good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of eat global and i want to give a super warm welcome to all of you for our web3 weekend now all of you are watching this on a handful of different platforms we're streaming this to uh through twitter and everybody else here is on youth global.tv so for those of you who are joining this thing for the first time i want to quickly give an overview of how we've designed this experience we we wanted to design this thing so all of us can experience this event together even though we're all in different parts of the world so as you see the rest of the get the day go by we'll we'll see the stage match what uh everybody else is seeing so wanted to make this super uh a super synchronous but also a a creative event for for all of us so there are some interesting things that are going on here so kind of the the first few things i want to mention is that we're going to be hosting all of our summit talks and q a from this interface so if you're joining in right now be sure to log into the chat here so you can ask any questions to our speakers um if as we kind of go by and we take breaks you get to enjoy some of the low-fi beats and a little bit of the radio and today for the first time we're actually uh streaming this thing through uh through live pier and in a decentralized streaming platform so we're super excited to be trying this out today so as you see uh the rest of the talk in the day go by we'll all that will be coming through and will be transcoded through live pier so i want to thank all of them for making this work uh with us and i'm super excited to see how all of this turns out for for the rest of the weekend so for those of you who don't know this hackathon is organized by its global and eth global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits and this weekend is no different we're running a hackathon that spans today till the end of sunday and we're running a summit called y web 3 after this intro talk and we're going to talk about all the interesting things that are happening in the world of web 3 and how you can be part of that ecosystem in even a bigger capacity so let's talk about the hackathon we have an hour here for just the logistics we want to cover for the hackathon and then we'll roll into our summit talks for for the rest of the day so this hackathon is one of our there we go uh this so we're super excited to be running this is the soccer phone with all of you here we have over 240 hackers from so many different parts of the world joining and hacking on interesting projects this weekend on top of that we're running a summit later today uh and we already have over 400 people signed up to watch those talks the the attendees that are hacking and participating throughout the weekend come from 35 different countries and we're spanning all this thing across 14 different time zones so we're going to have a lot of fun 24 7 until the the event ends uh in 48 hours and i can't wait to see what everybody else does and the cool things that come out of it uh it's just wild to see so much diversity and how many people are joining us from so many different places around the globe so as you meet a lot more people who are participating in this event and are interested in working on similar ideas be sure to say hi to them and get to know somebody and make friends from all over the world so what i want to do is uh today at least cover a handful of logistics for how this event is going to work um and uh before we get into all of that i want to make sure that um we kind of give some special kind of comments out so not only is it just a hackathon we have a lot of speakers and talks we're also going to be inviting and hosting 10 different companies here who are participating at this event as sponsors and then and also as mentors still be here to help you anywhere from get help technical or otherwise on your ideas or help you integrate some of their protocols and sdks and really make your life easy as you work on some interesting projects on top of all that there's over fifty thousand dollars in prizes that are going to be given away this weekend and we'll go into the details of what these prizes are and how you can qualify to win some of them and i'll cover all of that in the next 30 minutes so i want to especially thank protocol labs for being our partner for this event uh protocol labs is an organization with a very similar coal as as global to really make web3 a big thing and they do this by working on falcon and ipfs so you're going to see a lot of interesting things that we can do with decentralized storage and uh they'll have a lot more to say um just right after i finish the logistics so thank you so much protocol apps for uh for being part of this event we can't wait to uh have everybody else know how they can get involved in the protocol labs and the falcon ecosystem on top of all that we also have some amazing companies like live pier audience textile ethereum foundation the graph in chain link and then ocean protocol online protocol ens they're also here participating as sponsors for this event so they have cool prizes you can win if you integrate some of their protocols and sdks into your projects but also they're here to help you really get into the web3 ecosystem so when we announced this event uh we kept it very broad and entitled it the web 3 weekend and and it's it's totally understandable how broad of a category that is so we got a lot of questions from everybody asking what does it mean to build something here or how can they participate if they don't have too much exposure to the web 3 world so kind of the common things that we've heard and we've told everybody is that there is a lot of overlap and everything that you're interested in already and how you can actually make that blend with the web3 world uh we have so many people working on uh nfts and d5 related hacks uh that's um that's kind of the the most obvious classic thing we can all do and there's so much support that we already have from from our mentors and sponsors here for these topics but there are so many other things you can do that can help you with decentralizing and social networks and also a lot of game developers are also participating so there's a lot of opportunities to make really cool games and host them on on decentralized storage solutions or use creative smart contract implementations similarly we have companies like live peer and audio audience joining in as well so you have a lot of room and creativity and flexibility to play with really interesting decentralized storage and audio and music related hacks on top of all of that if you are interested in anything that has to do with data or analytics or or really making sense of information especially as it's openly available in in a permissionless world in the world of web 3 you can build super creative hacks on that theme as well and we have a lot of uh activity going on on the discord where you can not only find teammates but we also have a list of ideas that you can work on if you are still trying to find out or figure out what you want to build for the next two days so let's kind of quickly talk about the themes we're going to cover especially in the logistics i'll quickly walk through what the next three days are going to look like if you are still looking for a team i'll just go over what team formation looks like and how it's going to work um also how you can get help if you are stuck um or you need any technical help or you want to understand how to do something really well in this ecosystem all the prizes all the talks in the workshops and just also how judging will work on sunday and then we'll also cover what the summit format looks like today and we'll go into our talks after i cover all the logistics so the most important thing here is that all communication for this event is going to be on discord uh we're keeping this as asynchronous as possible because there's so many different time zones that we want to make sure are accommodated so anything that happens for the weekend whether it's talking to a sponsor or getting help uh even follow-ups from our talks or even questions about what i'm saying right now discord is the best place to ask those questions um the thing you want to note is that after you rsvp'd on your dashboard you need to connect to discord from your dashboard because that will give you the right permissions to all the channels for the talk about this is you'll know this by you by seeing a web3 weekend header on your discord and you'll get to see all of our sponsor channels all of our help and mentorship channels and also all of our team channels for finding other teammates and just seeing who else is participating so make sure that you have access to discord um and if you don't see that or if you're running into any issues you can ping us on discord again because we are still there we just won't be able to show you the hackathon specific channels without the authentication working so we'll just ping anybody on the global team and we'll get you set up so after that what i want to cover is just how the rest of the communication is going to go so we're going to send out invites for how judging is going to be blocked off on sunday to some of the talks that are happening today and tomorrow you probably already got some of those invites yesterday for the talks and workshops we did yesterday but everything else we're going to talk about the entire schedule is available and it's going to be live on on our website and we really want this thing to be asynchronous as possible so especially those of you who messaged us saying um like they really want to attend a talk but they can't make this work because of the time zone um don't be don't be kind of sad about that we are recording everything so the second a talk ends it'll be available on our youtube channel a minute later and we'll also post all those links on discord so you can always catch up on everything that's happening this weekend and i'm seeing some comments here so i'll also try to address some of the questions that are coming from the chat and and uh well well uh for those of you who just joined us i also want to say if you log into the chat you also get a nft token for participating um in our in our ceremonies um and uh we'll be sending all that co-op tokens to everybody after this event so um in case you want to know where the schedule and prizes and all that information is uh the website is web3.etheglobal.com so quickly let's jump into logistics how does this event work uh essentially the hackathon begins now uh which means that as of me saying this sentence you can start working on your projects and uh you have 48 hours from here or in this case 49 or so hours here to submit and work on your project um i'll kind of quickly cover some of those logistics on what it means to qualify and what what is a right criteria to be eligible for this event but to answer one of the other questions coming in you can work with a team of up to five people so some of you are already still looking for team members or you want to join a team you can do that as of right now and you can start coding in terms of rules and criterias everything that you submit on sunday must be written over the course of the hackathon which means that if you were working on something before today or even until about right now that would be against the rules and uh and and if you have any concerns or questions about that you can just message anybody on the global team we'll be happy to clarify that and of course using open source libraries is totally okay and that's actually encouraged but if you were working on improving your project that you've already been working on and you're using that to submit for the sakacon that will be an issue for this event the submissions have to be on the web3 theme which means that if you are working on anything related to audio video nfts d5 or analytics but interfacing with not only some of our protocols but just the world of web3 and decentralized storage or smart contracts you are eligible to participate and qualify for any of the prices all this information is also very much uh going to be sent again over email and already on the notion doc that we've sent to everybody so if you don't want to remember this right now or you want to reference this in a lot more details later we'll send you all the links um and uh we'll communicate that a few times over the course of the weekend and also for those of you who are joining this this event for the first time or you're still interested in understanding what you would like to work on uh you're not the only one in that position there's a lot of a lot of you as participants who've reached out to us saying they are looking to find team members or they're looking to uh find an idea and they can not code in anywhere from a language to their they have a design background or or ver so many different skill sets so what we've done is we've created this channel called find a team and you can find a link to a slideshow that we've uh we've offered where you can talk about your experience or your background what you're interested in and really use that to find other teammates we hosted a team matching session yesterday for those of you who are able to join uh and and some of you ended up finding new teammates there are still a lot more of you who are in a similar position so we're going to be hosting another session uh in a few hours after all of our summits end so if you're looking to get on a call with other people who are looking for other team members you have a chance later today on top of all that you can also introduce yourself in the web3 chat channel we'll be using that for all of our communications on discord and also if you don't find a team or you don't want to work on a team it is totally okay to do so uh team is uh being working on a team is just optional you it is entirely okay to hack on something on your own uh it just makes it a lot easier for you to distribute the work um if you can find a group of people to really work on and collaborate and really meet some interesting and awesome people around the world so not an issue if you don't have a team and you want to just work on your own and lastly uh we also have a lot of talks in workshops a lot of them happened yesterday they are now available and uh and are recorded so you can catch up on them if you miss them or you couldn't attend and uh that content spans everybody from beginners to experts in this space and we'll be doing a lot more talks later today but also a few workshops and talks tomorrow on saturday so uh you can join in for any of those talks and panels uh they will be hosted here uh on the global tv and in our youtube channel so um don't don't worry about again missing something because of a time zone conflict and all this information again is on your info center so if you uh are on discord or you just go to our website on web3.global you'll be able to see all this reference again so the most important piece here is how we're going to do judging and submissions this is a weekend hackathon which means that we only have 48 hours and we have to coordinate a lot of things uh in peril and real time from 14 different time zones so this is going to be a very crucial moment on sunday but the main key point to remember is that submissions are due sunday at 12 pacific or sorry 12 p.m eastern which is from a relative time 48.5 hours from now um this gives you all this time to work on a project and submit something all the submissions are going to happen through your dashboard and after you submit this is what's going to happen for the judging process there's going to be two lines of different judging one of them is the main judging for everybody where every team goes through a judging round and then in parallel at the same time [Music] overlapping windows we're going to be doing sponsor price judging which means that after you do the main judging or before you do the main judging you then talk to the companies that you're trying to win prizes for and you present your project to them as well so they can also get a chance to look at what you built and also decide if you are going to be one of the winners for their prizes all these details will be emailed to you again later today um so don't worry about remembering everything but keep in mind that for both scenarios you will have five minutes to demo and if you have a chance um it's a lot easier to make a video of your demo and present that to the judging session so you don't run into any problems about something going wrong or if you're doing some transaction that requires a main net confirmation you don't want to be stuck and lose time on something not going through so if you have the time make sure that you you take out an hour or so just to make a quick video recording and really submit that and you get to just play that video when you're judging happens and the questions can be done real time but you will have five minutes in total for for the demo uh whether it's to our sponsors or through our main judging so i know i'm breezing through a lot of this but i'll try to go through as much as possible and uh we'll uh we'll go through all this again in multiple times over the weekend so the other thing to note is as you present to the judges for their prizes all you have to do is you're going to join a discord audio video channel for each of the the companies and you get to join that and you get to share your demo and present it to them whereas for the main judging that's going to be done through zoom so you'll be able to see a zoom link on your dashboard and you get to click on that and join and present to the main judges there just in terms of clarifying the more common things we hear is that if for example you qualify for a prize with three different sponsors you have to go through all three of them and the main judging and present your project in this case four times so that each of the three sponsors can independently decide what you built and ask you questions but also um as part of the main judging you get to go through all of that um just like every other team would be and and how you kind of qualify which prizes you are eligible for or you want to submit or just kind of the talk the teams and the companies you want to talk to all that will also happen through your dashboard so as you are submitting the prizes on your dashboard you get to say i want to qualify for this specific prize and this way the sponsors and all the teams would know that this is a project that they're expecting and they'll they'll contact you or you get to contact them and we'll walk through all of that on sunday [Music] um to get more details of everything i just said about judging the submissions you can head over to web3.edu judging this has a really long dock on anything from how the format works to how you can design a really good demo whether it's video you can even get a template for you a slideshow that you can make about your team and your project and the inspiration so all those resources are here along with a handful of sample demos that we've uh we've highlighted to reference and you can find all that throughout the weekend by heading over to this url and lastly i want to make sure that i remind everybody that we do have a code of conduct and uh and how you can how you should behave in our ecosystem and our community the rules and the code of conduct is uh listed at each global dot co slash rules you can see a a pretty comprehensive way to understand how we expect people to behave especially in an online setting but the gist of it is that please be respectful for everybody around you there are so many people with so many different perspectives and harassment and abuse is not tolerated in any capacity so if if somebody is troubling you or if you need any help or you you're not sure if something needs more clarification whether it's to rule about the hackathon or about the code of conduct you can message anybody on the global team for help and you can do that by either at mentioning us on discord or you can email us to a team at eve global or hello eddie global.com so don't hesitate to reach out to us we're going to be here the entire time for the next two days and we are here to to help you and lastly um as you kind of start working on your project and you sprint through the next 48 hours please make sure that this is very much a an event designed to experiment with what's possible there's so many cool things that we want to see with done with video and audio and smart contracts and decentralized storage um you should treat this as a learning opportunity instead of a competition we want you to have fun want you to learn new things we're doing all these talks and uh and workshops and we really want you to understand what it means to uh to get into the space and how this ecosystem works so don't try to do everything or or don't try to trade off sleep for uh making a really great project pace yourself accordingly and we don't want this to be exhausting for you so try to get the best out of this over the weekend and uh we'll uh uh we'll all try to have fun together and learn all the new things that everybody's gonna build and create so that that's most of our logistics um if uh if you missed anything here you can watch all of this later it's going to be recorded right after it ends and you can also head over to your info info center to get all these details again so the next thing i want to do is just cover today's schedule i'll be talking about what the summit's talks are going to look like and also cover some of our prizes and some of our special messages from our sponsors we asked a lot of them to uh to make a video telling us who they are um and uh and how and why they're excited to be part of this event so quickly we're going to be hosting a summit the summit is called white web 3 and kind of the goal is to really welcome a lot of newcomers in this space to understand what is happening in this ecosystem whether that's on how storage markets work to how dows and nfts and d5 is going to be uh structured in the future and what is and isn't possible we have so many different interesting topics uh and what you can do with just not only decentralization but also programmable money and programmable storage so um as a quick overview we're going to have a few talks today the first one is going to be just interesting business opportunities that you can develop on falcoin so it's not just storage there's a lot more you can do and a lot more things and features that unlock so zx we'll we'll talk and kick off uh today's summit with that talk and then we'll have santi talk about what universal basic income looks like especially using ethereum and how we can actually design that fair world um where we can pilot something like this thing at scale uh then we'll have allen talk about interpol interplanetary timelessness and sort of how falcon and ipfs are being integrated to really make the nft world a lot more possible and sustainable then we're going to have a very interesting discussion on just what's possible with nfts in general we have some amazing speakers for for that panel we'll be talking about what we've seen in this ecosystem so far what some interesting things we would like to see and overall how that intersects with just the creatives and the technical parts of our ecosystem then we're gonna have two or more panels uh first one's gonna be what's possible with d5 we'll have three amazing people in this ecosystem really talking about the super interesting cool and just creative things you can do with decentralized finance so anywhere from like changing or getting a better financial system to cool and clever hacks that we've seen that sort of enable new use cases or protocols or just products that would not would not have been possible so that'll be a super interesting discussion and our last panel is going to be about the future of dao's we've seen so many things happen in the past month about just how dials are being applied in creative ways and it intersects with defy and nfts and storage and different business models so it's going to encompass all of what that world looks like as we scale down to more and more people and then we'll conclude the day with our last talk on the summit which is going to be what are some interesting open problems in web3 uh that's from a techno standpoint from a usability standpoint and juan binet from protocol labs is going to be giving an overview of what you can be part of and what are some open problems that we still need to solve um as an ecosystem to really make this world um ubiquitous and at the end of the day we have another team formation workshop which i just talked about uh which is if you're still looking for a team we're gonna do an actual live phone call or zoom call and uh you get to talk about and meet other people who are also looking for teammates or our ideas and you get to uh possibly work with them and uh and really kind of form teams as you kick off building your projects after all this so that was enough of a summary on how at least today is structured um i want to spend some time talking about all the prizes so we have a lot of prizes being given away this weekend and what we've done is we've asked our sponsors to uh to record a video talking about some of the uh interesting things that they're doing at the company who they are why they're excited to be part of this event and what prizes they're giving away so our first company is protocol labs they're going to talk about who they are and uh we'll play a video for them quickly and i'll walk over to uh going over the prizes again one more time so we'll have dietrich come in for protocol labs going to launch web3 weekend with you hello my name is dietrich and i'm the ipvs ecosystem lead at protocol labs protocol labs is an open source research development deployment laboratory our projects include ipfess file coin lit p2p and many more we aim to make human existence orders of magnitude better through technology and today we are going to launch web3 weekend with you at 8th global and are excited to spend a couple days exploring learning and building web 3. we are huge fans of youth global and the work they do we've done a number of different hackathons with them and they always bring an excited and invigorating and inspiring community so we're looking forward to hanging out learning about some of these things that have been occupying our time and our minds nfts explosion of creativity innovation happening in our ecosystem in our communities lots of people using technologies like ipfs and filecoin and we're going to talk to you about how to use those technologies to build the nft apps of your dreams also decentralized finance something as experimentation in the last few hackathons that we've done with global using ipfs for data storage front ends all kinds of different things but for the people coming to these spaces for the first time from the web 2 world it maybe looks and feels a little bit like this so many new technologies some of them familiar some of them unfamiliar new paradigms new architectures and all kinds of things to learn so that's what we're going to help you do this weekend we are here to help we have a bunch of different talks from people inside protocol labs people from our ecosystem a number of different projects that are building the tools the technologies and the educational materials to get you on the road to help you build over the weekend we've had three different workshops four different workshops today we have a number of talks uh or yesterday a number of different talks today and on saturday we're going to introduce you to some new tools for making it even easier to build with ipfs and filecoin we would also like to introduce nft school a new learning resource for building with nfts using them and incorporating and integrating them into your services recently we launched nft storage this is a service that will help you keep your nft assets and metadata online and updated using apis and tools that are familiar to be able to onboard your nfts onto the distributed web you'll also learn a little bit about sleek sleep.host this is a service that also allows you to be able to publish your photos your videos and your content onto ipfs and also archive to filecoin it has familiar looking hp apis that'll make it easier for you to learn and build and to help you get into this new world to be able to help you reach we've offered a twenty thousand dollars in file coin prize pool for anyone who's building with ipfs or filecoin we are happy to open this pool up to the most number of people so that all of you can join in and have a wonderful weekend and walk away with something awesome we encourage you to build with ipfs and filecoin in your applications and technologies not only during this hackathon but afterwards you will also hear a little bit about our next step microgrids program which is open now and allows you to walk away with five thousand dollars for a grant for building your application services and projects on ipfs and filecoin we i encourage you to join our sponsor channel ask for help learn more it's pound sponsor dash protocol dash labs in the event discord please join us there we're gonna be hanging out all weekend long talking and learning and helping you build your applications and projects thank you so much for joining web3 weekend we are looking forward to hanging out with you enjoy amazing so that was dietrich with an amazing intro to how and everything that protocol labs is doing i'm particularly excited about nft school and also nfd storage if you're building anything on nfc uh this weekend you should check out nfp.storage and uh really get all that abstracted away from you on managing how to deal with that asset on a decentralized network on top of all that as dr talked about protocol labs will be giving away over twenty thousand dollars in combined price or a pool and uh for those of you who are trying to understand what this means in more details the way it's going to be set up is that if you are using ipfs or filecoin in any of your submissions as long as you specify that you're using one of these technologies and you submit on sunday uh by selecting that on your dashboard for every qualified team that is actively using ipfs or fog coin this 20 000 will be split evenly for every team that uses these sdks or networks or protocols for their submission so potentially anybody who's interested in building something cool that leverage deceptive storage will win something at the end of this hackathon and i can't wait to see what everybody builds using falcoin and ipfs so next up we have textile and now we'll have andrew from texas i'll talk about everything that they're doing and what you can win from textile [Music] hello web3 weekend and thanks again to the eath global team for having us back again for another excellent hackathon i'm andrew hill i'm with textile you can find us at textile.io we're here because we have some awesome bounties for you to win uh so let me go right into them the first bounty we have is for using textile buckets buckets very similar to amazon s3 allow you to push data to remote servers on the web so the really neat thing here though is when you push buckets they actually are persisted on ipfs nodes meaning that all the data in it is available over the ipfs network using ipfs peers or over gateways so if you're going to use ipfs anyway i definitely encourage you to look at how buckets work but then they come with a lot of other really useful features for example every bucket has its own ipns key which means that you can have persistent keys to data on ipfs they also have a really easy to use filecoin integration so you can move that data to the filecoin network the second bounty we have is for textile threads you can think of threads as synchronizable databases over the decentralized web and so they they work over lib p2p and you can embed them in any browser-based application or we have a go library so if you're building say a chat application you can do that over threads so that's the second bounty using threads the third bounty is really just a mashup bounty we want to see how you use buckets with any of the other sponsor protocols uh you can do that with filecoin there's lots of great ways we have already documented those in our in our documentation um but you could also you could also do that with ceramic near any of the others we just want to see them however close you can get to those other protocols with buckets and show us that mashup can't wait to see what you come up with very easy bounty potentially for you to get and we should be around this weekend to help you out you can find our documentation at docs.textile.io and definitely uh check out our twitter and elsewhere for some of the latest releases around what we're doing with filecoin what we're doing with near and some of the kind of leading edge pieces that you might be able to use in your your hack but like i said i can't wait to see what you build good luck thank you andrew so um as andrew mentioned there will be three prizes from textile uh the best use of textile buckets will get fifteen hundred dollars the best use of textile threads will get fifteen hundred dollars as well and the best use of buckets overall will get a runner up one thousand dollar price uh next up we have live pier and we'll have yondan talk about how you can use life here for your hacks and where you can win hey everyone my name is yondin and i lead engineering and research for the live peer public network i'm here today to talk to you about live view the project and how you can use live pier to bring video streaming into your applications for web3 weekend live pier is a decentralized video streaming network built on the ethereum blockchain and the core service provided by the network today is video transcoding which is the process of taking a single input video stream and converting it into multiple different output streams such that they can be played on different connection speeds and different device types and this is quite important in order for a video stream to reach as wide of an audience as possible regardless of what internet connection they have and regardless of what device they're using the live peer network is an always on transcoding network which means that there is always nodes available offering their hardware and bandwidth resources for transcoding in practice what this means is a video application can have their users stream using a common format such as rtmp or http into the network where one or many nodes will transcode that stream and make the results available to a variety of different device types and a variety of different internet connection speeds liver.com is a video streaming platform built on top of the live peer public network which makes it easy for applications to bring video streaming into their app using a simple api examples of applications that are built on live pier include user-generated content platforms such as play dj.tv which is a platform for djs to stream their live sets and corkuma which is an application that allows businesses to leverage live streams to amplify their e-commerce efforts and file.video which leverages live peer for transcoding and filecoin for storage in order to create a decentralized video hosting gateway live fear is sponsoring a few prizes for the web 3 weekend one for the best overall hack the second best hack and the third best tack we're really excited to see all the creative ideas people come up with for using live peer but if you're looking for suggestions to get started you can consider integrating live peer with other pieces of web3 infrastructure such as audio nfts domain names or decentralized storage they're going to be a bunch of live peer team members around this weekend ready to help any hacker that wants to use live pier so look out for us in the discord channels we're really excited to be sponsoring web3 weekend and can't wait to see all the interesting applications that people come up with using live pier and generally are excited to see the next wave of web3 applications being built happy hacking amazing thank you so much london and uh to summarize life here is doing three different prizes um for the best overall hack and integration of the live pier protocol there's an interesting tidbit we are streaming this with live here right now and it's it's incredible how easy it is to use so i hope to see a lot more creative video and audio related hacks so those were some of our three sponsors that um that we asked to share about who they are and make a video talking to everybody here about it we also have a few other prizes that i want to quickly go over and talk about so first we have unlock protocol um you get to win uh multiple prizes for using unlocked protocol in your hacks unlock is a workload lets you gate content and really make content accessible in terms of subscriptions or using unlocked tokens so you can win lots of udt tokens as part of the price and the best decentralized application that uses the online protocol will win uh three to five ugdt tokens uh next up we have ens enus is the theorem name service so if you are doing anything with d5 or solidity um and you get to integrate dns the best team to integrate um ens into their hack will win a thousand dollars um in eve from the ens foundation then we have ocean protocol so ocean protocol is giving prizes for uh the first second and third best use of using ocean protocols for their data markets um onto your hexa mission so uh this is super cool to uh to use and like i'm particularly looking forward to all the interesting integrations that come in with ocean protocol here for this weekend so uh you are eligible to win up to five thousand dollars in total from the ocean team then we have uh the graph so uh the graph will be offering a thousand dollars in diet or a thousand diet to the best use of um a collectively ens unlock audience or live peer subgraphs uh on the graph explorer so this can be used in tandem to make your lives easier for querying the blockchain directly and you can use these subgraphs to really filter to get the the results you want um into your hack and save a lot of time not computing or not fetching all that information and then they'll also be giving a thousand die to the best new subgraph that gets submitted on the graph explorer so you also have the ability to really come up with some interesting use case that is suitable for your hack and really submit that as a new sub graph onto the network and win some prizes then we have chain link so if you're doing anything with oracle's chain link is going to be giving away three 1 000 prizes to all projects that are using uh the uh the changing smart contracts uh to uh really build any um applications that reference uh on chain oracle's um or sorry oracles with on-chain kind of being the state fetching so you can use that in any of your projects whether it's something with nft or d5 or even audio video streaming um and uh you can win chain link prizes and three up to three thousand dollars in total then we have po app so the best use of uh co-op in a creative way um for this hackathon will win three thousand dollars from from the team uh so this is just super interesting because we wanna see a lot more creative stuff happen from the web 2 web 3 in the creative world and uh everybody who's on our chat right now you get to also win a pro app from our site for participating at this event and you also get to win directly for integrating these tokens into any of your projects so those are all of our prizes we really want this thing to be a collaborative weekend for all of us so all of these companies will be here over the weekend helping you with anything from questions whether they're related to their sdks to just overall in this ecosystem so you can always have hop on and rely on some technical help if you're stuck and if you want to get more details of these prizes including links to the talks and the videos for um each of these companies to understand how they work and how you can use um some of these protocols you can head over to web3.etcova.comprizes and we have a whole page dedicated to all the details you need to know for winning any of these prizes so with that i want to wish everybody happy hacking these were all the logistics we wanted to cover i hope you got a chance to meet some amazing people already on discord and on this chat um we'll be taking a quick break here and and getting started with our first talk for the summit so we're we're a bit ahead of time here and want to really give a few people a chance to join in before we start our very first talk so uh for those of you who get uh who are still here enjoy uh the next eight to ten minutes of a quick break get some coffee or stretch or anything you want to do or say hi to other people on discord and we'll see all of you very soon and that will kick us off with our summit and see for the first talk so thanks again for all the hackers and we'll see you join us for the rest of the summit talks all right hope everybody enjoyed some low five beats and uh welcome back and for those of you who are joining us welcome to the web 3 weekend uh we are about to kick off our white wife three summit and uh i'll want to welcome everybody who just joined us and i'll kind of quickly walk through this whole platform eat global.tv and what we have planned for the rest of the day so those of you who are joining us on equivola tv be sure to log in and say hi because for any questions that you have for our speakers you will get to ask those questions on the chat and we'll we'll uh we'll relay those questions to our speakers directly um during their talks if you want to ask anything you're going to comment on anything be sure to sign in and also for everybody who signs in we'll uh we'll give out an nft to uh to everybody for participating at the summit so this summit is called why what three and uh before we jump into that i want to quickly talk about the web3 weekend so we have a hackathon going on this weekend that starts right now until the end of sunday in this summit uh the summit is presented by protocol labs and we're super excited to be working with them and we're going to cover so many interesting things that are happening in web3 and decentralized storage and smart contracts we have so many incredible people participating at this hackathon we have over 240 hackers we're nearing 250 now and over 400 summit attendees from 35 different countries in 14 different time zones so it's going to be a packed weekend and we're going to see something happen 24 7 uh for the next two days so i can't wait to see what everybody builds but on top of all that i can't wait to learn all the interesting things that we had planned for everybody today so i'm going to quickly walk through the agenda and we'll kick off with our very first talk of the day so we're going to have a talk on just what business opportunities look like with decentralized storage and with falcon specifically and then we're going to have a talk by santi on how we can do universal basic income for every human using ethereum then we'll have alan talk about how ipfs and falcoin are making it possible to manage and store and keep nfp media files persistent then we'll have a panel on what is possible with nfts with some amazing and incredible artists and people in our ecosystem we'll talk about what's possible how we can extend the space and how we can actually make this more inclusive then we will have two more panels so our the next panel is going to be on what is possible with decentralized finance we will have camilla mariano and divide that talk about what trends we're seeing in indi5 how the space is evolving what are some open problems and how we can have uh bring on more people uh from a user and also a developer standpoint then we're going to have our final panel of the day which is uh the future of dallas we'll have linda kendall and john talk about all the interesting things that are happening with dao's right now you've seen so much of that happen in the last month um and we'll kind of talk about where all that is headed and we'll close the day with our last talk that will be about some open problems in web3 so monbine the co-founder or the founder of protocol labs uh we'll be talking about some problems that we still need to solve as a group and a community that exists from a technical or usability and and just overall every category we want to improve here as an ecosystem to really bring more and more people and make this more accessible um as a as an opportunity for new people to come in so that will be the last stock of the day uh so a super tight uh packed day and a lot of interesting talks and we'll jump right into how all that is set up and uh with our very first talk by zx so the talk is tired of more than just storage how we can think about business opportunities on faultcoin and uh without further ado i'd like to welcome cx to tell us about everything that we can do with storage so welcome thank you claudette thank you thank you um great videos on let me share my screen um can we say fine everything's great all right thank you hi everyone uh thank you for having me my name is zx i'm very excited to be here i work on crypto economics and falcon ecosystem at protocol labs um today um i just want to share with you like some of these new ideas uh ideas around like business opportunities on falcon because a very common question i get from developers and entrepreneurs in the web for ecosystem they often ask me hey we really we are really interested in building on the falcon ecosystem but there are so many opportunities where do we start right so i hope to like just like um provide some ideas and directions in terms of like opportunities that we should explore as an ecosystem i'm very excited for this hackathon because i hope many of these ideas can be explored um to i think to to catch up on what uh what is stylecoin and uh we should probably start from airbnb um and to try to understand the business model of like what's uh building on powerpoint airbnb uh nasdaq uh listing last year and they did this pretty interesting thing where um they offer i think seventy percent of their shares for purchase to the early uh early early host on airbnb so uh well this is a pretty commendable um effort from like a traditional web 2 platform economy but if you look at looking at it from like taking a setback like an overall platform economy in the web 2 sense um many of this value that's been generated by the by the providers on the platform they're mostly being captured by the shareholders of the company and i think with web3 um there are there is an opportunity for us to really change this kind of economic structure and i think um hosting airbnb itself carries lots of similarity with mining on firecoin uh both of them um on airbnb as an airbnb host you contribute housing resources and on a smiler on filecoin contribute cloud resources being a host is labor intensive being a miner however is knowledge and technology intensive as a host you add best a contractor but for foul coin if the miner you are an owner of the network and uh airbnb is being managed by your company and where filecoin is governed by a decentralized ecosystem in terms of dispute resolution you have to go to legal recourse on airbnb um but there's good economic mechanism social consensus community governance on firecoin but there are some similarities as well i think like both hosts airbnb and providers on file coin share this brand identity with the platform right and and people compete both within the ecosystem and outside ecosystem like airbnb with hotel chains uh through differentiated services it's not really about price right maybe to start price could be competitive but really people compete on differentiated services and this is why um hackathons accelerators um startups and so on so important to our ecosystem because developers build this kind of different differentiated services on top of the file coin uh protocol uh with this in mind um in in hindsight actually like falcon mining is a lot similar to hosting airbnb compared to like a traditional um bitcoin ethereum style mining because we're doing useful work people we are providing miners are both uh maintainers of the blockchain also provided of the services on the platform and this really paved the way for mainstream adoption for blockchain as a whole through doing like useful work that has like business value and business impact and so in some way we can think of file coin as an airbnb for cloud services but it's also a lot more than that which we will talk about in a moment so just to recap what is five points so that we start on the same page you have different participants in this ecosystem you have clients looking to consume storage goods and services you have miners providing that service also maintain the consensus on the blockchain they have developers building like products and experience on top of this platform and they have token holders doing investment providing liquidity supporting everyone in the ecosystem and their ecosystem partners collaborating with the ecosystem very deeply to really push the boundary forward and going back to our island economy analogy right so like you have researchers building on the algorithm then you have like miners amassing these different kinds of raw materials like this idc's or data centers uh compu and so on to produce storage related goods and services then you have developer coming on to build that experience right and then you have token holders providing liquidity loans collateral and so on and so forth and overall goal for everyone in the ecosystem is to attract uh more potential clients and participants to join the falcon economy so falcon is a utility token it's a platform's protocol it's a blockchain network a community an economy an ecosystem and also very importantly an evolutionary system just like many other blockchain networks and uh we coming together to really move and shape the future trajectory of this uh of this economy and uh with this in mind i think like i think falcon is really uniquely positioned uh in rf3 to support both web 2 and f3 use cases uh we should we start from talking about business opportunity from like a more web 2 star interactions and then we talk about why the web3 use cases that are emerging on filecoin so let's just recap again on like what is uh using storage and filecoin because sometimes come from like a traditional web tool where we might expect things to just work out of the box right it's a product you should just there's one way of working how it works right but no if i go into protocol just like here and many others there are there's no a single defined way of how the interaction should be done right it only cares about the basic building block as a layer one um and then the rest is all emergency up to the creativity entrepreneurship of developers and founders building on the ecosystem so when you're providing miners are providing storage on file point they are proving their storage in this notion of a sector it's like a shipping container and then they can put different content in the in the container and then the blockchain will come around every day asking the miner hey do you have the data that you promised that you are storing and yes or no right they they have to pass through certain checks um so using search on falcon really is using storage provided by miner providers on the fileclip network so uh and from this kind of mental model right like the redundancy encryption indexing fast retrieval one pod storage this is all possible on the falcon network today and it just maybe because it's only six to seven month old you need to find the right provider to provide the uh to have the right sla and provide the right level of service and looking at this dashboard we can actually see that the storage cost on filecoin today is actually quite competitive it's only 0.3 of aws but i want to emphasize this point earlier uh i mentioned earlier just like airbnb it's not just about cost right well i think cost is a given but i think it's really easy about that experience that's how web3 can win as a as a community and that's why i'm so excited for this hackathon where we have so many developers building and defining uh this new experience on firecoin um so now i'm going to talk a bit more about different kind of web 2 star interaction and opportunity in that space as mentioned filecoin is a platform it's protocol so clients might need to find the miners um to make to enter into a deal so this could be inefficient to start but right now we're seeing very exciting and promising sign where you have miners notaries bring very reputable clients to the filecoin network but there is lots of room for building applications to improve the whole user experience a new dual matching platform can emerge as i mentioned earlier uh filecoin can be thought of as an airbnb for cloud services but it's also a lot more than that because you can see many many airbnbs or do a matching platform emerging on the falcon network many dropboxes many google clouds and so on and so forth and the next step we could be defining like now that you have this matching services and platform my reputation and ratings become a thing because as a client how do i know which miners i should choose there are more than 2 000 miners on the falcon network today so define the next step will be potentially defining grades of storage services right like just like hotels right like you have like three-star hotel five-star hotel and different kind of ranking so like this could be a precursor to commoditized like cloud storage right this is where we draw like inspiration from crude oil defining different kind of grades right then now you can have like exchanges on cloud resources uh that can emerge on the file coin uh economy so uh another another opportunity for the more traditional kind of sense would be um so falcon miner have lots of storage capacity and then uh they also have lots of computer resources that sit next to their storage capacity this is very really powerful um so this whole collocation of storage and compute we did a pilot with life here and falcon coal mine which is very successful and then we also bring uh grants during this hackathon to support more application that is built in the intersection of these two ecosystems i think with compute closer close to the storage analytics become like a pretty straightforward thing about less rational four than they sound but it comes like it becomes a natural thing and then we can we can even store algorithms on file coin it doesn't have to be just data right you can store like the computation on filecoin as well we'll talk about it in a moment and uh and we also saw many of the falcon miners offering stars and gpu as a service and i think the next big thing that's uh happening pretty quickly right now is all the caching and retrieval services on top of the storage they're being stored on powerpoint um next opportunity which is also pretty big and also quite a standard uh data as a complex and sophisticated economy data becomes really key so there's lots of room for data services to emerge and then like financial services as well because like miners needs collateral clients um need uh filecoin for their payments and if you look back at the history of finance really um managing risk and providing liquidity and reducing uncertainty has always been the demand for finance a financial product and the case of falcon is even more uh the demands even stronger because uh falcon token it's both an um it's also used in the pro as a production capital so like it's useful for uh miners and clients to be able and other participants to be able to be shielded from token volatility risk and financial and data services kind of go hand in hand right with like better um network analytic infrastructure this will enable even more sophisticated interesting financial applications to emerge on the falcon network so we talked about this kind of more traditional web 2 common kind of business model and opportunities which i think each of them are really big it's really big i think falcon also brings a pretty unique and new building block to the whole webster ecosystem and this is under uh it's not fully realized and appreciated because the network is so real um we go through some of this new opportunity in a moment but we i would like to first talk about to revisit what are some elements of bethlehem right privacy and ownership transparency and openness permissionless participation community governance um being able to compose different building blocks to allow for emergence right because stylecoin is a layer one there's lots of room for different kinds of protocol and project to emerge on the basic building blocks that falcon provides and uh personally i think web3 is a lot about novel interactions and new business models that really change how we interact with like each other with like assets and so on and so forth and we look at some of these like interesting like or successful um areas within like the webster ecosystem if you look back at d5 right it first came up i think it was mentioned back in 2015 but then during the uh 2017 ico boom lots of depth and d5 projects started to emerge and then you have the launch of compound units for late 2018 then you have a d5 somewhere last year so what are the lesson or takeaway that we can learn from this past trajectory of our broader raptor ecosystem so i think there were many that before but some of them may be a bit complex and i think like d5 is a relative leverage the um the building block that ethereum provides by doing some relatively simple operations and then there are many protocols that emerge on top of the underlying layer one and each of them provides different building blocks such that um that leads to like an exponential growth of the ecosystem next would be nft which has been pretty popular lately um so it started um i think earlier earlier in 2017 people talk about digital collectibles and so on i think erc 721 was defined as a standard then you have cryptokitty which is like a big success and lots of attention and awareness was raised around nfts and then you have this whole cambrian explosion of like many many nft projects and then we have the book that we saw like uh last year and this year so i think some of the takeaway here is the importance of defining a standard and some reference implementation and some type of concept would go a super long way and i think like protocols and marketplaces you'll find they're part of marketplace relatively early so what are the building blocks that really falcon brings to the table so i'd like to share with you this diagram that we used to talk about we call that the dataverse let's first look at this uh whole data flow um at the top here i call it data supply chain and i think it's very common in the web tool world today i think you might take a different form in the web3 world there's lots of opportunity here to explore so data the data gets reduced and then data gets refined and then um it gets you rated and then value generation even happens and there's somebody attribution one of our favorite example would be bloomberg right like lots of data on bloomberg they are not private they're actually public and then like boom block mindset curate and curate them into a terminal and then they sell them right this is a pretty mature business model in web 2 but i think there's lots of room to do something different and better in web 3. and then we look back at our stack i think like ipfs is a content address where everybody can upload data to the ipfs network um and what falcon brings to the table i think there are two unique value propositions one is the scale and volume right you have more than one or two petabyte of a useful storage being added to the network as capacity every hour and this is going to increase with the upgrade that's coming next month now hyperdrive and the next thing is as mentioned earlier the blockchain will come around checking on the storage on the network every single day so that you that's and so that you know that your data that's being stored is exists every day um that generates a proof right so before falcon introduced like a user-defined smart contract i think there's some pragmatic thing that we can do as a community i think like a bridge layer could be interesting rather you bridge discharge states whether the data is stored and so on and so forth stream oracle to other web through ecosystem and then you can have the business logic that lives in um in some kind of smart contract platform i think anything for the top two boxes these are just reference on kind of how they might emerge i think there might there are many different ways of doing achieving this that uh people are exploring and we did see lots of like uh collaboration integration with live theory projects um changing integrates with our coin to bring like decentralized storage oracle so now people can like as we mentioned earlier um now we have oracles can relay destroy states on file point to enable new applications that sit on other uh smart contract platform and lighthouse bridging the file coin filecoin and ethereum um and then also texcel releases collaboration offering free storage for like all the new developers building uh applications with alcoin and i'm going to share some ideas um that could be interesting to explore i hope um given this kind of like uh to define like new webster experience and define like new web three protocols so the first one is uh data boundaries right like so smart contracts can pull together funds um to to fund the storage of a particular cid cid just an id of some storage that's being stored on the ipfs and falcon network and funds can only be paid out uh when there's a proof that this data this cid has indeed been stored uh on the falcon network and this is like a building block for many other things like data dials where dials cannot be formed around data that a common cares about members drawn by proving that they have stored some data or they have contributed to a pool they found this storage it could be wikipedia it could be like um internet the internet archive it could be things with short foundation it could be anything and uh with distributing blog then you can have like storage insurance um commodity features around like cloud storage itself right after we after we after this like different kind of rating that we talked about then you can repair miners for example right data get lost uh by the way falcon has very strong penalty data gets lost there's a very penalty on the protocol itself um against that kind of um outages but let's say some data get lost right like people can put on the boundary to ask to incentivize miners to repair that piece of data um there are even more so nfts right like nfp is um it's a really it's a really amazing ecosystem and i think there are but they have their problem on is uh there's some problem area for improvement as well and observation here is that um i think every dual id on file point can be considered nft because if you think of nft as a unique representation of the underlying content and where is the value of the what's the value of the nft uh it could be in a trading and exchange but i don't think it's in the content itself right this opened the door to like persistent nfts and then like this also give you a stronger incentive because now your incentive aligned with maintaining the content on the network so this paved the way for setting up the metaverse you can create vr content games 3d printing models and many many more and and with this kind of content first nfts um there's a very natural question to ask how can we do better in terms of value attribution because that's like one of the pretty common criticism today so uh remember we saw the ipfs cid network right there's there's a network of content that is stored on powerpoint right and this creates room to define new standards and protocols of like what is a node what is an edge how does really how does value really flow in this kind of content network and i think there's lots of interesting experiments that will emerge and then we talk about you can see ids you can talk about you can put uh algorithm on falcon as well each cip can be an algorithm and that can be strong involved when you have compute and data you generate more data and then you have a network of like value and data on the falcon network so overall i think like as a later one protocol as very early stage of the ecosystem i think there's a lot of room there's a lot of room for layer two protocols that leverage the falcon unit building blocks and fill in the gap from the layer one to the application to provide new experiences right like perpetual search protocol like store one as pay one and store forever you can see like many many of this emerging on the falcon network you can have data protocol data mining mining with like a token for example content delivery protocol and more alternative incentive for people to use the falcon network to upload data to use factory it's not just about focus to bring more uh participants into web3 and this incentive may not be financial all the time it could be social where like why would you upload photo to facebook when facebook was launched sometimes is that social incentive so even this kind of social app on the falcon network uh is also pretty interesting to create this kind of alternative incentives so with like only six or seven months into the uh into the network's launch i think falcon ecosystem is exploding with like many many applications building on the network with new infrastructure with many accelerators ecosystem funds investing in the startups and founders in the ecosystem so some question i often ask myself because as i'm thinking about uh looking at this new project that are emerging um given where we are i think we have uh i think we're really lucky as a builder in battery because there's lots of room to decide where we what we are building right whether we are building an application a product or a service a platform protocol or standard or even we are building or defining an entirely new industry so how we should constantly think about where uh where we are positioning ourselves as we as we're hacking our projects and help and see like a roadmap and a business plan business model down the line and it's also important personally i think like web 3 a lot of that is about new interactions and with this building blocks that the underlying technology provides right what new interactions can we enable how can we find product market fit so these are the questions that we should ask ourselves as we hack on projects over the weekend so just to summarize some key takeaways i think like filecoin is really uniquely positioned to support both web 2 and web3 use cases and make blockchain mainstream and useful and there are immense opportunities in building layered two protocols on top of filecoin platforms products and so on and i think business model is really key and there are many areas that the community can explore and i hope some of my sharing can give you guys some ideas uh lastly i think um spread the word um grow the community grow the pie together i think for blockchain to be for webster to be to go mainstream we have to have this win-win mindset and we should we will come together to build the future that we want to see so feel free to reach out to me on twitter um thank you so much for attention amazing that was a super comprehensive and i incredible overview of what's possible um we're still kind of getting some questions from all of our different upper uh like whatever these being streamed that we're coming doing a lot here um maybe i have a question for you in the meantime so obviously a lot of these things are you know presented as sort of high-level categories um kind of from maybe we just walked through all three points you mentioned uh like i'm curious like what's uh is there something quick and actionable that you can advice to teams on uh for this weekend that they can just kind of get started to see how this would work and then over time expanded to be that the broader sort of uh uh fully uh developed idea like how do you think about what what people could do this weekend and uh give any kind of advice as you've talked to a lot of teams over the past couple of days yeah so i think like i think building a poc of like like i think uh informative bounties and data dials i think these are something this is something that like with uh with the with the the bridge be provided by textile you can you can develop some develop something over the weekend and then with the training bridge as well you can explore uh some of this um new interaction as well i think like it's it's all pretty open the resources are out there and then i feel like some sometimes we we can build that experience first and then we can figure out what's missing in the technical step afterwards as well because at the end of the day i think web 3 similar to biocoin is about delivering that experience absolutely um i guess one other question that that we have here is uh overall i feel like a lot of these um ideas in a way productize or sorry monetize the product aspect of what the application does but i'm curious like does the answer or does anything change if you're designing something for developers specifically instead of and consumers or everyday users yeah yeah i see so i think there are um i think business model and so on is like a pretty big a very interesting topic personally i think like um there are lots of traditional web 2 models but i think like even in web 3 i think like there are lots of new like paradigm rates but building a community let's say you're building a developer tool i think like um open sourcing solve this work and then like building a community around it and then having like governance and and this kind of now kind of format could be a very interesting model um and also for even for other stuff right like as i mentioned earlier like are we building an application a product a protocol standard or industry right this offer very different incentives and then like i think we are all in this exploratory phase so i think we don't need to rush into like thinking about what is my our immediate monetary uh monetization path platform monetization but we always have that in mind because well the key really is growing the market bringing more user growing the base and then the rest will follow pretty naturally i absolutely agree this is a really good framing of that um well we are running out of time and we're ready to move on to our next talk so maybe the the more actionable thing i would say is that zx is going to be here all weekend you should uh ask him any questions that you want um on different business models but also how you can use file coin or ipfs for your projects and there's so many interesting things here that so nicely overlap with nfts and endows and specifically anything with smart contracts so um can't wait to see how people do a lot of those proof of concepts this weekend so absolutely feel free to reach out yeah sounds great thank you so much and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk so our next talk is uh by santi siri and he's going to talk about universal basic income for every human using ethereum so santi welcome hey hello everyone hi it's a pleasure to be here so i'll be demoing uh mostly what we have launched around almost three months ago on march 10 2021 which is a protocol co-developed by cleros which is an arbitration service only built on ethereum and democracy earth foundation which is the organization i preside as where we do research trying to understand what democracy looks like in the information age and one of the biggest hurdles that at least us at democracy we faced through every single pilot that we have done uh of digital democracy over the last seven years uh is that ultimately one of the biggest roadblocks that we need to to to get over is um understanding the issue of identity the challenges of identity the fact that we don't have formal a way of formalizing human identity over decentralized networks is what has been preventing uh democratic governance from emerging in a network like ethereum um so alongside with the cleros we worked throughout the last couple of years on proof of humanity i'm gonna show my screen now so proof of humanity is a protocol that allows the creation of a list of humans and it prevents the presence of robots civils and authorities in this registry in this list of registry through as a series of crypto economic incentives the protocol was deployed on mainnet in march 10 and i'll go quickly straight to the demo here you can if you click on start over here click on start you will see the the registry of proof of humanity with the latest identities or the latest humans that have registered in the system so right now we have uh almost we're going to be reaching 7 000 humans right now or profiles in the in the in the system and each one of these has to submit a proof of themselves so i'm going to go to mine if i can find it somewhere around here hopefully here i am so this is myself this is my own proof of humanity and one of the first steps is that you have to do a video on this video you have to say a statement where you declare yourself as being a human and that you do not have a registry in this register it's a sort of affidavit where you have to commit to the fact that you don't have another identity on this registry so also a very important thing of the video and i certify that i am a human and i do not have a register in this register and at the end of the video or at any moment in the video you have to show your ethereum address which has to coincide with the ethereum address that you are using on what you are uploading your identity into the system so once you submitted your proof of identity with the video brief information about yourself information does not need to be your real information just something that helps you identify the network but that doesn't need to be your real name or your any kind of personal information but once you become verified someone else has to vouch for you someone that has been all previously verified by the system has to vouch for you once you are vouched once you receive a vouch you will have three days and a half where you'll be under uh in in in uh where you could be challenged by someone else so let's see some challenge registrations so these are all profits that have been challenged because in some aspect of the proof they do not meet the criteria of what's required in order to generate a legitimate proof of identity and this can be maybe it's the wrong the address of the video does not coincide with the outlets that has been used to submit the profile or maybe you are not saying the full sentence on the on the video or maybe you are not showing uh properly the the address of your your ethereum address on the video or maybe the dimensions of the video or do not fit a resolution high enough to perceive your your face uh so there are all these requirements that need to be met and if you don't meet them someone once you submit your profile and after being vouched someone can challenge your profile uh there's a window of three days and a half where challengers have an incentive to challenge because when you create a profile you have to pay a deposit and this deposit you will get it back if no one challenges you challenges you and if you do the proof all right you'll be able to do it but uh if you do not do the pro proof properly uh then the challenger has the incentive to use your your the positive uh to earn your deposit through the challenging process now let's let's check on this profile for example here this profile has been challenged um and it argues that the resolution of the video does not meet the criteria uh so this goes to uh an arbitration system which is the cleros court uh arbitration system so uh let's see if i can connect to plato's here so the humanity court um where is this uh products let me well what's going on well let me i have to find it uh elsewhere here my connection is a bit slow but you go to an arbitration uh service which is cleros where judos will ultimately have the final word whether your profile is valid or is not valid on on your proof of humanity so we launched this on a we launched this on march 10. so far we have almost 7 000 unique humans in the registry let me show you some graphs that show the growth of the registry so far excuse my my slow internet connection so here you can see the last 30 days it's a bit broken but this is for one member of the community but you you can see that it has been steadily growing throughout time uh most you know most of missions get approved uh some that these ones down here are on the pouching phase these are the the voting the the submissions that are still waiting for a bulge from someone else uh and the the challenge ones uh i i don't think these are listed here but you get at least a sense of the growth that the project has been having throughout the last three months um so what can you do with proof of humanity so the fact that we can build now with this primitive of a registry or a creative registry of human beings means that we can start building uh social applications of all kinds some simple ideas around these type of applications are for example systems that enable democratic governance and i'm going to tell you how we are using democratic governance today on the proof of humanity dao you can enable systems of universal basic income and i'm gonna show you how we have implemented a ubi token a universal basic income token of proof of humanity you can create the systems of a credit that don't require collateral you can start building a credit score and go you know start creating define without the need of a and just using a reputation or a credit score for the identities so the possibilities that proof of identity or registry of humans that it's built in a decentralized way are many so we combine with proof of humanity a video proof we want to make sure that anyone anywhere can detect civils or can detect deep fakes or robots present in the registry uh and that's the only requirement the only information that is specifically required we don't require your personal name your real name your legal name your nationality where you are none of that information is relevant we just want to enable people to be able to check the faces of those participating in the registry you have to be careful though that if you are going to be using this it's probably better to use a fresh account an account without too much financial activity or ethereum just to protect your privacy because it is true that your face will be tied to that address and you have to be aware that probably that others will be a public address on your behalf and not a private address um so on top of a proof of humanity the first application we deployed is the universal basic income token the ubi token so there are a couple of very interesting features about this token that i would like to highlight uh first of all it is an erc20 but let's go to the code a little bit let me show you just how easy it is to integrate with proof of humanity so if we check into the contract code uh you can see that it's a you know pretty straightforward erc20 that interfaces with proof of humanity you know it called it talks to the proof of humanity smart contract which is already deployed on the mainland and it asks whether an address is registered on the registry that's it so what proof of humanity does is that once you become a verified a human and let's see if i can find my uh a profile here let's see let's check someone those are already registered these are probably the latest ones uh we have a one interesting thing is that we have a lot of grandparents actually earning a pension through this service we have a lot of uh children also people are putting their child or their families into the project so here you can see that this user is already earning upi so once you become verified on proof of humanity the ubi is streamed and straight into your into your ethereum wallet whether it's metamask or whether it's a rainbow or any of the wallets there you will see your ubi accruing in real time over time right now the issuance rate of ubi is set at 1 uei per hour and the current market value of ubi is around 20 cents of a dollar so that means pretty much that we are delivering a universal basic income to these 6 000 or so people of uh roughly 150 dollars to sometimes 200 250 sometimes even more if the token price goes up a month which is in most developing nations is even better than the pension being delivered by the state uh in my country in argentina that's a better pension than the you might get from from the government so the token right now we have a liquidity farming program so we have for those that are providing liquidity on your uniso version two very soon we will have the liquidity farming contracts for unisov3 those are being developed from what i heard from hayden adams from unislam but right now if you provide liquidity on unison version two uh if you provide liquidity with ether or you probably didn't die there's a liquidity farming contract that will allow you to earn more uvi throughout the first year of the project and this was a mechanism that allowed allowed us to start building some liquidity for the token to be able to bootstrap itself um there's a bunch of experiments going on with the projects uh obviously you know if we go to etherscan and we check the token activity the initial supply that the token had was 10 million let me let's go to the cleros blog which had a very good announcement let me see here universal basic income for humans here you can find more information about how it works out but the initial supply of the token uh 40 percent went to the liquidity mine we we minted 10 million ubi at genesis uh four million went to the liquidity mining program four million went to the community treasury that is being used by the dao and 22 million sorry 20 uh went to the pre-sale investors that participated in the project uh leaving only five percent really from that twenty percent to the community contributors so that was the initial allocation uh so you can see that right now we actually meet one million uh tokens on top of that if you look at the max total supply without now roughly 11 million one million more have been minted uh to the users or to the verified humans that began to create universal basic income so a question that we get a lot is now you know how we are going to be able to sustain price over long term uh where there's a bunch of projects happening in the community uh i'll try to demo you some of them uh there's a project that we are working on called human money which are urine bolts uh wired bolts uh we are now building on top of the dye white iron bolt and what this bolt does we're still right now on testing phase but what this ball does is that you contribute die to it it earns an interest in diet and a fraction of that interest is used to buy and burn uvi so this is a bolt that reduces the supply of uvi with the profits generated on wired finance we are right now auditing and testing this vault um but so far so good we have been able to test the burning mechanism and if we are able to build liquidity into these vaults we could have a very interesting instrument keeping in check the issuance or the emission of ubi to the newcomers to system um we i also mentioned the dao the using snapshot snapshot allows for off-chain voting and proposing which is very good keeps the system very prone to free speech which is very important and the other aspect is that for the dow we are not governing this down uh with the uvi balances we are actually governing this down with proof of humanity and we actually are using a proxy contract that gives one boat one boat to each verified human on proof of humanity so if we go to one of the key proposals which is short for humanity improvement proposal you can see that everyone is voting and everyone has one vote right so it's one person one boat as far as we know this is the first democratic driven down in all of ethereum's history or at least one that has significant usage and members so this this this is an interesting feature in on itself because we are using snapshot delegations are allowed so we are using liquid democracy on more recent proposals uh let's check out more recent one because i think this one might have someone with more votes uh here you can see for example clement luzege from plato's he has 11 boats delegated i had four boats delegated so it's a version of liquid democracy so for those that do not have the time to engage with the governments they can delegate their vote to someone else and obviously we have the forum where different proposals are being debated to improve the economics to improve uh how the protocol works the different challenges the different aspects that make proof of humanity possible the community has been very creative there's one of the contributors that created humanity tools humanity.tools has a lot of very interesting material but some interesting demos as well uh i like this demo a lot that checks for similar faces and it's a nice tool if you are if you want to find duplicates in the registry and earn a good quality for finding duplicates you can use this tool so let's copy someone's addresses test this stuff like this if this work you just introduce the others here it can take a while maybe it's an address if it's not index and tries to find similar faces we'll have to figure out if this looks i i did it with my own face and i actually have to admit that that it found similar faces to mine so these are interesting tools that the community is building in order to to make sure that the that we have uh resources that can help improve the quality of the registry of the list so uh if you want to learn more about how proof of humanity works uh you can obviously follow us on twitter uh and in telegram there are two telegram groups uh there's the proof of humanity proof uh it's uh let me prove humanity without the off which is actually the original group we had with researchers um so right now this has 25 members and there's another one that's proof of humanity in spanish that has around 3 000 members so it's a growing community it's been three three months already almost six thousand seven thousand humans um we try to communicate as much as possible social media analytics and projects innovations uh demos stuff that is being built by the community and the purpose is trying to understand how we can leverage the incredible world computer that ethereum is in order to deliver universal basic income at scale uh for every human on earth a couple of interesting things about the project [Music] you know details or nuances about how the protocol works that are worth mentioning is that vouches for example let me see if i can find a very interesting tweet from me a graph it's a with the with the pouches or with the graph of pouches um that [Music] maybe this will be hard to find very quickly but i think i found it yesterday it's not here there it is so we have different uh we have users giving vouchers to each other this is from the early days of the protocol we didn't have too many vouchers um but each vouch or every voucher is actually processed in a sequential way so when i vouch for let's say five different people those vouches are not processed in parallel or immediately and it's processed one after the other and each one takes three days and a half because that's the window of opportunity that challengers have to challenge one of the an identity that does not meet the criteria the reason vouchers are processed in a sequential way is to prevent a network of spambots from suddenly hijacking the registry and taking over the system so the fact that when you create your identity you have to pay a deposit which right now it's at 0.1 plus the fact that you have to receive a vouch from someone that trusts your identity and that vouch you know will be processed uh you know in a sequential way and it might take in some cases if you ask about to me my vouchers my vouch will probably take one month because i have already given vouchers to a lot of users and they are all processed in a sequential way so my vouchers are not good for newcomers that's why we actually have some crowd vouching groups for those that want to seek help from the community uh if i remember correctly it's two week crowd ubiquial voucher this is the group on telegram um uh i don't know if this is or what we call crowdfunction maybe it is moving cloud watching oops sorry typos so you can you can ask to the community on telegram uh if to request a vouch from someone that has not given a lot of pouches and you might get a quicker path to getting approved on the registry um and uh if you are approved then you get your deposit back and you are able to start the accruing ubi uh every second uh throughout the throne throughout time uh the the identities are valid for one year after one year you have to renew um that's also a matter that's actually being debated by the community right now and uh and yeah that's a quick overview of how proof of humanity works uh with the universal basic income built on top of it and with enabling using nothing but smart contracts and ethereum and crypto economic incentives um i don't know if we have time for questions or yeah no thanks so much sante it was a really interesting overview and also uh just always impressed to see when people go live because uh you never know something's gonna work out or not but everything worked out nicely so that was great for you to show us how everything has been done so far uh we have a couple kind of comments and questions coming in so i'll start asking them as kind of they come in and also for everybody listening if you can type those questions out in the chat we'll be able to relate them to to our speakers so uh maybe kind of the first one is just um i want to sort of segment that into two categories one is just how it was designed and the second one is like how it's working now that it's launched on the former um sort of did you look at or evaluate using stable coins instead of uh sort of the tokens fluctuating in value kind of how do you think about that as being the means of the token being delivered and sort of i would love to kind of learn more about that decision process or just the trade-offs rather yeah it's it's a you know it would you know when you're building a system like this uh the only variable we control is the issuance uh we when you know if we were to use some kind of stable coin or some kind of you know something that could stop it stabilize the price we are definitely paying attention to projects that are doing that we've been looking at algorithmic stable coins uh like ample fourth or you know different kinds of projects that we're trying to stabilize the price we never expected the wild swings the token had the token you know when you know it's it's a small cap token and it had speculators playing with it and of course you know it's on the very early days but we wanted to make sure we had a mechanism that fairly and automatically distributes to everyone and with our own token we can control that issuance right then comes the challenge of well how we control the price if we can control the price you know we live in a strange world where dodge coin has a market cap of 85 billion dollars uh and you know probably a price can go a bit irrational with these markets but uh we thought that you know having a fair distribution for a fair mechanism that is you know once you become verified you get this token uh we'll enable a couple of interesting things first you know everyone that will be find themselves holding this token will eventually have an interest to find utility for it that we're saying like peer-to-peer markets we're seeing implementations on roll-ups to make the transaction transacting more frictionless so we're seeing a community building around with the wire holes there's an ave fork actually being built to length the token and use future price to stabilize price in the present uh so there's stuff like that working around with with the with the uei token whether the issuance if you know the issuance rate we had arguments in favor of increasing it and decreasing it as you can expect in a community with different ideologies and different ideas decreasing it potentially could help boost the price increasing it could potentially dilute the pre-mine so you have these trade-offs what i believe after three months of seeing the project in action is that we were always able to deliver a ubi that's above 100 a month and that that's very helpful for students for uh pensioners for people in the developing world uh so the we were lucky with that respect that price was always able to match a decent uv guy at least to get bootstrap the system and if we are able to fix the issuance rate and we just know the fact that one uei equals one hour the collateral of the token is human time and then the market can without surprises of increasing or reducing issuance without surprises with our shannon information surprises the market can coordinate that price around it that's that's at least our hypothesis if the market has this predictable emission rate of this token over time to humans then the market can decide well what should the value of universal basic income be right now the market is saying 20 cents because of a lot of factors because ants went down last week because you know there are multiple factors it's still very early days but on the long term uh i think that the market can work and can coordinate a price of what's the real value of ubi and and we are eager to see that what could happen with that it's very experimental but you know we feel confident that we can take it to an interesting place as a community of course absolutely and sort of like a follow-on to uh what you sort of already transitioned into is just overall obviously you've seen a lot of positive reception from your community but what's kind of been something that they've requested um for you to either add or integrate or work on that wasn't either part of the plan or just found you by surprise like what's kind of been that reaction for the people who did not know what this is yeah look it's it's it's been like quite a roller coaster to be honest the last three months of my life after launching this but it's so exciting but of course there are guys we were expecting for example to see big fakes we were expecting uh to see uh you know people with or twins or multiple tweets or people these guys they're on the guidelines we forbid using makeup for example to prevent that but you never know but the strangest thing was that apparently what the requirement for the videos is that they need to be 360 pixels wide at least and we found out that whatsapp actually reduces four pixels from each side so you have like or eight pixels from each side so you have 352 pixels and because according to the guidelines the requirement is at least 360 and we didn't know that whatsapp was cropping the videos that way a lot of challengers suddenly took literally you know where positivists we we could say that took clearly the words of the island and started challenging profiles that were do not meet the criteria because of eight pixels so we had a huge debate in the community whether that was right or wrong we had arguments on both sides i i think it's just morally wrong to challenge someone because of eight pixels uh it should be that in the interpretation of law and justice justice is not logic logic is logic justice is something deeper uh so we we saw a crazy debate around stunts like very interesting yeah explaining the small worlding right of the of the guidelines wow um yeah i know we're running out of time but i'll ask one interesting question that just came from from our chat and now we'll then move on to our next talk and the question is sort of how do you think about proof of humanity overlapping with people wanting to be anonymous or synonymous online uh do you think that's uh is it a contradiction or like where does that kind of fit into how i guess we're seeing the web evolve no i think it's a legitimate concern uh you know i i have a public address and ethereum and i have many private addresses probably have more private addresses than public addresses but for most people i'm santi.if so that's that's me you know you know you have it on twitter that i i decide to be public on that address i see that you know that that's a spectrum with metamask i think you can wear multiple masks that's that's the point of a metamask right and in some masks you will be your public persona in other masks you'll be you're more private or more anonymous proof of humanity tries to put all kinds of warnings just to make sure that users are aware that this will be tied to a video of yourself declaring yourself as a human you are not required to disclose any personal information or of yourself whether your name your other nationality none of that is required you can use caffe name effect whatever but we people need to check your face we need to check your faces just to see if there's some other human that looks like you or not because evolution wanted this part of our bodies to work as a public key we recognize each other in society socially through our faces and it's it's just a fingerprint that we have you know in a way of recognizing each other at a distance and we're just simply using that fact of nature but of course uh you know be cautious and be aware that this is part of your public persona protein part of your anonymous persona on ethereum makes a lot of sense well hopefully uh marcus that was uh got you some insight into that answer and uh with that we are ready to wrap up so santi thank you so much for doing this talk and answering our questions and uh hope to see you all again in month future events and uh with that we are ready for our next talk and next up we have alan shaw from protocol apps and he's going to be talking about interplanetary timelessness and how ipfs and file coins are making nfts more possible for the long haul so uh mellen welcome to our summit and i'll let you kick us off with your talk hi thank you very much uh let's share a screen here we go okay assuming that could all be seen and stuff all right um hi i'm alan i'm an engineer at political labs uh and this talk is about nfts and the off-chain side of them and how they can be stored uh decentralized on ipfs and filecoin for a long time for the long haul uh so i'm kind of new to nfts uh i guess we're kind of all are really um when i found out about them i started getting interesting interested uh i was i was really happy to see that uh ipfs was already being used to store them working for protocol labs and having worked on ipfs quite a bit it's really nice to see it being used in the world so for uh for example i can uh just pull up uh any uh any kind of uh market nft marketplace for instance just this one uh check on activity uh and wow look at that uh just so this is this is just like uh nfcs have been created or bought quite recently uh and if i click through i can just have a look down hopefully down here uh and if i click through to view transaction on eva scan and then do a little bit of splunking in the uh in the ethereum blockchain pull up the contract whoosh scroll down here put that in there do a query and look hey it's an ipfs this is an ipfs hash hey rad okay so uh and then i can i can literally just put that uh in in my browser uh and uh this comes up uh as uh in in my browser here and i can just click through to see that nft in all its high-res high-res glory so fun times all right um so back to the slides uh where are we why why why why are these nft stored online okay that's well um first of all it's kind of prohibitively expensive to store uh big big data like that on chain uh in ethereum at least um and and ipfs uh has some really nice properties for off chain data that we uh we can get into in a little bit um but yeah that's that's super rad um so anyway as as i learned a little bit more about nfts i came to realize that the developers enabling nft creators so um these are kind of nft marketplaces like foundation like super rare like like zora um they all really really cared about users being able to access their data should they ever disappear so if they just went poof they didn't want all of these fantastic nfts to just fade away because they're nfts they're they're things that their artwork that people have created uh that people have bought and they shouldn't just disappear into uh into nothingness uh so that would that would suck so um i confess ibs um can solve this problem and actually fits this bill um really well uh so it's not all that surprising that it's being used already um but in case you're kind of new to ipfs let me explain um by uh going over a few basics uh okay so i've got this uh this random nft that i've found a picture of some mountains that's sort of generated it's really pretty uh i love it uh i'm gonna put this uh this data in my ipfs node so for example if i put this this nft if i import it into my ipfs node then i get back a cid which stands for content identifier and cids are a kind of cryptographic hash and they address the content not its location so that means that um any given cid will always refer to that same piece of content or if we flip it round to a different way if the content change changes then the cid would have to change as well and so the idea is that once you've got this cid or what what what typically happens is that um that cid or a url to a gateway an ipfs gateway with with that cid in it is what's stored on chain um but if that wasn't stored on chain and just a regular url to any old website any old like google drive or whatever then that could be problematic um and that's problematic potentially because like the owner of that content could just delete it or like the domain could expire and uh or like the hosting could expire and never renewed and then then the nft will be lost forever uh or or possibly even worse uh you like that nft could be altered so you might have this fantastic image of a of a kitten a cryptokitty perhaps um that you've bought and and then uh whoever owned that perhaps came along and and defaced it and made it into a dog crypto doggy uh perhaps and that would not be cool for you um you'd be uh pretty angry um so that's that's not good uh the other another good reason is that maybe this url is just not accessible from within your country or within your workplace maybe you actually need a peer who that is actually a bit closer to you to be able to serve it because you literally just can't request stuff outside of that boundary um okay so how how does that work well uh so i have that content i've imported it into my ipfs node if someone else requests that data by its uh cid um then uh they'll receive it uh the the the ibfs network is such that um you will search the network and eventually find someone that has it and then try and connect to them and when you have connected to them you'll receive that data and so now two nodes can serve that content which is super cool um and so i kind of like this uh so a third node comes along and asks for the cid but both of those nodes can now serve that request and send that data to that third node that's cool and it what it what it means is that this original node can actually just go away so gone and and that data will still be retrievable from the other nodes and so uh this is the awesome power of peer-to-peer networking you might have heard of it um all right caveats yes there's two caveats okay the first one uh first one is kind of interesting but um i'm kind of obvious but if all of the nodes that have that content like go away if they're simply not available um then there's no one to serve that content to you so you you can't get it um there's no way so that's the kind of obvious caveat the second caveat is um is uh it's garbage collection so um we have this thing an iphone garbage collection and depending on your configured uh garbage collection rules it might run at like a certain time um it might run when your configured repost storage limit is here maybe you've just been ipfs catting loads of data and you've used like a terabyte of data and an ipfs eventually goes okay that's the limit here let's do a gc round and it will just do that or it can be run manually so you can actually invoke ipfs gc from the command line um or you can if you've exposed the http api you can hit it um over http and tell it to do a gc so um so yeah uh if you add stuff to ipfs then it will stay there and it's not uh it's not eligible for gc but if you just try and get stuff from the wider network and pull it in then it's not automatically kind of it doesn't automatically become ineligible for garbage collection so what you need to do is tell ipfs that the content is not garbage uh and it's a super rare nft uh and it's not trash it shouldn't be thrown away and in ips that's referred to as pinning and if you don't pin the data then it will eventually be garbage collected so um what that means is that even if the content is super super popular then it can still eventually exit the network because well either nodes could just disappear who have that content or those who did have that content might slowly garbage collect and eventually nobody has it and that's and that's bad uh and then so uh in general these two caveats are why developers use a third-party service like pinata like textile like bleak to store their content and the reason is that these services actually have nodes that are publicly available and they stay online 24 7. and obviously they pin the content so it doesn't it doesn't disappear it doesn't get garbage collected cool so that's um caveat number two um all right nft.storage is something that we've been working on and it's a place where you can store your nft data decentralized on ipfs and filecoin and it's and you can store it safe in the knowledge that it will be there tomorrow and it hopefully goes way some way to solving that permanence problem um and it's free it's free for as long as we can uh make it free for as long as we can keep keep this thing going um and and one of the big parts of it is that things should be easy so um so let's uh let's check out how does it work um well you you upload your nft data to nfc dot storage uh simple right uh and then what happens is the nft storage uh stores that data on ipfs names okay so um so far so good uh but what's different from like a regular pinning service well behind the scenes nft storage is actually negotiating deals to store your data with miners on the filecoin network and the filecoin network incentivizes miners to store data and they get paid to store data and they also typically get paid for like when data is retrieved so uh it's a it's a win-win situation for them um okay so why why is that good well if nfc the storage just uh goes away um and then all of the uh like nodes the ipfs nodes the nft.storage happens to be pinning to went away and all of the ibfs nodes who ever fetched that content also went away so all of the ipfs nodes uh they just disappeared for whatever reason everything garbage collected content or they just vanished from the network um then the miners will still have the content the miners are super incentivized to keep storing the content they get penalties for stopping storing content before the deal term is finished um so um you can just think of these miners as just another set of ipfs peers they are built on the same technology as ipfs and they've got super strong incentives to continue storing the data so hooray um we had a public launch for um uh nft.storage a few weeks ago the url is nft.storage dot storage is a top level domain who knew uh and so you should go go take a look we have a simple http api and it's expressed as an open api schema if that doesn't mean anything to you then i guess you could well you should know that it allows us to generate nice documentation websites like this which uh which is cool because you can just use it from the browser uh without even doing any code so that's one of the benefits at least um there's an official client uh that we built in js it's got some typescript types it's got nice api docs and we've literally just launched a new metadata api which should make minting nfts uh even easier than it was before and you'll do that with erc1155 compatible metadata so you'll be following standards at the same time all the best practices baked in so that's that's very cool uh this is the github org um and um so what i wanted to highlight here is that because of this open api schema um that we we have um you should just be able to generate a client in um in like any other language and we all we're like yeah that's great that's brilliant but then we're like well maybe shall we let's just do that so we did so we chose like some of the big languages and just generated some clients uh with uh tools that we found on the internet so they might be they might be a bit clunky um it's a machine built them uh they might i don't know your mileage may vary uh but if you are using that then if you're using one of these and then like let me know or if there's problems then uh open an issue open pr uh would be i'd be really interested to hear from people who are using one of these generated clients to see what their experience is so okay uh that's that bit of the talk all right um so i'm gonna do a little demo of the js client to show you what uh what it's like to store um nft data uh on ipfs and filecoin so uh let's just stop my share for a second i'll share my whole screen [Music] here we go okay uh assuming you can now see code on my screen uh screen screen everything cool so here we go this is live coding so this could go all completely and utterly wrong um but we're gonna give it a go anyway so what i've done is i've installed the the client it's uh it's nfl storage on npm i'm importing a couple of things so they've got the client uh we also got some web apis that we're exporting as well for use in node.js natively um but yeah so this is the default we don't need to do anything there but what we do need to do is we need to go and get a token so let's head on over to um the nfd.storage website okay so i'm already logged in here let's move you out of the way uh if i check out my api keys here i've deleted all my current ones so i'm just going to create a new one um i'm going to call it demo and create the key uh here it is uh i will delete this after the demo so i'll steal my api key um head over here paste it in here lovely job all right so let's let's talk about this a little bit um all we're doing here is we're instantiating the client uh passing it on our token we don't need to pass that but just the actual completeness and uh we're gonna read a file this is not the file we're going to read this is this file um but i put this yeah here we go i'm going we're going to store this is my favorite this is my favorite meme on the internet hello yes this is dog just for example example processes let's let's try storing that so this what we're going to call here is the store blob api this is the simplest api that nft storage exposes it just allows you to store raw data and get back a cid that you can use in your minting process if you so please so what we're going to do is call store blob uh so we've read the file creating a new blob because store blob requires a blob to be passed to it uh console of the cid and then we're going to call the status api which allows you to check in on the status of a nft that you've uploaded before and that means um checking out the pin status see if it's pinned yet or not and see the size of the thing but you can also see what file coin like information about filecoin deals that have uh have been made with this particular cid you can see like which miners have have your um have your data and what the current status of that deal process is cool okay so i'm going to save this and in theory i should this should be good to run yes this is dog this is good so i'm gonna go node store blob um okay right so uh first log line is that cid so the cid for this uh this this is yes hello this is doug and then the second one is the status object that we queried for so we get the cid back again this second property is the deals the file coin deals that this particular cid is included in now uh one thing to note is that usually you will see like as soon as you upload something this will not be populated this is something that i've actually uploaded a while ago uh and so it's had i've had a chance to make it into file coin deals which is why i'm showing you this particular item uh but but here we go we've got 5.2 so we've got three deals here uh and this is being these deals have been done on mainnet falcon mainnet this this is the miner that this deal was uh made with the current status so initially when you upload stuff you'll get you'll get a an object with status maybe queued uh to say that it's uh it's being queued up and what's uh what what kind of is interesting is that we're kind of batching up these uh this data in it so it will be queued up and then eventually we'll make a big deal with the miner with lots of lots of data so uh that's the deals um i don't know if there's anything more interested in there we've got the network in there because uh we have test nets and uh and then it allows us to make deals with uh with with miners that are running crazy experiments and stuff on on different networks so we also get the size of the thing uh we get the the pin status uh and uh yeah that's the status api but this is like the simplest the simplest most simplest api we have and actually if you um if you've ever kind of minted nfts before you'll you'll know that an nft um you actually kind of want uh both the assets so the thing that's being minted like the the thing that the artist has created or whatever it is um that's being minted but also you kind of need a metadata json file so you'll need to store on ipfs kind of at least two things so uh the asset as well as the metadata.json and what that would mean if you're using the store blob uh api you'd have to do two calls you'd have to do them sequentially because typically from the metadata json file you want to reference the uh the um the asset and you can only do that by having to see idea of the asset so you need to upload it first and then it's just uh it just gets a bit complicated uh so we have this uh we have a metadata api which allows you to more easily create a metadata.json file uh from uh some data so what i'm going to do is okay i'm going to try and do some proper live coding and so we're going to do store i'm going to create store better data.js okay so i'm just copying over the exact code we had in the previous example i'm going to close close out there actually just make it smaller we've got our yes this is dog and so our metadata api what we call is just we call a store a store function and that we have some obviously we have some uh typescript types for this so we get some really good uh information about this function that we are we are adding and so um you pass that a object and that object will is what will uh what this kind of the js form of your metadata your typical metadata.json file that you would create when minting an ft so we're going to give it a name we're going to call it um if i could type properly yes this is dog meme i'm going to call it yesterday and then we'll have a description as well there we go so and then i think the minimum the minimum you can have is uh is is these items and so i'm not i'm going to pass it a file because what uh what the api does is it just it checks that the data you're giving it is actually image the image has to be a an image or a video so what we're doing going to do here is we're just going to say pass the um the file name in for for creating a new file so i can choose so i can i can read this file with this file name but i can call it whatever i like in the file so that's that's cool and that'll be persisted i'm just going to give it a type finish jpeg and then once i've stored that let's get rid of this we get back our metadata and uh what we'll do is let's log out the metadata.url and this is the url to the metadata.json file that we created so what happens behind the scenes is that the store method takes this object and where we put actual file or blob objects in properties what it does is uh it will do one shot request to nft dot storage and nft storage will unpack that information it will store all of the files uh and and send you back a uh basically a adjacent object like this but with these um these files replaced with ipfs urls to that that content which is stored on ips and uh so here we go so i'm gonna log out the metadata dot url i'll also log out the metadata dot data this is the actual data that you would typically see in a metadata json file just to show that um that uh that url that that file to url conversion um but this this message.url um property is basically what you'd store uh in uh when you're minting your nft so here we go [Music] saved that let's give this a go hopefully with any luck this will work first time woof okay rad okay so we've logged out this uh the url this is what you'd see um we would store on chain and this references this uh well this is a javascript version you've got like but this is a url object but if you to string on that url object then you get uh this this uh this string here um and so what what we'll do now is we'll just log out let's look at that let's just log out we've got an embed function and what this uh what this function does is it gives us back that same uh that same object here but instead of having urls that are just the ipfs urls this will actually replace those with uh gateway your ipfs gateway urls so it'll be typically a dweb.link url so let's just rerun that to get those gateway urls here we go and so this becomes clickable uh i can just open this and it should open in my browser hooray and that's my that's my dog brad uh i can also i should also be able to if if i grab this i should hopefully be able to go so another gateway different uh it's the same but different um any you should be able to fetch content from ipfs from eddie any http gateway so it doesn't matter which one you're using um and this is my json file this is uh this is what uh this is what was was created for me so that's super rad all right um i think that's about it for the live coding i can't believe it all totally worked right let's stop here for a second and we'll head on back to the slides [Music] here we go okay you should see slides again um cool so aside from uh nft dot storage there's um there's some other things i wanted to just quickly tell you about um if i have time um uh so we're going to be starting our save the nfts initiative and uh and what that means is we're going to crawl the ethereum chain from genesis uh well i don't suppose there'll be too many nfcs at genesis but uh you get the idea and what we're going to do is we're going to upload all of the nfts we find to nft.storage um so so none of these nfts that have been created so far um like none of them will hopefully ever like disappear off the internet again we'll we'll upload stuff that's ipfs uh ipfs already but also things that are on your in the end of urls uh to things that aren't um ipfs or decentralized at all so we'll do that and we'll do it for not just ethereum we're going to also going to see if we can we can save nfts on other blockchains uh and of course what we'll do is we'll try and visualize that data on entity storage uh we're going to create a new nft checker there's a there's already an nfc checker but this would be a new one and it will show you the the health of your nft in in terms of um like how how many providers on ipfs there are for your nft and how many and obviously we'll show you that information i've already showed you about the filecoin deals that your nfc is on so how how well how well stored uh is your nft uh i guess uh in the long term um and uh and obviously we'll try and make those metrics available to developers over some sort of public api so they can do what they what they're pleased with it the second thing the second and final thing uh before i leave is about this uh this brand new website um and so storing um nft data the offchain stuff uh is just like a small part of a much bigger process of actually minting an nft and so if you actually want to do something like that and you have no idea what you're doing like me then uh this this brand new website uh should uh help you out with that and so it's got like step-by-step tutorials and how-tos and code samples and uh and uh like references for the erc uh schemas and stuff um and like what like the concept of d-apps in general and stuff like that so um and and the best thing is that the tutorials here actually use nft storage so um you get all of those uh those good practices all kind of baked in uh so um you should check this out this is brand new this is this was launched like yesterday it's just some stuff that's still under construction uh it's completely new but um you should go check it out and please any feedback you have on it is um is greatly appreciated um so that uh is all of the words that i have to say uh for now you should uh go out go and check out nft.storage and um and nftschool.dev that's the school that i just talked about um but yeah thank you very much amazing thank you so much helen uh this was an awesome live demo i'm glad that everything worked out in the first try um we are running a little bit short on time so i'll maybe ask just one question which has been uh kind of a conversation happening on our chat and then the question is on the technical side of this which is for nft storage is the metadata uh fully immutable or can that be amended over time if you were to add more properties and uh just the question is around just that and there are a couple of other threads around it but maybe this is a quick answer yeah uh this is a conversation we've had previously and right now there is no mutability uh icos in general that's not great for immutability immutability for the reasons that i uh uh that i mentioned earlier but um yeah we've been having conversations and we want to kind of come up and build this this thing out and well uh i'm not sure how how necessarily how that would work for metadata adding properties to that but in general like having um kind of ipfs collections of things um would would be really useful and we're trying to build that out um uh now but yeah no not at the moment well hopefully hopefully that's uh that's some clarity cm uh who was asking this and uh this kind of makes it there you go so i think in the meantime you can always use textile and sort of uh and use that thread to uh to update the new cid so if you're looking to hack on that um hopefully that's your hack around that hack and uh and if you have more questions you can find the ipfs team on our discord so uh thanks again alan and now with that we are ready to move on to our next talk so next up we have an amazing panel uh with four awesome people in this space the panel is titled what's possible nfts and we have billy who's an advisor at folia app we have people pleaser from police for dao we have molly mckinley from protocol labs and the panel will be moderated by amy jung from maker dao so they're going to talk about everything with nfts and i'll welcome all of them here to kick off the chat everybody hello thanks um thanks for the intro billy is already getting started with the party um i'm really excited for everyone to join here i we have this amazing panel and just fun is maybe it's a friday fun day um so i just wanted to start with a little bit about nfts for anyone who is new it stands for non-functional token unique and non-interchangeable so i think of nfts from a technological lens they represent tokenized digital assets plus proof of ownership plus money channels baked in um and you'll see sort of nfts of all kind there's art music in-game vr parcels real world business assets like real estate um scientific papers and even liquidity positions so um our topic of what's possible with nfps is fairly large um and with this stellar lineup it's going to be hard to cover everything but i think we have some really fun topics today to cover um i'm we're just going to start with a quick intro from all our panelists um maybe we'll start with billy uh with molly and then people pleaser and then billy um just a brief intro to give people some context you can also talk about when you learned about how you learned about nfts um so maybe molly kick us off sure thing hi everyone really excited to be here um uh so i work on ipfs filecoin with p2p um and run kind of our engineering team at critical labs working on those protocols um and so my my connection to the nft space is usually at kind of the level that you're just hearing from alan around how do we make sure that when we're addressing nfts that we're um you know not not losing those or breaking the the links um to the data and metadata that makes up an nft and that we're storing that and making it accessible long long-term without reliance on a lot of central parties um and being able to do that in a really resilient way to all sorts of faults or mistakes um and that really comes from kind of the longer space and longer mission of kind of what ipfs and falcon are aiming to do here in the web3 space um but yeah i first learned about nfts back in the in the cryptokitty days where so i was not early here but i was hearing by that and i'm a huge cat lover was like this sounds amazing i definitely want to own my own cat neopet that lives on the blockchain that sounds like the future i want but i was looking for that like that that platform that space where i could actually go and interact with it and i think the um the team actually moved on at dapper to go and build some of these games where you could actually take um these crypto uh nfts these identities and you could move them around into different spaces and i thought that was so exciting to be able to use things like um peer-to-peer networking content addressing to say take take your favorite neopet from one video game to another video game into your favorite virtual world it's like wow this this is the metaverse it's it's starting it's happening here um and so just really excited at all that we can do kind of from a technical level um and the infrastructure and tools we can build like nft.storage or guides best practices things like that to enable the amazing creators and artists and folks who are actually making making that future of the web uh exist so that they can do it more effectively so that's that's how i fit into this field here in this world hey everyone um i'm people pleaser i am a digital artist who frequently collaborates with a lot of d5 protocols and um also i i guess maybe am more known for making that unison v3 animation and uh consequently selling it as an nft in which we raised 300 honey ethereum for charity and then also uh a dao was formed to purchase the piece which is now called pleaser dao and um when i first heard about nfts uh similarly actually i heard about it i think the initial initial point was probably from cryptokitties but i obviously had no idea what nfts even were at the time just thought oh it was like kind of cool but then sort of when i when i got like a little bit more um involved in sort of selling nfts was around d5 summer but even before that uh because i had created sort of an instagram art account and just to kind of get my content out there i had joined all these random discords and then so i joined a couple ones that were uh crypto art discords and at the time i i wasn't selling any of t's but i was just joining these discords to sort of promote my work so i would just drop the instagram links in there and then people would be like how can i buy this because i wasn't selling them so i actually had no idea what i was doing and just like they probably just thought who is this person who's always dropping instagram links and they're just not selling nfts it doesn't make any sense and then uh later on then i actually discovered variable and that you can actually and this is sort of about one and this was last summer so about one miracle was like kind of taking off and then so i i just um as an experiment like minted you know like just a like three pieces or something and then i can't believe people actually bought them so then i was like wow if you actually want to buy my work this is really cool and then so that's kind of like how i got started or which was like around last summer and then it was sort of happening in conjunction with my whole like d5 summer where i was um also making um animations like uh in collaboration with diva protocols but yeah those two worlds kind of like didn't merge until uh the unison b3 animation where i was like i can actually also this could also be an nfp like the animations that i was doing for the d5 protocols so i mean and that's the only time that it happened so far and so yeah uh i'm billy um i'm based in berlin i'm on the board of management at the interchain foundation who are the stewards for the cosmos network i'm the founder of clover's network which is an nft game that rewards the creation of scarce art and i'm a founder slash advisor to folia app which is a space for exhibiting and collecting nfts first encountered nfts with a concept while i was building an early version of clover's network back in 2017 i had sort of a proto version of it before the standard really existed just as clover's network and then i was started hitting the hackathon route really hard to try to like share my work and try to see what people thought about this weird idea and so i went to the very first youth global event east waterloo where  kitties launched and it was really fun and exciting and seeing the standard there sort of clicked after realizing like the limitations of erc20 and being like oh yeah like if we all just use the same thing so much more exciting things can happen um and so really just followed it from there developed an eip called refungible token which is like a fractional ownership eip and um my fun fact is that i'm i'm the reason why ens uh uses nfts but also fun fact my twitter profile is a clovers um yes so i'm a big fan of a lot of new work i'm a fan of everyone here i've been following you guys on twitter and everything beforehand so um just to start i think for this panel one of the greatest things is thinking about there's a lot of conversations around nft art and just like it's selling and all these numbers but kind of moving away for them and actually thinking like to inspire other people i want to kind of think talk about some of those unexpected or creative use cases in which nfts that like people don't think about when they think about nfts and and one of them is around this like interesting way to sell the nft to fund something more positive or like a public good and so on then we definitely want to go back to people please not pleaser on that one but maybe billy i'd love for you to talk about this um you you kind of bid for the first the tokenized solidity code base for reserve auctions and like how selling code and and what that meant also in an nft um maybe you don't talk about that um yeah that was um a really fun experience um almost a coincidence so um my involvement in folia uh is mostly like nights or weekend uh when i was first talking to a friend about it i was like from a technical point of view it's not very difficult but from like a social point of view like you know this was founders who have been involved in like traditional art world like getting art people interested in crypto and getting crypto people interested in legacy art like that's a problem that like i'm gonna leave to you but technically you know i'll help out whatever the the tech hasn't changed the last couple years and so we were talking about building a reserve auction contract for a little while and it was exact same weekend that uh bounty on mirror posted this bounty like somebody want to build a reserve price auction and it was like absolutely um so so uh dove into it really fast they were really responsive the team over there is great i know some of the people there already um but you know iterated on a couple times they deployed it really quickly uh definitely got some help from them polishing the final code but ended up launching it and yeah selling this code base as an nft which was i guess the first of its kind um i mean it's it's not like it's trying to take the ip angle where you know ownership of it gives you rights to the code in some way but there was this really sort of like a nice iterative thing that is happening over at mirror that i think they're doing a great job of which is like uh stuff around like party dow you know almost like flash styles you know hey let's all get together on this like really specific topic purpose uh what what happens if we all just like band together really quickly to do something cool and having an nft sort of encapsulate that activity i think is really great and also provides a lot of interesting next steps for that collective activity you know the reselling of the nft proceeds of that nft collectively management the funds there's there's a lot of cool things that happen from there and speaking of dallas coming together i mean people please are you you've also been a lot of your work kind of connects back to kind of giving back the stands with asians and the autism um like tell me tell us more a little bit about your experience with like your work nfts and this kind of funding explosion that has happened um sure so uh sort of the concept of selling nfts to give back uh really came from i read a tweet from chao wang um back in the day and it really sort of resonated me basically he said that if you made a lot of money um trading assets in 2020 um just know that and he's like i speak this as an investor trader myself that you're not really contributing as much to society but if you want to brag you should brag about how you've helped people financially and so that really when i read that you know really resonated with me not that i made a lot of money in 2010 or anything but i make you know livable income just from my collaborations um in general and then and you know there's a round about you know like obviously before i was selling a piece but they were i had never done an auction before so i was just selling them for pretty cheap like i just put like less than one each or something and um you know it wasn't really like on the top of my mind but i had always thought that it would be cool if one day you know maybe i could do like a charity auction or something and so uh obviously when the whole nft explosion happened uh i did see it as sort of like it's like a superpower to you know because it is something that is only happening to a very very small group of select artists um that they're able to sell a piece you know that's going for hundreds of thousands of you know just a lot of money right and i thought what if we can sort of use that superpower for a distribution of funds you know instead of because a lot of the media as well was very focusing on like me me me and how much money can i make and you know i i was not like super hot about that narrative and so it just sort of uh in my mind kind of like came together while this unisoft thing uh had you know well i i poured my heart and soul into it it was a very special piece for me and then also i knew that there were a lot of eyes on it i could use this opportunity to really make a difference here and so that's kind of where you know everything sort of came together and i thought that this would be and i had never done an auction before it was really scary i didn't know how much it was gonna you know end up going for but yeah i'm really glad that obviously the outcome way exceeded my expectations and the whole uh thing where um i guess my sort of like internet friends and fans came together to form a dow was also really touching to me personally and it also shows an alignment of all of our values together that we all cared about uh making difference in the space and and also hopefully showing an example to other people as well that first you don't have to already be extremely famous to uh sell a piece for a lot of money and second you don't have to keep all of this money you know obviously if you're starving or something then feed yourself first but secondly you know and we actually just sort of finished the process of um finalizing the grantees and so you can actually find us on my twitter there's 24 charities so far that each receive 25 000 grants and then you can see what each of these charities stand for and what they're planning to do with money and i just think that it's really great to be able to directly see the kind of impact that this has and that's a way that nfts can totally positively affect the world around us and this is something that myself and pleaser dao are very very much aligned and hopefully can continue to do more of in the future i think that also kickstarted a lot of these styles that are kind of creating these collectives that say you know they have a purpose and a meaning and the purpose is to not just own the piece but it's about how to like distribute some of these goods in a way and and fund other things so um it's been amazing that you kind of opened that up for people i think it really blew up like starting from from your work um and and so maybe molly like you know you've seen it with foul coin as well you guys are just kicking off this also um kind of sponsoring this event as well what are some of the kind of unexpected or creative or just some of your favorite use cases of nfts that you've seen well i think my legit favorite one um which i haven't gotten to experience personally yet but i hope to is one that was actually an nfd hack couple of uh a month or two ago where where you uh created a piece of art and and it was i think flamethrower or something so an art piece was created there was a video of a flamethrower burning the piece of art and that was recorded and that is what was meant to see nfd which i thought was great and so that's my favorite so far though i'm clearly gonna have to get the least cat because that's phenomenal and i want to use that from now on um but yeah i think one of the things that i'm really excited about which i haven't seen happen yet but i think is a really interesting opportunity kind of goes to what people pleasure was saying around um you know not not needing to to lean on already being famous or already having a massive following in order to um kind of see see adoption of your work or have this opportunity of reaching people and um and kind of you know distributing uh your your nfts and gaining awareness for a cause um that you really care about i think that's super super meaningful i have a couple of friends who are musicians and are not well known you know are but have art that like speaks to kind of ideas and missions that uh that they really care about and they would they're really excited about an opportunity kind of the reverse of a dao that's buying a single work but more a collection of artists who are coming together and creating works around a theme or a mission or a cause um where where then you have kind of a collection with a curator who's helping you know think of an exhibition in a gallery or things like that where you're bringing together the collective work of many artists and so you could have like effectively taos on both ends around um you know a wider group of things where you don't lean on one person's individual like bbv brand but you you lean on like the the collective sum of these works um and then kind of on the other hand you have many people who are potentially you know becoming fractional owners of that lighter collection or um kind of visiting the the space in which this collection you're you're now experiencing this and now you have three parties you have the the series of artists who are creating work you have the curator who's helping bring together these works and um kind of set them up for um being like really meaningful to people and and exposing them to the the concept or mission that's trying to be achieved and then you have the group of people who's um getting to experience that collection of art and and i think that's something that's really exciting and interesting and i'd love to see how the technology can evolve to support that as well what are the things that we can create that make it easy for a curator to describe a series of works of art a series of nfts make sure that you know a community can fund that whole collection of entities instead of picking and choosing um and and kind of redistribute the the value uh kind of collectively across this collection versus um kind of the the one-off auction model which i think um works and is kind of the first thing we've tried here but i think there's a lot more opportunity for us to kind of explore other ways um in funding this art and so that's something that i haven't seen yet but i'm really excited for groups that are and i feel like having dao's purchasing art is like the right next step in terms of exploring that wider space which i think is really cool yeah it's awesome you kind of touch upon like the next question i had which is this topic is called what is possible with nfds and sometimes when you go really wide it's like anything but sometimes it's interesting to think the opposite way or think about some constraints that we have and whether you're designing to push through those constraints or outside of those constraints i'm curious to hear from everyone like what are some of the limitations to this nft either like creation or development pro as a process or um like what is the nft world need but hasn't developed yet to kind of all the also inspire other people um to to produce and build and and be part of this this world i could jump in first um just the first thing that comes to mind that i feel like is really missing is a really solid nft block explorer i find myself using openc as sort of a default block explorer to just like you know what is the status of this nft what is the history where is the owner etherscan is like such a fantastic product in this space and like what a what a true uh public good um but it really is lacking in terms of nft so that that often comes to my mind but when it comes to like kind of the restrictions i i'm often like split in this perspective on fts because on one side yeah they they they are everything they enable anything but on the other one like they're just like an isbn number you know i mean they're literally just a unique id on a publicly accessible registry and like sometimes people get really tripped off of like you know well what is the nft like why is this jpeg matter or whatever and it's like it doesn't but like it does like technically change this one very very small benign thing which opens up like a really interesting possibility space um and when it comes to like the restrictions i i would actually like to see more restrictions actually in the way a lot of artists engage with the format something that we we try to really support at folia is like getting the artists to uh get a deeper understanding of what the technology does and why and and trying to sort of like see if the work can interact in a conceptual level with with the format so um you know what does it mean to be transferable what does it mean to be not transferable how do you interact with like a live code code that changes over time uh code that plays with time so there's like a new piece coming out where it's a series of poems but they're they're released on this schedule that's relevant to the content of the poems but like the last one won't be available for 40 years and you know like this idea of like a blockchain is like forever or like you know etched in rock like the the auctions will continue to happen over the next 40 years but now you're really like thinking about this work all of a sudden in this this time frame which becomes difficult to pull out pull off in other other contexts you don't have like guarantees around time the way you do with distributed systems um i think yeah um i think that something could be that would be interesting as maybe i'm not a technical person so but uh because currently you know there's nothing that really sort of prevents uh we're very much in terms of uh data storage uh reliant on platforms right like you know when i'm in on openc that is uh stored on openc or if i'm in foundation then it's stored in foundation and it would be cool to see if we could uh have something where it's a little bit more like you know you meant separately or independently from the platform and then the platform is more used like for a sale but on a separate and separate separation of that when you're minting an ft because of well related to this issue if i'm minting on a foundation then there's not technically nothing stopping me from minting the unison v3 video again on uh wearable or open c or something you know obviously that would tarnish my reputation as an artist but technically there's not anything that kind of uh prevents that so what could be interesting to explore which uh let me know if this just doesn't make any sense technically but uh something that sort of either scans the metadata or uh det detects whether or not each file is sort of identical and then when it is then it kind of like rejects that mint function because you're trying to mint the same file and that if it's a one-of-one then you shouldn't be doing that right so that is something that had been on my mind and i feel like is probably hopefully something that we are exploring down the route as well and doesn't have to just apply to sort of like an mp4 file but you know even like 3d models like obj files um anything that could exist on the metaverse or just an nft form in general yeah i think the thing that that kind of gets it gets what you're talking about is um kind of the space in which you want to use an nft kind of describing the the qualifications for nfts that are valid within that context um because like you know at a fungible level like whenever you look at a particular image or video like changing one pixel changing like one piece of metadata technically makes it so that it's a different piece of content but what you can do is you can you can lean on the platform say like the video game or the gallery or um the the the space in which you're kind of operating on those entities that the block explorer or viewer of the future um to think about kind of which nfts are um like valid in that context for example something video game creators have to think about all the time is like um you know is is a weapon or a an artifact that you're bringing into that video game gonna like uh offset the balance that's like carefully crafted within within that space in order to kind of enable everyone to uh you know play with each other and and so they're frequently finding like these op like overpowered uh items that then need to be like changed and updated um and so that's the sort of thing where you can you could think about um an nft itself describing the context or even those those characteristics changing as it moves from space to space and you could potentially use that as well to be like well you know this this video is just a reproduction of another video that already exists and so videos that are um reproductions we you know only the initial um piece of art is kind of acceptable within this context within this gallery within this platform and so i think i think there's an opportunity there to kind of lean on some of the potentially lean on on the ways in which you'd view or interact with an nft to kind of also encourage the proliferation of really new exciting um types of nfts that differentiate themselves across platforms um also the i want a plus one kind of billy's like i think there's this awesome like explosion of content that's happened and it's really amazing to see um how people have um been able to like fund all sorts of amazing artwork that previously it seems people were like oh it's digital you can't you don't pay for digital things i you know but but as soon as kind of you put this opportunity for like a receipt or a trend uh timestamp um and like purchase record on it then suddenly like so much funding is able to to flow into these um to these artists and into these communities which i think is really cool um and so i'd be i'd be curious to see how we can now make those accessible to people see if there's other things within the um kind of engaging people in in kind of performative art or kind of um interaction style nfts like this um experience that changes over time things sound so cool like there's a lot of opportunity there for for like whole communities to engage with an nft and influence its evolution um over time but that also seems like a really interesting area that i'm sure some people are exploring already yeah we didn't get to get to the nft piece which our generative piece which i would like have loved to expand on so much and the change of state um but unfortunately that sort of times up for us and um i don't know if we still have time for q a but um i would definitely go over we got 10 more minutes 15 more minutes actually oh amazing well can we talk back on this genitive piece um that's the piece i i think billy you've also worked on molly you kind of touched upon as well um the the question i had was like this idea of the influence of like code and art as its relationship with each other and the code sometimes creating the art and you co-creating as like a human process um maybe molly or billy like do you want to expand on any of those ideas um i mean the thing that that i think would be super cool um and i'm i am not actually an nft creator so i can't i'm not making this exist but um i did a lot of theater um growing up and i think there's kind of a really cool opportunity for kind of communities interacting with kind of a a performative um art piece together where their actions kind of like improv influence the evolution of an nft so i think there could be a um a really interesting opportunity around nfts that grab um like data from the wider world or suggestions from their uh collective doubt owners over time in order to actually kind of change the course of that nft or influence that world you kind of think about you know as thinking of this as the primitives for creating the metaverse a really important thing there is kind of object permanence when you add a teapot that teapot is now part of that world and it sticks around for the future people who are interacting with that space and so having nfts that that are um kind of evolutionary in that way and that you can add and and build out more content to them um i mean i'm sure decentraland is pushing they have their their land nfps but you could also think about them building up more um more pieces of the virtual world as kind of meta nfts and meta meta nfts where we're talking about like larger and larger collections of other nfts um as like units you can also address and evolve i think that'd be a really interesting space but i'm still brainstorming here yeah that makes me think about all the different ways that that um nfts can be utilized as sort of like functional aspects different ways so access tokens you know combining different things but when you talk about like generative work one of the the things that really resonates for me is is that like at its core i think nfts are interesting in the history of art as an extension of conceptual art you know it's even if you think about digital work itself as an extension of conceptual work you know it's it's uh explicit uh code that represents the concept sometimes and and sometimes you know the concept itself isn't very like illuminating it's the concept is these pixels and this this arrangement um but it opens up sort of a much richer space of saying like cool the thinginess of this digital thing is being represented by this very concrete technology the nft but then the work itself is actually much larger than any specific representation of that work it's you know maybe it is an image in its most sort of concrete thing but maybe it's actually the source of the image maybe it's the fact that that image has been reproduced maybe it's who created it when they created it and why so even in this idea of like don't let somebody mint the same image you know i mean there's a rich history of conceptual artists who do complete reproductions of artworks but the fact that they did that reproduction in this context makes it completely like new work for an interesting way and and like um when i think about generative works you know that's getting actually like really explicit about the the concept you know the concept is the work looks like this under these conditions and like run this software to sort of enact and enable and see the results of of my concept for an artwork and i'm not creating a specific work but i'm actually creating an entire design space and within that space there's all these system possibility and and possible outcomes you know depending on whether when it was generated how it was generated the random number generator etc but um you know it's it's like uh i think uh an extreme step forward for you know uh an area of art that has you know very rich history but it's it's really you know blossomed into the space and i think that that convergence of those uh ideas of conceptualism as well as like software as concept really has like found its form with nfts and it's why i think we see stuff like art blocks being really successful and a lot of the larger generative series being you know really resonating with the audience is because it it hits in so many different angles ellie do you think it's possible yet to um to have something like reddit place on like as an nft as an entity that's evolving like or are there things that we need to build like technology that's missing in order to make it so that you can have like you know a massive community where you're each owning a pixel or not not even owning it like you get an opportunity to vote on what color that pixel should be on on a you know a series of time and we could have that sort of kind of evolving picture of the world and see what sort of crazy things we create i mean we've got it in a lot of ways there's there's another um what was that original like million dollar website where people you know bought pixels or something there's a new version of that which is nft based so that's collective drawing through like very discreet property ownership there's a new project from jody which is an nft that's generative but it's based on the seed of the address the person owning it so the actual image constantly changes based on the conditions of its ownership you know there's not like something you can nail down which is really nice i mean all sort of like massive online multiplayer organized games are starting to like merge with larps you know and you start having you know different aspects of it and the line between where does the art start and stop you know comes really blurry and it might involve nfts in many places along that way but you're right that i i don't think that we've we've seen anywhere near the end of the possibilities there everybody i was going to say i'm also just going to merge all the conversations from the chat and the questions we're getting and there's a there's a very consistent theme here that i feel like you can just address and then we can wrap this up which is uh can we talk about use cases of nfts that are not art related and kind of what does that world look like um and there's a lot of interesting ideas obviously billy talked about ems being a really interesting example here um just any comments or thoughts on on that as a category that'd be awesome somebody want to kick off i've got some ideas i can talk a little bit about the um like defy side as well because we do have nfts in this like really interesting we talk about liquidity positions um using you know swap not the not the animations themselves but um the positions being nfts themselves and um at maker we just onboarded something called real world assets where these tokens these nfts represent certain like loans or or aspects of of assets and therefore then you can put out a loan so it's not just art itself but it's sort of like a a tool like an and i can't i still can't figure out like what the word is but it's like an asset that holds a lot of these other um values things of value and it's not necessarily about the nft being valuable itself it's about what's inside the nft or what it represents i feel like i'm talking a lot but nobody's jumping um the the part that really resonates for me is uh one of the compounding effects and interesting aspects of blockchain themselves is this idea of composability um you know there's an agreed standard there's a common api and you know nfts are exactly that it's a common api and so it actually doesn't matter if it's art on one side or if it's a financial asset or if it's whatever the fact is that you can reuse these same tools reuse these same interfaces you can build software that has expectations for how to interact with these things as long as they follow these rules then it'll work inside this new context and that is really exciting for railroad assets i mean exactly the the um i guess the centrifuge is the example you're giving for the the real world assets is the one that comes to my mind you know these these invoices that can be now used for collateral again at the end of the day they're just isbn numbers but like you know it's it's great an isbn can represent a comic book or a novel and like it's great if you love novels and you want to talk about you know french literature or something like that but like it doesn't change the fact that libraries rule and they work because isbns you know are able to like track where the books are and why or whatever i mean i guess books at large rule i don't know what that uh claim would be exactly but um the other real world stuff that i'm really excited about i mentioned briefly is sort of access tokens um you know things that become possible with patreon memberships almost like library cards again to reference libraries you know uh you you end up not only being able to like pay for subscriptions but you also get like a token that sort of shows hey i'm somebody who's paid the subscription 10 times it's like putting a bumper sticker on the back of your car every time you like pay your dues to some you know non-profit or organization that you want to show that you support and those things of course can be used and we see them already being used for things like airdrops you know you have this paper trail of your your interactions uh how you work with different things and the fact that they follow this api means that they can be used forever in the future and all these different ways that we haven't even thought of i'm going to add also ip creative ip and then i'll let people please and i was just going to say that i think that's super useful and you know the fact that it is a shared api makes it like uh so then everybody is sort of following the same rules of the blockchain but also useful in cases that uh people want to keep like souvenirs from you know music art concerts or music festivals or and you know so much of it is sort of in the physical form right now even um small things like punch cards at your local cafe or something which i lose all the time so if there was a way to sort of like move all that on chain either through like poap tokens or something that would be extremely beneficial i think there's a really interesting thing like where we start bridging the the kind of online experience with the real world like there's there's all sorts of digital assets that actually encode real world objects and i know a lot of people um kind of are looking at you know we already have nfts for digital land so can we have nfts in realty um or like in the um the physical space there's one that i think is really would have been my answer to the question earlier around um you know things that are trying to do really cool stuff there's like tree dao which plants trees where nfts are created and then you can vote on like helping maintain the the land and like how to how to help improve like the local environment ecology it's like that's amazing that's so cool and the interplay between the online um like nft space where you know within the blockchain folks are are kind of um kind of making decisions as a group and then the real world implications of of the objects that those digital um things point to um those things connecting i think is also a really cool space folks pushing i i got a final question and maybe we can wrap this up uh the question is uh what is the name of your cat that way i need to come up with one now um after the east global crypto kitties launch event i like came home to christmas that year and like uh i've been traveling so it was like a bad sibling son and didn't buy anybody's presents so i decided to like give everybody crypto kitties and the way i did it was like buying postcards at the airport and writing mnemonic phrases that were inside of them and sealing it and then like sending it to all the crypto kitties and now i my sisters are all like hey is that still like exist is there like real ether on there like am i rich now i'm like you have a crypto kitty i'm like i hate to break it to you but like i'm really trying to think what the name of it was i want to say like uh fluff fluff nut or something like that so if i can if i can bring that up that's the name of uh every every digital cat that i own from now on amazing well billy people pleaser molly and amy thank you so much for for this amazing talk and this awesome panel and uh hope to see you all in our events and we'll keep you uh posted on what comes out of this weekend from the hackathon thanks everybody thanks for having us bye and next up we have another panel on the topic of d5 and what's possible in the world of decentralized finance and uh for this panel i want to welcome camila russo from defiance d5 dad from zapper and uh moderating this panel will be mariano conti from previously make a doubt overall great guy and i'll let mario camilla and d5 to kick us off with this panel great thank you so much kartik and uh really happy to be here uh if global events are really my favorite um but so welcome everybody this is uh like it said what's possible in decentralized finance i'm joined by camila russo and if i dad uh how about we do a couple of uh quick introductions starting with camila uh sure um yeah thanks it global for uh inviting me this is great um i'm really happy to be on this channel with mariana and defy that um i am uh the founder of the defiant uh hopefully uh you all subscribed uh to the newsletter i'm watching the youtube uh but the defiant is um a content platform focusing on decentralized finance and i'm also the author of the infinite machine um the first book on the history of ethereum awesome and uh yeah yeah i'm d5 dad uh i have been in ethereum or crypto for about three years uh and i was uh i think one of the you know earliest people to get on board with defy just trying out applications back in 2019 uh and i have since then been really fortunate i got to work for a few years at consensus working on the ethereal summit i now work on the zapper core team i've been with them for almost a year i actually coincidentally am an advisor to the defiant so i've been really lucky i met cami right right around the time she was launching the defiant and uh i write weekly posts in the defiant and then um i guess aside from that i host a uh a weekly live stream now called zapper tv which happens an hour from now if you want to join us after this uh and uh also i'm an active angel investor in the d5 community so um thanks for having me too really grateful to be here and especially next to two of my favorite people here in the world oh the same same here same here uh well quickly about me i been in the space for a while i was at maker for four years uh ended up leading the the smart contracts team uh i love defy i've used it ever since its inception i like to think that uh that i was one of the people who was there for uh you know the birth of uh of this whole movement so uh when we think what's possible with defy i i love this topic because first off i think almost anything is possible but what we're seeing lately is uh you know we're reading stories that really ground uh everything that that we've been doing and and they put in a different plane right it's becoming real uh we're going further from just uh you know speculation and and you know coming arriving to things that that will help people in the day-to-day and uh we were discussing something that i really wanted to talk about which was a thread that was started by romina a member from the d5 latin community and it was picked up uh by the defiant by argent which was a person in argentina that they renovated their house from uh an airdrop you know the the uni swapper dropped the pull together air drop and uh they managed to to renovate their house and i think that it's like a great place to start um but i want to start uh discussing that a little bit i think cami you you wrote about that in the defiant or um i'm i'm writing the story i i i'm setting up interviews with the the guy who actually did the renovations and romina is putting me in touch with even more people who have similar stories um i'm also getting um stories from people in in iran who who also got a unisof uh airdrops and like bitcoin airdrops um so there's like by reporting this story i'm getting just like these uh really interesting anecdotes from uh just users in the space all over the world uh who just by you know interacting with these protocols are are getting rewarded with with uh with tokens um and and you know it's really surprising i've had this experience myself i think we've all had of like oh like this protocol that i use every day now has an airdrop like let's like i'll go claim my tokens and then like suddenly realizing okay like this is an actual like like decent amount of money um and i um i think this i mean besides kind of the fact that it's cool to get like free money um i think what's important about this concept is that like we're going into a new paradigm of what the internet is is like and how people are interacting with internet applications and how finance is really part of the internet now and how people by using applications are also becoming owners so like we as as users get rewarded with application tokens and then then these tokens give us power to actually um govern and and make decisions on the very protocols that we're using uh so i think that's kind of what's so interesting about this this concept besides kind of like getting free money which you know is fun and in some cases actually life-changing um so yeah it's it's really nice story uh do you find that in your case uh you know working at zapper which is kind of you know like they say reddit is the front page of the internet i like to think that zapper is the the front page of d5 right because so many people like myself first website they open up in the morning and uh you have to integrate so many of these protocols so you probably get to work with them also early on what has been your experience yeah yeah we so we get a fire hose of both new and advanced users on zapper and in case anyone's new to this go to zapper.phi it's a place where you can track your entire d5 portfolio so if you've got one or many wallets you can see it all in one place so the most important thing of knowing where your money is is checked off but then we provide you with all the other sorts of tools to on-ramp and to defy like there's an exchange there's the ability to invest in liquidity pools and there's the ability to get into uh farming opportunities so i mean i so i i feel very lucky i actually just got off a zapper community call today and you know we'll have people that will have users that want to talk to us about the newest most advanced farms but we also have people who are like how do i set up a meta mask and i i think like my my takeaway has continued to center around the idea that those who dip their toe into defy you never meet a person who says i tried defy and uh it's just not for me every single person says holy this is insane i can do this with my money this is the internet coming for my money i finally have the opportunity to participate in anything i want do what i want when i want the only limitation at this moment especially on ethereum is just can i afford to transact and that is a radical radical concept i mean the ability to to do whatever i want with my digitally scarce money anywhere in the world and so you know i i think that you know going back to like our original topic i guess like what's possible with defy you know like you guys said it's anything but what what is so radical about the whole d5 movement is that it's about people learning what they could have done with their fiat money in most cases many of us did not grow up with a a wealth manager or you know someone in the bank that wanted to help us grow our money most of us grew up with some savings account some mutual fund with high fees that screwed the middle and lower classes in every country in the world and so the the difference now is that we have access to a lot of the best tools for earning yield with our money that's why really rich people are getting on board with defy but that's also why people who are not super rich are also really interested in defy and you know i think i think like as long as we keep our our eye on the ball with educating more like that's why the three of us are here i think we all believe in that more than anything the defiant has what do you have like 30 000 40 000 subscribers now cammy i don't feel like that so you have all these subscribers you put out a tremendous amount of free content me and mariano have done the same things through different channels the goal right now is to educate as many people as possible so that we don't repeat the mistakes of traditional finance that that's the that's the greatest threat to our success in the future is just not helping enough people learn how this stuff works i i agree and and in some cases um this learning is is gamified right uh cami you mentioned the philippines and axe infinity can you talk a little bit about that and is it just a game or do you think that it it is also a gateway into defy oh that's that's interesting um yeah so i i was just mentioning this great story that we did at the defiant um nfts are becoming a major source of income for crypto newbies in the philippines to colombia so um this is a story that kind of goes into how this game um actually infinity is uh allowing people to earn um additional income um in some cases uh substantially enough that it becomes their primary source of income and um it's it seems like it's this very kind of cute game where you um collect these characters and and like have them kind of uh play against each other and like go to like battles against each other um and by participating you earn these um these nfts these tokens and like you know everything in web3 uh players of xenfinity actually own these these tokens it's not like actually infinity the game that that owns these nfts but like the players have non-custodial wallets uh they're earning these nfts and they can sell them in in an exchange to make actual cash um so and and people in in emerging economies are taking advantage of this because um because something that maybe might not be very substantial for uh people living in in new york where really you know you need like 100 bucks to cross the street for someone in an emerging economy like you know a couple hundred bucks like really does uh make a difference um so um i think yeah you know it's it's not just a game because it it really kind of starts to teach you how to interact with this new world where you are actually an owner um kind of and you're in control so the concept of like having a non-custodial wallet having to be responsible for your private keys um actually owning the assets that you are in this case playing with like these nft characters you actually own them and can just exchange them so i think these games are great uh gateways into d5 because uh there are ways for um people who who don't come at crypto from uh this traditional way that we've been used to of like a like uh being like um like a bitcoin enthusiast and being attracted to crypto because of like the digital gold like hard money aspect or b like coming to ethereum because you're a developer and you want to build kind of financial applications but now we have this new wave of users who are coming to crypto because oh like they're they're playing a fun game um and like with this new kind of wave of nfts is oh because like they're creators who uh who want to monetize their their art um so um yeah i'm i'm really excited to to see uh to see kind of uh blocked in games as as gateways to d5 and and web 3 as like yeah people kind of learn how to interact with this new paradigm cameo you hit on a point around um there is an innovation that's happened in d5 and uh that one of the many innovations is liquidity mining or yield farming whatever you want to call it because in the traditional world an entrepreneur goes out and she or he raises money from investors and then they use that money in marketing and sales product development but the whole goal is to acquire customers so they're basically burning through investor money in an exchange what those investors have ownership in the company they believe in some sort of upside the problem with that of course is the limitations of who can participate in most instances as an investor you normally have to have money to invest it in a lot of countries like the us um and it also becomes a game of who has access to these sorts of conversations i don't doubt that uh venture capitalists work really hard but i i i can attest just for the short time i've been in the world of investing through defy i am amazed at just how we just recycle through the same investors over and over again so what defy did is it flips it on its head and it says screw that you you don't have to raise money through the traditional routes you can just launch let's say with a team of five people or something or even one you could launch a protocol and you say hey customer who's risking your money who's spending valuable time who's talking about my application how would you like it if i rewarded you with equity in our protocol or our company if you want to talk about it in that way and so that's what's radical about liquidity mining is now we've cut out all of this this  this inefficiency that happens and now we can reward users and that's that's what earlier cami you were mentioning like you and i and and mariano we've all been blown away by there are applications that i just i used because i thought they were cool and i talked about them because i thought that others should learn about them the fact that we've gotten airdrops it's brilliant because we were already aligned with that company i already loved pulled together and was going to talk about it till till i'm in the grave and now i actually own a stake and pull together so i'm even more incentivized git coin just did this i donated probably a thousand dollars over two years to maybe 500 projects probably a a dollar one die to every single one of them i mean the airdrop that i got was you know a surprisingly significant amount of money but i'm still gonna remain long and part of it because i believe in git coin and i want to participate in their governance and i want i want to see through the future of that protocol so yeah i mean i i just you know i want to remind everyone if if you've heard that liquidity mining and you know farming is a fad that is wrong there will be lots of teams that will flame out because of it but we are going to see this mechanism take hold in other industries once others realize that they can incentivize a community of their users to get behind them and raise capital this easily and this quickly it's only a matter of time before we see that become a standard so you think that this you know the the the airdrops to loyal users it uh it doesn't necessarily create a community because the community is already there but it kind of cements a little bit right it it it doesn't have to but it it's almost like an implicit you know secret handshake it's like a thank you and also probably because i'm i'm imagining you know a virtual shareholder meeting right between i don't know uh companies in the spf 500 and d5 projects i would imagine the token holders for the d5 projects to be among the most diverse crowd ever right uh from pretty much every single country in the world that has internet access and uh all of them eventually having a voice uh and a vote in the future of these projects which to me are gonna become you know the next uh the next big companies that'll take over the world one one thing we it's probably too expensive to talk about here but when you go and you think about what's possible with defy i actually think that defy uh in general will be able to dissolve um our sense of what is a country or what's a nation state and and really like unite more people because like i can tell you right now like i'm not anti-american but if you said where is your greatest loyalty my greatest loyalty is to the ethereum community why because i have more in common with them i don't know where most of a lot of my friends that i've made through the community i i often don't even know where they are in the world you know i come to find out oh you're in malaysia oh oh cool i had no idea but there's so much in common there because we're living in this digital world that you know this this still sort of is that uh it's that mirror that reflects what is like we're simulating what would be a panel in a physical conference but like i think this is going to be the default you know i think we're all going to live in a world that's remote first and we're going to thrive in virtual reality like the defiant has a vr headquarters now and that is that's the standard so if if the world is becoming more and more default digital then we need a default digital money we need a default digital finance and that's why this this is the future like we're not going back there's no one today who's writing letters and is like oh yeah you know email it just it just isn't for me i decided i i like i'm a i'm a us male maximalist you know it's just nothing's ever been better you know it's it's me and my friends we meet up at u.s mail maximalist uh meetups and you just talk about how great the us postal service is you know like that's what some of the bitcoin dinosaurs sound like right now and uh there's still time you know we're still early in d5 but i think it's really important that everybody uh you know get on board this this is not going away i love that that's hilarious um yeah i think i think you're kind of it's it's yeah on point there on like what's what's possible in d5 it's this just global um network like global financial system uh that's really providing access to uh financial services for the first time to to just you know people anywhere um who like whoever they are like all you need is an internet connection and an ethereum wallet um so i think that's pretty unprecedented it's it's really revolutionary um and it does kind of like bring down borders and so i don't know like i think we we get like um very um just like idealistic and but in the end um it's if we want to kind of like bring it back to earth it's it's really kind of the ability for anyone anywhere to access financial services um and do something as simple as um get their money in a stablecoin and start earning interest and start building their wealth and taking control of their assets and hopefully becoming you know more financially independent you know i i think it's it starts with that and then you can kind of continue building off that but like for anyone who's just like getting into defy and like thinking like is this for me is this like this is like really weird like what are all these like cartoon avatars talking about um but i think like it's just like you know it's financial access for everyone that's basically what it is like you need to like first like get over that first hurdle of like using metamask approving transactions that's kind of like will look very weird at first but once you get over that it's just very simple and you can like start increasing your your savings and taking control of your money today i sound like a defy ad but take control today but you know one thing that broke my heart last year was uh i'm very active uh as you are with you know the latin american community uh and starting to see people getting priced out uh of you know ethereum mainnet and and d5 because uh the fees started becoming so huge astronomical and but it turned out that i'm not gonna say that it's a good thing but it did uh you know prompt the community overall to rethink and uh you know roadmaps and come up with scaling solutions faster right and uh today it's like a different ecosystem we can um we can transact on mainnet through either ourselves or through uh you know compounding protocols like uh yearn uh but we can do things on on scaling solutions and and that way we bring all the people who who may have left uh we bring them back and uh when i say d5 i mostly or exclusively mean uh d5 on ethereum in my case uh you know which is i believe the most uh credibly neutral uh smart contracts blockchain um etc but and to me it's nice seeing all those people who may have left uh coming back with uh you know scaling projects like uh like polygon and now the l2 uh hopefully uh the other solutions that are gonna be coming out and uh do you find that have you seen any of that you know polygon uh is supported uh in sapper yeah yeah yeah maybe yeah if anyone's newer to the d5 space or to ethereum uh you know don't be afraid to go try defy on polygon um you know there's a lot actually also going on on um uh phantom i recognize there's a lot that goes on on bsc but it's understanding what you said what's credibly neutral what's actually has is is more decentralized or what whatever your definition of what is decentralized versus what is not as long as you know those risk parameters i mean you're good you know i think like if someone comes to me and says i have 20 dollars i want to get started in d5 even at 30 gwai you know with super low gas prices right now on ethereum the last few weeks i'm like you know in good conscious i i i know you can have a lot more fun if you get onto polygon so you know you go to like zapper we we opted to start supporting um polygon bsc and phantom all three of these are um i think appropriately called side chains despite some of the ridiculous conversations i've heard about that lately um and then you have your true l2s like arbitrum that's launching very soon you'll have optimism you'll have zk sync or whatever it's called zk porter when it goes live um those are truly like elevated trains loop ring to those are elevated trains on top of ethereum where they inherit the security and decentralization benefits of ethereum so anyways long story short though i i i would encourage anyone like don't be afraid to you know get on zapper.phi bridge and move some money over to polygon um i choose to keep a majority of my assets on ethereum but i think that's a privilege at this point i think it's because i've been here for a few years and i i think again i'm very fortunate to be able to do that to make that decision but it was it was some dark days you know for for months there we all were looking at gas prices saying this is this is so insane like when you get up into 200 300 500 go away on a few days that that's not possible for any for for many people the gas cost more than the amount of money they had to transact with so you know um yeah i guess that's that's my rant on knowing the difference between defy and what is something in a spectrum between defy and and centralized finance but it mirrors it looks just like defy but you know if you're on bfc you know that those those validators are ultimately they're either under the control of binance or they have very tight-knit relationships which questionably uh uh makes it questionable whether or not it's decentralized finance i know i know deep like that that uh you are a yield farmer you you show every uh a lot of projects on on tv but uh cami are you a yield farmer too do you actively use all of these projects do you use some um well i i test uh some projects um i'm not actively yield farming um i think you know what i try to bring uh with the defiant is um objective on unbiased reporting so i try to stay away from investing in these like any like specific protocol but i obviously do kind of testing things out because i need to kind of know what i'm writing about and editing um but yeah i'm not like yeah actively investing i guess in in d5 what how about or you or mariano what um you know one thing i don't want to leave off here while people are watching is uh you know if you had to recommend like one two three applications for those that are are newer uh to d5 what are some of the simpler ones you might recommend i would say one of the simplest ones if if somebody already has access to digital dollars be it usdc or die would be just putting them in polygon and inside of it that is i would say just about the safest that you can get they're tried and tested the you know battle tested uh protocols you can start earning some money on your digital dollars and that is the perfect gateway to slightly more complicated strategies like uh you know once you're there you may want to learn about insta-app and how with just a couple of clicks you can do a loop with your uh die or usdc and whatever you supply you can borrow again and supply it yet again and instantly you are now yield farming uh the matic token for example so that to me lately has been my recommendation also uh in my case because i know a lot of people who um need access to digital dollars right they and they uh people here in argentina and other countries they save in those dollars because you know i always talk about the depreciating argentine peso um so that to me is usually my go-to that's awesome cammy anything else that i i know again you've you've been more um uh testing aside from from i know the long positions you would hold but uh any any of the defy apps that have really stuck out to you i'm talking actually to like protocols so i'll say default as i would tell anyone go to zapper.fi and um you know click on the farm tab you can discover there's like 600 opportunities there and then you can enter any one of the liquidity pools uh on the pools tab but if you're not doing that what what what do you like cammy yeah so um i've actually like had to uh do this a few times because there's like so many friends and like family asking about crypto and d5 so like i i guide them through like how to do this stuff and um a lot of like people are just like coming into this without knowing just like the very basics so i think to to start like anyone just getting into d5 um i recommend uh just trying unisop um because i think that's kind of like the the first thing like the building block that you need to get like from each to like whatever you want um so like just go to unisop uh once you have ethan in your metamask and um swap for uh uscc or dye or like some stablecoin and and then i i recommend also like ave like um getting interest on on dave on on ave or like um i i think it really blows people's minds when i explain urine to them it's like you go like you can uh pick any of these strategies the protocol itself will execute this thing so that you get like the the most amount of yield um you don't have to do anything and that really kind of like blows people's minds and a set is also like a similar concept so i think like both yearn and set are are really great places to go for someone who's just starting out and just wants to put them their money to work and not have to do much like they're just like very kind of you know allow allow you to have like a very passive strategy and just like start earning interest that way it's fun only robots like uh rsa mentions uh i'm being told that we need to wrap up uh in a couple of minutes so uh you know a reflection uh kami has a book on the birth of uh ethereum and and a little bit of defy called the infinite machine she actually uh tells my story of buying a car with a loan from maker uh with dye that was probably one of the maybe not the first but one of the most uh one of the earliest examples of you know actually using defy uh in the real world and uh cami are you writing uh anything new with the you know all of this probably last summer gives you can write a bible with everything that happened last summer there are so many good stories in d5 i'm itching to write a second book um i'm not at the moment but i'm i'm collecting stories for the the time that i do i think i need to kind of figure out how to delegate more more like defiant work because right now like i wouldn't have a minute in the day to write a book but once i figure out how to do that then i'll get to to writing the second book which i really like i can't wait just like the stories in deep eye are insane there are so many uh do you find that anything you want to add no just uh you know i i think uh one of the key takeaways is think about what's in your your wallet that's sitting there idle um you know i'll use the most obvious example of ether and you know if you can start to find again like the easiest way to find opportunities is through an aggregator like zapper and you can go there under the farms and search ether and then start to recognize that hey i could take my ether and be in a curved pool with 50 staked eath steph by lido and fifty percent ether now i'm i'm earning staking rewards i'm earning trading fees and i'm earning in that case i'm earning a few different reward tokens so as long as you can self-custody which is probably the that's one of the biggest questions is can i trust myself to self-custody and maintain these assets then you can start to let that money work and i think idle assets is one of the best places to start i have something i'd like more of it why don't i put it to work in this thing bt dubs you can ensure a lot of these things now through like a nexus mutual so anyways yeah no just uh thanks so much for having me though this this was awesome always always a pleasure to to talk with the cami russo and the mariano conte and we defied that it was yeah great time i wanted to say because you both only because we could have done this in spanish i couldn't have i was [Laughter] so good to see you guys and um yeah just keep putting out all the awesome content the two of you do like that yeah likewise emmy and mariano thank you so much it was a super interesting conversation there was a lot of there's still a lot of questions but i feel like we're definitely a little bit over time so i wanna i want to leave them for some other future talk that we'll invite you back for but uh thanks so much for this awesome discussion thanks kartik hi good job bye guys take care everybody and uh next up i want to introduce our last uh panel talk for the damian one more talk after this and that is a our panel on the future of dowse um so uh i want to welcome john palmer from party dow kendall shot from blockchain capital and moderating this panel will be linda shea from scalar capital so um we'll have a really interesting chat about just how dials are changing everything and welcome everybody on the panel well awesome thanks for having us the d5 panel was really interesting too um so just quick intro on myself my name is linda and i run a fund called scalar capital and previously was a coinbase very excited about this discussion on daos with uh john and kindle and so um kenji and john could you please kind of talk about a bit about your background and what you're working on with dao's and why you are excited by daos my name sorry is the audio like working well for you john or uh yeah kendra i think he might i don't i don't know maybe like a gesture mic it's a little bit cloudy it's still a little bit um muted maybe maybe john you can go first and then we can yeah that's fine yeah sure um yeah my name is john palmer i'm a software engineer and designer have worked as a designer and engineer at a few companies and founded a solidity tools startup back in 2017 but as far as it relates to this talk um i'm currently pm'ing for a group called partydao it is a group building a product together that allows people to place collective bids on nft auctions and happy to dive more into it later i think well yeah maybe i'll just leave it there that's my intro awesome thanks how's my audio it still sounds a little bit underwater let's um hmm not sure okay okay cool johnny and i can chat well okay we can just jump into a first question if you want linda yeah yeah well first of all like that's a really interesting example of that i would love to hear a little bit more about how that got started and kind of what are the interesting things you've learned through that process and then um we can jump into uh to talking about what are some creative use cases that that was with controls back totally yeah so um yeah party dow specifically um yeah this is this is the origin story moment i guess um if i'm sure you've seen and probably a lot of people here have seen recently on twitter or on foundation or different nft platforms this behavior of groups of people coming together and like pooling their money so they can place massive bids and win nft auctions maybe the most notable example recently has been pleaser dal placing like five million dollar bid on the snowden nft um and so uh the founder of mirror dennis had tweeted out this idea like what if there was a just a product called party bid where you could just like quickly like spin up a dow pull money together bid as a team and then win an nft together eventually like selling it and splitting the profits and overnight a friend of mine anish built the smart contracts for this and just posted on twitter and ended up using those smart contracts to win an nft auction with a friend later that week um so this kind of sparked excitement around this idea and dennis then created a crowdfund on mirror to raise 25 ether to um to build a dow to actually like build a real you know professional productized version of this this same thing and so 25e ended up getting raised very quickly from maybe 50 or so contributors who then joined a disc you know token gated discord together and started organizing to build that product and that that's that's kind of the origin story the really cool thing about that for me has been that the people who've ended up in this group are actually amazing builders so there's people like you know khalil the designer from unispot like the designer of uniswath and you know senior solidity engineers from companies like cello and dharma and 0x then you've got like amazing pms and writers in there as well so it's been really cool to see like a group of talent that you could probably never recruit to one startup is now working together on something and that like definitely makes my years perk up and be like oh that's that's kind of like a cool competitive advantage around talent or something and you know over the past few weeks that group has elected a smaller team of about seven people to design write smart contracts build a front end for this product which is you know now about halfway through development so uh yeah i think i think that's the origin story that's what's happening and to me you know in the announcement like blog post for this thing i kind of framed this as like it's really cool because it's a dow that builds products and i think uh you know hopefully when kendra's here and we start talking about dals more generally i think it's a very loaded term so it's cool to like kind of break downs down into different you know taxonomy of different use cases and i kind of bucket this in this kind of unique spot right now it's a dow that builds products i haven't really seen that before so that's just a bunch of background on partydow that's awesome uh this represents some of the parts of why i'm so excited about crypto and like the really amazing things happening in the space like this is so cool um hopefully we have a kenjo back um well i had a question about uh membership so is membership open to anyone to be able to join the style like do you have a application process like how do you think about the dichotomy of like dows being super open to anybody but also making sure you're filtering for high quality members yeah definitely well right now um you know the the initial membership was basically based on who contributed to the crowd fund that was how tokens were initially allocated um and since then you know it's a discord server with a collab land bot you know gating it by 10 tokens so the only way to join the dal right now is if a member sends you tokens um and that's happened quite a bit you know members have sent tokens to friends or people that they wanted to work on this project and um yeah some of the people working on it now we're just like invited via sending tokens but that's the only way in right now it's like i guess you could say that's like membership referral or something um now technically it's not something that's totally under the control of the doubt like if any member decided to kind of overrule and put the tokens on uniswap then people could buy the tokens and there would be like a market for entering but no one's done that so far and i think that kind of speaks to the alignment around the singular focus of like we're here to build this product um not to like pump a token or not to just like kind of arbitrarily grow i feel like all the members that have been added so far have been aligned around this idea of like the immediate goal as we were building a product that we were trying to shift and so right yeah that makes a lot of sense well it reminds me of one of your tweets where you talked about how dows are a very abstract concept and we should be thinking about them differently i would love for you to kind of talk about that because i thought that was one of one a really interesting tweet you had yeah totally yeah i i would even first link that back to something that i was thinking a lot about and wrote about earlier this year um which is like this this term of uh a scissor label which is is rooted in like a a slate star codex post but i think uh dowels have become one of these terms where it's it's a term that we're all talking about where we've all like agreed that this term is like a thing and we're all talking about it and that's useful in so far as it's now like the shelling point for conversations and action and like it spurs things to get started but even though that term has been established no like canonical definition of a dao has been established so people are talking about the same term but assuming different definitions and that's like not really a very useful way to talk about something and so i think dials are in that camp right now which is one thing to be cool here is talk about like different types of dials like some dials are smart contracts and that's all it is some dials are like a discord server with members and it's like very much socially coordinated some dowels are like governance tokens like uniswap's token where there are on-chain governance mechanisms that also really rely on social coordination as well like these all these are all things people call dals the tweet the tweet that you're mentioning uh was i think you know the the biggest fault of that kind of phenomenon is when you start talking about like let's start a dow like we should do a dao um and it's just like saying like we should do a startup without deciding like what yeah sounds great like what should the startup do like what's what's the idea what's what's the purpose um and that was really my point is that like any given dao should have a job to be done and like a mission and all of the things that you do with that dao like how you decide the membership structure decision making uh where you congregate like what your criteria are for like um participation all of that will be designed around whatever that initial mission was but if you just like start a dow and then and then you know like cool we started a dow and then you kind of try to kind of figure out what what it's going to do i think you can you get to get like really messy coordination because there's like no initial you know incentive alignment or anything from the beginning so i was just tweeting about that basically yeah it makes a lot of sense i fully agree with you there um can joel uh would you be able to introduce yourself and talk about what you're doing in the dallas space and why you find out it's really interesting yes sorry about that hopefully this is better it's better yeah okay awesome um yeah thanks for having me so my name is kendall sorry about the technical difficulties um i'm an investor of blockchain capital and then on the side um i teamed up with shakespeare basics and when i'm watching both of you [Music] nice um by the way there's like a bit of a background noise i don't know if you can find like a quieter location just just putting that out there um awesome well uh i wanted to talk about like just what are the most creative examples that you're seeing in the dallas space i think it'd be really interesting to the audience to hear what are some uh cool examples happening right now i mean the space changes so quickly too right yeah so some of the dials that um i think are super interesting art space non-profit space um trying to basically come around and fund different audiences or different missions that don't necessarily see a lot of coordination and capital allocation is an easy manner so um i think a lot of the doubts in that space in particular have stood out to me and i think we're kind of at the tipping point and how about how about you john yeah definitely yeah i think um to to me dolls are just like as the umbrella term i feel like the commonality is like it's it's new ways of organizing people to you know coordinate around any given like goal or purpose and um i personally like think that the party dial thing is interesting like a group of people building a product i think you know the pleaser dal uh stuff is pretty cool too that's like kind of a group of people that's um bidding on art auctions but typically in support of philanthropy so it's this interesting kind of like it's a brand it's a fund and it's also like a philanthropic organization again just like blurring lines between different things um that would typically have to be kind of these formalized separate institutions and then you know the the dow term is like originating from decentralized autonomous organization and i think originally the idea was that that was a it was a smart contract with like rules on chain and like public functions that anyone could call and to that degree something that i recently thought was like a cool dow was this thing called the freaker fortress which you know there was this nft game called ether freakers i think it was just a hackathon project but you know there was this game where you could like fight nfts against each other basically you know they had attack and defense attributes but someone built a smart contract my friend wilson actually um built a smart contract on top of that game that let anyone send their character into the same contract and then members of that group could vote to collectively attack and win the game by attacking with like the collective power of all of their characters in the game and i think that's i just throw it out there is another like interesting dow because there's no discord there's no telegram it was really just a smart contract that anyone in the game could opt into to like link up with just like public functions wow that's awesome is it so that's publicly available anyone can yeah yeah you can check out wilson2sac's twitter he was tweeting about it a bit a couple months ago that's awesome um well leading to my next question is um what are some use cases for dows that currently you haven't seen right now but you would like to see exist in the future um kendrill do you have any ideas there yeah so um i think like we started to see this with barbie dao where folks came together to like purchase an nfc um and i think what's interesting to think about um in the dallas space that i'm sorry about the background noise it's just like pop-up downs and how like dallas can kind of differ so i think you're going to see a lot of experiments experimentation there where maybe a dao is somewhat temporary and has a particular purpose for a moment in time but then kind of you know completes that event i like that i like that a lot especially we have um so many more tools in the dow space now that it's easier to spin these up and coordinate people really quickly uh john how about you any any things you're super excited to look forward to yeah i mean i i think the stuff kendra mentioned a minute ago around like um nonprofits and artists stuff is really cool like i think um maybe like the mint fund was is like a cool example of like pulling together money for like gas costs for artists and then um i actually don't know all the details of the mint fund other than you know when it was first announced i found it really interesting but yeah i think it's always hard to it can it can always get tricky you know it can always get tricky to answer questions about dolls because they can get so so broad it's like uh you know i'm trying to think of like what's specifically unlocked here and i feel like a lot of it lately is around like pooling capital and directing it towards some like common goal but um i guess i i could really imagine dallas like kind of doing anything because it's just like a group of people coordinating around something so it's hard to like limit limit what i can think of there yeah i mean it'll touch upon everything i feel like um one area i'm i'm actually excited by is um just the idea of building up reputation in these dows and actually have that reputation like poured over to different dials like hey i've really built up and shown my work in this dow and then like that can maybe carry over so i'm hoping somebody works more on the reputation side of things um and then so kendall you recently co-authored a piece with cooper on the rise of micro economies i i really love the piece could you kind of summarize what this trend is and what's a micro economy and how do you see this kind of being the future way that groups collaborate yeah definitely so so yeah cooper and i co-authored a base on the rise of micro economies and really what we were thinking about here is we have all um this long tail of communities that are you know spinning up online and have been setting up for quite some time and now they have a way to basically add a monetization layer through daos and through social tokens and different types of you know just token economics more broadly um and so the way that we define a micro economy is basically you know maybe 100 or so folks in a community under a million market cap and they're kind of doing something free products you know for a common mission and so that's really how we thought about designing it and i think it's going to allow for a lot of different policies to create a product and generate revenue nice um and i also had another thing that you wrote about um that i thought was interesting to talk about was you had asked um what makes something a dow and not just an online community so is it just the idea of just adding in financial incentives or is there something more to that would be curious to hear from both of you what are the differences between dows and online communities yeah i like to think about it as like um like a community with a bank account or community with like a treasury to govern and some sort of on-chain yeah i to me i i don't know that i'd necessarily draw any distinction really like i i think this is like i feel like when i when talking about like dials or communities or like any like kind of like yeah one of these like scissor labels to use my terminology of like this really like loaded term that like people are centered on i feel like that that term is just like serving as like a a vehicle for or like a void that we can fill with a conversation about the phenomena that are actually interesting about like like what we're noticing happening so like to me i i'm not as interested in saying like what's a dow versus what's not a dow but more like what are the what are the interesting behaviors that that are making like this dowel term rise to like such a level of popular popularity and then can we like break those down and definitely like what kendra's saying is is exactly that which is like yeah like there's groups of people who are not like formally employed by or like you know involved in like some you know a legally identified organization but they're they have collective control over some kind of resources but to me that that's also something really interesting about what's happening happening with communities um some some friends of mine wrote an essay a couple years ago called headless brands and it's about this idea that like particularly in web 3 protocols there's no head of of a brand there's no singular voice pushing out like the bitcoin brand for example or the ethereum brand everyone can kind of like co-opt it and talk about it or like use the logo however they want and um that was already happening kind of before crypto because of the internet like you know the internet made it so anyone could broadcast to you know infinite scale basically and and maybe you could say that about like influencer marketing or communities or something like i do feel like communities now even without even before like a shared wallet that holds cryptocurrencies have a way greater amount of power than they ever had before because they they can like you know brands regularly bend to the will of their like customers and communities before our eyes on twitter and so that's also interesting like community or dao whatever term i think these things are converging around like similar behaviors which is like groups of people coordinating and having like real influence and power and then i think the question becomes like how like what are what do you do with that like how do you how do you become an expert on how these groups are organizing because i feel like that's only going to get more important for like yeah a while maybe like decades yeah yeah i feel like um i mean i'd be curious to hear both of your thoughts on i mean regarding coordinating these groups of people as these dows become larger and larger how do you actually have governance at scale how do you make sure people feel like they have a voice and that they're active in the community just because there's a lot of noise would be curious to hear if you have any opinions there so one thing i've been thinking about here is um i mean like social scalability is something we talk a lot about in the broader crypto ecosystem and how that might work within government and i imagine that reputation will play an even larger role in how governance evolves just you know as on-chain gratification becomes more thing um i just don't know if dallas are going to be as flat as they are today where um you know it'll always be open access but you'll kind of know that there's potentially different reputation levels that contribute differently or um you know roles that are assigned within like this collective so i think that's kind of how i see the future evolving yeah that's spot on yeah i think that's a great distinction between open access versus flat structure which don't necessarily need to be the same thing um i think even even like biology had a cool post a while ago about like network unions and the idea of like well i guess one solution this is like voting delegation right of the idea of like not everyone is going to be super engaged and not everyone is going to be an expert on like big decisions that are happening and so being able to forward your own voting power to a delegate and have kind of voting power kind of pass through a whole network and end up you know a little bit more concentrated about them hopefully around the most active you know qualified people is one way to kind of break out of just like a completely flat hierarchy and then i think um yeah i guess like another another thing that's tricky about like just groups of people who are like democratically voting around action is what what level of granularity do you vote on right like if you know we're building a product and party down right so like if we were voting on like what color blue should the button be okay cool like what typeface should we use it would take years to build the product and so i think you know an obvious decision is like dude have democratic decision making happen for like broad strokes of action wherein you then appoint a smaller group or even a centralized individual to coordinate much more dynamically for a constrained period of time and then let it go back to people to kind of assess do we want to do that again this is what happened with you know on a much larger scale actually the uniswap grants program was just like hey let's approve a budget of a couple million dollars to run a grants program and let's just appoint these six people to run it but after two quarters we will assess if we even want to continue that and um and you could even you know democratically elect those people or whatever but i think this is uh yeah maybe something to decide like up front with a dao or a community or like whatever you're doing if you're bringing people together to do something is like early on try to decide like what what level does it make sense to to vote on things and what level should we just like appoint people to run the stuff for like constrained periods of time yeah i think those are really great points um uh regarding delegation i really liked um how git coin approached it with their token distribution that just happened um where there was 100 delegation to start so like even before claiming your airdrop had to delegate to someone so i really liked that just moving things forward uh from the from the start so um awesome well uh i want to leave time for audience q a so um i think kartik is moderating that piece to uh kartik are you going to be joining otherwise i can keep going with questions hey sorry i carted i'm i'm sitting over for currently um yeah i mean we can definitely go on for questions if you have more to add feel free to go we still have about like 10-15 minutes to go on uh max over things let me just try to see if there's any questions from the chat um while i'm looking into that you can go for another one i can i can add one thing just onto the i actually wrote this down before the talk because because i wanted to say this about you know this idea around like how do you get active engagement and make sure that you know a dow or a group a group of people is like you know staying it's staying high participation i think one big thing there is to keep the questions of governance and process at the forefront of the conversation within a dao or you know community discord or whatever like the questions of like this a lot of these things i think are obviously still very early on and i don't think anyone has fully figured out like how to perfectly run like decentralized governance over anything and so the i feel like the main pitfall you can fall into is like you establish some process up front and it's okay like it's probably a good starting point but now you're like a few months into your org and no one has like gone back to question like how do we feel about how this process is going is this working is it moving fast enough are people engaged do they feel like they have a voice in this system though i feel like they're people need to like my maybe my big takeaway like easiest takeaway from this would be like set a discord bot reminder that says like discuss governance process and ask how it's going would be the biggest thing because even even though we're all on like a panel here i don't think anyone really has like the perfect answer for this stuff so i would say like have the community itself ask itself how governance is going pretty frequently and and iterate and see how things improve yeah i wanted to say that and forgot to so yeah no that's great advice and i think also there's constant improvement by different projects as they launch their dows and how they're going about it like ribbon also um they launched their tokens and it's non-transferable to start and like there's all kinds of different experiments so it's i think it's a great idea to like pull from different projects and how and watch how their experiment has gone and kind of iterate in your own dao so i think that's fantastic advice uh were there any questions yeah well one of the question that is there is how do the dow prevent tyranny of the majority um from from someone from the chat i don't think anyone has a thought on that or something to add on that level yeah i mean i think we're gonna have some potential bad incidents in that in the world where maybe somebody comes in and there's a bad actor or um you know these like cartels kind of form i i do think as thou get larger and more open um it's more difficult to coordinate it's that type of an attack so let's just say it's like a smaller one and there's you know 50 people or something that's definitely more doable than like thousands of people if you have some of these um but i think we'll we'll probably need to institute some checks and balances that we just don't necessarily have yet um to kind of make sure that these types of things don't happen on the social coordination level yeah i think that makes sense yeah i i i guess the big lesson like i guess if you're truly fully decentralized like you can't like the tyranny of the majority is kind of like what will rule and that would be something like bitcoin where like you can't decide who or or ethereum like any any like l1 currency would just be like you can't decide who gets it if they can buy it and like you can't decide what they do with it but you know so so they're actually like the majority is kind of like in power in some way but like kenjal said it's hard for the majority to coordinate and then if if there is like a coordinated majority or minority that is upset about the tyranny of the other or something then that's usually like voice by exit which is like people will actually fork uh a community and uh like we're certainly gonna see that happen at some point like at some point i'm sure this already happens with subreddits actually like someone was telling me today about like the the fire subreddit which is like um like an early retirement it's like financial man it's embarrassing that i don't know the acronym but something something retire early it's like a community that's focused on building you know productive financial plans for getting rich and retiring but like there's now our slash fat fire which is like they basically forked the community because they were frustrated at how like nitpicky responses and the other were i wouldn't be surprised if we saw this for something like a dao or something like um a brand community or something in the future and i'm personally like excited to see what what would happen there when something had originated from like a central authority but then you know someone like usurped that or or forked a social group yeah i think that's going to happen a lot just because the the barriers to entry to join a dow or even started our solo and everything's so transparent and unchained and you really kind of have to make sure you're treating your members well or people are um having a good experience otherwise there's like always going to be maybe another dow that they can join and so it kind of reminds me of like sovereign individual uh where it's like countries are competing with people and so dallas are going to be competing for talent and i think that'll be interesting you see a bunch of forks uh yeah hey card dick sorry i was uh it was away for like a minute and that's the thing when it ended it was like uh we gotta figure out now a transition but super interesting panel i know we had some little bit of hiccups but everything worked out nicely um i have two questions we'll try to see if we can do both in the time allocated if not we'll we'll figure out a nice transition but uh maybe the first one is as kind of all three of you uh you've been part of a bunch of dials and you've participated in governance or proposals or just even some creative use cases of these dials is there a wish list for how you want that software itself to get better like i'm sure there's more than just voting you need and if you look at something like aragon you have anywhere from financials in there to a member lists like what will be the wish list of the software to manage these types of organizations and what are your complaints on interacting with dallas right now i feel pretty good about software right now um you know combination of like in party does case it's like a token gated discord so it's like discord collab land snapshot for token weighted voting and a gnosis safe for um you know signing on and allocating funds to different things um i do think that multisig wallet software could get a lot better ability to bundle transactions would be really helpful um different consensus mechanisms that aren't just m of n signatures would be better because a lot of the time signers can be busy and so you can it can it can take like a week to like push funds out to something that actually like is urgent and even even really establish you know programs within d5 right now are like struggling with that even when there's millions of dollars on the line like it can take four days to try to do something you needed to do in 12 hours so i would just say like consent maybe just consensus mechanisms around multi-sig wallets would be the top thing but i think the biggest stuff with with dals i mean with the doubt the one dow that i'm in uh or the one thing that calls itself a doubt that i'm in is is more social problems than software problems i think like these these ideas around like what kind of process do we even invoke for making decisions still definitely does not feel like it's found like the optimal solution at all so social software i guess is what you call that um yeah i would say okay sorry i was just gonna say i would agree on the social piece i'm a little bit of a boomer um discord is not my not my favorite i mean i love it but i also kind of hate just like the constant discord chatter and so i always love a governance tool that did like a better job of integrating like how we talk about a topic that's not discord um yeah that's just yeah i was gonna say the same thing because it was uh like i'm in several dows and um they all use different forums and ways of communicating and so i'm just like constantly switching back and forth between all of these and just getting like so many random messages and it's really hard for me to to keep up and manage that so some way of of like social organization and be able to track that would be super helpful even even discord channel structure is not figured out like a big advocate for like a decisions channel where like decisions are being made and then breaking other things out separately but i feel like you know yeah there could be a much better discord template for for this type of thing maybe i'll this is probably a good thing to end on but uh because i the other question was going to get way too political it was actually a follow-up to what you're gonna end with john um i'll phrase the question we definitely don't have to answer it the question was um yeah right now i feel like we're at a point where it seems like everybody has to care equally for every doubt they're part of and and there's clear scalability uh sort of trade-offs there in terms of like how well does that evolve as an organization so like what are our actual better methods or do we think everything falls back to how i would say like existing parliament systems are set up in most places where you just delegate instead of individuals representing um their interests uh on their own i feel like that's a big theme that also was discussed on our chat here that's probably a panel on its own so we won't get into that but uh uh maybe uh i'll summarize all the responses to the last software question which is i feel like that was finally at a place where uh bundling does matter uh because you wanna now just care about things that you care about and not necessarily be part of every single message in the process of the day to day of operations so uh for all of you who are watching this and hacking this weekend uh that's an obvious idea to uh to go into and i'm sure there's gonna be hundreds of users just waiting immediately if you make something easy to consume so well we'll end up that and uh angel john and linda thank you so much for uh for this awesome panel thanks for having us yeah thank you thank you thanks linda from monday yes thank you awesome so with that we are ready for our final talk of today's summit and uh for this talk i'd like to welcome my pane the founder protocol labs and he's going to talk about open problems in web3 and kind of prefacing this by saying that there's so many interesting things happening in this space it is not as easy to build things that you would like just because of anywhere from information overflow to just complexity understanding the trade-offs so uh juan will talk about just why it's so hard and how we can make that a lot easier for everybody and without further ado please uh welcome there we go thank you so much thanks for the introduction and really awesome summit that is going on right now it's a really amazing conversation and it's been um just fantastic to hear all the different ideas that people are coming up with like just the uh conversation about dao's and how people are talking about participating in so many different dials uh now and and and so on um just really shows how how fast the entire space is moving and i'm here to talk about that about how um uh how to get started how to build new things uh and so on so what i figured i would um i would do in this talk is kind of give a sense of hey the opportunities in the space are massive and talk a bit about the challenges and the difficulties that you'll find as we um as you go and build your your new new things and then talk about how to how to solve those difficulties and how to um get uh how to lean on the community to to resolve that so yeah let me share my screen and then let's get going i think can you see that everything is great guessing yes great awesome uh so yeah let's talk about starting up in web 3. uh so the opportunities are massive and i want to dig into why the the landscape is pretty challenging and you're gonna run into all kinds of uh problems as you get get going and you start building and and uh there's a ton of complexity and so on and the good news is that we're here to help so the this is one of the most open and collaborative industries on the planet maybe the most open-ended collaborative industry in the planet and uh this is a really an amazing space where you can lean on so many other people that will just help you figure it out figure all kinds of problems out and so the you know almost no matter what challenge you're gonna encounter you can find somebody in the community community that's going to be um not only able to help you but super willing and and happy to help you so um the you know big opportunities hey there's gonna be a bunch of challenges don't worry about it we're here to help uh i wanted to just uh give a quick uh description of why web3 matters in a larger context i find it useful to always reflect on this because um uh it's very easy to get caught up on uh the kind of normal stuff that that uh is happening day to day or the current projects and so on and it's very useful to kind of keep a north north star on uh where the whole movement is going and why why um at the end of the day these platforms end up mattering so much so uh you can think of web3 as the next evolution of the internet uh and you know it's good to step back and reflect that in just 80 years computing has radically transformed humanity so today we have superpowers you and i can uh lean on superpowers that our parents and grandparents and ancestors would have never um imagined and and the fact that we're uh communicating live right now uh through this uh entire um uh just computational medium uh is amazing and so we're just a different species already than we were maybe even just 80 years ago um and this change is accelerating so just keep that keep that in mind now in this integrated computing environment with humans and and um uh just silicon computers and so on and robots uh this is just connecting billions of people and trillions of devices and we're learning new and better ways of organizing ourselves and actually i should update a slide it also includes probably millions maybe billions of organizations and now daos and other kinds of entities so this like highly integrated uh world brains or so to speak um is functioning through this computational medium and every year more and more and more stuff gets integrated and uh you know most of our activity now is riding through through the internet pipes and uh all of these different um applications give us superpowers and one of the one of my favorite things about the internet is that um an individual or a small group of people can get together design a thing design a superpower write some software design some um really good product uh interfaces bundle it up and deploy it to everybody around the world effectively for free and that's just a an amazing environment that yields all kinds of permissionless innovation and just this super fast-paced uh growth of possibilities and this you know broad-based deployment of these superpowers now there's a lot of people around the world that don't yet have access to to these amazing superpowers and that's a a prob an important problem to solve and go out there and increase increase access um and uh you know you can also go and deploy some new amazing power and kind of upgrade the the whole species and you know the the thing to keep in mind is that this change is accelerating and it's gonna go through a lot of different kind of interfaces that is that are going to change us even more so augmented reality virtual reality brain computer interfaces um robotics ai and agi and so on um are coming in the coming in the next decades and each one of those things will just convolve with everything that's on there right now and again change um our experiences and how we work and how we integrate and how we collaborate and so on um so we're on this like super fast-paced um uh technological evolution curve now and just you stay uh you know it's like a way that you have to serve um and you know one of the really important things here is for every single one of these technologies it's really important that um they go well and that you know we aim for really good outcomes for um for tons of people on the planet and they don't kind of yield a lot of powers for um for groups that will kind of abuse that power um or any kind of like this very lopsided um uh centralized way where that kind of yields control or some some kind of way that just massively advantages one group as opposed to uh as opposed to everybody so you know keep like work on building uh technologies that kind of aim for uh as many good outcomes as we can and it's gonna be pretty important to like just set yourself up so that you can do that and uh you know so one thing that i like doing is kind of uh it's so difficult to think about time and how quick technology changes that it's good to kind of put it on on a graph like this so that you can't just look back in the years and then think 80 years ahead and just kind of get a sense of just how much things are going to change over the coming decades um because it's just so easy to lose sight of how quickly everything's changing great so back to web3 so how does this all affect what three uh it as the next evolution of this amazing platform for deploying super powers what web3 is is doing at the end of the day is that it's adding verifiability to the network and it's making the read write web of web 2 um a thing that you can act trust because you have the ability to check correctness or create structures that just reduce the level of individual trust that you might have on an entity and so by by building kind of an anti-fragile system you you can now trust the system uh trusted system itself because of its verifiability and so that's at the end of the day the you know the core primitive that's being added and it's uh rewiring all kinds of things uh to just work uh in a more trustless uh way these are some of the prince a couple years ago i tried to kind of write down some of the principles of web3 and some set of values this is just one one stab at it i think a lot of people might add or disagree with some of these uh i recommend in the spirit of web3 make your own list and put it out there and and let's uh borrow from each other uh you use usually these values map to a specific set of technologies that you that you can think of as achieving that that value and you know it's cool to reflect on just how much is happening in web3 um it's it's still pretty small relative to web 2 and relative to the amount of users that that kind of global platforms uh have especially social networks and so on um but just there's just tons of projects and thousands of applications developing and so web3 is changing all kinds of things around the around the world already uh so progress is a group that is kind of working on this this deck and we're organized in a way that lets us work on a number of different projects and we are very open source oriented we try to build things um in a way that kind of our community oriented and and trying to uh just make everything super permissionless for everybody to work on so what i kind of wanted to share is some lessons that we've learned along the way in building our projects and um and also in how we can potentially be helpful to you along the way so uh just for background we work on things like lipidup ipfs um and so on great so back to the key messages um so let's dive into the opportunity as being massive right so uh the at the core of it is it's the software is eating law and when software eats law that means contracts all kinds of arrangements law underpins government so all of that is getting bundled into software um all financial transactions uh are flowing into this so you you went up and out sorry um we end up in a world where uh every single thing that you can represent in a in a normal legal contract or legal agreement is now up for grabs in terms of software and that changes the transaction cost it changes the deployment uh structures that changes the runtime execution environment like right now you have code now checking this so it means that so much about how humans operate is going to be eaten by by web3 and it's sort of this matter of time thing um it's a matter of time given a large and robust um developer community and builder community that is going to go out and make these things um but you can just sort of see this happening in waves uh you know every you know you'll see that every two three years just entirely new ranges of applications uh will and will come online that could just kind of keep on knocking um you know sets of sets of industries and so on and over time i feel like what this is sort of doing is it's creating this um uh internet jurisdiction where uh an internet first uh an international worldwide jurisdiction where you can build contracts you can build organizations you can govern and so on and there's so much that we have to do to figure this out and figure out how it works and how it interfaces with uh traditional governments and how it interfaces with uh and how it preserves rights for people and so on like we have no good notion of courts yet as an example um but there's but it's a super exciting environment and uh it's also really amazing that it's really easy to deploy and operate whole new mechanisms new contracting mechanisms different financial instruments incentive structures governance systems trustless businesses uh all of this kind of stuff is super simple to deploy you just have to design it construct the contracts and then ship them now there's a whole bunch of change management that you have to worry about but um the fact that it's that easy and that it's that permissionless and that you know you don't have to kind of convince a large group of parties to try something new is incredibly promising so we live in an environment where a group uh could decide to you know create something like ubi and try it out and build it and deploy it and now it's live but you don't have to go and convince all sorts of governments and so on that this is a good idea or that we should try it or that we should learn and so it just puts us in a place where we can experiment a lot and we can learn from those experiments and we can we can feed that back in itself and and improve all these systems um and kind of get away from this kind of stifled innovation environment where you know you can't you can't easily create new countries you can't easily create new uh economic structures you can't you know you can't like solve the the ills of of the current economic structures because um the innovation of that is just so locked down but in this environment you can and you can go and try things out and if they work at scale then they'll blow up pretty quickly right and so you can tinker with all of these uh mechanisms and instruments and so on um deploy them into the network if they really work then they'll that's a pretty pretty amazing um contribution and all of this is super open and permissionless it's international it's um all kind of remote first and so this is really the internet coming into its own um you know that all the kind of waves of innovation in the past in in in the development of the internet where kind of fail in comparison to this level of permissionless innovation remote first uh shared uh innovation and so on so this is part of what makes it so uh fast and um and promising and massive because so many people around the planet are coming up with new things um and convolving them with each other and so that's one other component part of why the opportunities are massive here is that everybody's building composable primitives everybody's building smaller and smaller things that have broader applicability and kind of our more robust components that then get pieced together into larger and larger solutions and this is you know one of the big successes of the all of the defy world is that composability the fact that you can compose these things and people can use them in ways that you didn't predict um or that maybe you predicted but you just didn't have time to build so many projects out there get stuck on you know these like super long road maps that are hard to make it through um because you know as a team you're you're limited in what you can do and so on and so if you make composable things then whoever wants to use it can go and kind of build the next thing and and so on so if you focus on composability and and uh then you're gonna build a much stronger um thing that many people can can build on and that will feed into kind of this explosive innovation because uh you'll make a thing that builds on other people's things then now people can go and convolve your thing with whatever they were building or the new things they might be building and so this kind of constant combination and compounding of innovation is part of what's making web3 move at a super accelerated pace i'm very like i've studied a lot of um uh kind of technological revolutions and so on and um and i've been in the crypto space for for a long time like basically since early um 10 11 is when i first like heard about bitcoin and so on um and just every year i get more impressed by how fast and how much more there is like the rabbit hole goes super deep and there's more and more and more stuff every year um and so the pace of which we're going is pretty breathtaking um and so many things that were kind of like really important two years ago are suddenly totally replaced by by new constructions and so on so you know i really encourage you to be to read nimble and figure out how to build composable primitives and uh you know keep keep uh surfing the wave this is like examples of like the device explosion and so on even in falcon like we're you know thinking about these composable primitives uh like kind of like this none of this has happened yet and it's like uh you know kind of around the corner it's like later this year people people will go out and build all these things um and so on and and yeah one of the other cool things to see is like these ecosystems can ramp up super quickly like just you deploy an incentive structure into the network and suddenly tons of people come out of uh of nowhere to um to be part of these systems and grow a massive amount of scale super fast so what's happening in in uh just the platform binding system is breathtaking like just examines the storage appearing out of uh you know in a super fast um uh speed that no cloud has ever assembled this much storage this fast um and you know tons of new applications and systems and so on being built and experimented on and so on so it's tons of explosion uh and so all of this is gonna go even faster as new uh networks deploy like new layer ones and and layer twos and so on uh as we get uh just much faster transaction throughputs um as we kind of connect all these networks with chains and so on uh sort of bridges and and and so on and so think of like all the composability across all of these things that people are building that's just kind of amplifying and magnifying over time now of course it's all kind of you know complex and we'll get to that in a moment so the challenges um opportunities are massive but this is a pretty challenging environment so there's just a ton of complexity stuff is happening all the time all over the place and it's just difficult to keep up with the information flow what everybody's doing and so on so just try to you know do your best to to uh stay abreast of what's going on but also kind of focus on your thing and deploy again your composable primitive and and move on from there uh so this is pretty complex software when you when you deploy so the contracts themselves and the mechanisms and so on might be small but when you think of those pieces composing with other things that just the complexity blows up and we don't have good tools to analyze this stuff or to reason about how these things are going to work uh once you kind of put together so this is in in great need of of new tools and so on to reason about how to build and deploy the software um but yeah so you'll have for now while we don't have those tools you'll have to navigate this individually you have to navigate this by by just applying very good software design principles and software engineering principles around uh managing the the deployment of these things and kind of reasoning about the the potential problems thankfully we've learned a lot now from all the exploits of the last you know decade so uh now teams are just a lot better at deploying much safer software than we used to uh this also yields complex products it's just difficult to use all of these components and it just gives users um this you know tons of opportunities and flexibility and so on which is difficult to learn and so part of what's going on with web3 and why it's difficult not that many people around the planet are are really using web 3 yet is because of this complexity of the product you have like layers and layers of power users like you you don't have you know power users and then kind of uh broader base consumers no it's like a large gradient with many different groups that understand deeper and deeper notions of complexity um and so you see this show up in like wallets and in um even like you jump into uh uh things like the central line and crypto voxels and um and there's just a lot of crypto native complexity there that just makes the the systems hard to access for um a lot of other people and so that means both that's a lot of product challenges for us to figure out how to um make all of these things more learnable more accessible and so on um but you know it's not about hiding the primitives it's about making the primitives easy to use and easy to learn and so on but you know this this just makes the products harder to build and then on top of that you're building economies and deploying economy so all the mechanisms that you're building you have to reason about how those are going to yield uh different types of behaviors and groups and so on and you have to worry about exploits and you have to worry about how to align incentives and all that kind of stuff so as you build these things you're now worrying about economic design which just adds this whole other layer of complexity to the picture uh then you're dealing with uh potentially building organizations that have never been built before directly on chain or in groups and so on so this just adds yet another layer of complexity where you have to now not only reason about the complexity of your software your product economy you're building but also the organizations that you're creating um and and sometimes implicit organizations that you didn't think were there because your economic structure yielded some you know kind of group that now is all sort of aligned in one sense and like that's sort of an implicit organization that becomes explicit pretty quickly so um you you have to think about uh minute managing these uh organizations uh and so on and there's also you know just super complex regulatory landscape because uh all of the stuff is new and you we're software seeing law and and finance and so that just um is a complex thing to navigate and it's international first there's no single kind of um regulatory space there's you have to worry about a lot of them and so that's just adds a lot of a lot of complexity and and um and it's just kind of uh hurdles that teams have to kind of reason about and worry about as they as they're building and then you know after you've handled all of these hurdles you now have to distribute to users and web3 stuff is unfortunately hard to distribute because all the traditional app stores uh want people to use their um their kind of distribution flow so mobile and um uh you know you know kind of infamously i guess uh uh apple and others were kind of like banning all kinds of things related to bitcoin or cryptocurrency or um they were it's just the deployment pathway is really really difficult um also the web is we're dealing with many new kinds of protocols so the distribution into browsers is difficult so this just makes uh gives a whole other hurdle of making these products accessible to a lot of people just being able to get them to users in a traditional uh uh simple way is is is a hurdle so you know a bunch of complexity however it's also mountable um and just remember that like the the space is moving blazingly placing really fast um and you know this is both a you know a benefit and a curse because a lot of things are changing quickly but it's also kind of a curse because you might be working on a thing and by the time you're done with it it might be irrelevant because some other thing has now emerged and replaced it or um uh or you're building a thing and suddenly this other new thing could have saved you tons of tons of work so um yeah keep up rest of the information uh you're also dealing with an environment with like super high super volatile markets and like that's difficult for organizations to deal with um we're constantly having to blaze new trails there's not a lot of organizations you can point to and say oh yeah we'll just kind of do things the way that that group did them i kind of like the web 2 world this was very common uh here it's just much harder with this innovation and complexity just you end up with so many new trails and whatnot and so over time you know there aren't a lot of good guys or best practices uh but these are getting you know starting to get built and this is something that encourages the community to to to invest in and and build is just better better guides for how to get going and then you know um open source is an amazing environment has lots of amazing good things there's also some bad things about working in in um you know kind of super public environments and so it just makes innovation more difficult and then now you can involve that with money and like that just creates all kinds of complex incentives and so like that's that's also a challenge you'll have to reason about and you know there's trolls and public problems and whatnot now the good news is that as you know again the opportunities are massive it is challenging but don't worry because the whole community is here to help so this is again one of the most open permissionless and friendly communities that that uh and industries uh ever assembled and there's just this amazing spirit of shared innovation and shared um building of everybody's kind of trying the principles of the movement are to kind of build these composable primitives for more people to work together through and that's just a phenomenal thing to to be a part of and to lean on like you you as a new builder uh can lean on all these other groups that have built things before and you can you can ask questions you can get answers you can get help you can get support you can get funding you can get all kinds of things that can help you get going and all you have to do is ask uh you just have to you know find groups that uh that understand what you're up to and can uh can help you and you can just ask for help and we're here uh we'll help you uh everyone's super busy everyone has everything a ton of things to do and yet we can all still take time to to help others out and kind of pay it forward for the people that helped us and um and you you know find i encourage you to find communities where you can do that so this is a lot of this is on discord and on different slacks and matrix and um you know different kind of environments like that so just hop on those channels uh if you aren't already participate and and over time kind of ask for help as you run ones and uh yeah so the there's a lot of resources that get developed and you can you can lean on um and there's a bunch of organizations also that are making it an explicit goal to help others get started and you know pl is one of those orgs there's um the ethereum foundation it's another one that that has just for many many years been helping a lot of other groups get started there's a bunch of other orgs around around that uh that are super helpful each global is a phenomenal organization that has just for years now uh been you know the best pathway for for helping developers enter into the ethereum community and the broader web 3 landscape and just making it way easier to understand how to build things creating an opportunities for people to get going and can't wait to oh for all of us to get together again in a hackathon um and you know speaking of that uh really use hackathons to get started this is like a great environment to learn a lot try things out build the thing see if it works uh meet other people see what other people are doing and just kind of get inspired to to build together and you'll just i think getting into into the practice of of hacking frequently enough is just like a a good thing to do and again uh support very open and collaborative communities lean on and others ask for help um and you know everybody who's who's uh building something today that that you can point to and kind of recognize and so on uh got a lot of help from other people before and so and everybody's always very good about paying it forward so you just again they might be rate limited with time and so on but um but you can usually find somebody who will be uh able to have the bandwidth to give you advice and support and so on and and you know there's also a ton of funding for for groups that are building new things so there's everything from grants to investments to whole accelerated programs uh now focusing on web3 um and so as you build things so you have this mindset of hey it's super cheap and easy to build things you can try things out in a hackathon if if one of these things has legs you can maybe get get some grants to get going and start um building a thing and then over time feed that into into an accelerator or something else and uh you know one of the really awesome things here is that unlike the web 2 space or the or the first web space most of the things being built um don't have to be kind of like a traditional company structure you can build dials you can build protocols you can build tools and say hey this is just a tool i'm building i need a grant for it and then i'm done and i move on to something else and that's possible in this environment in ways that you know the web 2 world never really allowed and so there's just this habit of community the community funding really good things that are valuable to everybody um in a way that you know you don't have to attach it to to a company or a business or something like that so just really think about um building valuable useful things that that uh that people want to use and uh and and you there there will be people around that that uh if it's useful to them they'll help you build it and they'll um you know help support you sometimes will join you and build it with you uh and sometimes they'll be able to fund it so yeah think of like this kind of like pathway of resources hackathons accelerators and you know kind of grants and investors depending on on whether you're building a business or um or not and uh you know really find the right fit for the thing you're building like many things should not be businesses and in the web 2 world they kind of turn into businesses and we're we're now we have a bunch of things that um weren't supposed to be businesses became businesses and now that all the incentives are wonky and so really encourage you to like you know form a business when it makes sense or format find some other funding structure when when that makes sense um and you know you you uh you know there's gonna be a lot of opportunities throughout the year and next year and so on so um you can use it to to build things you know one quick plug for how to reason about uh layer one economies think of them as kind of like export economies where like a whole group of people are aligned to participate in one way and you can think of kind of joining that community and that community um kind of all being aligned to help each other and support each other and you're kind of like a you know city state in a sense uh that's uh transacting in some some kind of way and uh producing creating some value creating some service that you're now exporting to the rest of the world uh in fact when we think of this as like we're building the the kind of like uh city state that that is providing commoditized uh digital storage for for the world and kind of like thinking about how to how to export that out to the to the rest of the world uh great so um yeah grants accelerators uh you can talk to us if if you need any any uh help with this uh and and you want uh resources a bunch of us will be around kind of through the hackathon uh and reach out um you can message us here uh by email but you can find me on facebook's like and i'm also on discord under the same username um but i'm on it less because the spam is just higher uh for me but uh yeah if i can be helpful uh don't worry uh reach out and it may take me a while to respond but i'll get to it eventually and uh and you can reach out to any folks from uh pl or fauceline or ipfs and and not any other communities that we're that we're building and and we'll try to help as much as you can and we're you know also starting to do these things of like you know providing office hours for some teams like if your team is kind of building a thing and we can be especially helpful then maybe we can we can give you some office hours for you to ask questions uh from us and and so on so maybe if this is of interest um you know after the hackathon if you want to kind of pursue the thing you're building um let us know and maybe we can we can figure out some way to actively help you more uh cool that's it thank you so much uh sorry if i went a bit over oh this is great um you never want to cut off good conversations um well this was super awesome and uh we do have a few questions and i feel like uh on the chat there they're handful of questions directly for for you um so this this may turn into an interview but um oh that's the first question the first question is uh just overall like what's uh what's a project or maybe a couple projects that you're particularly super excited about other than what you yourself are working on oh yeah um a ton of things so i think um i'm super maybe i'll just give you a couple so um super interested right now in a lot of the metaverse things and the kind of i see the nft world as a as an offshoot of the metaverse effort there's like this broader effort to build um you know kind of what is like the more physical instantiation of the internet um and and kind of how how do we connect as humans and more familiar ways uh and how do we engage with each other and so on like there are a bunch of different ways to do it um yeah so things like crypto voxels centerland um and other things like that i'm super super stoked by um and i think the whole nft explosion recently has been a super good example of how just you know you turn you turn something like that in the human world and hooked into the the legal system in in kind of normal legal jurisdictions in governments and you make it digital so you take property and you make it digital and then suddenly explosions like that can happen right it's like that's the first you know the first of many um it just happened to match really well to moving around 2d art uh and that you know really exploded and then it is now turning into 3d art and dynamic art and so on and now a lot of groups are thinking about how to use that to fund artists communities and funding science and so on there's a couple projects that i'm looking at around uh how to use things like nfts to help fund science science endeavors by creating kind of like art that's coupled to the to the science and that's just one example of like digital proper property um and kind of like an explosion around that there'll be so much more uh kind of like the next path here is like a way so kind of a bridge of kind of the normal energies that are happening now to the metaverse is i think like museums are going to be a big thing here so making museums where you can experience the art together uh as people so think of like a like a you know three environment where you can jump in and have galleries and and go experience it together and at first it's 2d art quickly it turns into 3d art and and interactive art and games and so on and like that i think that's like a smooth path to to building the the metaverse i'm also really excited about gather uh gather town is like super super cool i just wish it was way more crypto native uh it's not it's like kind of getting sucked into the webtoon world and and it really hooked quote it kind of like you know really becomes uh web3 native and and so on definitely go to a bank and gather town and do your lending and uh yeah exactly that's the real world you want to be in that's also in the universe that's awesome um maybe maybe one sort of meta question or more like a comment is just i i feel like one thing that uh when we talked that i noticed is that i i think um part of the challenges are just in a way understanding uh especially for a foreign ecosystem on uh kind of what things make sense to abstract um and kind of if you notice the trend of like what web 2 is it's that hey like we'll we'll take over all the cost or the overhead of anywhere from managing users to managing servers or whatever but you get this end product at the end and here it's like we're gonna flip that a little bit and you opt into what you would like to go go in on um do you think sort of i mean to me at least this is definitely one of the reasons why things have not evolved as fast because you obviously have to a lot more to do now but uh would you say like you kind of need that sort of abstraction for things to be more consumer-friendly or propagate a lot more or would you see that this is still a challenge to figure out we can sort of get there without compromising on or settling on what web 2 is yeah i mean i think um you know this this happens a lot of times it's on the projects and you know very practically um people are just so used to the traditional development pathways then that using things that are different is just so much harder um and there's just so much infrastructure in the web 2 world that that uh you want to be able to adapt or reuse if you can um so i think it's totally fine for projects to lean on those things just have good ways of establishing verifiability and decentralize them out right so um a good example for that is like we found that it was really really useful to um a lot of people building nfts to have a simple http api that they can kind of really use to kind of end to end manage like the whole upload process of an nft and kind of help help maintain it and so on so we we built a tool that a service that allows that um however the plan is to we have a pretty direct plan to decentralize that and to make it be an entire thing that works entirely on the chain now we're missing primitives that are not there yet so we can't like we're we're limiting by those primitives so now we have to build those and once they're there then we can like fully kind of get rid of this of us having to run this this infrastructure um and so i think you have to basically do both you have to not re-limit the products by by you know kind of not building the thing just build it as a crotch however um figure out the verifiability story make sure that it's trustless and make sure that you have a very fast path as fast as you can uh path to just making completely automated and decentralized and so the hurdle right now is like we don't have a good way to deploy software at scale um that uh you know you don't have like the equivalent of kind of um like this is what's called borg within google and turning into kubernetes or aws lambda or things like that you don't have a good way of shipping a little bit of stuff that is going to persist and and be scalable like where it's cheap computation and it's going to be there in it it's not going to leak information and you can trust that it's going to be correct like that doesn't exist yet so the smart contracts are just a small piece uh where like super expensive computation and so on and those will scale out over the next two or three years but we're still missing like this larger piece around this broader computational fabric that you can deploy any kind of uh computation into and you can trust that it's going to be correct you can trust that it's not going to leak information and like once that's there then all the standard web 2 stuff will just fit but i think i think this is about like two or three years out probably i i can totally see that i feel like we're finally gonna get the whole computer that we all promised uh which makes absolute sense um and i mean like um i absolutely agree i think uh there are kind of two paths here right but you can still offer that abstraction initially just to get people started and then you eventually sort of um in a way transition out and and nfd storage is a perfect example that you can appoint it to but also actually looking at this live stream we're streaming to live there and uh we got a simple rtmp url that kind of abstracts that for us but everything is still happening on our behalf in the background and that gets us really started immediately and it took us five minutes instead of five hours but then eventually we now are set up on a path to uh to have a more direct integration that we don't have to rely on necessarily a single um endpoint or point of failure right um so to me this is kind of how we do it you test it out hackathons are a perfect way to do this you kind of test something see if it works and then you kind of polish it up and continue improving it and then looking at the comments seems like uh we may see some web3 gather town implementation so hopefully for all of you that are listening awesome cool one two awesome i will just yeah that's right on that there's like this really cool behavior where if you if a group goes in in web 3 if a group goes and makes a thing and there's any part of it that is not kind of decentralized and they don't have like a good plan to do it and like they're not making progress on it or you know maybe they have a plan but they're not making progress on it because they have other things to do someone will go to it do it and like someone will go and replace you and we'll go and make that thing decentralized and so it's great like don't worry about it like just build a thing that works make it make something that people want make a good product figure out how you how you can make it verifiable and as decentralized as you can and whether you get to it or not someone will and it'll be fine and so like just going to focus on delivering value and making things that people do want composable primitives figure out what the interfaces are and then just kind of evolve the evolve the whole thing together and be open to the thing that you're building getting getting kind of like using what you didn't expect or um or or replaced by something else if if that other thing ends up being kind of closer to the to what people were looking for absolutely i think that's a perfect name to end on so uh we'll we'll uh close here and uh thank you so much for this amazing talk thank you so much we'll all find you and the rest of the protocol labs team on our discord and sometimes on slack and uh we'll continue the rest of the the event there so uh to everybody who stayed here till the end of all this all the talks um thank you so much i want to just quickly wrap up and say that this is what three weekend we just finished all of our summits and we have now the hackathon going on for all of today of tomorrow and until sunday morning so thanks again for protocol labs and uh happy hacking to everybody can't wait to see what everybody builds in the next 48 hours so see you all on sunday you
