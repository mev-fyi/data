so I work around our additional state so so we're in funding of projects under the sky breeze so we launched this in last year I mean what - mr. B 550 K money in 2019 correctly and distributed about 120 and we hope to on the next wave way - which is closing on Tuesday we hope to give back 200 K and grab money and they're given Irish in 25 K and 10 K chokes so if you are so at the moment so have the hackathon they're giving away $1000 and surprising Sunday under these categories anything that but if you're not successful on that you can also fight in general - okay I'm just gonna do by 10 minutes open it up to questions okay so why what's the objective we're supporting the ecosystem were supporting under under under partly and so the grants criteria so what kind of projects as I say under the categories so when they are submitted projects must benefit the wider ecosystem and they must be open source projects these are projects and if the project tests are the startup funding prior to applying to droughts will be rejected but that's them to say that once they get a grant and I give you an outline of like the application process so it takes like two months from you sending in your application and doing and I need the hackathons that were involved in so people which away I'm on some day you already got through the first round okay and see so make your application you reach out for interviews exactly acceptance notification and then you expect milestones with a mentor and we currently have about eight to ten mentors time we are onboarding more adventurous as we go and and then for the duration of the grant we usually last about three months that's what I'd like to say you got 25k joke it's three parts so you get your first part and then you you need to network to end my song check-ins we and the next parts about 25k or 10k it's distributed so they've got an idea of the advisory board that we have see the people kind of making decisions on some of the projects that are coming in and Jim is on earth is with consensus ter time and Antonia items as well so we have a like other board members so if you want to know any more questions I would suggest just taking a snapshot of this and another kind of lead you to any kind of like frequently asked questions that we usually get answer them so these are a couple of grantees that have already been awarded they were awarded I think back in May so gas station ribbon which is a healthcare and project and there's a guy here from themselves and he was access that he's he's gonna be brought on as their mentor which is great black girls code African up to developers and we fall under the category of Education and then like has and researchers and there's I think there's like another six projects done both sitting funders and you can go on to who the brown stuff senses calm to like that I wanted to meet the grantees alleviate downloaded like humans kind of like what's the type of projects are applying for the grants that have been an unsuccessful sorry partnering with get coin and to distribute the grant money as well it's just so just so you know and then also and as I said we have the thousands of dollars that we will be giving away on that tomorrow so is anybody here yeah and so yeah and then most importantly our way to applications is closing on Tuesday so if you want to get in or not that's great Neal kind of I get an answer a lot quicker then if you apply and Wednesday that'll be another like 10 weeks before you get kind of answers on much okay and if anyone wants to take a speech of that and agree to the applications so far I kind of want it cuz if people have a lot of questions usually about the grants program yeah so if you kind of look here so you can see like in the structure they've allocated a 200k for that a lot of the infrastructure projects it depends just really depends on what you want achieve in your milestones and what you need that money for and just twice kind of change so if they see me for 25 verses 2 times a so for instance and on the grantees so far and they've allocated 10 brac from watching developers versus a lot of like the heavy lifting on development goes out to 25 and I don't think so no it's not that he just the grunt so constantly usually yeah it might differ unlike where you are based we've had like applications like totally it's really like one place that we're getting and we're seeing so we're doing is are partnering moving with hackathons already written of a few applications there and they just keep on rolling in but it's maybe them Sydney Singapore they're coming from everywhere disgraceful yeah yeah checking yet so and when you agree on your milestones and the only real knot with your mentor so if your project is in healthcare for instance the Polish healthcare Network believe and then you layer menu in Korea many milestones that's how you get campaign like your jacket points that's what you say okay what I'm reaching this classroom no system and order to that object rats into those oh yeah absolutely oh yes over most this is all the most yeah so this one gets really important stuff it's kind you can reach places that don't get grant funding so that's why so do you want to see the sort of a business plan for return on investment or is this really I mean I just don't understand the judging how would you judge the big grant is work as opposed to another so they have a debt so at the start they like broke down the categories so infrastructures so they said okay well there's a need for infrastructure projects and that's why they allocated like a big chunk - okay - - and so they see a need to go buy it more and so projects coming and it goes through like different lab to different brands so well it just seems quite arbitrary so the judges sort of make up their mind and give it a category and it's a roll the dice whether you're going to get well you've got like a so there's like checkpoints at each friend and that they need to meet so the first friend will be let's just say kind of do a bit cold if there's not no links it's like the team doesn't seem legit if we feel that's you know the team doesn't have what it takes so yeah so you have to have a team was a true you know I'm team you cannot make one to two people or anything from one to like four people but you just can't have had something previous something what's the rejection rate tell me that so we had a BIOS so you got a bite it's my ten percent similar to like investments like temps between five and ten percent of applications gasps yeah [Music] yeah exactly so and so on this way this way too we went back to the previous application of a1 and so hey because they got feedback and with their applications and then they applied I think I've wanted two of them that came up through the ranks yes yeah like we're you know like we launched this last like late last year and so we are like holding it as well like as we go and it's not perfect because we're just kind of learning at each wave and what's the best I might bring it really and it comes on to like the committee members as well getting like stronger I mean okay like what's the need for this project was a real need for this project hopefully getting better and so I think I'm actually working on a telling more hero stories by the budgets that came out so that these are the types of things that are actually that's program on these are like my stories yes we had to use it or else oh right because I was like a sponsor okay so I came on the grants program by ten weeks ago so I'm like a bag like Whatcom what like pop rights is coming in and then but get grant money usually you write NYU argument like use that money for like so you okay well and step or allocate like 10k and we need to buy X range it's kind of fun so here you see 10k award of those funds transfer of some or something yeah yeah reporter yes so you so it'd be over three months open and personal you have your check in your mentor you might get goes yeah they're reaching their milestones these four more cut loose yeah well they may be that how it works is if you're not reaching your milestones and many members are kind of brought in to kind of help you through not sucking on the restitution see okay well why aren't you meeting the milestones and tracker again other mentors might be able to help you five minutes yeah what else Oh question what so we're figuring out that's our adventure day and what was kind of like what will happen is that there are we interesting projects that are coming head of Iran's program that will be interesting to Laos coming down the line and just bringing those projects to fruition a little bit more [Music] [Laughter] [Music] well that's why we couldn't partner with all the hacking months and so we could be MVP it could be you know so yeah part me just an idea we gonna have to show okay what if I'm gonna build this this is what I wanted to okay let's see you get some money dude so we have to keep the money the committee members the board members we brought in to try and get you over the line and it might not just you might not hit like after three months I'm like okay sorry to ask my question in a weird way thank you [Music] and I'm at the desk but my dear ego eyes and just so you know it's here from the consensus person I didn't come over here so we've got a cavity which is the education guys so that'd be yesterday that he was the question was there arrived just ping me on discourse and I'll make sure that they they know you're here and there is I believe he's probably heading to
