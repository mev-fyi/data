great welcome everybody um we have constantine here from protocol labs he's going to give a session on ipfs and coin and how it shapes the future of webtree uh feel free to add your questions to the chat and we can take them towards the end constantine i'll let you take the stage thank you a lot and welcome everyone from protocol lab site i am super excited to be here on hack money event and the next 13 minutes would be just amazing so first of all i'm all welcome you here on the session introduction to ibfs and filecoin and how they shape the future of web3 so to clear things up first of all like uh we are quite a huge organization you may know us under different names but we work with a community of people and organizations to build a better future through technology so you may know protocol labs which is an open source r d lab uh which is aiming to build protocols tools and services to improve the internet we also have our branch which is called filecoin foundation which are the stewards of the filecoin community and aspiring to put the power of humanity most important information back to the hands of everyone and most likely some of you are already familiar with such protocols as ipfs which is a peer-to-peer protocol making the web upgradable resilient and more open and filecoin which is a the most like the largest web free decentralized storage network that stores humanity most important information and today session would be consistent of five items which first i will go for the core concepts of ibfs and file coin then i will showcase you the tools for builders then i will uh provide you some ideas for your hackathon project if someone of you is still deciding or developing your project idea then i'll talk a little bit more about the possibilities of flip free and then i will proceed with a discussion and q a to answer the questions you have right now so feel free to also add all the questions to the chat right now and i will try to cover them all once i finish the main session but drop your questions at any point of time and coming to the topic of the core concepts of ipfs and filecoin uh these are the this is the development of the internet this is how our history progresses how we interact with the web first we started with the readout on the internet then there was a read and write the web 2.0 which you are most familiar with and we are slowly going towards web free i will not go into too much details what exactly web freeze let's justify that uh it's the next evolution of the web uh it makes web read write and trust where trust is being an operative thing and there it is achieved through verifiability and a whole bunch of underlying primitives and technology that builds up to it so we are all on these like two major sites transitioning from web 2 to web three and left two in our case as very centralized very disconnected uh internet with many many single points of failure with data monetization by the data analyst and we are trying to transition to a more decentralized and ideally distributed internet and by distributed i mean the internet where users power the services the internet which is censorship resistant which considers your privacy in the first place and at the same time the internet which is self-verified and non-silo data and how do we get to this amazing internet of the future which is on one side is resilient performance scalable secure efficient and many many other uh major words about how internet should be structured but this all is in our history uh show that being centralized and being single point of failures is always worse than being open peer-to-peer and communicated all across the network and as we proceed to exploring the free stack many of you are already developing some of the solutions for the web3 i would say that for the website stack uh verifiable data is one of the essential points to a truly distributed system on the image below you see that there are many many parts of that compose web free stack together you have the layer one change you have side chains you have development environment and file storage and many many more pieces that come together to create a web free which is resilient and accessible for everyone at any point of time ipfs and filecoin also contributes to this web free stack and not only we are highlighted in the file storages on this image this image is quite outdated we are also could be placed into the off chain data protocols as our ipfs filecoin solution is off chain data storage and i will also tell you that we are first of all we also our only one blockchain but we're also developing smart contracts which are coming later this year so that uh you can have all the smart contracts and evm compatible uh virtual machine as well on the final coin itself and in the next 25 minutes i will tell you more about files and folders and that believe me or not they're not as boring as you may think so let's start with an ipfs ipfs is interplanetary file system so you all are obviously familiar with file system itself which are just files and folders but what exactly is interplanetary interplanetary means that it is distributed on the first place that there is no central server and it is resilient and offline first uh why does that matter imagine uh we are expanding to different planets we as humanity grow start to colonize other planets and if you continue to use the same centralized solutions as we have right now in order to have some communication with an internet on mars for example whenever you request a file first the request has to travel all the way down to earth and then return backwards and this takes at least an hour for any kind of request so it's not a very scalable solution as soon as you start thinking about a gradable internet instead of that if you can create a solution where content is already fetched by someone else on mars and you can just request that content from him instead of requesting it directly from the centralized server on the earth that makes things way more convenient and you just need to have at least one copy somewhere close to you so that you can always retrieve it with regard without depending on a centralized solution and that's exactly what ipfs do ipfs is distributed by design there is no central authoritative service which is storing all the content rather a lot of nodes of ipfs network are storing bits and pieces of the content which you can request at any point of time so how ipfs works ipfs does multiple things and first of all it addresses the content by what it is instead of where it is and let me provide a great example for that imagine you're requesting a book from your friend just a regular physical book instead of him telling you what exactly book you have requested for maybe a recommendation to read he just tells you okay if you want this book you can just go to library you can go to the second floor you can go to the third book shelf and on the third row there will be a third book which is what you're looking for then you have to travel all this time you have to go to this library to the second floor to the bookshelf then you pick up a book and see that it is the same one as you have in the backpack all of the time and that's exactly what content addressing do it's the same thing where instead of telling you what you're looking for it tells you where it is and that's how for example our computers work right now where in order to find a file you need to provide a file password it's also the same way that web 2 operates right now where in order to find some content you go to a domain website you go to a path on this website and you go to index.html link where everything you're looking for is located ipfs replaces this uh whole structure with the content identifiers so what it does instead instead of pointing you to the address where a certain thing is located it provides you the content id which points exactly to the object which you're looking for and the beauty of it is that there is you don't need to know anymore where your content is located you can just ask this content id of over the whole network and the closest peer which has your content will provide it to you and let me explain you a little bit more how the content id exactly works so first of all content id is developed is designed to be just a cryptographic hash function which is implementing the existing sha 256 algorithm and it encrypts any uh not encrypts it transforms any object or content which you have for example a text file hello world into a content identifier which is associated with exactly this item and what does that mean is that for any content there is first of all created a unique cid content identifier you can imagine it as a unique fingerprint and it provides you with multiple functionalities first of all for every time you do the 256 on the same content it will be the same cid it's not dependent on itfs specifically anyone in the world can create the cid which will be the same for every content and you just need the original content to produce it from and the beauty of it is that you can also once you retrieve some file from the network you can verify that you retrieved what you were looking for on the first place so you can create and again the sha function on top of the content you have received and compare with what you have received in the first place if cid is not matching then there is some problems in the network in the first place and you know that you are dealing with untrustful system it also works with the folders in the same way it works for the files so folders in essence is just a special kind of a file which lists other files in it so all the core principles to remain the same to the folders you can create a cad for the folder as well and let me show you how it all works in a system so imagine you have multiple folders and multiple files inside of it you'll see on the image that there is and every folder and every image has an associated fingerprint with a different color it all will be a cad so it's a cryptographic hash function but all these are pointers to this specific content so on the first place you have two folders one contains three items and then the second one contains one item then you have a second folder which points to the two folders and then you have the root cad which points to the original folder in the system and to accommodate all this information we have the specific merkle dax which are good graph data structures and where each node is content addressed and you have cads all across the point so you can trace whenever you point to something and the beauty of designing a system like this is that whenever you create a new folder with the content which already exists on the network you create a folder by itself but the content to which it points inside is already existing so therefore first of all the c8ds will be the same and secondly you do not need to store the same information again in the network it will just point to the original nodes which already store the data by that you can first of all duplicate the internet so instead of storing hundreds and thousands of the same content all across the internet you can just store five to ten copies which will ensure a retrievability at any point of time and then securely delete all that other content and imagine that we have hundreds of thousand memes stored all across the internet and because they are addressed by the location we don't exactly know uh where they are stored we rather just know the location instead of that we can point to the exact cid of the meme and the duplicate and save a lot of storage for all the content being stored on the internet and you can also do the verifiability which i already told before so this is how it works in one single place on one single computer and that's that in order to create a system out of it we need to have first of all peers peer is a node and a peer-to-peer system which operates with the ipfs and we need to create a network of peers which is warm and in order for the system to work and in order for node to be part of the ipfs network it must be uh first of all discoverable so we need to be able to discover the node in the ipfs network we need to be able to point that certain node stores certain information and then we need to be able to root the node what that means is that we need to have a path from our personal node to the node we are looking for in order to have the ability to trace and retrieve the information from it these are two essential points of it but there are many more that comes in the peer and content browsing whenever you dive deeper into the how ipfs and generally peer-to-peer networks work secondly in order to also manage the content inside the systems there is the very smart idea of using distributed hash tables distributed hash table essentially stores or lists all the content which a certain group of peers is storing and you can imagine it as a very simple example of the phone book imagine you have a phone book where you store a name and a number as exactly on your phone but instead of maintaining it by yourself you maintain it with a group of friends and what that brings is it to you as benefit first of all you do not need to add duplicated solutions and if someone of your friends already added your friend's name or someone's from his friend's name you don't need to add it again but rather you just look through the [Music] phone book and retrieve the information which you are looking for and it is exactly the same how ipf network works in addition never we never store the whole dht table of all the content ipfs instead of doing so we maintain smaller distributed hash tables for a group of peers which are storing similar cids in the nearby location by that we reduce the effort to query the dht table but at the same time we allow to effectively locate where the content is located because we group the similar cads together and they are stored in a similar location so that we are always know where to ask by peer uh for certain content but we are not storing the whole dht table in one single file and we also enable all the peers in the network to do multiple things with the dht table by itself so first of all peers are able to add rows to the dht declaring which peer id provides with cid and we are also telling how to connect uh with the appear id peers can query the dht to find peer id and they can also query to find a certain content id by that the whole network is capable by itself to find the content over the network locate at which period is located and request a certain information that's how simple but also how generally peer-to-peer networks work and how to use that in the wild so let's say you have some content and you want to upload it in it to beer in a peer-to-peer network so that your content is stored reliably and accessible to you but at any point of time so but in general peer-to-peer network if there is no nodes there is no retrievability so who runs peer-to-peer nodes then why so first of all you can obviously run your own node and upload all the content to your ipf fast node you can run it very easily already browsers support natively some of the solutions or you can for example run ipfs desktop to do so but whenever you upload it to your ipfs node it's only stored locally how to and that's the same single point of failure so how to do that on scale you can run the network of nodes and uh you can also run an infrastructure to manage it you can also pay a pinning service to pin the content to the nodes uh such as pinata temporal and four other projects which are existing right now and lastly you can hope that your content becomes popular enough so that other nodes will benefit by their goodwill and does that sound to you that we are really in decentralized and reliable web free where we have to rely on someone's goodwill and trustworthiness to store the data and make it available to you not to me and that's exactly where the file coin comes into place the file coin incentivizes persistent and verifiable storage which is designed for web frame first of all it uses all the same uh properties of the cids which i was talking to you before so it's compatible with ipfs and web free in general it uses verifiable storage like cryptographic proofs so that every storage provider has actually to prove in every 24 hours that he still stores your content and it will be available to you whenever you request and it's also a self-managed solution with an open market of storage deals which ensures that the pricing of the storage is always as low as and as competitive as possible and it works quite simple so whenever you have an file on the ipfs network you can use it to create a file coin deal you provide the cid and in the open market uh storage providers that compete to store your data first of all you then make a file coin deal and file coin deal is a an agreement with a storage provider that he will store your data for the point for the duration of the time which you have agreed so you can first of all do multiples deal at the same time at least we are recommending using at least five deals and all of our storage helpers are using five deals minimal so that all your content is persistent over time and if something happens with one of the storage providers you can still find the content and retrieve it whenever you need you can also do the file coin deals repeatedly so that whenever you request a file and the duration of the deal is maximum 18 months you can renew the deal automatically so that this would be a duration of the storage for whatever timeline you need you can also do that in parallel with other solutions such as cloud or other permanent options available in the web but uh we are also agnostic to all the other storages and you can use directly from cloud to ipfs or any other solutions in parallel to ensure the redundancy and your content persistence and i would say that ipfs is truly loving file coin they are designed to work to be complement to each other ipfs is here for fast flexible retrieval it provides you with the gateway to the local nodes with browser accessibility and filecoin ensures the persistence of verifiability of your content on the network for the lifetime so summing up all that we have the ipfsn network working together about how to start with it and that's exactly where i will tell you about the tools for free which are available to you for ibfs and filecoin first of all uh there are multiple layers of web3 which are working and dependent on decentralized solutions first of all you somehow you have always some kind of front end which is traditional up to or newly emerging with free front end with web apps data solutions and nft apps then you have your smart or logic layer with standard application logic or smart contracts and then you come to the storage layer where all the content from the first two parts is stored and we always suggest to use storage helpers in order to work with ipfs and file coin nodes because they simplify a lot all the deal making process and generally managing the content on your behalf but at the same time gives you the flexibility of and uh easiness of two lines of code collaboration with the content by decentralized storage and first of all the solutions for many of you that might be one of the easiest jump start for your personal project on this hackathon we have the nft dot storage available for everyone where nft uh could be stored with two lines of code uh with a simple api and a very nice ui website and you can call the nft.storage to store any kind of content on the network it's also backed up five times in the ipfs and filecoin network by it and you get generate the ca id of the content on the fly with this solution the beauty of it that it's also completely free to use with read nft dot storage or nfts in general as a public good therefore it should be available to everyone at any point of time and we apply the same logic to the federal storage so you have the capacity of unlimited storage for any kind of nfts through ipfs and filecoin to store your content reliably through the lifetime of the content if you have a more generalized solution there is also available general free web web free dot storage it's also designed to be a general storage helper for file coin and ipfs network it has a similar interface to any keynote storage but it provides you with a production level storage and retrieval reliability plus performance you do all the same you have all the same interaction there is only two lines of code to change to store with dot storage solution you need just an api key and uh calls of the libraries and well web3d storage provides you with one terabyte of storage for free as well if you're working on the websites and you want to develop your website in decentralized manner and be independent of any specific uh cloud provider you can also do that with ipfs there is a flick hosting solution which provides you with the fast modern censorship proof website development and you can host web apps directly on the open web it works with the most modern frameworks such as docker gatsby react and many many more and simply the simple way to work with it is just to connect the github repository at the build settings and it will automatically deploy your website to ipfs and it will be backed by filecoin therefore you ensure that your website stays in a place regardless of the cloud providers and it's actually independent of one single point of failure which is amazing one last thing uh to highlight as a tool is power gate and it provides you with a wrapped container around the ipfs node plus file coin node it's a little bit more uh extended solution where you can manage your own stage store and trigger data information and it provides you the powerful ways to connect and instead p2p ipfs and filecoin solutions so if you're diving deeper into working with ipfs and filecoin have a look at this solution and feel free to use it and one more exciting thing to mention we are also making our effort to make filecoin verifiably sustainable so there is more information also on the far point green project which allows you to understand better how falcoid network uses the energy when storing your data and how green the energy is there is multiple consensus mechanisms involved which allows you to ensure that your data is stored in a green way and it's stored verifiably green and we provide you with different models and dashboards in order to trace that information so here is a little bit highlight of what tools can be used for you during this hackathon just a brief overlook feel free to scan the qr code right now and i will also provide that back in the channels on the ipfs discord oh sorry not an ipfs discord but on if that's uh a global discord and these are just the highlight of the tools so there is an nft.storage there is web3.storage there is flink there is textile powergate and there is lighthouse.storage solutions available to you at any point of time also a quick reminder that for our challenge is actually very very simple to use uh to participate in our challenge you just need to develop a solution which uses ipfs for content addressing and file coin for decentralized storage and you can use any of the previously mentioned tools that builds on top of ipfs and filecoin and you will qualify for our amazing prices and taking a bit of time in the end to also provide you with some ideas for the hackathon projects especially for those of you who haven't yet decided on what you're going to build there are many many ways how you can build with icfs and file coin together first of all you can continue or you can develop user and client interfaces with providing uh information and resources to end user and you can build that on a file point you can also develop smart contracts which are ensuring the decentralization of the logic layer and providing you the flexibility of operating the specific tools rather than relying on one single solution as a whole you can also develop with ipfs and falco in the computer and consensus layer have a look at libby2p uh libraries they provide you all needed tools for building your own solution for in a truly decentralized manner and we have libraries that allow you to do so on the flight with a very very easy way and you can also develop solutions for hardware and networking have a look at the cid gravity project and there are many more that comes into the place when you talk about ipfs and filecoin ecosystem to highlight that uh ipfs and filecoin is a scalable storage for the next one billion of nfts and the metaverse we see already huge potential and huge interest in building solutions for ticketing for gaming assets from music industry for videos ar vr there's also a load of storage for documents and co-ops and here are some of the project ideas which i think would be very valuable for the participants for example for this specific tac money project first three might be the most interesting for you but i also looking forward to see all kinds of projects from you on the submission so feel free to use your creativity but let's cover a few of those i definitely see there is a huge potential in managing the art and finances which happen in the background we can inbuilt into the nfts the royalty processes and smart contracts to manage the art managing exhibition lifetime network capitalization could all be powered by ifs filecoin and also be reliably stored through their lifetime you can also do an amazing work with dows uh dowels are booming right now but there are still lack of tooling to properly manage them so feel free to look into the solutions to govern and record dials most important information for the ipfs and file client there are much much more on the idea project and i hope that just gives you a little bit of oh this is also possible with us so whenever you have a question how to implement certain projects feel free to reach us on discord and we are more than happy to help you with brainstorming or uh helping you with developing your own solution within our ecosystem so then i will just highlight you a little bit of the possibilities which are coming together when you're joining our ecosystem and our ecosystem is the strongest asset in the growing file core network in web3 on one side we are seeing the rapidly expanding capacity storage of the network we have right now more than 4 000 storage providers across the globe and there is more than 18 xp bytes of total storage capacity available for you and on the other side we see an increase in demand of explosively growing ecosystem with more than 330 startups from pre-speed to series d and there is more than 9000 developers contributing to our project at any point of time all across the world and ipfs and filecoin is more than just storage we are also developing solutions for the compute layer of the file clone we are enabling programmability via filecoin virtual machine which will be an evm compatible solution and there is more coming that to that closer to the end of the year feel free to follow our updates and we also you know developing solutions to ensure verifiable the file coin is operating completely green and sustainable and all this come to build a sustainable foundation of the web free so we are looking for your contributions to the jointly developed projects on ipfs and filecoin as we're quite sharp on time right now i'll just highlight some of the projects which are already using ipfs and filecoin there is a variety of projects and applications which you can find for me the most personally exciting projects are some which are internet archive we are actually backing up the whole internet archive right now so that all the content and most humanities important data is available to you at any point of time there's an amazing and valuable project by styling lab which ensures that uh historical events such as holocaust information is persistently stored and reliably accessible to any human on this planet there's also practical applications such as huddle audios for music or live beer for video streaming and we have some uh interesting applications on the real world on the uh open data from the cities for example we are collaborating right now with the new york city on storing all the open data together with ipfs and final coin and when it comes to the nfts and general applications we are also in the background of all of the solutions that uh use nft marketplaces for example openc is also developed by ff supported by the fsn file clone to sum it up webfree is an amazing opportunity to develop your own project and there are multiple components that brings together the web free first of all the decentralized solution the centralized web it's blockchain it's linked data and fairly the best way to predict the future is to create it i truly aligned here with ellen k and i wish you all good luck on this hackathon build your projects don't be shy and make sure that you're excited all the way through the hackathon so i'm wishing you all good luck and just to come closer to the discussion and the q a feel free to join our ecosystem there is a discord and stack available for you at any point of time and if you're building uh our projects in our ecosystem feel free to ask any questions in the slack and also in file coin slack with the field builders after you continue with the project development there is also micro grants and grant support available and we are also supporting the ecosystem with a bit by being a developer and sponsor of many projects and by investing them on the stages of uh during the different stages of foundation of a startup so once again i'm super excited to see your projects thank you a lot for attention and i will now drop uh to the question part of our talk and as i see now some of the questions is it okay that we are i will spend a bit of time to the questions as well yeah we can spend a few minutes on the questions and then we'll move it over to discord after um just because we are running out of time um but yeah you try to take as many as you can quickly and then uh any questions anyone has they could take over the discord channel we have amazing thank you a lot then yeah totally i will share the slides about it in the discord afterwards and uh yeah excited to see people working with ipfs and file coin i know that there are many many people who are using it from project to project and definitely uh uh looking forward to your project submissions after on the end the next question was who pays the money for file coin i'm not sure exactly what this points for but as you see for the whole ecosystem there is definitely an interest in file coin and in this general data layer of the network and we are designed to be agnostic to uh whatever systems available on interns so anyone can freely plug and use ipfs and filecoin without any demand uh one more question was is it possible to make temporary user profiles in the ipf class that can be used as the authentication for user sign-in with nft token address so it will stop from the same user from signing in multiple times on the depths ipfs essentially is designed to be a storage player if i understand the question correctly but you can use cads as pointers to specific users or to specific nfts so any nft units internally is a cid pointer which for example openc or any other solution uses so this cid becomes your pointer to the content if you can if you want to use that the same solution to the user profiles you can freely do that as well so uh i think there is a lot of opportunities how to implement use the profiles within ipfs though you need to keep in mind that cid is always unique to the content so if you want to update your profile or do some different solutions on top of the user profiles then you have to keep in mind that cid will be changing and i think that was it on the question side so i'm also super happy to give back to the stage and thank you all once again for the attention and i'm looking forward to the amazing hackathon and your submissions good luck great thank you constantine uh thank you for everyone for joining us i'm sure it was very informative because a lot of people are going to be interested in uh incorporating ipfs and filecoin into their projects we do have another talk starting at 12 o'clock eastern time with redstone unlocking d5 potential using redstone cost efficient custom oracles if you do have any questions regarding this talk you can take it over to discord and the team will be happy to help thank you everyone for joining us thank you constantine thank you a lot as well it's an amazing stage have a
