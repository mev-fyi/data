all right says we're live if somebody would like to let's double-check that [Music] bear with us for one moment there is a slight delay so it might take a second yes looks like we're live all right exciting we're all here we've got a bunch of people from past eath global projects I'm excited to hear from them for anybody who's in the Xoom call remember to just stay muted until the end when we are actually gonna have time for questions and yeah if you want to put your video on please do then I can wave at you you can wave back it'll be great all right we'll start if anybody's anybody's on the zoom call see this double peace son who I've almost got everybody all right we'll do that again later cool awesome so let's jump into this this where are we going share screen I'm gonna present all right so we're on the first slide everybody can see that thumbs up if you can awesome so everybody in zoom and I see we've got some people who are stuck they can't get in somebody can just double check the discord channel and drop them a link to the YouTube stream that would be very helpful again welcome everybody who's in the zoom and on the YouTube stream we're very happy that you joined us today we are gonna go through four projects three from eath London UK ZK recovery lurch and laser blazar we'll find out and set protocol which is from the very first eath Waterloo so again super excited let's get to it if you don't know we are eath global we've run a bunch of events over the past few years around the world and this is kind of a retrospective on a few of them digging into some of the winners what they've done what they experienced and the things that they've learned however right now this is our first online event that were this is this content is tied to it's called hack money you go to hackathon dot money we'd love to have you apply it's a 30 day virtual hackathon for anybody around the world it's not just one specific city so if you're interested in defy in theory 'm in changing how money works please go apply ASAP we've already got a ton of people and we but we'd love to have more it starts April 24th but you got to make sure to apply by April 19 yeah it's gonna be really really awesome we're excited to do our first online event so without further ado I'm gonna hand it over to Tom Makoto and Yanis and they're gonna talk about their project take it away alright thanks Prince look I've I'm Tom I'm here with the Makoto and Yanis and together we were involved in a decade social recovery hack East London there's a really really cool event so what it's like a social recovery so the basic idea was that increasingly you get the smart contract wallets where you can use them to store your funds you can use them to do all sorts of stuff but least to my control wallets another private key associated with them or some secret bit of information that you need to access these wallets and they have this feature social recovery which means that if you lose access to your wallet you can ahead of time have enabled these so-called guardians who have special privilege to restore your account for you but this all occurs publicly at the moment and so we wanted to make this private because we thought it was a potential security and privacy risk so today in these 10 minutes we're going to chat through basically what it does the tools we used advice that we've got other hackers that are in our position in hack money and basically how you can try these things out so I think I'm gonna hand over to Yanis first and Yanis is going to talk through who basically what the hack is and what the whole concept of psychosocial recovery is so Yanis if you want to take it away you should be on this call you good Yanis so Yanis is stuck in the waiting room i think i think he's having zoom problems [Music] you could see he sees one in the waiting room trent if no i can just take over let me double check so we wait the Yang's to get a maybe I can give a bit of context about how we formed a team in the other stuff yeah go for it yeah so again I like three of us so yeah this is from company called model is who provide a wallet and and Tom is from Aztec who's like she knows expert in all these privacy really technology and I'm I walk on the ENS and back so like I tend to have like a walk on the app we she is very that user-facing so like it all three of us like we both all based in London and we often kind of meeting meet up call a lot doing same code up which is like unlike normally same meetup which is a kind of mix child like a developer non-developer investor this purely focus on the coding side so we basically goes to monoliths office and we just have be a pizza and then we just show that everybody's code or just talk about code so highly focus on that so prior to that like I think this problem is kind of related to that not a problem yeah nice hat is the anything yep yeah I just admitted everybody so hopefully yeah so probably was the giant giant probably can't talk about what problem they are facing yeah but leading up to that I just wanna prep for the meet that we actually have a small gathering that guy I think a week before the East London and where I can we brought a couple with people so like a London there's lots of like it good like the same company but also people who cruise I think a headquarter is knowing London by some developers I'm working so we had a week before we had a Rachel from three box and we also had a my colleague of a kick back around who had a new tool like no cord kind of UI generation tool so I can we we brought these two and I think yeah I think Aztec did a big showcase of their technology so we had a kind of good head start that we we brought some local companies to talk about their toolset so that's how we got we we did the end and they Bob ahead of the time yeah so Yanis can you hear us right now if not we'll just crack on yeah Yanis is okay I can you can't all right cool all right Yanis you wanna take it away I mean I will talk a bit about a smart controller let's because this this is a starting point and just as a meme like what's the use of programmable money if we can't have programmable wallets so they're very useful and you can implement a bunch of things with those with those wallets like you can set a daily spend limit in case your key gets compromised so the attacker cannot steal your funds in one transaction you can set whitelisted address key so you can bypass this limit and when your key is compromised you can send your funds to those addresses that you trust you can have Native integrations with other ducks or you can have meta transactions you can even pay with your tokens instead of fees for gas and this car has also like huge implications or actually you can set multiple transactions with one signature and discuss like huge implications for you XO I absolutely believe that smart controllers is the future and one of the most important things that they provide is that you can have recovery a recovery mechanism so in order if you lose your key at some point you didn't back it up you lost your seat phrase or whatever you can have preset something like a mechanism that you can recover and so you don't lose your funds there one of the ways you can do it is the so called social recovery where you have a bunch of friends or rather addresses I mean in theory there are friends or people you trust but in reality it can be your ledger or your cold storage and by setting the module here we use the term Guardian which is introduced mainly by Alton which use this form of our social recovery and you can use them in the future to recover your wallet but there is a cat rat so once you recover everybody knows you're your guardian address your recovery address and maybe this is your secret the cold storage as I said before and you have fun so nobody needs to know and even if it's a friend of yours nobody needs to know what kind of assets this address holds or what kind of transaction it has done in the past EMM oh here there should be a way we wanted to find a way to make these private so nobody can actually see who your actual Gargan is and so zero knowledge proof proves to the rescue and I think Tom will talk about this now yeah exactly so the whole idea is to keep the Guardian private so normally these smart controllers work by they store on chain these guardian addresses so rather than doing that we take a hash with Garden doesn't store that on chain because as long as you believe in some basic cryptographic assumptions you can't back out the inputs that Guardian to that hash on chain and then if the kind of a guardian comes along and wants to restore access to a user's wallet then that kind of the Guardian has to submit a zoanoids proof saying that they know the address that hashes to this thing stored on chain and the idea is that only a valid guardian is going to know that they're acting as a guardian on behalf of another user and so only a valid guardian is going to be able to construct a correct so noise proof that will pass the whole idea is illinois's proof is that you can prove to someone else that you know something secret without revealing this something secret so that's the gist of how it works and so if we move on we're going to talk a bit about the tools and I think this is a good place for mocoso to talk about how we built our UI because there's various components to this we have a smart contract wallet that has this illinois's functionality we have what the UI to it which allows the user to easily interact with it and Makoto was quite was the man working on the UM we use quiet and nice in the mid tip tools so if we move to the next slide and then start going through how we actually put us together and so do you wanna take away talk about soul UI so yeah so saw to is actually developed by one my colleague the kickback but like it's separate project but what is it's one diesel horn or called tool embalming I think there's already popular ones such as that zero or maybe s field is some of these like you know or building that tools there for people we saw you can build in UI we start non-coding and I think the difference is for something like this build hero are mostly cater for someone who don't know programming so it's like very visual kind of orientated like you know you might on a drag-and-drop kind of stuff where is this soil UI is more more for the developers like especially small contract developers whose very very good at maths and stuff but they suck at like design and all the stuff so quite often in the hackathon like a they do amazing stuff but demo gets where the he leaves a judge is like you know people do everything in come online and the stuff so like this one basically takes Jason like a bi of the SmartPoint job and there it's kind of extended I think a bi but agree husband everything is Jason and you can kind of specify that input what kind of coin smart quadratic cost and how you output and everything is JSON power and once you define it it it kind of automatically generates a UI for years so it's it's a tool for kind of back-end smoke on chart developers if you don't find a teammate who's who's good I like the front-end or CSS I highly man check out saw you I so like that I think I knew the basic how you want because of the meetup I get a week before by I started using the tool from that day and I think about our ability to get up to speed and that actually just finished or most of holding in one hour so they the rest of the time we're just trying to find a like logo also practice that's pretty excited yeah cool so yeah and then they'll totally Socrates a case now type stuff and then your standard suite of like truffle ganache et cetera for developing smart contracts so just to wrap things up so if we were gonna do this again some advice that we might have if we're going to take this on so basically aim to do the simplest thing possible first because without saying try build the sort of minimum bit minimal building block from which you can build on and say thanks forward it's only a hug fun you don't have that much time and then something else that's really cool and really important is that the mentors that you've got has the mentors are so resourceful and have such a wide range of experience that can really help to sort of supercharge what you're trying to do and it can really help build you up to speak quite quickly as are the hackers so if we just jump to the next slide the final slide so you go try out what we built you can just go to our github and clone and play around you can experience all UI and go through what the UI looks like and play around with it so yeah so that says okay social recovery me Yonex and Makoto so yeah sorry one thing about one piece of advice because I often do the mentoring on the hacker so the one thing I definitely ask everybody to do is in a very beginning before you start coding you go to the channel and they asked like kind of talk about the idea to that kind of meant as fast because that kind of they give you the perspective from self party with whether that the idea it's gonna actually fits in a context of hacker so quite often when I get judged like it that especially like it's kind of I don't know how you guys have a bounties or something as a bounty provider we have some sort of expectation and someone come up is completely labor hack if they they come to us before like our very beginning and talk about the idea we know like you guys have become under my radar so it's a lot easier to help so like I definitely recommend that you start engaging like not towards like a couple days before like you know we can hackers only happen in the last 30 minutes but in this 30 days like definitely start becoming people to start engaging in a very very beginning just to validate the idea which members okay awesome thank you so much that was a really good info all right we're ready to move on to the next project there'll be time at the end for additional questions or context from from the teams alright so before we move to the next one I'm sorry the the YouTube stream can't see this I don't think but let's do cover number one I everybody so the speakers can see you're paying attention awesome alright here we go next is lurch take it away Richard hello can you mean excellent excellent so yes I wasn't really planning to give a whole ten inch steel now I'm more of a question/answer type person but basically I'll give an overview of what lurch was who's from the East London hackathon that happened fairly recently I mean basically it's D Val for etherium you can imagine it allows you to run your contracts but on aetherium which in of itself sounds kind of useless but unless you do cool things because if you are running the etherium contract yourself inside this type of environment you can do really weird things like hijacked addresses or yeah it's very hard to explain so again it's more of a Q&A type style thing I think it's better but I will give you how do I like have everything on this slide yeah so yeah there we go I'll just give a quick use case of something I did afterwards which was routed so this is just a short demo to demonstrate the types of things you can do but it is basically if you're familiar with aetherium when you deploy a contract you have some byte code and when this byte code runs the result will be your contract was deployed to the network so routed it lets you deploy the same deploy different contracts to the same address so you can deploy some contract use it for awhile decide you don't like it anymore have it self-destruct and if you use rooted then it deploys brand-new byte code at the exact same address which may or may not be something you want to do depends on the situation it's more of a proof-of-concept just a weird interesting thing you can do now that we have something like eval be without you without lurch or something similar to it you simply can't do this there's other ways to accomplish things that are similar to it but the nice thing with with fruit is you literally require not a zero lines of code needed change in your existing contract you can just take somebody else's transaction and run it through lurch as well to deploy their contract yes so that's kind of in a nutshell the types of things you knew oh go back one word second we had ones like I didn't know how much I just followed the the the previous person had it added one slide so I thought I'll add one slide so basically some other ideas that you could do with this you could execute our retreat you can imagine for example you have an exchange you want to elect people give byte codes to actually run on your exchange maybe you want to allow them to purchase X of X units of die and then they want to purchase the square root of x of s die or sire or whatever that sort of crazy stuff you can actually just let them run their own code inside your contract kind of like a delegate call but you can block things that are state changing for example so you could actually have a safe way to let people eval inside your contract otherwise you could do cool things like store data somewhere else yeah it's kind of a weird idea I don't hopefully they'll be more questions that will help refine possible uses for this sort of thing and also there's some cool ideas around debugging I've been kind of playing with you can imagine I can actually run if you have a transaction scaling on on the network you could actually execute that on the main net with hooks in place that would do things like log whenever you're storing something so even a failed transaction it still produces a result that doesn't work but at least tells you what went wrong what went wrong that's real idea so that's really oh I guess so in terms of like great there's a bunch of questions over here as well that we're kind of like guidance for what we should cover I'm so basic concept the tools so one reason why I wanted this is so this is entirely written assembly I recently prior to this written an assembler for EVM but I wanted to kind of like stress test it so that was kind of another reason to write a very assembly having you project and basically in the first like 12 hours of the hackathon this found so many bugs I spent the first half of the hackathon just fixing the assembler so that I could actually compile lurch so it was really good test case for that it did that part of the job very well and that's all part of me theories Jas so feel free to like just use that now I think all the kinks are ironed out because this was a fairly comprehensive project I'm very free yes for the assembly EVM sorry just reading through this so you have blockers pitfalls that was kind of it but one thing you could mention is so you're working as a working as a solo going on your own you don't have a teammate so what was that experience like do you typically work on your own or was it just for this event so this is the first event I worked on by myself for quite a while My partner and I usually go to these things but she's teaching blockchain in Toronto so if she couldn't come out this time yeah it was definitely I would say it is definitely nice having that other person as long as you get along well with them I think that's an important thing as well having teammates you get along with I would usually probably try picking the teammates before you pick the project or that sort of thing I know it's not always possible once you get there you you know especially if you're not if you're new to this space or whatever so I mean I'm not discouraging that but if you know people it's got like roommates if you want to pick your roommates before you get the house rather than move into a place and get your roommates it's definitely nice having that but even if you have complete strangers for partners it still gives you that like morale boost or that sense of community or when it's like 3 a.m. and you're tired and nothing's working the misery loves company thing really kicks in and you can both just kind of like wallow together until someone like rubber duck sit and like oh that's the problem we forgot to semicolon or whatever and then the world was off to the races again and also just having a second set of eyes the reason why I say semicolon in assembly the semicolon is a comment in JavaScript the semicolon just ends the current statement so trying to send me : JavaScript code doesn't do it you expect it to do yes if you're expecting it to be a comment so it's just having a second set of eyes to to tell you you're being an idiot because again it is now it's 5:00 a.m. and you're really tired and things that aren't working any better than they were two hours ago were they working no better but different working differently so yes I would prefer having people yes it's a good point otherwise that's I think basically what I have the other question e things you have or otherwise we can just move on to the next person looks like well as a question in the comment I can her in the chat I'll just read it to you oh sure can you say any more about contracts of arbitrary size it's an issue I've been running into recently ah sure so one thing you could do with lurch I mean it's probably not the most efficient way to do it but if you're familiar so just actually the weekend before I did this project somebody was talking about something called the diamond pattern which I believe is the idea we have a contract which is gonna have a list of like vetted contracts and when you call it that that route contract it's going to dispatch out to using a call delegate to one of those other contracts which represents some of the functionality I think it can go a lot further as well but with something like lurch for example you could actually just have one simple one simple central contract which has lurch built into it and you can actually give it the operations you want to execute you can just give it like for example you can imagine at the high level if you're familiar JavaScript imagine you have some function that's basically like a repla you're gonna give it some JavaScript and it's just going to execute it blindly obviously this isn't exactly what you want but what you can imagine is build that same contract but this time put a merkel route - of all the possible codes you want to be allowed to run and then when you receive a piece of code to eval you verify that it's in the you verify it belongs to that root hash and it does then you can execute blindly because it means that the author signed off on it I mean it's a little bit complicated and not the ideal way to do things probably but it's just an example of the type of thing you could do once you have eval I can literally just give you some code and you can run it as long as you have some way to vet that that code is something that the author intended to be executable then it's fine and you can also imagine really weird things where the code you submit to it is vetted it's proved that belong to the Merkel route but then as a result of that code executing it alters the Merkel group so you'd have something for example can only run once or that can add new function new functions to the to the Merkel group that sort of thing I don't know that really answered your question but you should also take a look at the diamond pattern because the similar type of idea it's just far more gas efficient because oh that's one thing which mentioned with lurch it costs a lot more gas because you're running a virtualized environment it has to execute the EVM it has to manage all the memory has to manage the PC so it costs I think well my deployments I've been seeing it cost about twice as much to deploy them so awesome yeah I'd encourage you guys to dig into that in the discord I'm sure it could be a lot more color given all right thank you Richard thank you or we move on here's our second check-in I want you to hold up an object that's within arm's reach that's not your cell phone I have a cat I'm gonna hold up my cat see what else other people hold up Mikoto has a water bottle a pen another water bottle the cats not entertained awesome thank you for playing along sorry YouTube stream we'll make sure to include this next time so you can actually see all right blazer are you ready yes take it away all right so I'm I'm Rafael blazer was actually called dodge at eath London and I think that the way that we that we presented it was a time warping machine where you can get your future money right now but what it actually is is a fixed rate fixed term lending protocol so a bit like compound or RV which was sponsoring the event except that instead of having to wait for your interest to accrue over time you can deposit your money and get your interest upfront and the trade-off being that you have to lock up your money for a certain amount of time so it's a soft lock which you can you can play around with and we actually built this in the in the demo but basically that's what we that's what we built and the the idea is that obviously right now in defy variable rate lending is the is king you know if you look at compound or or RV but there is that gap that's that's there with fixed rate fixed term lending which obviously in the in the in the centralized financial world is a really big plank of of what people do so you know there's always that constant question do I take out a fixed rate mortgage or a variable rate mortgage etc and you don't really have that in in defy so that's what we wanted to that's what we wanted to build something that as a team we we thought about cuz we we actually work on another project together so this was a side project but there's now turned into a full-blown project and so we knew each other quite well already in Coober on the call as well kubarz going to speak a little bit later as well about how he built it because because so we we talked about it for a while and then when we when we arrived at them we had a pretty good idea of what we need to what we need it to do the other cool thing about Dodge now called blazer is that when you deposit your money you lock it up for a specific amount of time you also receive what we call future tokens F tokens Oh F die or F and those tokens are fungible and tradable so you can if Alice puts down a hundred died deposit $100 err she'll get her interest upfront and she'll get a hundred F die which she can redeem for actual die at maturity and that she can transmit to Bob or Charlie or whatever so that's the basic idea if you want to move on so yeah this is what the the interface look like where you can just slide the amount that you want to deposit for how long and it calculates automatically how much interest it will give you and actually we built it on covin and it connected to the RV test net so RV for people who don't know what that is is a variable rate pool so deposit and borrow and you you get your interest accrues and actually the way that we we built the solution for the hackathon is that whenever you deposited your money we actually just funneled that into our V and our V is the one that was generating the interest and then when you redeem your or when you've got your F tokens you redeem them you basically had to hope that there was enough interest that had been generated on our V for you to get your principal back now what we're what we're doing with blazar is actually building that out into a much more robust solution whether the protocol can guarantee that you'll get your money your principle of your of your money of your deposit back exactly at the maturity date which is actually a hard problem to solve but for the hackathon it was good enough to develop it that way and demonstrate the proof of concept so now if if goodbye you have if your online will be cool is to explain how you built it because actually Cooper was the only developer the team and he pretty much built the whole thing well Loretta was designing the the interface and I was basically shitposting there is one one question real quick just a clarification on what you mean exactly by interest paid upfront yeah so if you put in let's say a hundred died then you'll get and the interest rate is 5% you'll get five die upfront plus 100 F die and so you can spend your your five die any way you want and your F die you can also actually transfer those but you can you can redeem them for actual die from the from the liquidity pool at the maturity that you chose so if you look at the slider right there it says you know you're looking it up for five months six months seven months whatever in some months time you'll be able to send your your f die to the to blazer and and get a hundred diet yeah I'm here I was part of the blader team and actually my first hackathon where when I was saying so as a developer and I totally agree with rechart having a second pair of I super helpful whenever you get back in your code that I recommend that have a team mate team developer and what else so seeing the most part us that for me was to pace myself and narrow down the list of features in order to have a working solution aimed for the Sunday morning and obviously any an integration is costly and integrating with stuff that you cannot run in a kind of a low cost and books like ABI protocol when we needed to integrate live deployment to actually being able to to get the real interest rate to change the state of the protocol etc was quite painful and at all early which gives you live debugging of tracks and I strongly recommend it to any any deaf apart from that it was a pretty typical stuck with with truffle with ganas testing a lot of testing especially around the compounding interest of the calculation and yes and view for for the front that which is super efficient commander actually you can move on to the next slide trail so and we'll come back cool Bevers actually can you move to the to the last to the next slide again yeah previous this line at the previous one no this one is good so cool bad I don't know if you missed anything there in terms of lessons learned on the development side yeah generally when we do hackathons cuz we've done quite a few in the past I'm always the guy because I don't have to develop it I'm always the guy who's who's trying to get cool bar and the other developers to just win as many bounties as possible and to integrate as much as possible which invariably you know on Sunday morning at 4:00 a.m. really makes them hate me because they don't want to do any more integrations and the traitor just make this stuff that they've already built just work and I've been on the receiving end of a lot of that definitely what I would say in terms of lessons learned is that the mentors especially in if London were really helpful and that was too many to figure out you know how to how to how to think about what we were developing and also figure out what where that gap in the market is and and how we're going to how we're going to do the pitch and just road test that pitch because if I if I do if I if I do have one word of advice I mean if global says don't worry about the pitch just do the working demo I'm not a big believer of that I think that the pitch is absolutely key and there's like it's happened to us before where we build like something that we think is amazing right and then you just arrive in the judging room on Sunday at 11:00 and for whatever reason the thing works you just can't explain it it's not crisp you've only got three minutes or whatever it is to presented so I actually wrote testing that pitch and doing it with as many people and getting input on that as you're doing it you don't necessarily need to do a presentation but we did we had a lot of memes and I was to try to keep it light and funny road-testing the pitch is actually quite good and if you just come back one slide Trent nope the one before that the one after that yeah so just really a high-level why we think we won definitely having a powerful story that's like that you know whether you're doing a hackathon or you're setting up a company or whatever having a story that makes sense and that resolves an actual problem is generally helpful because people get what you're trying to build having the working demo is obviously key and what we added on top like the the little sprinkle of magic was the the killer memes that we developed and again I say that because that was literally my job so I would say it but ya know everything helps basically to to try to tie the whole hack together awesome said it any questions for - slash blazer all right so it's good all right final final attention challenge there's a question in the chat trend oh sure I think that was oh so what is the minimum limit I don't know if you can see that Raphael it might be related what is the minimum limit so for that you have to separate out what we did at the hackathon and what we're what we're doing now right actually the the limit or the term limit of these deposits working on that's actually going to be defined by Dow and it's gonna be algorithmically set the the spot rate the spot fixed rate is going to be set algorithmically according to various parameters but at the at the hackathon it was unlimited it's basically it was a toy a toy hack and more of a proof-of-concept we're basically at the maturity date that you've set you putting in your F token sending them back will maybe give you the the exact principle or it may not but it was good enough to demonstrate how how this would work for for a hackathon and captured people's imagination yes I teacher if if you just wanna unmute self go ahead ask a question yeah hi thank you so my question was actually you know compound and all these protocols will actually you know give you interest based upon the block you know mining okay so basically every 15 seconds you will be a curing thickness so what you realize you know that was really amazing okay you will be getting the you know interest up front and what I was really excited about is you know on be based up on like more teammates like you have given up front and like what is the time interval that I should lock up my phone thing do you know yeah so that that's that's what I'm saying is basically the the setting of the maturity date or how long you lock up your your money is arbitrary you can choose it within a minimum and maximum that's set by the doubt which is what is going to happen but as I said there's difference between the full-blown solution which we're working on now and the hack where you can get away with just not having to solve that problem as long as then because that's the general question that we would get is we've got a lot of questions about you know the minimum lockup period how do you manage things if the variable rate switches on you flips on you and actually generates less than what you chrome it promised to the depositor and everything so there are always going to be limitations that you cannot address during the hack and it's important to also which is why road-testing the pitch is important you get all of those hard questions and really all you need to do during your pitch is to have plausible answers to that that will put everybody's mind at ease and that will help a lot to help you you know get considered for to be a finalist awesome yeah and so Ave is actually one of the sponsors for back money so I would encourage you guys to continue this conversation if you have any more questions just jump into the discord we have ston e there we have a bunch of team members I'm sure they'd love to hear these questions and answer them as well josh has a question but will we'll do that at the end with everybody together all right final attention check about everybody everybody make a mustache with their finger Wow oh no Jacob does cheating okay good there we go cool full participation on that one now further ado oops I went forward far we're moving on to set which was one of the projects at the very first eath global event Waterloo in 2017 you've probably familiar with it it's one of the most popular dphi projects today and it's it's evolved quite a bit since the hackathon project so Felix take it away and tell us what you what you've done since then sounds good for those of you who don't know me my name is Felix and I am the co-founder and CEO of set you may know us from some of our products like token sets which is one of the easiest ways to implement some sort of asset management strategy on your crypto but I'm super excited to be here today it's a bit of an irony that I'm here because I have never won I've never been a finalist in East Bobo hackathon and I've never won an e hackathon let alone win any kind of like sponsored prizes as well so I don't know if I deserve to be here and talk to everybody there you're welcome to us okay well all that I guess I suppose that's what matters and the spirit of this is that no we're kind of hacking and built and this is a great venue for experimenting and building new technologies and and and and pushing kind of the boundaries of the future rather than just kind of trying to win money or fame or glory so I mean I'd all I wanted to do kind of this session is just kind of share the story upset in particular with how it kind of evolved during each Waterloo and share the story of some of my experiences and and then and that's it so to begin you know I know the context of each Waterloo was it really was the the height of the ICO boom like this is when crypto prices were going up you had a new ICO project that was coming out every every day maybe even every hour and I had been most fascinated with the stuff around kind of finance on on on ethereum so I was fascinated by 0x Khyber era swap those were the projects that really captivated my mind and really what kind of blew my mind was when I read Antonio Giuliano's dy/dx white paper and he demonstrated that you can build sophisticated financial instruments using smart contracts so in addition to that I was I just completed consensus Academy which was consensuses kind of course where they fast-tracked everyone to being a proficient solidity developer no it was a program where they invited that there was 1,500 people that apply hundred people three people got in and the carrot on the stick to get you to finish was that they would fly you out to Dubai if you were one of the top kind of 75 kind of students in that class and in addition to that I was I actually left my job in July of 27 to focus on crypto I was reading white papers and really trying to make sure I understood kind of all the different concepts I was also investing you know in in different various projects at the time too and I was super excited to attend each Waterloo which was the first theorem hackathon and it was awesome because it was the first one many of the people I looked up to were sponsors or judges it was a lot of things it was free and many things were already taken care of for example know when you flew out there they know how to bus ready for you to drive you to the venue and everyone was buzzing with excitement so that was kind of the context in which I entered B through our Lewin I had originally planned to join a team that was going to work on a typescript version of web 3 it was something that didn't really exist before and I was excited to do that but on the on the plane ride over to eat Waterloo I was thinking about what was missing into space and I know being very excited about finance related stuff on a theory on I realized that no one was really building a fully decentralized index fund product and I no thought about how to implement that on the plane and by the time I landed I was so excited by this idea that when I got to Waterloo I had to tell my team that I was going to leave them to work on you know essentially what ended up becoming set on my own so they were obviously very disappointed that I I left the team and I was a bit nervous because I was going to work and hack on my own but I ended up being one of the most kind of amazing experiences I've had no ever and no I and it started coming with a specification on my own I didn't have any teammates and I was doing something very different because instead of building kind of on top of using some existing API or SDK I was writing solidity code and writing unit tests when most other hackers were just trying to integrate various api's or get just get something to work without testing so I you know started kind of implementing a solidity I was testing it using using truffle and and kind of the mocha the testing framework no there certainly were challenges along the way and I was getting stuck when trying to you know use you know open Zeppelin's kind of like the standard libraries but no when I got into any challenge it just happened that there was always kind of somebody there to help me and when I got stuck with the open zipper library it turned out you know manual Arras from open Zeppelin was there and I was able to just kind of go and talk to him and get some of my and he helped me actually he actually spent an hour to help me debug kind of why I'm like my unit test was failing at the time so as you can see there's like extremely amounts of technical talent available and and mentorship available come at these hackathons which was really great in addition since I wasn't working with the team I ended up just hanging out at the sponsor table and I was just hacking on my own but I was just sitting with a few folks that were friendly and we're helping to answer some my questions and it turned out I was sitting right next to I was at the Maker doubt table I didn't really know what maker dad was at the time I was like why would you create something called the die and why would you want stability but no Nick was there and he now is the head of kind of back in like services at maker and he had been super helpful and I was sitting kind of with stuck beer who was at the polymath table and he was helpful to you and you know I kind of worked through the night and these guys have been kind of sitting I got to know these folks well and and basically at 3m when I'm really tired like I've finally finished all the unit tests and the smart contract code and no I realized that I did not have a front-end so I ended up kind of like partnering with suck beer who was working on essentially a 0x exchange and I just tacked on a page on top of that so as you can see on the right here that's what the UI looks like and unsurprisingly that's why I did not win any prizes because it looks terrible and it doesn't really work that doesn't seem like it works at one most prizes are given out to know things that seem that you know seem to look good so I finished the hackathon and you know we presented this and I'll and you know when judging happened it was really cool because I got to present and from like Joe Lubin and a consensus I presented in front of like will war and at 0x and Linda Shane a number of all their really great kind of folks that had looked up to industry as well and I mean at the end of the day no I do not didn't make it to final this or anything like that but I was no I had a really kind of positive experience that 0x ended up giving me you know a consolidation prize like a few 0x tokens just for hacking on them but that was kind of the my experience with kind of sadly said eat more loot and go to next slide you know this is something that you know was just the beginning what I built at the hackathon was just a proof of concept and but it was something that I kept working on I think partly is because I was I was crazy but you know that's how most I guess big project start is that there isn't necessarily a rational reason for we're moving forward but you do it because you're passionate about it and you want to you want to Keith you want to see things through so what kept me going was a few things one is after eath waterloo had an opportunity to know like the carrot on the stick for consensus Academy was they fly you out to Dubai and pay for your whole trip so the hotel was free and the flight was free I'd never been to Dubai before and everybody who attended was super excited we no consensus at the time had partnered with the government of Dubai so like we actually participate in hackathon over there where we worked in essentially the White House of Dubai so that was really cool and we got to see the Emiratis and at the end of the event like people could share their own ideas of what they've been working on outside of the hackathon and I got the opportunity to present set to kind of a bunch of people at consensus including Joe Lubin and Jeremy Miller and they got so excited by what I was doing that they actually offered me and entrepreneur-in-residence position at consensus to keep working on set I know I was very flattered but ended up declining that you know a few kind of days later no deaf on three happened and I attended and it was also a very magical event as many people had a lot of money and the parties were really great but Willie for me I got to talk to a lot of other developers and people in the space and they validated the excitement that I have so I kept moving forward and then after that I started getting all my friends involved I would tell my friends what I'm working on and I would add them on so github and slack and we be working on set the nights and weekends and during the day just we know we started working on a user interface new we kept pushing on the smart contracts I started kind of putting together a white paper and by November of 2017 a few weeks a week and a half after Def Con we kind of announced what set was now and we put a proper medium post we had the whole kind of white paper to put together we even had a private kind of user interface and that was really what was the beginning of what's that was and that kind of resulted in us pushing and raising some venture capital in early 2018 and no and we've just been building out kind of the product and the scenes and the team since then and it has this has only started B I think in part because of Waterloo which was really the genesis of the initial proof of concept but since then as you can see there's been a lot more development in progress and we're proud to to be keep perfect pushing forward and to be able to kind of represent what can come out of a hackathon so yeah that's kind of it on my end hopefully that wasn't too much of a monologue it's perfect it's it's a fascinating story and I think it's great to see new projects coming out of something like eath London UK and then a project like yours which is years old now and you've built an entire team around it and you've really pushed forward that concept it's great to see all these different things so now we're gonna move to if anybody it doesn't have any questions for Felix all right so the first open discussion question is what would the teams have done differently if they had been doing an event like hack money versus a three-day work every hour type of event that the eath global events are kind of like where you don't have as much time why don't why don't we have the seek a recovery team start so the ZK recovery is just a like proof of concept at the moment it's definitely not a complete thing there are limitations to it on the depo so we would definitely had taken the time to definitely get it further out or just like the proof-of-concept show off this thing that you could potentially do and get it to a more finished sort of doc it's not be quite cool because especially with the like four week period I think that's plenty of time just sort of polished things together Yanis picasa and what do you think we would have done differently if we'd had more time say the same I would have slept more yeah we will have many more features I guess so but the overall approach would be the same I don't have a better answer to that but definitely it would be a completely different experience so I would like to have this experience and be able to develop something because if you have just Indian it's just two days and you're more or less sleepless you tend to rush things you tend to just try to make everything work but the thing in a three week period you can be more creative and I think it's even though you have to spend more time I think in the end it's more rewarding and you can build something much stronger much nicer and with greater potential I've got ten parts take it like a online hackathon maybe like two three times in the past and during that time I always hacked a loan because it's much easier to manage my time because like it you know it's a longer period so it's not like if it's weekend it's like all constrained and that you can do it working team even for don't like you know it you just form the team together whereas one months is very long to manage so even when you join a team quite often during one month time like even for the weekend hackathon quite often team won't to be put job back right I think one month period is even harder to keep motivation up and running so you want sense in the video treat take advantage because you could just like wake up until the ninth working I think yeah but I care so I think how to but at the same time it's one month I let me do it three times like the dentist times more resource oh I think how to for people who's forming the team how to manage I think yeah team for the longer period would be quite key I think oh that's that's awesome yeah it's definitely gonna be a different experience because you've got more time but you also have more time to manage right so we are almost exactly at three o'clock I'd love to keep talking with everybody does anybody have to leave at this time any of the speakers oh I need to run right now do you want to say anything quick before you run well good luck everybody Thank You Felix for presenting and sharing that story anybody else if we can stick around for a few minutes more if there are any questions in this room we still haven't heard from Richard and the Placer team so Richard if you want to just talk quickly about what you do have more time yeah so I guess at the first of all I would have spent a lot more time optimizing I'm a bit of a week but the week following the sack of Catan I spent all my time at ECC my spare time you know poking away pulling a little bit of gas out here in there to make a little more gas efficient and then I wrote routed last week out two weekends ago just as kind of a proof of concept so it would have optimized more and I would have made more use cases so people could see what was going on but to be honest I probably I should have picked a different project when for being just me just being me by myself I feel like for hackathons that are a weekend-long it's more fun to pick something strange and weird and unusual that I wouldn't otherwise like I wouldn't dedicate a month probably to do something like lurch but wasting a week on doing it just to see whether it works so it's yeah I can imagine having done something completely different if I if it was a month long or maybe building a much more thorough ecosystem on top of it but a month is a long time it's a I'm really curious to see what I could think it's come out of this yeah for sure we are - thank you blazer yes oh I mean from from my perspective is a long time I don't even know like that the thing about hackathons is that everything is so compressed and you have that time pressure and you just have to get it out and it's it's a great it's a great experience for a month I feel like we've been on a month-long hackathon since eat London trying to get the new iteration of blazar I guess from our perspective it probably gives more time to test out the actual product because you might actually finish it you know way in advance and you can you can start iterating on it I don't know what you guys think a ratio kuba time-pressured to have a working solution to the ticking cutter there mmm at the deadline at the stage that you're happy and not at the let's say the your desire and your for food either in the quality of cold comment etcetera where you can take yourself or a mouse definitely will have to have a more advanced design and cleaner crowd or so to give you a comfort of having greater and lower maintenance cost in the future because I have them cold it's always okay kinda forget you I'm sorry you need to unwind later yeah exactly for me the same hey we would be focusing more in UI UX would be asking people about the use cases how they would use it what the pain points are I even give it you know give it to try it out and give us feedback on either the code or the UI the UX more of them will have the opportunity to have more of a community building a community feedback looping if you like and engage you with everyone awesome yeah that's actually a really interesting idea maybe in the last week we could have a little demo like a prejudging demo session get some initial feedback if you haven't had any yet any any final thoughts from any of the teams or anybody on the zoom call I said one more quick thing I wanted to mention Stein was asking about arbitrary contract sizes what you could also do is store your entire contract in storage and then execute it through search so you could be rather than reading from code you could read so anyway it's just random idea for whoever had that question I think it was a will something feel 3d bug me afterwards cuz yeah then you can put a gigabyte worth of data on the blockchain and execute like a contract if you're really bored maybe try raphson or something affordable first yes that's all I had to say awesome this has been really really great because I hadn't heard some of these stories from past hackathons and really just interesting to hear the inside perspective from all the hackers so again thank you the presenters who made the time to talk about what they've done in the past and how they've continued to work on their projects this is really helpful you've all joined the discord already so I can't I can't show the discord but please do join and be active because you are the kind of people we want to be mentoring and just providing support for people they're gonna have questions and you've built something and you're the perfect people to get feedback like that I think that's it thank you everybody have a good rest of your day and this will be this has been recorded streamed live and you'll be able to watch it yourself again in a few minutes all right bye everybody thank you again apply to hack money Platt hack money join hack money everyone whose last
