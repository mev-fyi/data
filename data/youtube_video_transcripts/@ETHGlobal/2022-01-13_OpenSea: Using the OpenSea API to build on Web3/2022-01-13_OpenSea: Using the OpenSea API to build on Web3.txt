good to start so hello everyone um we have michael here from openc for his workshop using the openc api to build on web3 i'm super excited to have openc here at nft hacks 2022. uh and with that i'll hand off the mic to michael all right thank you anna um so welcome everybody um this is my first time leading this kind of workshop so if i'm rough around the edges i apologize but hopefully we'll get through this um and you can learn something about um building on openc um so really the goal of this workshop is to kind of introduce you to the setup tooling that we have available for developers um as a platform for openc um and less so about like the marketplace and the features that we have you know on the web app that regular users use today um we really we really want to inspire you to um build into that marketplace and utilize the things that we offer to you to create amazing and uh really interesting projects um so just kind of giving an overview about what we'll go over today um first we'll go over like an overview of what openc is why you should care about what openc is for those who don't know what openc is um and why it even makes sense to build on openc as a platform next we'll move on to um one of our two kind of tracks that we see developers falling under for as they use our platform which is as like a web developer app developer a lot of people are calling that web two versus web three um and then the second track that we have is kind of use it building on openc as a smart contract developer and these are the people that kind of create nft projects and launch them and then go on to like sell them on openc and you know how those two worlds can kind of intermingle um so just getting started um on like what at least my goals are for this presentation um at least what i'd like you to do as you know hackathoners here is to just build amazing cool things if you end up using our platform and our api and our sdk through that amazing i'm just you know personally speaking as a nerd i'd love to see some of the cool interesting things that you'd be building here um the second thing is i would love for you to ask me anything um i am very much so an open book about everything that is going on here at openc everything about my life if you care about my life um or anything that we could be doing um better and that kind of leads into number three which is um providing us with feedback um you know this company was not at the state that it was a year ago even um barely anybody knew what openc was and we obviously grew into this um really really big industry as a whole um and we're still learning we're still kind of trying to improve things we know not everything is perfect we're very aware of that um and we're trying to do better by that so the feedback that you provide us is really going to go a long way in helping us improve things specifically from a developer perspective because um that's something that's really one of our big goals this year is to really improve our platform for developers so that they can build on top of us so going into what is open c um i kind of wanted to provide a little bit of an overview in case people aren't familiar but openc is the world's first and largest uh marketplace for nfds it was started in 2017 by david finzer devin finzer and alex attala and the really their goal at the time was to and still is is to become the horizontal marketplace um which is the most inclusive marketplace of all digital goods today they're known as nfts that any project can integrate with and that was really important as a as a goal for open seas to become really horizontal and not really pick a lane when it comes to which projects can kind of get listed and that led to openc becoming a little bit of an index and the largest data set of nfts that there is out there specifically on ethereum um really uh you know the breadth of nft data that openc has has really led to it becoming this common secondary marketplace where a lot of projects after doing their initial mint and their primary sales will go to for secondary sales um and for you know building on top of the of open c as a platform um we have an expanding selection so over the last two years we've extended expanded from ingesting really only erc 721 non-fungibles which i will go over into what that means as an overview to also include erc 1155 semi-fungibles which introduced this whole other category of digital goods um and then more recently uh later this year we actually introduced or i guess this is last year now we're in 2022. um but in 2021 we also moved on to become a multi-chain uh platform so we've integrated with polygon and clayton which are polygon is a layer two solution on top of ethereum and clayton is another blockchain that we integrate with as well um and that really you know kind of opened up a whole can of warms for what you can do on openc um obviously those two blockchains and the many other blockchains that we plan on integrating with in the future all kind of have different use cases and openc um one of openc's goals is to become this um wide index or or marketplace of all these uh nfts as an api platform or as a developer platform um what we really aim to do is to be really become the backbone of third-party tooling in web3 um we currently have a rest api that has already kind of become the backbone of a lot of really successful projects and really interesting things that people are doing with web3 um but we really only plan on improving from here and this is really only the beginning of what we plan to have become a whole platform of different tools including an sdk smart contract tooling and many many other things that i am very very excited to share with you um soon so why should you care if you are a web or app developer quote unquote web 2 developer um i personally don't like that terminology just because it kind of implies something negative about being a web 2 developer versus web3 developer but i digress um building on uh you building using our tools gives you access to one of the largest data sets in the nft community um really our indexer and our and our watcher of the blockchain has built up a data set over the years um and and has really indexed that data set very well um in a way that um really powers a lot of projects today but also like gives you access to like not just the nft data but also you know um events and orders that occur on openc as well as um collection groupings that we kind of have internally and a lot of people kind of rely on that today and that's very exciting for us and obviously kind of will help you because millions of nfts and active orders are already available at your fingertips the moment you start developing on openc so that that data is already there for you um you know you don't have to start from scratch and re-index the entirety of blockchain in order to have access to collections that might be older and might not you know be around as much anymore um and as the largest marketplace we do benefit from having like this existing ecosystem of third-party projects that and i'll showcase some of these projects that i personally thought were very cool um later on but having that available to you kind of you know gives you a very reliable source of the state of the nfd marketplace as a whole right now um and i hope will inspire you to kind of build really really cool things finally getting started with our api and our sdk is quick and very easy um it really only takes a handful of commands in your command line to get started with our sdk getting started with our rest api is uh in my opinion very straightforward our documentation website is simple it's getting better it's not quite there yet but it is getting better um and we really hope to get to a point where um when users start developing on web 3 and they really want to use some sort of api for data for nft aggregation the openc becomes the default um option here or the you know the obvious choice here just because of how simple it is here i have a little screenshot of what you know our developer website looks like um next i'll go over why you should care if you're a smart contract developer so like i mentioned earlier open seas exchange contract is one of the most actively used uh contracts in the entire ethereum ecosystem so this goes beyond just you know the nft marketplace ecosystem we are very regularly one of the or the highest uh gas burner when it comes to ethereum transactions um and that kind of just you know lends credence to how big of a platform and how big of an impact openc has had on both nfes and the ethereum marketplace as a whole um next we you know we also have built-in royalty support which is obviously a feature that is expanding out to other marketplaces which we're very happy with um and doing this with openc is very quick and painless um if you have uh already we've already collaborated with the royalty registry which was a project started in late 2021 to kind of unify the um registry of royalties for con for collections across all uh platforms so that when you go to uh list your collection on openc versus wearable versus any other um of these platforms that should be standardized across and that should hopefully make things very easy for people next our documentation um our documentation in my opinion is consistently being improved on and some of our uh latest pat and we include some of the latest patterns and trends that we notice in the solidity development community uh because we really want to make sure that when developers come to openc to learn how to become smart contract developers they can feel confident that what they're learning is up to date and also um useful and keeping up with the latest trends since uh as i'm sure many of you know this industry moves very fast and you know trends come and go very quickly not not specifically to like what collections are you know hype and what which are not uh more so like the coding patterns that you would have as a developer um so the things that you know solidity developers were doing in 2017 are not the things that they're doing in 2021 and 2022. um so so this this is very much so a growing community and we hope to continue updating our documentation um for developers as uh that community matures next we can go over what it looks like to be building on openc as a web or app developer so the um open c developer platform uh is like our web 2 interface consists of two major parts one is a rest api and the second is an sdk that actually builds on top of that api and simplifies a lot of the um sometimes more annoying or complex aspects of calling an api directly this becomes particularly useful when you want to do things with our api or our platform like submitting buy orders or sell orders for interface the api itself provides endpoints for the following uh index models on our platform uh assets which is just like a term we use to describe all digital goods um so this includes both erc 721 nfts as well as erc 1155 uh semi-fungible tokens um and i guess this would be a good time to kind of elaborate on the distinction between the two so uh when you think of nfts you typically think of the erc 11 erc 721 uh implementation and that kind of lives by the world of you know one owner to one token whereas with erc 1155 tokens uh the this uh proposal or this this new standard introduced the idea of semi-fungibility which allowed you to do very interesting things like having uh tokens that are semi-fungible um and can you know you can include you can actually own several of a specific type of thing a very good example of that um that i'm sure many people are aware of is that adidas recently um developed or released a collection uh that partnered with punk's comic and boarded yacht club and g-money and that that collection was actually an erc 1155 token because um you know if you go to the page on openc for example you would see that um all of the tokens on that page are all kind of under one detail page and people can have several of the same token um if you want to learn more about this there's plenty of resources about this on the internet in fact uh devin who's our ceo uh at this point last year released a very very accurate to today and very useful uh article called the nft bible that kind of goes over the specifics of these things so um i think that personally i found that to be a very good resource if you are confused about any of these topics it's a it's a great uh place to go to um another thing that we index is our collections which are like our off-chain concept for grouping contracts um in addition to events which are just transactions that have happened on blockchain for a specific uh asset uh individual orders that were submitted uh the accounts so this this would be like my wallet versus your wallet and finally asset contracts um and i'll go over the distinction between asset contracts and collections in a bit um next uh you know our orders api uh that i kind of mentioned earlier with our sdk allows you to both retrieve orders as well as submit orders directly to our exchange contract and um you know a lot of people found that to be a very powerful uh part of our developer platform in fact many people have created these you know bought the trading liquidity bots that actually submit uh actual orders that people can accept on the platform and that has actually been a very successful program for us and we hope to um you know work with those trading bots in the future to kind of continue this relationship um next you know some of our endpoints like um orders and events uh which tend to kind of be uh more heavily used are api gated um and the reason why we do that is just to prevent a lot of misuse of the platform that we've seen um with people just you know hammering those endpoints and kind of leading to problems on the platform itself um and uh i know that that sounds a little scary to have to use api keys and all that stuff as far as i'm aware you should be able we we actually created a specific signup form for api keys for the hackathon which will work with um you all over the weekend in order to make sure that api keys are just granted very quickly um and we we hope that you know the the keys that we give you you'll be able to use um we don't we don't want anybody getting stuck on this part when it comes to building for for this weekend um and finally the you know mainnet and test net apis are both available um they have feature parity between the two of them so any api that you have available for the ethereum mainnet you should have available for the rinkeby test net as well and um well i think personally that's very powerful because it allows you to test run a lot of your ideas without having to use quote-unquote real money um you know the test nets is kind of just like a playground for people um relying on uh building on ethereum this also maps very well to our testnets.openc.io which is like a test now website that we have available for developers like you to go test out your your ideas on so you can actually see an an exact replica of openc just a test net version of it that you could play with however you want um and then finally below included some links to our um documentation uh reference website as well as our sdk uh github repo that includes a um very good uh readme going over things um and i'll and i'll showcase both of those uh in a bit before i move into that though i'd like to kind of do a little bit of model definition i know i threw a lot of models in that earlier uh bullet so i kind of just wanted to expand on these a little bit so first we have assets these kind of represent individual tokens coming out of a contract we call these assets internally although um you know that that name is maybe not the most appropriate um these can be owned by one or more accounts um so this you know like i mentioned semi-fungibles can be owned by several people so you can have i can have one semi-fungible of the same exact token that you have um and then finally the you know what has led to the the the explosion of the nft industry which is the metadata of those assets um and that includes any you know media like images videos people have developed entire video games that live as metadata on their tokens directly um and that lives on chain or off chain and then finally some traits and these are just you know properties that people can attach to their uh nfts and um you know that can kind of determine rarity you can determine your your uh playable characters abilities and a game it can kind of that's you know that's up to you to develop and and build out in your world of your contract next we have the contracts themselves these are uh you know smart contracts that are deployed on the ethereum network um whether that's the mainnet network or the uh test net network and these are typically associated with a single owner account that um is the either the deployer of that account or that you know or deployer of that contract or if that uh deployer was like a third-party developer you know you can hand off ownership of a contract to other individuals um finally or next we have accounts accounts are individual user addresses so you know me as a as an individual a real person michael i have several accounts that i kind of manage under my wallet called metamask um so an individual account is mapped is more so a mapping to an individual address that you have funds in within the world of openc and our you know exchange contract accounts can be makers and takers or ore takers in an order and i'll go over what that means in a bit and finally you know that that kind of represents what you would see when you go to open c and you go to your profile page so if you're having a hard time understanding what that means it's it's just that um next we have collections collections are a grouping of assets or all of the assets in one or more contracts typically uh you know collection creators will have one contract in their collection we've seen certain instances where creators wanted to have several different contracts all living into this under the same collection and this is really just an entirely off-chain concept that we developed to make visibility on openc a little bit uh more organized for creators specifically and collections include you know metadata like the royalty information of how much um money a creator gets on secondary sales um social links um you know uh obviously information about the contracts themselves um and they can have one or more authorized editors on our website and that kind of allows user or creators to have several individuals working and managing their openc infrastructure without having to worry about you know who has access to what wallet next we have events and events are kind of broken down to two types one are on chain events and these include you know transferring an nft from one wallet to another sales of that of those nfts minting nfts uh as they're created and then they also include off-chain events like bids and listings um which uh i won't go too much into the uh infrastructure of how like an exchange contract works but the uh the the bids and listings kind of happen off chain and then when they're ready to be matched meaning that there is a person who would like to accept an offer or you know purchase an nft um then that's matched and that event happens on chain finally we have orders which are by far you know our more complex uh model that we have within our system um these are account submitted intents to either buy or sell an asset so these represent you know only one side of that transaction meaning either the buyer or the seller um and that can kind of uh apply to the different types of sales structures that we have on openc like auctions direct sales um dutch auctions things like that um you know these exist off-chain until they're matched um they typically have a type associated with them you know whether that's a bid or an ask and ask is you know a listing for sale asking something to be listed and uh they contain the metadata required to actually match an offer or or one side of a of an order on chain if you are willing to provide the other side um and then this is where the concept of maker and taker come in like i mentioned for accounts accounts can be makers or takers um this this actually was a concept that took me a while to kind of understand when i entered the world of open c um and just exchanges in general um a maker is something that or is an individual that provides liquidity the best way to think about it is the first mover in uh two-sided uh sale whereas the taker is the one that takes liquidity um so you know making and taking liquidity the reason why the word liquidity is used is because that liquidity could either be an individual nft or it could be um a uh ethereum like like buying ether and that that kind of makes more sense when you list an asset or or when you create a uh offer on an asset that then the owner of that asset can accept in which case the maker would be the guy that first moved um and then that's kind of why we have that distinction between the two um going into what our rest endpoints are these are the most popular endpoints that we have but by no means are they the entire you know set of endpoints that we have i just thought that these would be ones that would be very useful for individuals to get started with but afterwards i'll kind of go over some of the other ones that we might have available um the most you know the the standard one that you might think of is just a get endpoint against our assets um this you know fetches a list of tokens uh based on some filtering criteria that criteria could be something like the contract address of that token and then you know in which case it would fetch all of the tokens within that contract or the collection slug if you want to just filter by collections next we have the um get token by actual like identifier api and to uniquely identify a token within openc you need to provide both the contract address as well as the token id and then those two things together kind of provide a primary key for finding that token within openc systems and this fetches a little bit more detailed information about a specific token whereas the listing api is a little bit more uh bare bones um to just provide an overview of each uh nft so uh an example of this is that for erc 1155 semi-fungible tokens um this includes a list of all the owners of those tokens instead of you know just providing the the individual owner which doesn't really make any sense in the world of semi-fungibles as well as providing all of the open orders meaning orders that you know haven't been matched yet and are still valid for being uh matched for that token next we have the get collections endpoint which lists all of the collections uh very similar options filtering options to the assets endpoint so you know for this one what would make more sense is filtering by asset owner so if i wanted to get a list of all of the collections that i have at least one nftn that's when i would use that asset owner parameter next we have the get collection stats endpoint and this endpoint takes in a collection slug which is just like a human readable identifier that the collection owner chose for that nft um if you go to any collection page on openc you'll see that as like the the endpoint name you'll see the the collection slug and then this provides a list of statistics about that collection so this includes trade volume um i believe like 30 day averages for different things as well as like a very sought-after metric in the nfte ecosystem which is the floor price which is a full price for those who are not familiar is just the lowest uh open order uh lowest price open order for a asset or an nfd in that collection um so this is typically just people people view this as a metric of how much money would take me if i wanted to enter and and have a an asset in this in this collection for an nft in this collection um next we have the get events endpoint which fetches a list of events based on filters uh like i mentioned earlier this endpoint requires an api key header this is kind of what that looks like you would have to pass in this as a as a header for that api key and then uh finally we have the orders end point which again like the events endpoint does require an api key and it returns a list of orders um based on filtering criteria uh these include filtering by like makers and takers so you can see all of the outstanding offers for uh that a specific uh person has made or any incoming offers that that person you know can accept um and and personally i think that this is an underutilized um concept that i would love to see some some projects come out that that think of of clever ways of using this and i won't go into too much detail next we have the openc sdk which is kind of like a complimentary package on top of um the api itself uh that we provide for like javascript developers and you know uh that really it's an npm package for those who are familiar with web development and really this allows you to have more advanced like e-commerce functionality um including like buying and selling nfts um technically you could submit you know you could post orders directly to our api uh many people find that to be very complicated because that that endpoint requires a lot of feels and a lot of validation um and this sdk provides a lot of that out of the box and kind of abstracts away a lot of the complexities there um it uses web3.js which is a very popular package for um ethereum or evm interactions under the hood um and that really allows you to do something as simple as like pasting in your uh private key in the um in the like an environment variable where it's hidden um and then you can do things like submitting orders like right you know out of the box and i'll and i'll show what that looks like in our documentation in a bit um setup for it is very very straightforward it's it's a one one command with an npm install um obviously make sure that you have web3.js as well uh it's backed by rest api and the exchange contracts that we have within openc which are known as the wyvern exchange contracts which i'll go into that in a little bit um that that contract is actually integrated directly into our sdk so creating uh buy and sell orders is very straightforward as well as fulfilling existing orders so if you find that there's an order that's very advantageous for you to programmatically accept you can do that using our sdk which is in my opinion very exciting and opens up a whole can of possibilities for what you can do with the sdk um so real quick i'll go into what you know interacting with all this looks like i'm skipping ahead a little bit sorry um okay so this is what our api reference looks like um here are some of our you know this is where we define some of our models and the fields that you might expect to see in those models um you know this is the assets endpoint accounts um this is a reference to you know the the get api forget assets api um includes uh this ui which you know we've worked to kind of develop or to build out um provides you with the ability to actually like interact and make calls directly from here which is very nice if you're like testing out the waters with the api and you're not really sure what you want to do yet um and you're not really sure what that data looks like um so you can you can actually pass this information directly in so if i go here um i don't think this account actually has any nfts in it so it won't work um but if i press try it yeah this this uh the platform that we use for creating our documentation's website has been weirdly slow today but um the benefit of of this platform is that it actually provides you with like code examples um that you can you know you could copy and directly run in whatever environment and it works out of the box which is really exciting this is an example of like what the result would look like but if we really want to i don't really have to even wait for for this ui to work i could just copy this curl command directly i call this again like i said i don't have any assets in this uh in this uh collect or any assets in this uh account so maybe maybe i'll switch over to one that does it's not a demo if it doesn't work or if it works the first time you try it and we have a bunch of data it looks kind of ugly so maybe we can do a little bit of reprinting okay it doesn't matter we got the we got the data here it just doesn't look pretty anyway we you know you have access to all of our endpoints here it describes a couple of other ones that i might have missed out on like bundles which is just a grouping of assets that people have to sell things um you know fetching asset contracts if you want to fetch the information on a contract directly and it also includes references for our test nets api and like i mentioned this is a one-to-one mapping between our test nets and mainnet api so any api that you have available on mainnet you can try out in nets which is nice it gives you a little bit of a safety blanket next going into what our sdk looks like this is the github page for it the readme is offers a lot of detail as to how to use this sdk installation is pretty straightforward um you know once you actually install it inside your project um getting the sdk set up is as straightforward as providing a network that you want to use um a web3 provider which is typically you know something like infuria or um alchemy um and these are just like connections to existing ethereum nodes um as well as your api key um and if if you need to uh submit orders or you know do anything that interacts with the blockchain you can also pass in your private key for your account here and then at that point the sdk would be able to kind of do things on behalf of your account like signing transactions um you know you could fetch and uh assets and other data just the same way that you would with the api it's kind of a wrapper on top of it um and then you can do it what the exciting part of using the sdk which is creating buy orders creating bundles you know you can create sell orders of course um you can create special kinds of orders like crowd sales if you want to do different types of listings like auctions as well um you can fetch orders that you have existing um and then you can also fulfill orders so if you have an order that you know you want to accept that you've fetched here um you know fulfilling that order if you have the funds in your account um it's as easy as calling this one line if you have the order information which is very exciting um and then you know the same kind of applies for like accepting existing offers that you might have okay so sorry to jump in here but we are a couple minutes over um yeah super detailed explanations that was super cool um but on that note i know like there was a lot of questions in the chat however the chat was really lively and it looks like everyone's mostly been answering those questions um on your behalf which is really awesome to see but we can maybe do one quick minute for questions if anyone wants to unmute their mic to speak up really quick you know i would ask about the the orders things i think like a lot of people just afraid to use it much because like uh kind of limits and uh you said that is underutilized a lot and my take on that is like i don't really want to abuse anything like like orders end points you know yeah i i understand your perspective here um i i hear you on this and this is something that we're trying to improve on as a platform um really a lot of the the limits that you might have heard of um have to do with the fact that um people are making unbounded uh or submitting unbounded amount of orders on our platform so if you have one each um in your in your wallet uh you would people were submitting you know uh several thousand orders all for one eth um which technically is valid but you can't realistically accept all of those um so what we had to implement as a as a stop gap for that is um essentially what you know people in exchanges define as margin requirements so if you have one eth you can only submit upwards of you know 100x that or i'm not sure what the number is at but um and that's just to prevent you know that's cool yeah it makes sense makes sense because like all these orders are gonna mess up the whole system basically right um thank you thank you yeah no problem and i'm sorry i went over i didn't realize how slowly i was going with all of this but um could we maybe provide people with access to this uh powerpoint yeah of course um so there is the um openc discord channel on youth global so they can be sent there i know someone in the chat did ask if they can get the slides um so if you just want to send the link in there michael you should be in our discord yeah no problem awesome well thank you so much michael that was super super interesting um really cool learning about like open c api and stuff very intense yeah thank you so much for spending your uh thursday evening with us and to the rest of you thank you so much for tuning in to open seas workshop um and being a part of nft hack 2022 i hope you all have a great rest of your day or evening or morning depending on where you are and
