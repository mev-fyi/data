hey everyone just bear with us while we get the live stream set up thanks welcome again and uh i'm delighted to welcome felipe and luis here from the maker dial team they're going to give a presentation on how maker dial keeps building on dye if you have any questions in the meantime feel free to pop them in the chat and we can take them towards the end and yeah i'll let you take the stage luis and felipe thanks okay thank you so much so yeah we're going to talk about how micro java keeps building a die uh philippe and i we work for the maker growth uh core unit there is a working group for the for the for maker dow so so yeah i i am most of the part of the support operations and philippines is our checklist so yeah we're going to start hopefully if you can yeah so hi everyone my name is tripp i'm working at the growth coordinates in in the makerbot now really and yeah we're here to talk to you about how we are continuing to build around and support to die um uh as as the the ecosystem keeps going keeps on growing yep uh so please next slide so yeah so yeah basically let's start with uh what is uh or who is uh the the tao or maker daw itself so maker does one of the oldest doubts that is like uh still around uh we can like talk about maker tao right now into like different components like maker doubt the whole global dial itself that that is composed by the uh the whole maker community the protocol the stakeholders uh us as the car units and all the people that is uh uh yeah like joined the in the dial that is uh working towards the the healthy of the of the protocol and then there is the second component that is basically they make a protocol itself that is like the set of smart contracts that would die alive into the dfa maintenance so uh basically we are essence last year a full decentralized tao since the dissolving of the of the maker foundation and right now the whole maker dow team is composed by different working groups that are called uh career units there are the ones that are like giving their services uh to the to the dog basically for example us at growth we are doing the the work uh for uh partnerships and you basically try to to increase the die demand uh all around uh mainnet and and other other parts and yeah basically like all around maker dao it works uh thank you to the the governance the maker governance there is like the process when where the mkr token holders like vote for whatever uh regards to to the maker dawg or to the protocol itself for example the parameters are on die what core units are going to be working for the dao what collaterals are going to be backing that back and die and so so yeah this leads us to our star product that is basically die so diet is this a decentralized stable cone that is over collateralized so as i said it's based on over collateralized lending and as right now is one of the most trusted stable coins in the whole space so as dye is uh is over collateralized as you can see right now it is not super affected by the the market uh movements and multiple systems are in place to make die one of the most useful stable coins uh all around the decentralized decentralized finance uh if you can yeah so yeah let's talk a little bit about how the day works it's like super simple uh as you know uh as you may know you make a dial so people can come with whatever collateral collateral that we accept in maker dao it can be if it can be wbtc it can be a comp it can be a usbc through the bsm or whatever uh crypto so you go and interact with with maker daw and from these collaterals you start a mixing diet so for every diet you mean you create a a maker volt and then these vaults have a stability fees that we let's say kinda control through the governance process as we mentioned it uh before in order to keep the type uh to the to the u.s dollar so basically uh when die is trading uh above the one dollar peg and what we do is that this stability fees we let's say we lower them so we uh increase the desire of people of mentioned diet and food with the market so dai keeps the bag with with a with a dollar and in the opposite side uh when die is trading below the one dollar uh target uh what we do is that we increase a little bit the stability fees so we encourage people to to repay basically their loans inside maker dial and then take a little bit of of the die uh in the market so we basically reach the one dollar peg and yeah so the maker bolts are basically like the core part of the whole maker protocol that are the this smart contracts that enable everyone with whoever wants to interact with the protocol to me die by locking a collateral on it as you can see in the in the slides there are like many interfaces for example instant update saver oasis that are the ones that provide this service to to maker and yeah we like whatever protocol we we accept uh in whatever collateral we have said in the code you can die against it as much as the depth ceiling of the of the bolt uh allows you because every bolt has a depth cylinder is the maximum amount that that you can uh like basically means in terms of die and then for example if this depth ceiling comes to a maximum the maker governance process comes in again and yeah basically the empire token holders can vote for the absolute to be increased or to be decreased if there is not much demand on the collaterals and so yeah that's basically how how the the defaults and the protocol works another a pretty pretty important part part of the of the protocol itself are the maker oracles and we don't use for example chain link as most of the all the other players in the in the ecosystem we use our own oracle so any lending protocol you know uh us maker uh relies on the price of of of the oracles like the the price fits of every every collateral so we maintain our own network of decentralized price oracles and this can be accessed by uh accessed by any defy applications because yeah we have a order in the blockchain and for example one uh pretty cool part of our oracle system is let's say in this market we have a security module that is the osm or the or the oracle security model that gives you like the price fit of every collateral and it always delays the next price uh for one hour so we always give like this kind of opportunity for every vault owner to see how healthy is uh it's uh his or her collateral so they can like take the uh a chance to repay the repay to die uh get more collateral into into the vault or wherever so we like uh do this kind of for our users to be like more more secure on what they are doing to give them like more time and when this uh like kind of market uh situations uh comes up so so yeah that's basically the the most important part of the of the protocol and then i'll let you with er with felipe who is going to talk to you about the other modules and the features we have so basically as luis said there are a couple modules in play when you interact with the maker protocol and we have to make we have to make a strong point about the maker protocol being quite modular so there are a lot of different parts that affect either the the dye emissions the dye stability and also there are other other parts of the protocol that let you interact in novel ways with dai and the the maker ecosystem so everything is basically voted in by governance after doing a lot of risk analysis and we over over this over a couple years we've integrated a lot of different functionality that's already available for use uh by other d5 protocols uh one of our premier iterations is the d3m er that stands short for direct deposit module and this basically lets them just inject liquidity into other protocols such as ave and basically provide a better interest rate for people who want to borrow die on other another venues and um sorry this actually allows people to get die at better rates that they could get elsewhere and benefits both maker and ave and also users the idea is to make the most uh available stable coin in the map letting people just borrow it with whatever collateral they they want uh always taking into account the permissions that the other protocols give so for example in ave you can borrow die with other crypto collaterals that you might not be able to with to borrow with in the main mega system so that expands the possibilities for for everyone involved and um the d3m is not rea it is not linked to ave itself we there's a lot of potential integrations uh in the work zone coming up and also you can build uh your own projects using the d3m as a source of dye liquidity for whatever needs you have uh bear in mind obviously that the 3m iterations are subject to governance acceptance so uh the product that uses the d3m should be secure enough to actually be able to use a d3m integration uh one of one of the most recent cases of these 3m integrations make hearing the news is our deal with tesla um through another uh through another um lending protocol so basically we actually threw this through this other protocol we ended up lending die to tesla to actually get a real world um risk going running uh summary centers that sort of thing and this is a real power of the ethereum we can inject liquidity whatever the market needs it so basically maple finance is one of our partners who actually specializes in uncollateral uncollateralized lending so we can we can make a strong point about this the about maker being a little bit more capital efficient in this realm and what this the main point of this is that the security model of dai we set up a debt ceiling for these integrations and we kind of extend the lending rights to other protocols so basically we rely on other protocols to do the do their due diligence and then die us as much as they as much as they need really this allows us to scale in a huge fashion because there's that there's uh no need for crypto collateral in these cases and real world assets can actually start tapping into crypto collaterals and crypto in the device space in general by means of using a stable coin like die and just starting to do stuff in the in in the device space another interesting uh development that we've had over the best stability modules so the that's the piece the psm uh the psn basically allows you to trade die in or out for uh right now it's three stable coins usdcp the pax the paxos and a gemini yes and the whole idea for this is that we want we want to build a other system for stable coin swaps and um maker's ability to mint die and burn it makes it puts us in a very special place uh to be able to actually expand and contract the demand the the the the dye supply in in really then really expanding contract didn't play as much as it's needed so if people want to drop their esc for die and go yield farming for example they can just do that on the psm and they will get that right one to one the the main the main point for using the psn is that it's actually free apart from gas fees so you can swap to help to your house content without incoming trade fees another interesting thing and that we've seen use the psm used for is actually bridging die to the real world via stable coins back to dollars such as ufcc or paxos just enabling other borrowers to exit and also the the psm actually allows other actors to uh arbitrage dice peg so if place is trading below the type they can buy die off the bank burn cc and if die is above the market they can just deposit your cc and just die to make a profit so we also have another module that's called the flashlight mode this is called free to use and uh free version of abyss and link protocol uh this basically means that you can always rush die you can multiply leverage uh for free basically the only thing are paying in this case gas fees and also looking forward to them to the multi to the multi-chain strategy that maker law is bringing forward and the all this lcd explosion that we've seen we are actively working on make our teleport before i um just uh leveraging the the catalyst that the dow has actually mint and burn die uh so basically this functions uh via a mince and burn model where you actually die in one chain and that is picked up by your oracle network that relays message to the other side let's say you're transferring from from magnet to optimism for example you lock your lock your die on magnet that gets picked up by the by the oracle network that then uh sends a message to the l2 and enables you to die on that also the the die that was locked on the original chain just gets burned and it effectively means that you can instantly get your die whatever you need it whenever you need it uh we are rolling this out very soon it's first going up going to be on opt-in on stock.net and after that we are targeting our optimism to be launched and this wormhole and this uh teleportation of dye it actually enables us to actually deploy multicollateral light on lca networks so the gas fees that that have been so high for so long actually about people from protocol working on l2 being supported and so that you can mint and use die on different networks as uh just as if you were on my net so that's uh that's a an overview of all the modules that we are holding runs for in this in this hackathon um right right now we are in grants for a psm interface so an interface we let you slow coins using our back stability module we have a grant for creating an interface for our collab for address and mostly leverage tokens like uh curves take these lp tokens there's uh gelato tokens for the units of three die ercc pulse uh that sort of thing uh the we have a grant for a flapper distributor so fla that regards the mechanism for a in which there's a maker has enough uh enough revenue to actually start distributing that revenue to token holders and care holders so we are actively looking into that um we are also hosting a grant for a cool use case for our flash mint module which is actually which is currently free so that's that's a really useful tool for defy projects and protocols that want to just move collateral around another really interesting grant that we are hosting is the instagram for an oracle's dashboard so just looking at the oracle status of the maker ecosystem uh showing the different prices showing the the time delays between this between these prices that sort of thing whatever you can imagine you can you can do uh we will be in the discord channel to actually figure that out and had some discussions and our last grant for this hackathon is a sub graph for the mkr voting weights so right now the mkr governance is based on a delegate system so people can actually delegate the nk articles who in their in their behalf that's just a byproduct of the gas fees being so high on maintenance uh but yeah we are looking to create uh some sort of interface that lets people see how mkr is accelerated and how people actually are able to vote and support their delegates yeah that's uh that says uh from me i don't know uh if there are uh many questions in the in the chat channel and if the if you have any questions just feel free to drop them in the chat it looks like you covered everything in this workshop um there's no questions coming in yet no okay now don't don't be afraid to ask yeah okay yeah so whatever we're on the on the sponsor channel into the eat global discord server so there you can find like all the useful links of the documents and you can ask me or felipe or whoever is over there from the front maker team whatever doubts you might have around the the projects the prices and whatever that you are possibly building uh from eckerdale or you're interested in doing some of the of the of the ones that we put over there uh we are in the in the chat so so yeah feel free to reach out anytime yes we are also going to be hosting a series of brainstorming sessions on our official discord server for megadot so feel free to join great thanks felipe and luis for the session and you will follow up over this course okay amazing thank you for for the invitation and thank everyone for for being here thanks everyone for having a nice session with us
