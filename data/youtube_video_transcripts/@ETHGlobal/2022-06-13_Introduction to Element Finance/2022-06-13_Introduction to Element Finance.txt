[Music] hey everyone i'm matthew brown i'm one of the founding engineers at element finance and today i'll be going over the uh nyc hackathon workshop that we're hosting so let's get started so today i'm basically just going to talk about a little bit of a history of element finance and how the protocol works and then we'll hack we'll jump right into the hackathon topics and we'll talk about the three things that we'd love to see people build so first we have new yield sources so currently we wrap urine mostly and we'd like to see some more protocols added to the element protocol to generate fixed field sources so secondly we also have structured products so again we'd love to see people build on top of the element protocol and we can talk a little bit about what structured products means and give you an example and lastly we have the elfie nft project that we gifted to our community during our dow launch so we'd love to see people build on top of this there's a lot of potential here to bridge the gap between the nft and the fire worlds so we'd love to see what the community can come up come up with here and we'll talk about some ideas there soon as well this whole video should be about 10 12 minutes long so let's dive in all right so what is element finance so element finance formed a couple years ago in 2020 we did a mainnet launch last year and since then we've updated our protocol to a v 1.1 added some upgrades and we've also launched our dow along with that nft project that i mentioned earlier so what does element finance do so basically we're a fixed rate yield source protocol and we'll talk about how that works but basically what we do is we wrap variable yield sources so these can be pools that you can find on urine curve many other places around the ethereum ecosystem and the way we do that is we implement a token splitting strategy to create the fixed deal so how does a protocol work so if you know how traditional pools work you basically start with any asset say ethereum and you can put that into some sort of pool that generates variable interest in return that pool will give you an lp token that generally represents your share of that pool so as the assets accrue in the pool when you redeem your lp token you'll get more ethereum or whatever asset you put in out than what you started with element finance works a bit differently but sort of the same we take that same pool and we wrap it now when you put your asset in say ethereum again when you when you get out this time is not an lp token but two tokens a principal token and a yield token so as you can probably guess the principal token is just what you put in when the uh one one key difference though is that when you deposit through the element protocol the funds are locked for a period of time and this is sort of critical to creating the fixed yield so when you put the tokens in at the time that you redeem them the principal tokens are worth one to one whatever you deposit so in the example here if you start with one each at the time you can redeem them when the term ends the principal token can be redeemed for that one eth that you put in the yield tokens on the other hand are whatever interest is accrued from the underlying pool so say a year goes by and that urine pool had about a 20 interest over that year so the year the yield token will accrue that value over that one year and then at the end of the term can be redeemed for however much has been accrued in this case it'd be about point two e so where does the fixed yield come from in all of this so again let's say we start with one each and we mint that one principle token and yield yield token we have a one year term that had about a 20 variable rate so again at the end of the term one principal token can be redeemed for one each and one yield token can be redeemed for about 0.2 eth let's say at the beginning of this term the person who minted the principal token and the yield token doesn't really want to hold on to their principle they just care about the yield and there are several reasons for this we can go into later so they sell their one principal token at a discount for 0.9 eth and the reason they have to sell at a discount is because again the funds are locked so there's sort of an opportunity cost here nobody would buy it at exactly one eighth because they have to wait some time to be able to redeem it so they buy it at a discount and they hold on to it so the seller of that principal token has now only invested point one each remember they bought the principal token for one each they sold it for 0.98 so now they've only invested 0.1 eth and expect to make 0.2 eth off the yield token so this is one strategy in the protocol you can basically gain some pretty good capital efficiency if you only care about that variable yield you can sell your principal tokens at a discount and sort of leverage the yield tokens in this way so the buyer of that principal token bought it at discount for 0.98 they know when the term matures they'll be able to redeem it for one eve and that's what generates the fixed interest so the buyer of the discounted principal token knows that the value is going to go from 0.9 when they bought it at the beginning of the term up to one each and you know in addition there of 0.18 is about 10 fixed interest so those are the basic token economics here basically again principal tokens are just worth one to one uh whatever money was put in to the term uh when you try to redeem them the yield tokens again are just whatever interest accrues so at the beginning of the term they haven't accrued any interest so they have no value but at the end they'll be able to be redeemed for whatever interest has accrued and we also talked about how the protocol works which is basically a simple token splitting where we separate the principal from the yield and that's basically element finance all right so now let's go ahead and talk about our hackathon topics so like i said before there are three that we'd like to see people get involved with there's the new yield sources structured products and building on top of the nft project so to go into the first one new yield sources this one's the most straightforward so we currently wrap urine vaults which have the variable yield sources that we do the tokens putting on to create fixed field sources in the element protocol so a couple others that we're looking to add to the protocol are ave and m stable so we have a lot of code that you can use as boilerplate and examples to figure out how to do this we'll also set up a discord channel for you guys to reach out to us on and collaborate so again yeah so these are the two that we're looking at um feel free to propose others and uh and this one's pretty straightforward and we'll we'll again we'll share out some resources for you guys to look at to get started on so the next one is structured products so again yeah we would love to see some people build on top of the protocol there's been some pretty cool work recently fiat dao has recently integrated with the element protocol to use principal tokens as collateral so an example of a structured product here is the principal token protected fault so the basic idea behind this is that you can use principal tokens that have a guaranteed appreciation because whenever you buy them at a discount you know at the end of the term you can redeem them one to one so you can use that difference so let's say you know they're going to accrue five percent interest you now have that five percent guaranteed to invest in some other really risky product so if there's something out there that has potential to return really high yields but it could potentially not yield anything you could use the guaranteed interest in this principal token protected vault to invest in that risky product in a de-risked way so we think there's a lot of potential for this kind of thing and we'd really love to see somebody take a crack at it there's also many other ideas feel free to reach out us out to us again on discord or come up with your own idea for how to use principal tokens in d5 all right lastly we have our elfie verse nft project so we'd really love to see people uh build on top of this there's some really cool ideas that have been proposed so like i said right now it was just a gift to the community during our dow launch and they're simple nfts with no utility but we would love to see somebody bridge the gap between d5 and nft so there's a lot of really cool ideas here so one thing that people could do is add attributes for different things within the governance protocol so if somebody's voted on x number of proposals they've created proposals if they have so much voting power in the system if they're a member of the gsc you could have different attributes to kind of represent all of these things you can also just have attributes for fun that aren't necessarily related to the governance protocol and some of the attributes don't have to have any utility you could even just make a game to help the community community engage engage with one another so yeah again there's a lot of potential here we would love to see what the community comes up with to sort of bridge this gap i think it'd be a lot of fun so those are three basic hackathon topics a quick note on resources here so all of our stuff is hosted on github.com element-fi and there are some repos for the protocol here that are pretty useful if you're working on the core protocol so if you're working on structured products or adding new yield sources these first two repos will be pretty useful health sdk and elf dash contracts the sdk has some some methods on there to help you integrate with the contracts the elf contracts repo has the actual contracts themselves with some example code and boilerplate in there for you if you're interested in working on the nft project the council repo has the governance protocol of those contracts and the nft contracts repo obviously has the contracts for the nft project here's a link to our discord we'll share that below the video as well so again feel free to reach out to us anytime you have other ideas that you want to check with us or if you want to get help with the with your implementation we'll be around all right so that that sums it up those were our hackathon topics a little bit about element finance uh so that's all i have for you today so happy hacking and we can't wait to see what you guys come up with thanks a lot
