welcome again everybody to our workshop with lighthouse today and you're going to learn how to do permanent storage redefined with nandit here if you have any questions during the workshop please feel free to pop them in the chat and we'll answer them towards the end nan did i let you take this stage thanks awesome thank you so welcome everyone good morning good evening wherever you are it's not it's nighttime here so you can wish me good night after the session so welcome to lighthouse and we'll talk about what is lighthouse and how it's a permanent storage redefined and how you can use it in your hacks at build quest so to start off web 3 means true ownership but to achieve that we need to move from renting our own files to truly owning them and that's where lighthouse comes in so lighthouse is a permanent storage protocol and it allows the ability to pay once and store your files forever so unlike you would have used web to products where for google drive and icloud you'll have to pay for the files after every fixed period of time let's say monthly or yearly we believe that for web 3 native products having a permanent storage option is pretty important and that's what we are building so on the core of lighthouse protocol there is this endowment pool model so what happens is whenever a user stores a file on lighthouse some amount of it goes towards to the miner for storing it while remaining goes to this endowment pool whose job is to pay for the users file for many many years and decades to come so hence we are bringing permanent storage to filecoin and let's talk about what that exactly means so right now there are these two prominent storage protocols as we see in the market today with filecoin there is this huge storage capacity in terms of exabytes it is a pretty stur cheaper storage option but it allows recurrent payments so whenever you store data with a filecoin miner you essentially store it for one year or 1.5 years max so somebody has to take care of that and do those recurrent payments so for example given these nfts when we are expecting that to be you know transferred over generation to generations some are like pretty high valued and everyone wants that their nft be maintained forever like the records when you create those assets who you transfer to and who is the owner right now those are on the blockchains like eth polygon solana etc but essentially the file behind it which is a jpeg or mp4 file that is getting stored somewhere and we think that the infrastructure behind that it is not totally uh in the right manner and that's how we are building lighthouse that you do not have to pay and maintain your file ever again you just do it once using lighthouse and it's totally permanent there is this another protocol rv which does allow that ability although using lighthouse gives you this uh chance that you can do it at a much cheaper cost than rv plus we have a better user experience in the sense that you can pay in in your native tokens or native chain tokens for so for example it could be like matec bse or any other uh evm compatible tokens like phantom etc so yeah let's go on to a demo and we'll also show you a demo app files which is built on top of lighthouse so this is our website you can see like there is this get started button where you can go and go through the docs so to give an overview for our cli there are basically four commands that you need to know one is the install command that allows you to install our js sdk on your system then you have to just create your wallet and top it up with some negative tokens so for example if you want to use polygon chain then top it up with matic tokens and then there are test nets available as well so after that you are just like one click deploy away to deploy your files or it could be like you can deploy a lot of files together inside a single folder to lighthouse and then you can easily check what is the status of your file who all are the miners to which your file is stored and how many replications are made so let's try it out on our cli so i've already installed but uh if you haven't installed you can use the command that we just saw here to install lighthouse and these are all the commands available to you on your cli but our npm package you can use in your apps like react app if you are building you can use that right away in there as well in all your browser-based apps so we have this wallet command that will that will use which tells you uh your public key of the wallet that you created and which network you are connected to and you can also change the network so for example now we also support optimism which is a ethereum layer too so if you want to go to that optimism that's the right spelling yeah so you use the dash dash network parameter to change and now you are connected to the optimism network and then you can easily check the balance you need to top it up with some tokens and although to start off you can also use their test nets as well so need not uh worry about having uh real tokens for your hacks in the hackathon and then let's say i want to deploy some files so for this purpose i'll uh deploy a whole folder with a lot of files so that might be pretty helpful for you so i have this logos folder in which i have put a bunch of files i'll do lighthouse dash web 3 deploy logos so it is now giving back me the code that how much will that cost what all files are getting stored their respective sizes their respective piece what kind of file they are and their name and i need to do a capital y type it and click enter and i need to give my password which i set up when i was creating the wallet and now it's starting to upload the file so yeah so it gave me this first of all this transaction which is like a verifiable proof that you use lighthouse to store your file and this is what ensures that okay it is a record that you actually stored your file and lighthouse protocol will ensure that it is stored forever like we will we keep on paying for your file for many many years and decades to come not we as a company but the protocol itself so we just saw that it's 35 seconds ago or this transaction was made and um it also gave us this url where i can visit the file that i just deployed so yeah since it was a folder with a bunch of files so it has this common cid and if i open one of these files like let's say this file so this cid is even common so for example if you are uh deploying a lot of files this is a common root cid and then you can have simple names like one two three four dot png and then play around with that so yeah that's pretty simple to you know use top it up with some tokens and deploy files using lighthouse and check the status and we have also created this files app and we have open source just open sourced it scored as well for his for an example for you guys so how you can use lighthouse i'll just demo it it's a pretty simple app just log in with your metamask and then you can see um all the files that you stored so right now i'm on the matic network and if i wanna upload a new file i can do it uh using its cid directly or i can upload a new file from here and then i will sign a transaction to confirm and then pay a minimal fees like some transaction fees and some minimal fees because it's a very small file and then confirm that so yeah it will take some time equivalent to the transaction time of whatever network you are and then that will be visible here um and then you can see the file and play around with it so the code for this is open source i'll put this in the chat itself if anyone wants to use in their hack and to know how to use lighthouse in your systems for your hackathon projects and yeah that's it so i'll also put under our discord as well and let me go back to our slides so for the storage we build on top of ipfs and filecoin you can imagine lighthouse to be a layer to on top of filecoin so we have our own validator set of nodes although right now we have just few of them running within our system as well so company as well but will soon open it out to more people to use it and run your own validated nodes in coming months and so so our smart contracts they are multi-chain deployed on smart contracts like polygon phantom bsc etc and behind there is this economics and involving staking and accruing fees which grows this endormant pool whose job is to eventually pay for your files for over and over for a very very long period of time so given lighthouse there are variety of application possible you can use it for nfp storage and particularly for this hackathon you can use it to store your gaming assets your metaverse assets be just simple like images videos text files are even more complex like ar vr and maybe creative and dynamic nf nfts etc you might even want to create some reputation systems or some ranking systems and have that record be permanently stored on lighthouse which could be pretty important for your hackathon projects and for build quest we are sponsoring two thousand dollars and it's a full price so for all the projects who are using lighthouse it will be split evenly and you can check more details about it in our discord channel on the build quest hackathon and since lighthouse is a layer two on top of ipfs and filecoin so essentially if you use lighthouse you'll also qualify for the other ipfs and filecoin prices as well so it's like a new icing on top of this cake so thank you very much this is all about lighthouse and this is our twitter handle if you want to follow us and if there's some questions we can take them up thank you nandit for the presentation um if you guys have any more questions feel free to ask them now that someone says no question good presentation yeah thank you i think someone has raised your hand so if you want to type in the question oh maybe i can tell can you hear me yeah okay so there is one question how fast is it working i mean if you want to restrive the data for example fold this logo and load the page or retrieve those data as fast as possible uh how much time it would take none that are you there oh i think i think we last landed i guess he's back to hacking okay oh here i landed yeah so if there's any questions you can ask me or else i'm on discord and uh happy to also chat one-on-one with anyone okay so maybe i will repeat my question um i i have a question a question about the performance because uh you show us this demo but actually how how much time does it take to retrieve the data for example to load the page or take some sprites for for game and so and similar things how performance is this network i think so like if you're asking about retrieving data and let's say serving it on the web it should pretty work fine again on your specific use case if there are some specific files that you are planning to serve and we can specifically check you know performance for them but as we have been you know for the demo apps that have been built on lighthouse and other projects that i've been working on um we haven't faced any issues serving the files like videos or images on the website so but if there's any particular asset uh to your hack let us know if you face any performance issue and we can see yeah i was just asking about the overall performance so thanks for the answer yeah no worries thank you for asking we have time for some more questions if you have them feel free to ask landed or raise your hand okay so i have another question uh how much actually how how much you pay how much is the gas fee uh calculated when we're talking about those files are we talking about the file the per kilobyte or or something other measure is taken yeah so for the costing part right now we do charge uh for five dollars a gb um but that's for like storing the files again if you are looking to hack you can even use test nets and that won't cost you anything and for the transaction fees again it depends upon your native chains so for example the chains that we are supporting like polygon phantom optimism etc transaction fees on them are already pretty low so it's like very minimal and then again if you are you know deploying how even how i showed in the demo a folder of a lot of files together then it's like a pretty minimal transaction piece again because there's a lot of files and the transaction fees would be just one so it won't be any transaction fees but the cost of storage that is fixed right now five dollars a gb it would go less in the future for your hackathon purpose you can go for test networks but even that five dollars a gb if you take a lo over a long period of time that saves infrastructure cost as we see yeah okay thanks awesome so if there's any further question you can join our own discord or we are on this uh build quest channel as well so don't be shy ask us and if there's anything we can help one to one on your particular use case we would be pretty happy to do that thank you nanda yeah the discord channel the sponsor dash lighthouse for reference awesome thank you thanks thanks
