all right well hello everyone uh i'm pete from eath global and i am really honored today to be joined by leilani and ganesh from covalent um leilani and ganesha would you like to get started and introduce yourself i'm super excited for your talk today thanks pete uh hey guys i'm ganesh swami i'm one of the founders of covalent i'm here with leigh uh i'm going to quickly start out with an intro to what covalent is about you know what our mission is uh what we've been uh up to and what our roadmap is going to look like and uh and then let lay uh take it over from there with a more technical demo so um like i said i'm one of the co-founders we've been around for a while three and a half years to be precise and we started with this idea that blockchain data is all public but only on the surface to truly extract and make meaningful stories from the data you need a middleware player a middleware connector that is able to pull out the data for you and once you have that data the number of use cases that you can uh build on top of that are numerous so we started with that idea of course the first two years was pretty slow with a multi-year bear market not a lot going on but we persisted somehow we had the conviction that this is the right thing to work on for this space and uh you know that piece has started to uh started to prove true in 2020 uh the company became profitable we're one of the few companies that are profitable in the space and uh our traction just shot up so um we started with some big enterprise clients like consensus and then started opening up the platform to more and more uh developers covalent itself uh started at a hackathon uh we had a blog post god a couple of weeks ago on why hackathons are extremely important to us i'm super super excited about hackathons i'm a hacker myself i built the first version covalent at a hackathon in two days so we love supporting uh hackathons and i would say my biggest regret from the last couple years is not supporting more hackathons so this year we're i think this is our eighth or ninth hackathon uh just this year alone so we are a title sponsor for a lot of the heath global events uh and super happy to be there so the product itself is a unified api and the idea is that once you have this middleware piece it opens up a billion possibilities and uh currently i think we have over 300 customers and these customers can be uh all kinds of use cases it can be uh wallets so uh lots of lots of wallets i use covalent to pull out token balances and historical portfolio value and so on uh dexes we're pretty big in the deck space investor dashboards if you want to do something with nfts and show nft valuation models uh that's that's uh you can use that uh taxation is another another big deal uh especially in the d5 space where every single trade is uh a taxable event then you want to find the accurate cost basis uh just numerous use cases all kinds of exotic use cases like uh these uh crowdfunding platforms figuring out if investors are holding on to uh the investment or just dumping it right away and so it gets you a better class of investors uh like uh you know analogy would love to say is that we give you a can of tomato sauce and some pasta and whether you make lasagna or something else it's totally up to you so that's really what the premise of covalent the word covalent comes from covalent bonds in chemistry my apologies for uh for those harrowing memories from high school but the idea here is we're binding centralized systems with d satellite systems so our api looks like a regular rest api but it has it's a window to the entire decentralized uh ecosystem behind that api i think today we index about 12 blockchains and their test nets and the magic of the covalent api is that you only have to change one character literally one character and suddenly your entire application is able to pull out data from another completely independent blockchain so uh yeah pretty excited about the product the team is about 35 people we're mostly based here in vancouver british columbia up in canada and um you know happy to take any questions towards the end but keep the questions coming in i think we'll uh we'll allocate a section for a q a um yeah we're pretty much a pretty open open book uh you know we're very active on discord on twitter on all the social all of social media we have a very active email list as well uh and uh just love being a part of the hacker culture here um yeah now i'm gonna just hand it off to lei who will give us a product demo and talk through some of the more technical bits at covalent thanks guys thank you uh my name is elani or lei i do communications at covalent as of recently if you follow the project um you might have heard of our alchemist program that's actually how i got introduced to this company and i came through the alchemist program as one of the season one or ogs um so you might have seen me as lay in our discord if you're familiar there but uh that's like the first experience that i had using apis and now i'm doing demos so um it's not hard to learn that's like what really differentiates our product is that it's it's like really accessible um so i'm gonna be giving like a basic overview of how to get started uh and then showing you some different use cases some of the recent winners of other hackathons uh for like inspiration and different ideas and then i'll show you uh what ganesh was kind of talking about with like switching that multi-chain thing with one character and being able to like get data on a particular topic but switch it to multi-chain really quickly so i'm just going to share my screen there we go okay so you should be able to see it so yeah the first place that you're going to start to use the api is probably going to be the docs um this is like the overview of everything and all of the different pages you can get here from our main website as well which is just kobeylandhq.com but slash docs is where we're going to start so you can sign up for a free api key and that's how you're going to be able to make calls which you can actually do directly in the browser or however else you want to do it in terminal or whatever how you choose to build um but this is just like the table of contents of the docs page and i'll go through it really briefly so if you have our overview this tells you a little bit more about the product in general compared to like different solutions even though there aren't really that many different solutions it's kind of us and one other but um and then you can see our campaigns so this is like part of our involvement with the community we do regular one million wallets challenges which are wallet design competitions with different partners and then we do dungeons and data and this is a good way to get into using the api if you're more analytics-minded so it's like puzzles and finding different data points in on different blockchains and all of these have prizes associated with them these are supported networks so you can go through all of those blockchains that we index and this will you can see this in the api references as well it'll show you the numbers for all of our supported networks but if you go in the docs it's just going to give you like a little bit more in-depth overview and it'll show you like the supported endpoints as well so you can go through everything here and then in terms of tutorials and getting started the alchemist cookbook is like kind of the knowledge base for everything so you have tutorials how-to guides case studies references really just like all the information is here for different ways to use the api um and this is super helpful for like beginner beginners you really don't need to have any prior experience you can you can get value out of this and for developers one of the really useful things is primer so primer is like an added layer in the api that allows you to filter the responses to make everything even lighter and quicker um but it takes like seconds already depending on what you're doing yeah so more how-to guides here's a link to alpha alarm which is part of what i got involved with in the alchemist program um which is like d5 visuals across different chains that we post on twitter but um this is like a great way to interact with other industry partners and to get people using the api and training and for this hackathon probably a lot of people are going to be looking at developer tools so primer as i mentioned and then this is one of the really useful things that we have which is the topic calculator so for different contact events instead of like scrolling through the events on different block explorers you can just put the contract address in here choose the chain and get events uh and then this is our project showcase so for um some of the events that we've done in the past these are like winners and these are broken down by categories so if you have like governance multi-chain analysis um the wallet stuff like from one million wallets for example nfts dexes and i'll show you a couple of those later but so yeah we're going to go to the api references which is where you can directly make the calls and i'll show you an example a few so um once you get your key you're just going to put it up here and it should update so this is my key um yeah super easy and then on the left side here it's like the contents so you have your overview uh up here this is just gonna like give you again a basic overview but you can find all this in the docs so you can read through that in your own time but it's pretty self-explanatory and so are the end points so we have class a and then class b endpoints class a are like the actions that are applicable on any chain kind of so you can use this for anything of all the different chains we index you can get block heights or like get token holders or get nft transactions which is a pretty cool one um and then class b are the like protocol specific endpoints so for partners so you have like ave sushi swap balancer uni swap compound all of that so if you're doing dex related stuff these are super super useful um and one of the cool ones is network assets you can see like all the different pools um ordered by like balances and stuff and then you just have pricing and points at the bottom uh just grouped together to make it a bit easier so yeah one of the ones that i'm going to demo really quickly is just the get log events by topic hashes because i find that this is like the key to everything this is one of the ones i use most frequently so you start with a question um and for the purpose of this i'm just gonna do like say i wanted to look at crypto punk's sales across different chains so what i'm gonna need to do is find the cryptopunx collection contract in etherscan i usually start on ethereum just because it's like the biggest and kind of the most familiar to work with but you can see here that this is available this is the same contact address on like a whole bunch of other chains so there's sales happening on other chains um so i clicked on a couple of those and we index some of those chains which are like binance and polygon or matic so i'm gonna look at like sales in our api across those three but basically for the log events by topic cache you are just going to scroll down on this page and you can go to the events i like using crypto punks because the uh events are like really well labeled which i can't say is the same for like anything else in blockchain the data is a little bit messy but you can still find everything you need but um if i didn't want to scroll through here i could again put that contract address into our topic calculator and it would show you but so the hash i'm interested in right here is punk bot so these are like the sale events basically and i take this topic zero this is our topic hash so using that in the api um i have it as mavic right now as i was experimenting but all i need to do is put chain in like the id is one for ethereum and then i need to copy and paste that topic hash and you can specify a block range so like a range of time essentially for the size of the the size of the chain but you can also just put latest and it'll work that way too and then you can just click try and i'm loading the one that's the largest right now because ethereum usually has the highest amount of data but yeah so it's going to load directly in the browser um so here i can see the different sales and it's going to tell you like it's going to decode all these parameters right in front of you so uh punk index this is like the exact one that was sold this is the value in you and 256 and then this is the from address and the two address so like the buyer and seller and i can just scroll through all of these different sale events and then as we wanted to look at cross chain like this this is how i'm going to do it so the topic hash remains exactly the same but just the chain id changes so instead of one i'll do 56 that's going to give me finance sales for the same thing and then i can do matic as well or polygon sorry the name change kind of gets me but just go like this yeah and that all updates like right in the browser um so i have it set to just give me like a json response right now because that's the default but if you wanted and you're more familiar with csvs you can just type like csv in here um actually i'll just do it right now and that's going to give you something like this so you can download this directly from your browser or you can like copy and paste it into a spreadsheet and work from there but yeah it's pretty useful um i just wanted to show one more thing that's like kind of a unique cool one which is just the get external nft metadata um so one of the things that's fun if you're interested in nfts it's kind of relevant because they're like booming right now but you could like go on openc for instance and find something that you're interested in uh i chose this one because i like the gifs and it's like fun to use the api with this but if you're interested in knowing like the original owner and the history of sales stuff like that um you can find the collection on etherscan and then i found this specific ones token id so you can click on this on openc and if i want to get metadata for this i just copied that contract address and the token id in the chain and that's like all i need to put in and the response gave me this so i have like the original owner here the name of that nft the description um and then like the current owner and this is the cool part that i find so like the image or the gif or whatever it is you can copy this link right into your browser and it pulls up like a full screen of what the nft is so i've done this in the past for like new releases and stuff like that and we've seen people build bots that do like daily nft sales that uh basically post the metadata on twitter with like different visuals so yeah if you're creative minded that's like just a cool feature but yeah there's a whole bunch of different use cases here um you can use log events by topic hash for like different uh like dex actions like transfers or like mints or withdrawals or things like that or you could just get all of the events for a particular contract here it's really up to you that's like the one billion possibilities um aspect of everything but i'm going to show some of like the recent projects that we've seen come out of here so this was our most recent 1 million wallets which is that wallet design competition so somebody designed this like specter wallet which is really gorgeous uh so you can create one here you can import as well um this also was what part of the one million wallet submission and this is like a really creative take on like a wall display so i wanted to show it because this person's actually interning at covalent which is kind of cool but you can like zoom in and out here uh and you can go all around this like weird molecule looking thing but this actually represents like the wallet so you can click and you can see for this particular contract address or this wallet like all of the different tokens they hold and the balances so this is using like the get portfolio and get token balances for wallet address endpoint and you can change the contract address here so like any of these other ones um the loading thing's cool too i'm just like a sucker for good visuals but yeah you can like go all the way up and around and see whatever this person's holding so that's kind of cool another project is this hestia like nft marketplace that somebody created um and you can browse through all of these again if you go back to the docs and you just look at like here the uh the different projects so like multi-chain analysis governance tools wallets taxes nfts uh etc so yeah that's like a basic overview to get you started i hope that makes sense i kind of breezed through it faster than i was expecting but i guess that gives more time for questions and other components of the api so yeah i'll stop sharing wow thanks no that was great very fun very exciting very educational informative um does anyone have any questions uh feel free to pop your questions down in the zoom chat um or if anyone on youtube happens to or you know any of our live streaming platforms have any questions don't be afraid to pop there as well uh bradley wants to ask how is this different from the graph i can take that one so on the surface it's not different they're both middleware protocols to uh extract data from blockchains the key difference is that we provide a no code solution literally you can use the product from the browser as uh as late demonstrated you don't have to write a sub graph you don't have to do any of that stuff so it's the unified api that that helps you uh extract data with the sub with a graph you need to sit down and write a sub graph so if there's something like uh uh something like crypto punks for example you're not able to get it unless you write a subgraph if you want token balances there's no equivalent of token balances so the way covalent works is we make an exact replica of the entire blockchain so every balance every transaction every log event everything that's on the underlying blockchain and we expose that to the api with a sub graph it's more of a bespoke experience that you need to build for a specific contract so if you want to move from crypto funds to like cryptokitties or you know hashmast they're all different subgraphs which you need to sit down and write equivalent makes all of that automatic so uh yeah we were focused on that last mile uh usage uh and like i said the product philosophy is to use it from the browser uh so i would say those are the key differences of course under the hood it's completely completely different and i've given multiple talks on um you know databases and uh etl pipelines and uh the graph and covalent philosophy but yeah what size support is there for relational joins using the api uh unfortunately there are no joints so the only thing you can do is you can flatten you can aggregate and project but there are no joints and if you need joints you need to do joints using uh application code so uh i don't know if it'll even add joints so one of the things that lei uh pointed out was primer so what primer is is it's a mongodb style query language to do filter projection sort and aggregations and even in mongodb there is a join but it's not very performant so we're just cognizant of the fact that joints can kill performance but if you have a excellent use case where a join is needed which is not accessible through application level joints would love to hear about this because we're always trying to push the envelope of what's possible the graph uses jt tokens to pay fees for crates what's covent's pricing business model and what's the goal for the ctp token yeah so this is another key difference between the graph and covalent most of our customers pay uh for the product and they're all bigger institutions you know enterprises and um and so we do not expose the covalent create token to any of those guys so uh if you're an enterprise you want consistency in your data provider you want to be you able to use something uh like for something like covalent just like how you'd use amazon cloud or azure or or one of these other cloud providers which means consistency in budgeting and payments is necessary and you don't want to expose them to the wallet to leave the token so what actually happens this is not live yet the car the project is completely free for the next year uh so what uh will happen is that you'd go and lock in stable coin and then the stable coin uh is converted to cqt and distributed to the decentralized network on the back end to the validators and the indexing and the query nodes uh so the exposure to the volatility of the covalent token is to the people who are running the network and that's the right way to treat your customers in our opinion of course this is again uh the choices that we've made because we don't want to expose our developers and our users uh to anything besides stable coin how do you store the data so great question so right now what is happening is that we copy all of this data into a postgres database and and then we have the api sitting on top of the and it's exactly right it's the single point of failure that is the reason for us to decentralize lots of projects have different stories for why one they want to decentralize some people want to remove uh you know economic middlemen some people want to remove the censorship capabilities or the permissionless nature or single point of failure for us what is most important is the the single point of failure so right now this big humongous database which is multiple terabytes billions of rows of data is uh stored on the cloud uh in i think in oregon and that is a single point of failure not only that if you're connecting from asia you need to make a complete round trip which is also slow and so the next phase uh which will come in the next three or four months you should definitely hook up with our dev team uh because we're rolling out the validator program is where shards of this blockchain are going to be distributed across the globe so anyone can go in and participate and host a portion of this network and obviously you're going to be compensated for your uh for providing that service so i think public utilities cannot have a single point of failure and uh that's our vision for the beat satellites network how decent lights is covalent right now covalent is completely centralized so the decentralized pieces comes with how you extract the data and if you read a white paper there's something called a block specimen which is a unique innovation we've brought to the space and the block specimen code uh will be open sourced within within the next couple of weeks so it's a matter of uh you know progressively decentralizing covalent and i would say i'm pretty excited about the roadmap but there's going to be no changes and no disruption to the way people consume the data it's just automatically going to be way cheaper and way faster which you know everyone loves these are some great questions okay how long does it take for new data to uh on some chain to get indexed so we promise our developers to block uh latency which means that on something like ethereum if the block time is uh 13 seconds two blocks is 26 seconds so 26 seconds we are 26 seconds behind in a case of something like matic which is three seconds we are six seconds behind that's two blocks and something like clayton something like uh some of the faster blockchains like the bse where literally like two blocks behind so that's our consistency across the board um so what that means is that uh you can use this for historical balances you can use the log events you can use all of this stuff but if there's a state changing function so for example you're going to a screen where you're asking uh people to deposit into a luxury proof example we recommend that you do not use covalent and directly hit the web 3 node to get the latest balances that's the only way to keep it 100 accurate awesome those were some really really great questions and great answers to those questions um and of course just a reminder to everyone if you do have any like follow up questions after the presentation that you happen to think of um you can always hop into the global discord and then ask in the covalent sponsor channel um as i'm sure lay in ganache ganesh would be really really happy to answer your questions there as well um but i don't see any more questions in the zoom chat and i just want to thank everyone for coming uh this morning thank everyone for their time and especially thanks to the awesome presentation by the uh covalent team thanks for having us that was super fun i'm excited to see all the projects come out of this hackathon it looks it looks great it's going to be hype i'm so excited all right thanks everyone thank you
