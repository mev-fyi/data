foreign [Applause] [Music] Mass project I'm an architect of inbox IMAX is a stateless and it will make reserve a global purposes then it announces their Holy Spirit related word today I want you guys to bid online application that traverses it over later tools the max printer overview inbox first stateless means that power leaders do not need to have databases instead of bird leaders clients are logic can bandage each transactions in Max the client-side logic is infinitely recursive zgb foreign this process unlimited times unlike usual regards of GDP infinite recursive gkp can verify the whole chain of the GBP by verifying only one previous 3gp proof once you verify the previously you be proof that has already contained their Pro prior to that also the proof contains approve prior to it so the probing chain reaches the origin of this chain how to remove the transaction data from layout coordinator this is one of the most important parts we introduced limited Online requirements to the yellow lab and this improved both efficiency and privacy this algorithm rooms almost all own gen data from the yellow lab so it's 95 cost reduction compared with other digital apps a barometer liter marker problem the results of transactions to users after they sent transaction to the validator this proof can be used for Wizarding assets to lay a while with cgp a double spend or double exit is Impossible by there no movement proof which is using no inclusion proof like fmd they're aggregated lists of transactors in codender this is how animals works statelessly or in the Mercury root of the many transaction hashes and deposit is recorded in layover as described the users will merge the transaction to their off-shay strange by transaction ZB if we have the result leader of smart contract executions from the other layer zones in this depository like this we can use these states or conditions of token transfers and minting okay next let's start with an application first install the tools to using mugs Crohn's repository from the intmus run up there I open the thumbnail and get Chrome build the CLI code into the leave me check if loss is installed if not please install it beforehand build the zeroi if you see something like this when you're done you have succeeded configure area settings for easy use of CLI run the help command to confirm thus we create an account or in Max with the default Rod so that when the when we run commands with that specifying account that icon will be referenced cradle account or Bob as well R is issues 10 tokens or end marks which we call RS token since they were ish Baris artist transfers are always talking to Bob check the balance after the transfer and you can see that Alice has nine tokens and Bob has one dog let's take a look at the interoperability feature first write the private key to the dot evm EMB file be careful not to transfer any of Maintenance assets sees the key or recently written is a private key for testing purposes rewrite this part to your private key deposit is on scroll on the address corresponding to the private key 0.05 research is enough for this thing next Carol makes a deposit on this on scroll at the address corresponding to the private key next we create Carol of the guns switch to Bob's account and issue Bob token check that the balance has increased next make an offer to Bob to pay one Bob token or indmarks if Carol paid 0.0 the one is on scroll this operation will take one minute if it succeeds the offer is accepted if he succeed zero offer is accepted and so record the offer ID accept their previous offer on camera with account replace the part marked offer ID with their with the ID you just received and run the inbox activated command lucky up there Carol's account we can see that the Bob toggle has indeed been transferred we will now develop an app for inbox to interoperate with the other evm content compatible Networks create npm project install node.js if not already installed can't install hardhead this operation takes one minute Creator project okay module instruments finished we can see that the log contract has been generated this time we will create a simple auction construct and explain how to create a normal contract so the first one is it's without IMAX install the NASA module make it possible to import inbox interoperability plugin contract once installed we fix the solid version back to their simple auction construct we can import the offer manager contract by writing it like this from here we will write code using indmarks in the Constructor we store the address so the address of there the offer manager in strange in the Constructor causer register function this this function corresponds to their ink Maxi register in the CLI and once they're a simple auction control has transferred a certain amount or more through the offer manager to their message in their their token specified in several asset ID is transferred to the seller amount to your address on emags Sarah in Marx is written to be updated with each bid so that it's written to you when there's no bid save the issue for added to strange next we modify the bit function we use their update taker function to allow their higher beta to specify the address to receive the talking only marks finally the crane function is modified if there's even one bidder we call their offer managers activate function which triggers their transfer or inbox by sending is to their larger bidder function beer of our manager also remove the code for withdrawal amount of line 18 which is forgotten in this video if they're no bidders cause a deactivate function to pretend that there was no offer the visual function does not need to be modified their send applies function is removed because it is no longer needed after the previous modification finally check that completion passes deploy contract to scroll and prepare script to execute transaction register RPC URL on private key for school offer death net the private keys were obtained from their dot EMV file the address specified in in their dot m file must help the score for definite is deported install.m5.m Library I copy the script from sample auction app the start auction function is executed by giving their serousint math address the minimum bid is set to 0.001 is bid runs cabin there in Mark's address of the buyer but not their point desert please this function get auction info get the card better wrong claim it fails because the auction has been opened for less than two minutes so just wait for a moment I run climb again this time it succeeds and you get an explanation of what to do only mugs it shows their balance before activating to see the token moving on inbox to the ocean winner activate zero four after the activation we can see that the tokens have indeed been removed finally the server performs a wizard function to receive the winning bit so this is the example contract and example project and finally there yeah okay the receipt receipt is complete under the this auction is now over thanks so much for your time
