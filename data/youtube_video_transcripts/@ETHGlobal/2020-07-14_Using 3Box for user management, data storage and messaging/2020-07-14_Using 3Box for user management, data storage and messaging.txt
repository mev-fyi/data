okay we're good alright welcome everybody to a hack offense workshop this time we've got one of our sponsors and partners three-box with us Zach Freeland an engineer with three bucks is going to be giving it intro and overview and some code walkthrough to what three bucks actually is and how you can use it in your project so thank you Zach for taking the time to teach us a little bit about the project today if everybody doesn't know the week one check-ins are happening this today and yesterday so make sure to check out your cohort channel drop an update about what you've been working on what your project is so it's interesting to see where different people are at different stages and then once we have that information the youth global team is able to kind of help you get rid of any blockers or challenges that you're facing so make sure to do that if you're not in a cohort channel it might be because you haven't created your project name yet or added a project so the way you get around that is by going to your hacker dashboard and just creating something it could be a placeholder name but just make sure to do that and then we'll get you into core and then the little logistics things will be all settled for the rest of the event Before we jump into it does anybody want to give a one-sentence update for what they've been working on just one sentence nothing too long you can put it in the chat you can unmute I'm just curious what where people are at they want to share anything yeah there we go save it and well yeah yes we have been working for implementing 35 good inches document on top of ceramic ceramic cousins with three box this is yeah topic anybody else we'll take one more before we jump into it sure I'm working on a contacts app it's a hopefully going to be able to allow you to enter your own contact information but then you know subscribe to other people and then you slowly build up a contacts address book but you're not updating any of the contact other information other than your own and you're just getting the information from other people awesome you guys are both in the right place you learn about three box and user IDs contacts stuff like that this is perfect all right Zack I will let you take it away and start your work great yeah thanks to the intro it's like Trent said I'm going to do basically a little intro and they walk through some things we have a brief overview and then probably just stress on the code and cod dive a little deeper since we are built on IP fast in orbit to be kind of show it like some Thunder lion looks things look like glory API I can share screen here right all right cool see see our three box and just as we provide a user centric data identity layer for your applications basically what that means is you can authenticate when the theorem account and then you get access this keychain that which you can then link data link other accounts permission data then you can kind of take that and build these other primitives on top of it so some of the most common use cases we saw early was profiles for example someone things you can do is you can blink and ethereum account and you can link it to all this profile data so you can write data to a public store these things look like just basically key value stores so you could add a name an image you can link a Twitter proof that kind of thing and then other people are able to resolve this data and SDB like said this is all an IP FS part of this as well is there's also private space so you can also crypt data with the same keychain and if you for example go to one app and then go open it up to another you could authenticate there and resolve the same data there as well the end up with this like shared local cache across applications beyond that there's also these things called spaces so in a similar theme you had two permissioning data to the application so if you're running an application you don't have to run a backends or anything you kind of create a space and a user can store the stuff you get this key value store and then users can store stuff and you can price stuff this basically the user and the same thing they could bring that and permission that data to another application if they wanted sir provides you all the ways to do that um so I'll see here a good place to start building on it it's gonna come to our docks here and it has a walk through basically the different pieces I sit all separated here it's like what identity looks like all the profiles these storage mechanisms yeah I guess I forgot this messaging so on top of these things you can also then using the same primitives is basically build threads and chat systems and things like that so say you have like something like a common system you can resolve profiles you can also have the comments in a thread and these data structures can be shared based off with BP and ipfs so see some of those yeah these kind of go in kind of detail if you want a quick start the main thing of the interacting with is something called tree box yes so starmade javascript library and if you're gonna influence on your app you just pull this library in and they use these all functions here and use write and read functions so I'll go through those in a moment often when people are first starting to kind of implement so we do have a few things they're easy to pop in your projects besides just like if you were gonna build your whole like data layer on three blocks alone you could a lot of people start with these we have a few basic react plugins that kind of show and give you a good idea what this stuff looks like I was just saying so one of the things what I said was like profiles so like a lot of places the apps just showing just the theme addresses like in leaderboards or comments or anything else it says showing that you can actually show a hover that results with this data for the profile it's got like so it looks like here it's like you're showing address before the leaderboard so some people influent than these were social addresses you can't resolve to date in the profile nicely you can actually have verifiable links like hub and Twitter in here and then there's just like this kind of metadata images I attach the story 91st and names snake you bring this thing of stuff you don't want to store on chain or so storing like that's just a unstructured blob and ipfs now you have a way to resolve this data bring it into your own adversity in other places um another one of those plugins is comments plugin so it's a before it so with the comments I should look like here's like an example of it here so it's all built in three blocks in a space and a thread again they're resolving through box profiles here in these daters this data stored and uh log here all these comments are signed I say if you're listening to this live you'd actually be listening to the same thread so so in every three blocks anytime you get using three blocks yes you're actually burning an IPS note in the browser and that's actually connecting to basically pops up runs through these same DBS and topics so you can get updates here it's only time I'd read a comment here that we sent out to other peers or through our printing service as well this is one implementations another one of these kind of chat boxes somewhere so there's been these have been some of the easy ways that people have quickly added some social features into their apps let's see so I'll go over to a little bit of a demo now kind of what it looks like underneath and some of the pieces were ushered in I kind of like what our in for our set up looks like yeah during this part like feel free to ask any questions at any point and at the end we'll save a bunch of time to basically help anyone who already started likes implementations or has any questions about what we're doing they also mention Eric before I commissioned a little bit at the end of this mostly just be like three blocks part and it'll give kind of idea of what drove like thinking about ceramic after you see here so this is not too fancy an example up there's just a simple page using do box just like I said it's already connected so authenticate here let's see like to reload this yeah so part of this is we have this thing called 3d Kinect now so the keychain they sell your underlying keys are now managed in this iframe eventually they could be like you know the wallet certain medevac and they could have like a similar RPC layer for these kind of like identity or permissioning functions right now like sits the iframe so space asking me when I said ok I signed a message and then I'm dragging a keychain from that for use in three box sorry here says basic do I use my profile it also asked me if I want to access like a space after if I open one of those so I press Continue here this is an account already had ice already like signing this message I have this keychain available ready and yeah so one of the things that helps us link this all together like identity big part of it's a permission is data a bill to measure keys bill to bring it to different contexts like this one so we use something called JD's these are decentralized identifiers basically you the idea is you end up with this opaque identifier that you can use that then to resolve like immaterial mainly like for example you can use this identify or resolve public keys so if you're signed it in any way you could resolve it to this identifier and then verify those data payloads that yeah I mean you have to resolve it with any centralized one you can have these different they see anyone can fill in different D ID methods part is there's a specific one to us the three box so you see the prefix here and our DoD implementation is also implemented on ipfs so you could probably recognize this right here so like that dark I think I'll show that after but like so than anything we do right now is you take this D ID and then you can link it to an attorney about dress and what this does here is this is creating a proof like so I'm signing it with mine for example my my F key and I'm also signing it with my lady keychain after as well that Chris approved anyone else can resolve these two things and see that these two things are linked to each other so you can see here for example actually just Oh get this right here see so the box object on the window I'll just get it from yeah so these deities like I said Arthur and ipfs so if you're using our did resolver which is this three it resolves this they see I profess object you can see what the this actually looks like so temple says the keys here sign and key also has these other key material here so you can see in this one as my signing key so this is yeah so anyway you know once I you'll see after once i standed this data in here i base resolving this the ID and I get in the signing key and I can verify that payload as encryption key management key is just the address so it's kind of how you update these kind of documents where now you get the single document but in the future like in the context of ceramics you could link loss of accounts you could do key rotation so that kind of things right now looks just like this so yeah so like I said we have this public store this is kind of where mostly profile stuff is so I can just add something here so I set some data these values here yeah now I have the same exemple open um set a domain here so open up there as well you you yeah so like I say if you go to no domain now it's gonna look similar to like you'll see again basically 3d Connect will pop up it's not another domain it sounded like do I want to now permission this data and give access to this page to build to like you know decrypt a space or or load that data so first continue now this domain good access to resolve the rest of that and open it up here so give the same like in a private store and have access to this keychain inside the iframe to decrypt this data so you can imagine like this would be a different app and you need a bill to bring this space in this data here and load it yeah so then so it's gonna show here so like I said three boxes built on orbit DB which is this DB layer built on top of IP FS and they implement these basically these data logs so it's an easy way to get like before for profile for example if you're an app you might just throw that data in a blob push the thigh be fast in the end of this unstructured I did no one else can resolve reply it's hard to update so like you're gonna update it you'd be pushing a new object each time this is like a good way to the key value stores on top of it and you do that by building an underlying chain and log of values since it's kind of like a change log some people like filmer I guess with C or D T's that's what that's the format for but sure like what the underlying data actually looks like that you're seeing here so I just opened up the underlying values as you can see each one of these entries is an ID so you get these C IDs right here these hashes each one's entries these resolves these objects here you can see this metadata some puppet deities so you see the actual payload here like so the cool thing is they're signed with these C IDs so it's an identity also this right here just creating a proof also - you have like a temporal key in the browser this is also creating a link between see id Nike signing this payload here and like so you can resolve then the public key through the doc verify this payload and now anyone else can load this data and verify it and you don't need the trust where it came from just like a blue trust were like what the did is it's another peer if they we had the same DB open I want to listen to it I can right up to here they could get this they could verify that this came from this D ID and the context could be like verify likes it came from this with your address for example so you see some of the logs here see these things build a chain of values you can see this is firms in the next so the prior entry and that is one of these objects up here we're gonna go see a like this one right here and yet the cool thing is if you wrote these these two pages could be entirely disconnected if they were offline I could write values to both wants to come back online I can share these with one pure another and then build a similar chain locally again verify it and then construct this key value store here one of the things we have that kind of makes it possible right now is we run a three-block spinning service so all this data is pinned in our infrastructure right now also like I said if other peers are open at the same time like no thread you'd be storing all that thread data on your client in the browser so each one you have all these local caches but I said if any of those go offline or they're not available to sync it we are like storing syncing at all on ours eventually we want like a bunch of service providers to provide similar services or you Deaton build to select different providers in different context and either choose like let's say if you want to put it in persistent file corn or you want to just persist in some other form guru some service provider that has some guarantees yeah and like I was saying before if you're actually influenced in application it looks the same but you would you might make a separate space we're out this is permissioning it separately so it's asked me again like do I want to give this app access to this space so I'm gonna say yes I'm signing a thing here Herman so then I got the space and like if I had an application I just have this and then if I went to another app and said they might ask can you use my app space I'll say yes the same thing here and this kind of doesn't allow granular permission like over two separate keys right now but it's a good way to kind of get a similar effect the last thing I'll show quickly is that we have threads as well these are built on the same underlying logs instead of building key value stores you just have a you know you have a word list of comments or the kind of data or event changes or you know whatever you need there it's all open thread let's see I shall create a confidential thread so we do have a few options for threads you can create a public one anyone can write to it you can create one with one or more moderators the moderators can delete comments and stuff you can create a Members Only thread which basically as these action controllers for just allowing certain dids or certain addresses to write data to the thread and then similarly you can have member once which are also encrypt it's a set of members so I'll just create thread here to space them in a thread you see on the moderator I do it so there's Daddy here for this space it's a thread address I'll write some things yes I'll come to this page and let's see I open up the same space actually what is it called at my hub so it's open let's see it the same as I could just the sound was open to buy for a dress enough actually I might a disconnect them reconnect them welcome back to the after it's also less interesting with the same user but you had multiple users basically opening these up you could add thread members and so that's Minister Nexus controller where they see you're creating a separate encryption key for the thread and I said just like now you have these days you can resolve this to all the keys you can crypt it's their public keys and how these in the access controller they can then fetch this data then get that key and decrypt these entries so that's what usually would happen here yeah this is the most of it I'm glad to well actually well I mean I guess to say the last thing one thing we do crews in library as well one things we also run Basin API API service that kind of it indexes these DBS as well so you don't always have to open the pipe ipfs instance in the browser sink that data we also index most of the public data so like profiles and spaces and you can get that to the library as well that doesn't like to write it you can quickly read data from any of the public items and public threads as well I guess I'm I got this one there we go it's just loading kind of slow yes finally eventually loaded these entries here if I type something here we'll see it get it pretty quickly here same thing as a moderator I can delete posts I said they do stay in the underlying log still centreline dater still there I'll show quickly just what these look like they look pretty similar so do too let's see um yes suddenly like his log his values payloads what this look like here so you can see that these are just encrypted values and then quickly I'll show they steal I said these have also acts controllers and these actions controllers are stored there's similar way in the log so I can get that same thing several logs out from here the axe control just has one entry right now since I was just added as a moderator when I created it less I basically do is you create its who the D ideas capability and I said then you can there's all the public key for that di D and encrypt key for this threads that user so folks might have someone else it simply do the same thing for an entry here that when i sync all this stuff locally if i have access to it i look at that key and decrypt yeah so that's the list adjust a three bucks right now [Music] any questions I see there's some things in the chat you yeah is anything going to do for the format for questions do you just ask them to chat or open up the thing we lost asking yeah yeah it looks like some people have written out questions but see Danny and Dennis there - is there anybody who hasn't had their question answered and just wants to jump in with audio sure yes so um sometime to join a confidential thread using an identity wallet instance but it doesn't work like it just stops like when I'm I'm able to join them public thread but then confidential threads to join by thread address method just doesn't resolve okay yeah I can look into the after this we did have yes for context like we also something called a Danny wallet which manages the keys just specific three blocks so if you indicating three blocks law you could use it any wallets VC managed to D ID and the keychain here for three bucks so we're on a server where you want to like linked accounts in a different way you can use it any wall there or didn't have like context where you could get a what three provider because otherwise that's the interface right now yeah I think we test a little bit less of the identity wallet so I can sync with you on think it's you on slack out there thank you you um is it possible to login via a meta mask or another wallet or something like that or I can see on the homepage you can kind of do that when I log into the three box website yeah exactly yes all right now three box always takes a web any web tree provider to use an authentication method to drive you straight through box and how do you hook into that in your code how do you make it pop up the box basically that lets somebody log in yeah so that's all part of the three box library right here that's one thing we didn't really see so step two the dogs here this we're gonna use it you just create a box and then knuth in a cave user and at this point that's when he's gonna use that kind of iframe thing it's called it's three thready connects there's just another thing I said it's actually running a Jenny wallet which is talking about the master keys but when you do that obviously ask whatever web tree provider that's passed here so you pass a provider here decide with that kind of meta mask a web connect and those kind of things and then it will pop up the relevant sort of boxes for those yeah I got a kind of architecture I'm thinking of using it one a sanity check it I'm gonna have some databases which are going to be using I think textiles buckets and the idea is that one user might have access to five or six buckets or something like that and so each bucket would have its own private key and my idea was to maybe put those private keys in the private part of three box so that a number of people could all have access to the same bucket and you know there's no way of removing access but but it gives me a way of sharing groups is that a good use of three box is that a good way of architecting it or is there a better way of doing something like that yeah when yeah and I'm supposed to feel like in a hackathon a good way to like kind of get a summer thing an abstraction is to use like a thread as a log to manage it some of our we're doing like an accident so you could use like the D IDs here and one and one of the confidential threads basically create a log of a way to share yaki materials are like access through that to other things I don't know if you don't have like separate keys but if you had just like a single key there you're creating each time you could then like store that in the log and like so same as our extra controllers so my my buckets are gonna behave as if they users basically so the buckets are each gonna have their own private key and then you may have in your in your three books you might have access to six buckets therefore you've got six private keys in there and then other people might have access to these same buckets yeah and in the show access you have to share the the key to share their private key somehow mechanism for doing that yeah yeah no I think it usually a thread secure way to manage that and manage that between users probably like any that kind of metadata yeah it might not be optimal overall you might want to as part of like I said I actually part of like the dating method or just have these extra keys there and eventually like the stuff mr. Remmick makes it easier to like once these accounts and permission he's and access and they can be how do we share a thread between a selected group of users how do I make it so that other people can't see that thread how do I get somebody to join a thread or invite somebody to join a thread yeah for confidential threads don't think it's to keep track of there's like the thread address here ya know with that they could resolve any but sometimes thing as hard as you have to know like the D ID well I guess yeah or just you have to know the heath address where the D ID of the other goods you want to invite to it if there's an encrypted thread it's just a public one and you want to like encrypt stuff yourself for managing all the way then you have to know the thread address and anyone can resolve that without any X direction yeah anybody else wanna unmute and ask their questions they see a few more and Danny from the three blocks scene is here as well other day if you want to give a briefing on ceramic after or not I would have a very simple one I do other contracts on etherium business for three books there's nothing there's no contracts for this transaction read this in green so there's yeah there's actually no transactions alright now it just takes it just uses I three Macau it just needs another key pair as a way to authenticate and manage the keychain here as well yeah exactly so it could actually be on any test net on any it could be used across them and you can easily link other chains and other things in the future as well as long as you have a kita yeah drive down authenticates this keychain Danny did you want to talk about ceramic a little bit if you can jump on audio should should probably check these still here maybe not audio issues sometimes we if you have wireless headphones they don't like to yeah anyways yeah just it's like going beyond what we kind of built here and taking all our learnings here is ceramics women things working on a lot of same things like how we were managing it's like right now it resolves like busy all these links in to data to other accounts to managing your keys permission as those keys there's something you can do in these documents and ceramic sage a being like you also don't have to just use because there's some limitations for this kind of data structure it's like you can see oh geez in some context makes a lot of sense but there's also pretty slow sinking in it often you might want a spectrum of different properties depend on your application so idea is like you've been should build a resolve that to other data stores and those service providers furnish services you needed brother it's like persisting good or anything else so you could actually use like 3ds what textile as well other basically any other database layers like that as like the identity provider in those so you could be signing stuff and resolving keys through ceramic and tray-tease and then the same thing like if you need certain other properties below that like say you need to index and service need like a persistence layer anything like that you could have basically you would have these documents that point to these service providers and kind of say how you want to deal this data what kind of relationship you have there and then other people can resolve these things as well yeah I think we've talked more about that and all up stuff or you'll find us on slack as well oh yes Missy I'm just gonna see if we can get the call in number Danny wants to call in and give some more context so we'll just hang out for one more second any any hackers I want to share if they plan to use three box or kind of what what ideas they're working on right now specifically related is it okay for me to go here I mentioned a little bit about this in the in the comments on zoom but I'm kind of putting off working on this bigger project and focusing on a smaller thing because the bigger project I don't think I would be able to get it done within the hackathon but the bigger project is making it possible for giving an application that allows the user to manage their data and then just tie in identity like different identities to a segment of that data maybe also doing it through these profiles that are set to be either read or write maybe those profiles follow a schema of some sort so that multiple different apps of a similar type could know how to access the data that it's getting access to through that profile and then you tie that identity to the profile and then you can log in with that identity and that and it automatically has access to the subset of data that you've connected to it and the application you know now has access to that identity whatever you need to do but you have this manage for this management tool that manages all the data and connects that data to these profiles and then the add identities to the profile I don't know if you have any thoughts about that if you think that that's like really close or really far away or what needs to come in to start what needs to be developed to make that happen now yeah it's definitely love fonts weird thing about which Tremec so sound like right now it's very limited into like the missing even though we have destruction so like first case that people were just storing in the building taps and they weren't print stuff on chain I said these pretty like in the blob and ipfs like one step I was at least putting it in some structured form and having it like in some basically key Valley form that people can other people can read it it's still practically like it's hard without schemas so like really know how to resolve and like actually consume that data in an easy way in a different context it's still kinda hard like like creating that mechanism to do it and like I said you want you definitely want to spread like people have respect from of needs for their apps and like this is not gonna be the one for all of them so like people might want to just build push bigger files push stuffs in different structure Sood hope like that kind of metadata and that kind of coordination takes place like in these kind of documents in some form they said that like and like you're saying has all these links and you might resolve it through it could be any like underlying data provider and then the scheme is a separate and the identities can also be resolved through like a like a three ID here or like any other D ID provider as well there's any other identities so it makes a lot of sense when I initially started thinking about this I was it looked like ceramic was the tool I would need to use but I've been focused totally on three box with ceramic be that tool or in the future would it be the one tool that I would need to use and three box would just be an implementation or would I still continue to use three boxes like the developer friendly API for ceramic underneath because I know that three box plans to use ceramic - yeah exactly but like I said three voxer just be like most of stuff entry box like all the stuff you saw was like links and like permissioning stuff like schema sex control would be in ceramic instead of three blocks and three blocks and more look like would actually almost just be like orbity be with like this identity layer and like way to resolve that stuff - ceramic that's why it's kind of like an iteration of where we're moving doesn't Andy stop the links the ID stuff out of like what's - box now more into ceramic do you know the library from ceramic would be available to start using I know it exists right now but I also like I've read that it's still heavily under development yeah it's pretty early I think some teams are trying to create basically some of these documents it's like the form that for what like asking would look like Ryu would resolve data it's really different service providers and stuff so I think some cool exploring that we have like basic ways to create the documents checkpoint them and stuff and verify them yeah it's not used in three box Jess yeah that will be coming and like it's still a few months out and then that would be the point we build so like so attach other providers and other cool thanks man yep Louise uh feel of input so like how are you imagine like connecting these things in some way and if it yeah if it makes sense to fit in these documents or how they look like any did you want to add anything to that looks like you got in successfully yeah I think I'm here I didn't catch a lot of the reviews AK game but it sound like he covered a lot of it but other specific questions that more context is useful I will leave that to people in the chat who did most of the questions get answered [Music] and all of my questions get answered although I would love to keep talking about ceramic if there's something more that there is to cover but maybe we've covered everything yep I think we also talked about doing a separate session on ceramic maybe sometime next week so we can dive deep into that then as well all right Zack if there's nothing else you'd like to cover we could probably wrap up there and I'm this now I think there's a little finding three I'll be in the box channel as well awesome well thank you for going through all this stuff and there was a good discussion as well appreciate you and Danny hopping in answering some questions this is gonna be useful for people and like all the workshops we recorded it so if anybody missed something and want to go back through this will be available on the Eagle YouTube channel and we'll make sure to drop it into three box channel as well in the heck of us lack alright thank you everybody for coming out and I will see you in slack I keep like several
