i guess we can begin now so welcome everyone to hack fest 2021 so today we're joined with 650 hackers from across 61 countries and 18 time zones so this is the judging format there will be four minutes for demos and three minutes for q a with a 10 minute break every six to eight teams now let's look at the judging criteria the judges will be looking for technicality originality practicality ui ux dx and the wow factor but remember this isn't a competition people are here to learn people are here to explore what's possible they're all not aiming to create businesses hackers are here to get valuable feedback from our judges speaking of our judges let's introduce them judges would you like to introduce yourselves yeah i can go first i'm david i'm with protocol labs i generally do product management or technical project management most recently have worked on nft.storage and web3.storage which some of you might be familiar with through the hackathon so excited to see all the cool things that you all came up with hey i'm jose i am kind of a jack of all trades i'm currently working on architecting a product for this company called bread and this virtual influencer name little michaela that is going to be blockchain powered but that's all i can say about it before that i co-founded a tokenized real estate platform back in 2019 and i also have a design background i've done tech mentorship fourth global a few times and excited to come back as a judge and see what folks have built thank you so much judges now let's begin with our demos so we'll start off with team interstellar thoughts so they'll have four minutes for presentations their demos and then they'll have three minutes for q a so team interstellar thoughts please feel free to start whenever you're ready your four minutes will start as soon as you start presenting today's social media is highly centralized it's become normal for social interaction to happen on a platform that's owned by a giant company with millions or even billions of users in web 2 it's too difficult expensive and risky for people to run their own servers how can we get back to a future where interoperable social servers are run by individuals and small groups the interstellar concept uses web3 ipfs and filecoin to create a protocol for servers to host the thoughts of social groups small or large with minimal expense to server runners and freedom of cross-server interaction and migration for users forever anyone can run a server they can configure it for just friends and family use invitations or leave it open to the public today we're demoing interstellar thoughts a proof of concept server that anyone can run which enables thoughts to be posted by their users which can be reposted by other users to other servers across the entire network servers receive and verify web3 signed posts from their users storing recent content locally then eventually and regularly bundling the archives for storage to ipfs if a server goes down or even loses data routine archival to ipfs means data is easy to recover by either server runners or even savvy users even in the event of a data breach no private user data is ever stored on the server this enormously reduces the expense and stress for a server runner the interstellar server protocol lends itself to many types of subprojects but its first proof of concept is a program called interstellar thoughts of which a short demo follows okay so here is a server that we have made with the interstellar protocol and you can see that there are a bunch of posts here made by various people you can see that the ethereum address actually generated a random image for their wallet so you can kind of tell them apart by profile picture it's like a profile picture um here i can go see the posts that i've made just two and i can go and visit somebody's individual profile and see what posts they've made this person is also made to and i can go to this person and this person is actually this is an interesting profile because there have made enough posts that their posts were archived to ipfs so all of the ones that it just got were loaded from ipfs they were they were all backed up not locally and then i can put up a post myself so i thought i like this server and i can post sign by the wallet and there it is now i'm going to come over here to brave on which i have a completely different interstellar server open it's it's just it's it's completely unique from this one however you can see that from this profile picture that somebody from here and here has posted and it's um they're two different um posts but from the same person and i have my own profile over here as well and because it's a different wallet it's a different address it's a different icon as it happens this is me over here and this is me over here and the really interesting thing about interstellar servers is that they're interoperable so if i like a post over on this server um i can drag it over i can sign it and here it is straight away and as i said these are two completely different servers um but now i have it over here and there we are that's the interoperability of the interstellar protocol across two different servers thank you for watching thank you for your presentation now let's move on to the three minutes of q a yeah i thought it was awesome uh just out of curiosity were you all using like uh js ipfs or go ipods directly or we're using a different tool it's using um it's using web3.storage okay cool cool yeah um if you had more time to work on this project what are some features that you would want to add to it um there's actually quite a few things that we uh that we even hope to have by demo time that are still work so i've actually linked in the chat if anyone's interested there's a plans page there but i'll give you a sample of some of them um you know there's a couple of things to clean up just housekeeping about you know how it works and so forth um particularly um one of the things you really want to do is migration right so you are able to move your entire profile to another server all the groundwork is there for it but um it needs to do some web three storage housekeeping um you know the ability to unpin from one server while the new server goes and crawls it makes sure that it's pinging and so forth um as far as i can tell the webstore it doesn't actually have unpinning at the moment you have to go into the admin interface that's that's fine it's a uh it's not a huge deal um even if um even without that so a basic migration is basically there um you know uh some really cool things would be um the formatting extensions right so different servers could run they can say links become links or they can say links become images or they can link to even better right and different servers can choose what they want to embed um identity features will be great display names iconography that kind of thing um one thing that we um we actually got up and running after the dylan was um an aggregation server right so the ability to aggregate posts from different different things and sort them all together see them in order um to improve on that though we wanted to be you know live right use web sockets to talk to them oh yeah come on has it here on the screen yeah this is the aggregate over here um let me see you know other cool things uh would be to turn it into a discussion forum application or other applications in general um i think like collaborative applications will be really cool uh with this using crdts and things like that um the ability for people to sponsor like donate to posts that they like and have that displayed you know by a contract um would be i i think would be a really popular thing um and there's some other stuff too but that's that's some of the things that we would do well um and uh i guess one last thing just out of curiosity how does uh kind of the discoverability of new posts work um um in the beginning um we figured it would be pretty much word of mouth you know someone has running a server like hey come check out my server kind of like people do discord servers you know um so to be honest that didn't seem like a priority right like um that's that if if a server has its own momentum then it boosts the network you know what i mean and and once that server is sort of out there then if people are cross-posting by dragging and dropping and so forth and if these aggregation servers kind of pick up um then maybe they can even promote content that was found over here uh but not really haven't really thought too specifically about that aspect just because i think it'll kind of boost itself in the beginning um so that's that's that's necessary that one really yeah it's a bit like um it's like in the way that um you know discord servers currently work where people say you know join my discord join my server that kind of thing as well and also we did have a small ideas and remember about the um the stargazing aspect possibly where people can come to a section where where all of the the servers are maybe displayed and and uh servers with similar activity are beside each other and things like this and you it's like there's a visual for it and people can go and explore servers in that way just a small idea but it's just a it's a thought awesome yeah thank you so much for your presentation great work guys let's move on to the next team which is team carbon reviews thank you very much take care yeah hello team carbon reviews you'll have four minutes for your demo and three minutes for your q a and i'll be putting in reminders in the chat please feel free to start whenever you're ready hello everyone we are going to demonstrate you our project carbon reviews we are students from 42 kuala lumpur we have just learned about the blockchain technology a months ago we have built an immutable and tamper-proof rebuild system to track the products carbon footprint so with carbon reviews the use of smart contracts can eliminate the need of central authority you can also requires the user to register using valid credit card number and ethereal address this tree ring can map to a unique user id so in addition carbon rebuild token is issued only upon successful product purchase so this can prevent the users that didn't buy the project to leave a review we have used the smart contract back free storage and scaffolding so the smart contracts allow rebuilds to be returned only when prerequisite conditions are met the battery storage is used because it is a cheaper storage alternative that ensures data persistence here we are going to do a quick demo of our product whenever a user buys a product he would be provided a review token let's say i would want this nomad tumbler here i will click by going to the nomad tumbler under this drop down menu will show that one token is available and since the user has not bought any other products we would observe that no other tokens are available let's enter a review comment for this nomad tumblr entering the review will process the review in web3 storage and ipfs as you can see the number of tokens has reduced moving over to our web3 storage we would be able to view that the transaction has just been entered it was just a couple of minutes ago going to the cie and clicking the review json here we'll be able to see that this review has been entered into ipfs if a user and this a review where he does not have a review token there would be a prompt indicating that the user does not have sufficient tokens i'll move on to another burner account just to demonstrate that any user would be able to view all reviews for a particular product clicking view review here i would be able to view the review for the second item and as you can see this get json function here fetches the review directly from the ipfs link which is stored in our blockchain these mapping and modifiers within the smart contract to create multiple layers of security protocol we saw reviews along with the product id and the reviews address in the json format on the webpage storage as you can see before and we store the cid returned from the ipfs on the smart contact to make it temporable so people can't edit it and lastly we read the finality from web free storage to input and present the reviews in a meaningful way for even for users to be able to see it in order for this system to work integrity is very important we have the following improvements that we can make to enhance this system the first one is include a review voting system for authentic reviews we can also have a different class of premium reviewers with enhanced reward mechanism finally we can use carbon scores to gauge individual carbon footprints which brings us to benefit of using carbon review system we can reward these individuals with nft tokens this can also make companies be more aware of the sustainability of their products and it will also allow users to reliably compare products that are more eco-friendly thank you thank you for your presentation now let's move on to our three minutes of q a judges you can start whenever you're ready yep thank you and hello judges hi nice to meet you um so one of the questions that i have is sort of um you know what what mechanisms are there to really uh ensure that the accuracy of the information being put into the system um you know aren't in and of themselves like attempts to sort of uh create disinformation about um sort of the the carbon neutrality of the project or the product that's being reviewed um i think i think that yeah we are also our team is also i'm still looking into it i think that the best way to do is uh we would have to include some metrics to leave the reviews for a product so that you know um those reviewers actually have a metric to follow and then when we actually do introduce our premium reviewers so that these premium reviewers can actually you know help us to take care of the regular reviewers right yeah so that they follow the metrics actually awesome and uh i mean you all are students and uh it's really cool that you guys are participating in this and and achieved so much would just be curious what uh the journey was like and was the hardest part of putting together your your hack i think i'll let jaron to share it yeah i guess the hardest part was figuring out where to start in the first place because i think our first week was completely lost we actually uh only got the ball rolling like i think five days before the submission so we had to just pump things out day after day day after day so i guess the rush towards the end was really fun but uh figuring things out in the first week and and uh was a little frustrating but i think it's worth it yeah cool and then do you have big plans for what's next with the project or was this more just kind of a hack i think i think just getting to know about this blockchain development space and especially yeah you know how ipfs and falcon actually works and there are tons more of other stuff like polygon and other cool sponsors i think that the possibilities is definitely very huge and um i think for our project is it can be a very ambitious project as well but to do that we will need to uh deep deeper dig deeper into this blockchain technology and see what's actually possible for us awesome what are what are some of the ways that you might imagine um adding features to the product so so things that you maybe thought of but didn't have the time to actually build during the hackathon i guess like an endorsement layer where a tys mentioned where we have premium reviewers um yeah that would that would be the that was our intention initially but due to time constraints that we weren't able to implement it as well as we want to and did you did you feel like using uh i saw that you used scaffolding do you feel like you got a good understanding of how to uh work with solidity and stuff by using it yeah especially the aspect where you actually uh update from the smart contract itself and it automatically gets reflected we weren't really used to that and it boggles of mine a bit when it happened when we figured that out it all made sense cool yeah great job guys so now we're going to move on to our next team uh call made us so thank you judges take care thank you am i coming through yeah we can hear you yeah so you'll have four minutes to present and three minutes for a q a so whenever you're ready start the video this is my submission oh hang on i didn't hit the the share screen and there is okay this is my submission honestly i ran out of time on the front end working on the back end there is a list of the idea for the project is there's a list of videos that a user can publish and they can publish information about those videos there is an event list on the polygon network that the system scans and then pulls in the address for which it looks up dns name and then the call then for the call there is simply a list of and the ui really is where i ran out of time there is a list of yeah i met with blair events and speakers so you can tell who is talking when you can seek to various points in when the people are speaking and then for other videos that video doesn't have both there is um tagging as well so that you can list what um information about what is going on blood pressure up a little bit yeah you got my uh blood pressure up a little bit it'll go back down and like and our five minutes and select based on those attacks are really important hey okay that's it for the video okay um so in terms of like how you actually implemented this and how far you got with the back end what would you say was the most uh challenging aspect of building this project up to the point that you got to um the ceramic i'm still having difficulty with the test network if i load the page that i loaded earlier one of the videos has disappeared and the video that's there is an older version of the object and it won't load correctly and i i'm uncertain as to why that happened i haven't made any updates to ceramic and yet that is the case um the publishing to polygon was really easy like i just created a smart contract that every that i send a string and then it sends that string onto an event and i just read the list of events i couldn't use meta masks uh history function it can only go back a thousand transactions or a thousand blocks and a thousand blocks passes pretty quick on if this is deployed to the mumbai test network and that was relatively simple ceramic really was where i had my most challenges the most of my challenges yeah i mean i i would love to hear about what the vision of the project was and then um you know cool that you use ceramic and polygon would love to hear a little bit more about the stack and how those fit together to try and achieve that vision okay where i want to go with this is i want to record pair programming sessions and i want the metadata to include information like what issue the people were working on i want there to be links into github for the issues i also want there to be whenever there's a commit i want to take that information from github and create metadata for automatically so that it shows you know there was a commit at this point there was a commit here and stuff like that ultimately i want to have a system where programmers are compensated a small amount automatically for their time spent and the time spent is proven by the recording of the live stream i also want it to be live streamed so that if i if i i can pull up a page and see a list of these are the issues that are getting worked on right now and if i want to check in and just see how something's going or how something is done i can i can just click and connect to that live stream cool and then would you mind going over maybe the text yeah so yes so there is a custom idx definition and the problem is is when a user adds a new entry using that idx definition in ceramic i can look up the entry if i know to look to that particular user there's no simple way currently to know that a user though has published information using a schema so i send the events to the polygon network simply to be able to broadcast there's there's data here this is a user that you can look at in order to pull down videos so great job uh i'm gonna have to cut you off here uh great work but we're gonna move on to the next team team crypto toastmasters so you'll have four minutes to present your demo and you'll have three minutes for q a so feel free to start whenever you're ready sure one second share me screen hey derek i think we're having a bit of a bit of a bit of audio issues oh no hold on a second uh let me do this over again okay hold on yeah just make sure to press the check box in the corner to present with sound there we go i got that yeah we did this on the green room hold on a second do this one more time and go again hey there hack fs my name is derek wanson and here's my demonstration for crypto semesters kryptos masters is a club where its members practice communication get better at public speaking and learn about leadership members of the club will practice communication and public speaking by preparing and presenting speeches after the speeches the speaker is evaluated and given feedback we're going to be giving nfts hosted on slate.host to the members who complete speeches and levels in the club let's just say one of the speeches is concentrated on certain cryptocurrencies like filecoin ave or polygon those nfts will have unlockable content like an offer for a fraction of aveng filecoin or matic we're going to be minting our own coin to raise funds called ctm for cryptos masters on polygon officers of the club like the president vice president of education vp of membership vp of of education the secretary the treasurer the sergeant-at-arms and the vice president of public relations they're all going to be using these tokens as voting rights for decisions like how to how much crypto to offer to the members as rewards or other things like um where we're gonna hold our next meeting so uh it's still in the works but keep an eye out for it thanks bye okay yeah so uh this is derek wanson hi um let me just stop sharing my screen and hi everybody yeah so that's that's my uh my little spiel and a little demonstration i do have a website set up for the uh uh for the um uh for the club that i want to build what i'm doing is i'm using this as a little bit of a promotion so that i could uh try and get members for the club to join and try and get some people to uh to join the club so they can learn how to uh to to speak a little bit better in public and uh to practice communications i mean sometimes a lot of times um where uh we're engineers or programmers and we're not really that great at uh at public speaking or trying to get our thoughts together to try to uh display some of the or uh convey some of the things that we're doing in um uh in some of our projects and uh this is one way for us to to to get together and uh give some feedback on how we communicate and how we can present uh some of our presentations to to uh to people out here like in a hackathon things like that so i was reading through some of the description of the project that is in the page on site and i'm curious um how much of the project besides the nfts and the things that people sort of get for participating are sort of built or hosted in a decentralized manner um uh so basically the uh what i'd like to do uh what i'd like to do um how one of the things i wanted to do centrally is to actually create like a is to have the members of the club try and build something decentrally something like uh a token for the club um so the members of the club once they join um in a hackathon way uh so they can also learn about uh cryptocurrency and uh blockchain and um decentralization is to actually create a token for the club um so they can learn about it and sometimes uh talk about it inside the club and and get some rewards for it cool cool and so it sounds like the majority of um kind of the technical piece of it is around building kind of a dow for the club that's right so we we wanted to create like a yeah decentralized organization for the club uh so that we could um uh i mean i mean we all the time we see we see uh new tokens getting generated all the time and uh what we could do is try to generate a token for this club not necessarily to to you know pull the rug out of somebody and just try to learn how how how some of these things work and make a token for the club uh distribute it to some of the people that are that are uh that are members and and um and officers for the club and see how it works and talk about it inside the club bless you thanks and uh were you a part of toastmasters at some point or i guess you talked a little bit about your inspiration but i would love to maybe hear more about um how this idea came together sure so i'm i'm part of a club um so i'm i work full time as an engineer at memorial sloan kettering cancer center and we have a club called toastmasters where we do the same thing where we learn about communication and public speaking and leadership the name of the club is called toastmasters at msk and um i was president of the club and i am i'm also very much interested in cryptocurrency i mean i i i was a cryptocurrency miner and i i i mined for ethereum and i was part of uh toastmasters and i said hey wouldn't it be cool if i uh just put crypto in front of toastmasters and come up came up with the um the name called kryptos masters um and then uh try and do the same things that i was doing at memorial stone canary cancer center do that for the cryptocurrency community um uh get people from different uh uh i guess from different uh levels uh it could be some students from uh from kuala lumpur it could be uh somebody from a hackathon it could be uh somebody who's um uh somebody who's established in the uh in the cryptocurrency the crypto community and have them join the uh have them join uh they could be either an officer they could be a member and have them present inside the company inside the uh inside one of the club meetings so we'd have meetings twice uh twice a month uh kind of like the same way that i i did the same we did it over at uh at the hospital um uh we'd have meeting with uh with all officers try and uh figure out how to get uh put the meeting together we'd have a an agenda um we'd have uh we'll try to have like three speakers uh during each of the meetings and they would go through a curriculum um there's a curriculum from toastmasters.org that we would um that members would go through and then they would uh um you know do do the same thing uh and if so basically if you were to join the club you could be you could play with uh cryptocurrency and uh we'd use that cryptocurrency um to pay for the membership for toastmasters international which is a larger group of of uh other clubs hi derek i'm gonna have to cut you off right there no problem thanks yaru thanks everybody take care great presentation so now let's move on to the next team which is dead men's switch so please feel free to start whenever you're ready you have four minutes for presentations and three minutes for q a welcome to dead man's switch the dub allows users to create vaults that stores encrypted files that are uploaded to web3 storage the users share these with trustees trustees access is controlled via a smart contract trustee's access is only granted when the owner of the vault fails to check in with the smart contract within a specified time period this is our dubs landing page to login we click the connect wallet button sign in with metamask hello tri-id connect here we are this is our full speech this is where we actually create encrypted walls to create a vault we'll simply type in the name of the vault and hit the add button yes we would like to create this fault the vault was created secret fortnight now we have to configure our vault we specify our trustees and the number of days to check in if i do not check in within this period the fault will automatically be released to my trusty let's select some files and hit the upload button the files have been encrypted now we are ready to send our vote to our trustees all vote was sent let's now log in with our trustees account and we go to the inbox here we have the last four that was sent view the vault currently the vault is luck we must download the key or unlock it here we have an error our vault is still locked let's unlock the vault default was successfully unlocked we are now going to demonstrate the check-in feature you have to click on the check-in menu at the top here we have a button where we provide proof-of-life or we check-in we click the button confirm the transaction with metamask our check-in was successful and here we see the last scene date was updated thank you for presenting now let's move on to our three minutes of q a judges whenever you're ready awesome yeah that was a cool project um so i would love to understand a little bit more about the flow from uh when custody is transferred over because the check-in didn't happen um how that works because i guess there's an encryption element to it but uh you know everything stored on web3.storage is like publicly accessible by the hash so presumably like the new person might be able to decrypt it but i would love to hear you talk through it okay so each vault has a private key and a public key the public key is used to encrypt the revolt the users or trustees public key is used to encrypt the vault's private key it is then sent to polygon stored on the blockchain once the user provides proof of life or checks in the vault will not be released to the trustee only when the check-in interval when the user fails to check in within that period the vault will be released to the trustee the trustee will then download the encrypted volt key and decrypt it with his private key and then the files are retrieved from web3 storage and then decrypted one of the things that just comes to mind that i'm curious about is sort of uh you know really sort of long-term scenarios right and sort of really really uh critical scenarios where someone might use this for really sensitive documents and let's say i create a vault for like um i don't know really important my wallet private keys i'm 35 let's say i want to do that and someone might not access that until i'm uh i don't know 80 and i've passed away did you think about what it would look like to really truly ensure like the longevity and safety of these files and sort of the fragility of the system for for decades at a time considering that it is such a sensitive kind of a project okay i think this based on what i read on um on ipfs and on ipfsn web free storage maybe i would have to pin the um content to ensure that it actually is is saved right so i guess if i would actually continue with this project that would that would be something i would have to consider does there's any more questions not for me okay i guess uh we can move on to the next team thank you for your presentation uh the next thing is team ethiopia polytopia so feel free to start whenever you're ready four minutes for your demo and three minutes for q a it is a twitter-like app on the blockchain and the protocols i integrated are web3.storage ipfs slash filecoin polygon network and this is the initial state of polytopia so if you want to make a post on polytopia you need to mint an nft okay so in the console i can see my nft balance is zero and i can see the pseudo random number generation that generates the traits for this avatar and let's go ahead and mint so we get this state status storing image to ipfs file coin success minting your avatar so i have to confirm the transaction in metamask confirm so let's go here let's go to this one i like this profile picture they've that's already bought the nft so open image in a new tab okay you can see we've got the ipfs cid and this url is generated for us now we can post here this is what the posts look like let's make one great post uploading posts to ipfs and filecoin and in the console you see the cids generated here and again we have to confirm a transaction in metamask success let's see our new posts there we go three posts it looks like it's just me talking to myself so the posts have the address of the poster the block time so the number of seconds since the last epoch and then we get a i'm in brave right yeah here's the post [Music] okay cool so this is a a polytopia vault it's opened by a beneficiary account and you can deposit your die tokens into their vault and the die tokens will be deposited into the ave lending market and the beneficiary is is able to claim the raphmatic reward tokens okay so yeah let's make a deposit let's deposit um about a million because we are rich so you have to approve of course approving and deposit so someone has to actually deposit the die into the lending market okay and so this is what the transaction looks like yeah so the beneficiary can claim the the medic but um i don't think there is enough yeah there's not enough magic so the the next steps for polytopia are minting posts as nfts auction nfts likes and comments uh the beneficiaries can emit erc20 social tokens to stakers make the front end good and a native token all right thank you guys so much for watching great job let's move on to our q a so judges whenever you're ready hey sam uh yeah uh i would love to hear you know about the holistic vision of of the social network because you know there's you built three cool features in there and would love to hear how it all ties together yeah so with the um the vaults i was thinking that the ranking algo could sort um users posts who have the highest the highest tvl in their vault at the top and then because they're emitting they would use like a i staking rewards contract to emit social tokens um it would incentivize people to stay gone on the underdogs so that they can enjoy a greater share of the the market cap of those tokens so that's one of the economic incentives i was thinking about and then of course like a native token um so i've been thinking about how i could implement that yeah so i i was uh thinking about a lot of the ideas that um like vitalik was talking about in his east cc talk and uh just decided to see what i could come up with awesome um i'm curious because you sort of you took this really interesting approach that i'm super into which is um pulling together all these interesting threads of things that are really only possible with web3 and blending them together i'm curious if you had more time to kind of continue to build this or maybe you are going to what are some of the things that you're most excited to continue to push on and work on and tinker with yeah i think um the sorting algorithm right now it's just like the latest poster first so there are likes um but i need to refactor the smart contract to be able to show actually show the likes in the ui um yeah i want to use nfts instead of uh i'm using just a struct in solidity if i use nfts instead i think that the i can the ranking algo will be easier to use and then so yeah people could if i hooked it up with the graph or covalent um people could bring bring their own front end so um they could choose how to organize the posts themselves and then yeah just so in terms of like one thing i was thinking about is the censorship resistance and um i'd on my front end i wouldn't want to show like hate speech for example so i would censor that on my front end but because it's on the block jane your hate speech is is immutable in that smart contract and i guess someone could choose to deploy their own um front end where hate speech is cool right but uh yeah i was thinking about what it what it would look like to get cancelled on chain because if you say it's there forever um so you could get maybe you could be blacklisted from other other smart contracts yeah it's a really it's an interesting approach for sure i think like it tries to stab at that middle point of like wanting to keep true to the principles of the underlying tech but also giving you the chance and other people a chance to choose what they do and don't want to display on the front ends the uis that they run yeah anything else great job so that was time so i just want to say that this was our sixth team so we'll be taking a 10 minute break so we will be returning in 10 minutes uh at around 10 40 p.m eastern standard time thank you thanks i don't like it off the stage hello everyone the break will end in a minute or so so we'll wait when the until the judges come back so the break is over judges uh if you're ready we can begin so we'll bring up team p2p if they are ready i think we'll just wait for david to come back and then we'll start also judges uh uh i heard that teams were added to the list so like pre please refresh your uh scorecard hello um so you'll have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a feel free to start whenever you're ready so is it my turn to present yeah they took me okay um do you want me to play the video first or the pitch whatever is best for you okay um yeah so i'm from p2p lending market my name is ray and i had one other team member who unfortunately couldn't be here right now um so our idea was to create a platform for people to lend and borrow real-world items on the blockchain and to automate the payments for those and we did this by using nfts to represent real world items and yeah we used ipfs to store the nfts on the blockchain and so i'll share the video now which um we we didn't get a website set up um yeah just because we didn't have enough time but uh yeah so it's just uh can you see the view yep yeah it's just a console interaction with the blockchain yep so we so that's the nft that we created on nft storage and then we um made an nft oh we tokenized it on our smart contract and yeah so now the contract is given control to manage the nft which lets us automate the borrowing and lending of it and so here um this is the fee that is being sent being set for uh the borrower that has to pay when they borrow the nft and so you would also need to do the physical exchange as well but it's captured on the blockchain okay that's it great presentation so now let's move on to the q a judges you have three minutes and you can be it whenever you're ready um i guess the the question that i have is obviously the the you know ui is it complete so i was wondering if you could speak at all to um what you were thinking about the user interface if you got that far and how you were envisioning this being used this is for more advanced users or is it something that you would want a general audience to be able to use yeah so it was intended um for the general population so if you think about something like facebook marketplace where you can see like all the different items and then yeah so the blockchain component will be completely abstracted and yeah so it would be um yeah simple way for people to view and borrow the physical objects and um yeah it would be sorted by the location so obviously you wouldn't be able to borrow something from someone who's in a completely different city from you got it um and then would love to hear um like kind of going off the last part of what you're saying uh anything else that uh any other connections between the um digital stuff on the blockchain and the physical goods so i guess like how does that chain of custody transfer from digital to physical and then also like uh like what other kind of checks do you have to enforce um enforce that yeah so um i didn't quite work out like how you can actually enforce it because obviously like there's no law around it but i guess as um regulations get developed then you could enforce um yeah that the the transfer actually happens uh but we um we also had one thing which wasn't shown in the video that if you um if either party fails to deliver then um they will lose um like a steak that they had so say for the borrower um they don't return it then they would lose the steak that they needed to pay when they borrowed the acid cool and would love to hear of any next steps with this project or is it more just a hack to get to know things yeah it was more of just getting to know things and yeah proof of concept to see how it would work what would you say was one of the most interesting things maybe that you learned from working on a project like this um well i'd say like using nft storage that was very easy because it was my first time ever using that and yes it's super easy to get set up and integrated with the smart contracts cool okay um i guess we'll move on to the next team which is team bulletin block system so please feel free to start whenever you're ready you have four minutes to present your demo in three minutes for q a hi uh i'll be sharing a video first a multi-board system or bds with server which you can connect to on a single phone line with pc to download files read write messages and sometimes play text-based games as internet grew in the web browser became the primary interface for using networks listed on the 16 colors website so our project ultra lock system is both an homage to old-school gps's and our fancy art team and a way to bring the art monitor into the modern world and onto blockchain so here is our site i created this scaffold and post it on github pages uh because it's all static files using apis but no server uh when you load the page you will first see the so-called genesis scroll um these are all individuals [Music] um so those blocks above uh make up these genesis blocks okay so each of these is if i want to i can put these boxes and then it should come back into [Applause] okay there it demonstrate is so but instead i cannot always just okay there it is so then i just choose a file and then upload it and i will send it through the nfp.storage service that takes a while um [Music] thanks for watching great work uh let's move on to the q a part and judges whenever you're ready well the arc was really sweet i uh i i was curious about and maybe the name block alludes to this about like the top art and then it seemed like individual pieces of it were being sold is that is that correct yeah the top part is uh is a stitching up of the individual tokens and the unique concept is that we don't sell the token images as such we send the slots on the bulletin board assets so each of those images is a block the user can change the image of whatever they want and they can change the image on the board so now they can users can collaborate and you know create complex images which can have joint meanings and so on [Music] yeah really really impressive looking project and it's just such a great like super simple idea so what i'm curious is um maybe uh are there features that you didn't get to build um or if you had more time what other features would you add to this product we can hear you know let me so uh we wanted to build uh more uh marketplace like features wherein we list all the recently added blocks and give options to users to [Music] give a kind of collaborate with uh give a you know something of a chat option to connect with other users and collaborate on the minting interface how how so let's say you found someone to collaborate with on the minting interface how would you make sure your blocks are next to each other well uh yeah that's uh so every mint is going to take up the latest block so in case we uh you need to collaborate that way somebody will have to buy all the blocks and then sell only the block they need to individual users so that's a value proposition [Music] i think maybe just the last question that came to mind is sort of um uh is this something that you would plan to continue to work on i think it's interesting so i'm curious to hear if you would see yourselves continuing to work on this project yes definitely we plan to push it to the main net improve features and make it a lot more usable and we hope that this is going to be a a good stage for the ansi our style to be displayed and stored for eternity and also maybe other creative ideas can come from this um to help the community cool excellent great presentation guys uh let's move on to the next team which is team multi-chain bot thank you feel free to start whenever you're ready you have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a yeah my screen hello my name is alejandro i'm from ui i'm a software engineer with a master's degree in computer science and obviously a technology enthusiast i'm currently teaching software engineer at computer science in university or the motivation of these projects it's not a startup and not a proof of concepts just to have fun and to get a prototype of how simple it could be you from the user and the developer perspective to integrate several api so different web3 providers so let me share [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the use case here is using different commands and interacting with the with the board with the disco board and just uh simple comments from the developer perspective and documentation and apis provide us is critical uh with simple examples uh keep it simple always uh and these hackathons competitions are really interesting at a level of education integration and competences and really congrats uh all of you all your team i really enjoyed this i found a really good and excellent documentation and response times and sponsors and really a great great experience i really have fun with this and congrats all of you great job thank you for your presentation let's move on to the q a judges there's three minutes and sweet given how this was kind of an exploration of a lot of uh web through technologies would love to maybe hear about the most surprising thing that you learned during your journey yeah and one of the the most surprising things is using real the web 3 storage i really enjoy really have fun with this simple user interface and really integration with the apis i really take the web3 storage as a really best example of what usernames what would you say maybe it was like the the um a challenge that you ran into and maybe how you overcame it uh as you were working on this project and exploring all these different components yeah using a covalent this is it's really simple but sometimes it's you have to go to the to the to to get different uh instantiations of grpc a real i don't know sometimes it makes easy but the documentation is is not the best i think in my opinion that's that's just my perspective um and maybe another question is uh having done what you did during the hackathon is there some part of working with sort of decentralized file storage and these web 3 apis that you're still excited to like continue to work on and experiment with yeah no it's sincerely it's just to for fun and sometimes to to tell my students how to to work with these technologies and just having fun just the main idea no project behind it yeah let your students know yeah exactly that's how we grow this yeah yeah that's it yeah let's see here judges do you have any questions left okay great presentation let's move on to our next team thank you it's team coffee chain so feel free to start whenever you're ready you have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a hello guys okay let me share my screen check the screen okay can you see my screen now guys perfect welcome to coffee chain we will be addressing the challenge by eth global's face hackathon we are a platform where you can buy authentic social responsible and 100 organic products validated and tracked by the blockchain we have in mexico a problem related with hunger that comes from a poor financial inclusion mexico among a population of 127 million has 28 of those suffering from hunger and 11 in extreme hunger more than a half which are from indigenous population economic growth is key to alleviate that hunger and already in these communities there is a plethora of agronomic operatives eager to sell their products but they have several challenges one of the most important ones as expressing one of their logos is to have a fair trade and that's one of the biggest ones we found out that most of these competitors have no electronic e-commerce and their products are being sold in on platforms in which cases does not reach the producers indeed breaking fair trade which is devastating for those communities now what does the consumer seek in a brand the mother consumer seeks products that are socially responsible organic healthy sustainable but mainly that generate trust is determinant in a social setting as we can see from this example from nike related to a very social cause our goal is to make a platform that helps producer by increase their consumer confidence and enhancing fair trade we have already taken some steps by reaching out to a cooperative form a commercial bond with them and built a prototype together the cooperative is obvious that works in southeast mexico and it's backed by one of the largest banks in our country our blockchain marketplace is hosted in aws it is live we have three main parts already the first one is the marketplace itself it's operational using rapids apis which is the world's largest payment network here is a quick checkout demonstrating how the rapids api are implemented with this the second one is an interactive chatbot that helps the buyer known and deepen its relationship with the product also it helps to find a better product according to taste the third one and the most important is our blockchain provenance service that works with qr codes as you can see and as we scan the product it sends us directly to the blockchain where we can see all the information we recorded about product we are heavily employing web3 storage for this application with it we are able to fast track development wave 3 storage works with the filecom blockchain as a base and it is perfect for our application because of its speed and the fact that it's public so the consumer can check the provenance of the product and keep track of where it has been all this is indeed a hybrid between cloudtech and blockchain now this kind of idea has already reached several places and markets all around the world such as the wine industry the beauty and others but it has not been deployed in social responsible first projects having said this we seek that our certificates guarantee that the purchase benefits whoever ship produces it we are coffee chain thank you great presentation uh let's move on to the q a just as you can start yeah i would would love to hear more about the um i guess the the blockchain and the social validation side of things so is it just steps in the process people can use the qr code to like check in with the product or um how is all that working yeah actually the idea the main idea is or for a consumer just to go to the store see a product with their qr code just to scan it with the their cell phone or any device they have at hand and access the blockchain and see every all the kind of information that we want to show them about the product that is social responsible that it's organic the provenance the checkpoints has been carrying it has been carrying forward across the supply chain and also the the most important thing that is that is certified by blockchain cool and then the original problem uh you all introduced making sure that the money goes to the producers uh how what what part of the data stored on the blockchain is helping out with that yeah actually the certificates and the checkpoints because they'll actually they already have a supply chain for us already implemented what they do not have is the electronic like e-commerce and all that from that they have the problem of fair trade and the main the main issue that they have with this is that imagine that they have already our systems in hand so they would have only for those producers only for the ones that have the checkpoints validated by us they would have to increment and put another checkpoint into the system and validate that with blockchain only like all only authorized like distributors authorized distributor process and that's the main idea so i'm curious um from my standpoint um in terms of how the uh how does the information first get onto the blockchain so really how are we kind of ensuring that the quality of the information that's actually stored is is as true as possible only trusted partner will be able to upload information to the blockchain in this case those cooperatives like they'll have some person in charge of only uploading the information to the blockchain and also they're doing their supply chain so that no other lag let's say third party or any reseller can do that and in terms of maybe the future of something like this or maybe in your thinking because i know that from what you described this is sort of like a it's really a hybrid between blockchain based tech and more traditional web 2 tech are there parts of the web 2 stack that you would consider decentralizing over time to make the project more robust yeah i mean the payment systems is the one that comes to mind immediately and apart from that they i don't know even the the selling process can be and we were also thinking in creating some kind of physical nfts with that with this kind of idea but that is still just an idea not not even a prototype so yes sure do you plan to continue to work on this yes yes excellent great presentation so uh we're going to be moving on to our last team of the day which is team pet grab so team pet graham can you raise change we just leave right oh yeah you'll be demoted by the admin okay so yeah feel free to start whenever you're ready you have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a okay good um okay hi everyone can you guys hear me yeah hi everyone my name is luis and i'm here with this is my cat and this is the uh this is the author of the idea for tonight's presentation so let's just get started so um i am a cut only a cat owner pez lover and i didn't have an idea in um or team but i wanted to create something for my pets and i was thinking maybe i can create something so i come up with something i created something called petgram which is basically um a photo sharing app instagram version but in in blockchain so let's go through the demo and then and then we can take it from there so let me first share my screen and i'm gonna share sound share and then play and play excuse me louis is there any audio in this ah jess can you can you hear the audio because i can hear it no we can't hear the audio uh let me just reach here because i yeah when you share uh make sure to click the chat box it's checked okay let me just share one more time yeah you can hear it someone says that they can hear it oh yeah i think the attendees can but the panelists can't so let me just yeah let me just click again and share one more time okay okay okay can you hear can you hear it now no we can't hear no no i can't hear anything okay let me just i will check yes why is that uh let me think about it why is that very quick so if you cannot hear then it has to be okay can you hear now no if it's just the the host then maybe it's a zoom issue what was that oh one second i think that is just because uh let me shift the reference very quick [Music] well i was just thinking if some people can hear it and some people can't then it's probably not on your computer this probably isn't yeah i was thinking that uh you want to share it for me again like uh i can spare it for you instead should i send a link i have the link i'll share it to you right i'll share it right now okay thank you also can you play it can you play like 1.25 or something the the speed my what i think we can begin our three minutes of q a so uh that was actually really easy to understand without any dialogue so i'm curious um what what's the sort of thinking behind the using unlocked protocol and and sort of making this something that people are actually like paying to to access yeah can you hear me because also i couldn't hear anything i can hear you now yeah you can hear me okay uh yes yes so i guess the main idea was just to connect or to um to have a better better relationship between the the viewer or the fan for instance to me like having been able to appreciate appreciate um animals or pets and being able to contribute to either pet owners or authors i will be connected to it so i guess the connection of that and being able to connect direct and support direct to this pet owner or to the cad itself or to the pet is the connection there and and it's just the connection and i think that you can generate revenue from also like getting also when you see um cute images of pets or videos that makes you they even better or or happier and that's the whole value that the simple things it brings you a join awesome cool yeah cool and i mean is the way you see it uh for um fans of pets to to be able to pay to see content or are you trying to create a community of owners what's kind of like the market there so i was thinking just to build the community around pets and yes bringing value or maybe um or maybe just uh having like a community that cares about pets that take care of they know how to like let's say that i am a new a new owner pet pet owner so i would like to know more about things like this and i would love to go to this community and learn more about how to take it how to take care better of my pet and also like also like sometimes pets can be very expensive so having like an extra income on extra extreme income will be nice in case of your pet um is very beautiful very cute though has like something so nice tricks is that that's the purpose yeah what would you say was the most interesting challenge you faced uh oh yeah yeah so working alone um so i just finished up with coming i am very new to blockchain so work working alone it taught me a lot the first um it told me that uh it is blockchain is a big it's a big uh it's a big monster like the wild west there's so many technologies out there uh so many protocols networks and getting started i was thinking okay how are you gonna get started and put a simple so that's why that was like really simple the most important for me was to to actually do something and to build something and actually learn something and what i learned from the from this experience from this project was um been able for me is to use something very simple and to create actually something that i can use and and i learned web3 first of all i learned web3 to connect or to uh to interact with the blockchain from my react app and then i also of course nftf storage in unlocked protocol and simple and simple smart contracts you see in solidity and up and separating and i mean i would like to add way more things and i think now i have better ideas and like a little bit to expand based on on this experience awesome so yeah thank you so much so that was our last presentation so i think we can wrap up now so i just wanted to to say thank you to the judges for taking your time out of your day to do this and we really appreciate it as well as all of the hackers who attended the hack fest hackathon so and i just want to say great job everyone and thank you for attending so that's it and uh judges uh i'm pretty sure kartik sent you an email so if you want to look at that so just thanks again everyone for showing up thank you all right thanks everybody take care i'll call she can end this uh webinar and uh you can also type in the discord too got it
