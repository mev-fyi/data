foreign thank you foreign foreign thank you foreign use these microphones I'm sorry yes it's good of course right okay now I can add it test you put it back but it mentions okay as well I'm gonna just do one more round I'll get a are there anybody else in but uh I did okay I'm going to add these all to the website because there's a lot of detail and I might just do the ethereum foundation is offering total amount of money um minus one all right can we move this yeah let's move this a little bit and then okay I think we should be okay and another okay uh you know what we can unfreeze it right now yeah I don't actually I mean yeah yeah so I'll just do like this song thank you okay sometimes testing tests foreign hello everyone we're about to get started uh if you have drinks get rid of them and also no food thank you very much for the room um yeah yeah that's cool that's cool everybody's cool with that so get rid of the drinks rid of the um the drinks [Music] how many are from Paris that's a lot how many from somewhere else in France bomb how many from outside of France but in Europe how many outside of Europe wow who thinks they came the furthest where from oh who's back there or again whoa maybe winner do we I think Brazil wins yeah well done Brazil Brazil go Eurovision style um so um welcome bienvenue this is very exciting for us it is the first East Paris um and we are and it's the second East Global event of the year um for for 2019. we kicked off the air with East Denver uh which was amazing but it was at a very high altitude um and you know I'm personally I live in the UK I'm glad to be closer to sea level um I don't know how you feel about that Boris it was was a little bit intense in Denver so we we love Continental Europe um but let's tell you who we are oh um also Boris matched his hat to my hair for your viewing pleasure um Boris is um the uh the organizer of eth magicians and pretty much uh the head speaker Abby's magicians with his booming voice that you know resonates throughout we've given you the entire seat but you'll only need the edge [Laughter] and he is also the co-founder of vision great awesome and this is Simona pop who is the co-founder of TMO at bounties Network and for youth magicians which is a group that helps work on the technical ethereum ecosystem uh she helps Steward the education ring that is right amazing thank you very much thank you Boris thank you and thank you all so glad to have you here to witness our entertaining Duo so um East Paris we're gonna give you some stats because um we love stats and math and so um we have over 300 attendees this year for and for the first one it's pretty damn good Brazil Brazil yeah um I mean in Montreal too but right let's focus on Brazil that's good he's on the in the front row as well um 26 of attendees are students this year which is again awesome because um you know we love students get started in the ecosystem as early as possible is always a good idea don't do like Boris and I um 42 are brand new to ethereum which is my favorite stat in here everyone you are amazing another 50 to 8 as well but the 42 brand new to ethereum um it's it's very important for us to broaden the axis of um new um people new skill sets new um you know nationalities um and and make our ecosystem incredibly inclusive and incredible incredibly varied so that we can grow it so that we can have all of these different perspectives um and and building a lot of uh of very cool stuff and then we have the 22 sponsors that are helping out ensuring that we have the the awesome venue the awesome food um you know everything that we need to make sure that this is a very successful first is Paris so the concept uh of an event like this is to focus on learning uh you've taken this time thank you you've dedicated this time to decide to build something to build something that you want and learn new skills we value showing over telling uh this is a no PowerPoint Zone as far as the participants go we want you to focus on uh digging into code and trying to build something errors on screen from the browser is to be celebrated and then bugs filed in GitHub so we can get them fixed we are here to learn mentor and grow so we want this to be the first step uh get connected to resources can get connected to mentors get connected to other to each other and go from there and and keep keep going um this is a hackathon not a conference uh obviously a lot of this will be meeting people from as far away as Oregon and Brazil this is not going to get old we'll keep bringing this up but also Continental Europe and all the other Antarctica um uh it's not a conference so it is not you're not here as an attendee you're here as a participant and that's what that means uh this is for the ecosystem when we say the ecosystem we're going through uh the growing of something of web3 uh I was around as he Strokes his long Gray beard uh when we were going from web 1.0 to Web 2.0 uh before the Amazon Cloud uh and what we're trying to do now is what's next past the Amazon Cloud part of that is global networks like ethereum a large stack of other technologies that many of our sponsors will tell you about tonight as well so um and if you get started early you can be part of this very long wave that we're going to be kicking off yay now we've heard that sometimes uh in in North American English we say eth yes here it's in France f no is this true who let's do a show of hand vote okay eth okay if oh I think the eats have it okay I think so I think so um cool so let's see it wasn't I have no idea what's next I don't know oh it's me oh um do you want me to introduce you oh yes please no we have already done that okay but I don't like it you're like a sponsor or something it's true we are the bounties network is is a sponsorer and a supporter of East global building that ecosystem and getting newer and newer people in so that we can be a lot more inclusive thank you so much welcome Simone and her talk about uh the bounties Network thank you so much now I will try to be um as quick as possible so that you don't miss Boris too much um I mean it's not You're Here In Perpetual spirit so um what I want to talk about is um what we've been doing at the bounties Network in terms of impact but really focusing on what this technology can do in real life so the whole impact IRL is very much about what we can do to empower people and effect change because at the end of the day I think most of us are here and are part of these this ecosystem because we want to improve the current state of affairs we want to improve um is that important do you want to take it um so um because we very much want to um to make things better and and to find solutions to some problems that have persisted and and are ongoing so um some of the stats that we have in terms of uh social impact and we've got UNICEF France in the house today as well um in the crowd so they will be able to to attest to a lot of these things um we have some pretty dire stats in terms of access to information access to technology and also the access to resources or means of work or a global pool of work so they're pretty bad we're still at 40 unbanked we're still at 80 percent of uh people in the world are still working at under 10 a day and very relevant to our ecosystem only 36 um in the world have access to smartphones so a lot of the things that we are building and a lot of the the kind of tools that we are building in the blockchain ecosystem do kind of maybe need laptops and smartphones so one of the things to be very aware of when we do create these Solutions is to be as mindful as possible of whatever problems you are trying to to solve and make sure that we understand that um that access isn't necessarily um everywhere and so the opportunity for and for social impact with blockchain are a few and I've I've chosen the main three so the broadening of the access to information resource and work this is something that is incredibly important as we evolve what we are building and what we are doing so that it reaches the most amount of people again what we want is to really give that access to um let's say non-traditional geographies and non-traditional centers of Social and economical abundance right we want everybody to have access to those three things information resource and work and then mobilize people from the underserved communities right allow them or or rather lower that threshold of access to these things and I'm not just talking about you know developing countries I'm very much talking about communities even within the states or Western Europe or Australia that do not have the same level of access as pools of or pockets of population in in those regions and then creating Alternatives this is something that at the end of the day we're going to see more and more as traditional jobs evolve as full-time work potentially evolves as some um you know jobs that have been around for ages are transitioning or even disappearing and so these are all things that we need to take into account if we are going to build with actual impact so then blockchain for social impact again how we have the solutions for that are transparent funding this is something that's been a problem for the charity system for a very long time we have this complete opaque um kind of process between a centralized entity like a charity asking individuals for money four five five euros 10 euros whatever for XYZ cause but you don't actually have any visibility on what happens to your to that money you have to trust and blindly trust that that they're going to do whatever it is that they say they're going to do with the money whereas if you have the block um if you involve blockchain into it you have that transparency and are able to track all of these transactions and make sure it goes where it needs to go um new means of income again potentially it can open up New Alternatives or um facilitate the access to a global pool of work for pockets of population and individuals and communities that wouldn't necessarily have that access and then lasting change for instance I I put in here just as an example you could potentially have a an incentive system that essentially rewards um let's say companies for sustainable and long-term dedication or or commitment to an environmental um pause or to helping on environmental causes and then just so everybody understands what because again we have that a lot of people who are new to the ecosystem a bounty essentially is definitely not the pirate stuff right it is not a bounty on somebody's head um it is a reward offered by either an individual or an organization for a for the completion of a certain task because we operate on ethereum or in blockchain it will be a crypto reward right so it's a very very simple model in the ecosystem we normally use bounties for bugs and code and things like that but actually there's a lot of uh of different um ways we can use them and one of those ways is for social impact so what we did and because again I'm really into um very practical uses of it we created this bounties for the oceans now what the idea with this was simply to try and see whether re-engineering social impact based on bounties or on a blockchain solution would work and so what we did was instead of a organization asking you for money we kind of went okay what we're going to do is flip that and say if you submit verifiable proof of a cleanup whether it's on a beach whether it's in a park whether it's on a street and um you can prove that you have done that we would reward you with 10 die which die is a stable coin uh it's an erc20 token and its value is pegged to the value of a dollar so for instance 10 die a US dollar a US dollar Canadian dollars also exist they do but New Zealand Dollars sure Australian dollars right USD USD um so yeah it will always be 10 USD um and so we thought okay let's launch this we launched it in partnership with maker Dao who actually created the the die and thought let's see what happens and then what happened was a lot of people started doing these things and a lot of people from a lot of different areas and regions and geographies so we had a lot of people across the U.S and we had a lot of people in Europe and we had people from Tasmania doing them and we have people from Romania and we had people from Venezuela fulfilling these and we kind of thought oh okay there's definitely something to this because for a lot of the people doing these bounties they essentially it was their very first interaction with a web 3 application or with a blockchain application and it was also their first experience of earning crypto rather than buying it which was again incredibly interesting so what we decided to do was let's do something bigger and let's see what that how that works and so we created a pilot in Manila because we're a little bit masochistic and we thought hey that worked let's go to the Philippines let's go on a beach that's incredibly polluted we probably won't have internet but let's see what happens when we try to onboard people onto a blockchain or blockchain application so we went to Manila and we ran these two days of a cleanup um December 1st and December 2nd last year we had 224 people turn up and we try to onboard them but of course when they got there a lot of them did not have smartphones also the connection was really bad and also um the only wallet with a um an adap browser that was available was it was a single one out of the maybe how many do we have now or five Lots they keep growing Lots they keep growing but only one was available so we kind of had to um experience that because there is a lot of work to still be done but the idea is that we managed to onboard a lot of these people and the key is that a lot of them are still using the platform and still fulfilling this page so now I think so what are we what we also did was we filmed a lot of the experience and I'm going to show you uh the trailer for what we did uh the full documentary is coming out hopefully next week um and then we'll be able to share it with with everyone and and it goes a little bit more in depth with regards to what we did let's see the trash issue really is impacting people's lives garbage everywhere [Music] what happens when a traditional job like fishing stops being sustainable you need to create new means of income you need to create Alternatives incentives are Behavior changing if you're able to channel that you're going to be able to mobilize a lot of people is [Music] Generation we saw that monetary incentives were a great way to get people on the ground but now that they're here they actually can look past those incentives and really feel the intrinsic motivation I'm here I did I did everybody give them [Applause] amazing and I loved your hair thank you I mean it's it's intense oh now it's no longer working it's frozen we can't is this you told me this wasn't your laptop but it is your laptop isn't it you did um okay so um yeah the hair was it was very humid um so basically what what we discovered with everything that we did and it was incredibly eye-opening because it made us realize just how much we could make a difference in how big a difference we could potentially make so um the um the guy who you saw there in in the video um he told us and his name was Joe but I it might not be that um he was essentially burning cables on that beach to extract the Copper from uh the cables so then he could sell it so we had a translator this was on the first day that we we looked at this beach and we had to translate it with us and she helped us communicate with him and he was basically saying look I'm a fisherman by trade I'm from this local communities and as you saw the fishing is just not there anymore right because there's so much trash there was so much pollution that the fish socks are just you know not even half of what they used to be which means that they have to spend longer going further out and spending less time fishing and therefore making less money and then okay what do you do in this situation could you establish a new sustainable way of plugging these communities into something that also benefits the ecosystem but also moves uh and and gives them an income and then Ronald who you said speaking about a new generation was basically a partner that we found on the ground because he was part of these communities and what he does is he turns the plastic that people clean up into these slabs that they use to pave highways in Manila and so when we asked Ronald will you ever run out of the need to for plastic he said no because that's a business I do this now and so you can potentially have this ongoing Loop where they clean up the environment government there is also a new means of income and what we also wanted to do was to make sure that we absolutely had the opportunity and gave them the opportunity to exchange the crypto into um Filipino Peso because it was very important for us to make sure that they actually got money instead of hey here's some magic internet stuff that you cannot use bye um so we got a partner on the ground Ron who you saw there um our uh they are called coins.ph and they have they're very um widespread in the Philippines and they basically do a lot of um cool stuff in terms of helping the unbanked and having this ability to to exchange between crypto and Fiat um and so these are just some stats um of what we did in those two days by the way each day we had to stop cleaning at half 10 in the morning because it got so intensely hot that we had no shade on that beach either so in those Collective five hours with 224 people this this is what we cleaned up so from an environmental perspective of course 3.3 tons of trash isn't that much realistically but it proves it can be done and it proves it can be something that is sustainable um and so again the main learnings that we had and I'm hoping these are some of the things that will help you guys as you hack As you move through this ecosystem whereas we you advance whatever it is that you do in our ecosystem is that education is by far the biggest piece like anything you make or talk about should be understandable should be something that can be easily accessible then crypto wallets again as I mentioned earlier that is something that we still have a lot of work to do and then the internet always keep in mind that a lot of people you speak to or you build for may not have access to the wonderful high-speed internet situations that we have um and then again leveling out the playing field if we manage to get these three things it is potentially something that can really be a game changer for us introducing a new way and a new um you know just redefining everything that we are doing now in terms of work in terms of access in terms of how communities and individuals extract value and then again these are some of the wonderful people that participated um again we have about 10 people from that day who are still fulfilling the Bounty that is still up um and doing it on a regular basis and also the Bounty that we set up was a lot of the funds were crowdsourced so that a lot of people even contributed at five dollars ten dollars a lot of projects put some money in so that part of the bounty is still there and also it is only ever going to go to the individual payouts for verifiable cleanups there's no 20 that goes to admin 50 that maybe goes through the executives and whatever um so just to wrap this up um this isn't my quote it's vitalik's change the incentives change the world I think as we mentioned there and we have these conversations all the time our incentives the game changer not the the main solution but they can help and they can be the entry point or the kickstarter to something bigger and to something that can enable greater things and one of the things that we um and again in the Partnerships that we that we have it is very much they are very much based on this furthering of what we have that is very small right now but can have huge huge um reverberations through um how we're what we're doing in the world um and one of the things that I wanted to mention is our partnership with UNICEF very much focuses on this positive impact that individuals and communities can have and we'll chat a little bit later about what we're what we're doing but there's a lot of stuff that we are rewarding in terms of people hacking on social impact projects and um you know doing positive actions within the ecosystem so yes um there we go that is me done thank you thank you thank you thank you very much um I don't know if there were any pressing questions that anybody has I am here for the two days so you can easily find me and ask them but there was any one pressing question this is the bounties Network B right that's right okay any other questions that was incredibly pressing that's true yes right so um the submission can you repeat the question right so the question was how do we um make sure that those cleanups are done when there isn't anybody there to verify them actually the submissions that we ask for are photos of the human with the trash at a location with a filter for the for the location and the time very rustic I know and we will perfect that and we will make sure that it is a lot more sophisticated but we also the reason why we said it like that was to see how people would try to scam it because we need to know how they scam it in order to know what we protect against I'm happy to report that so far we had one guy who tried to submit a photo of a clean Beach that he got from Google and say I did it all I did it all obviously because it isn't it doesn't match the requirements I'm not going to accept it like it doesn't match them so I'm okay not to accept it photographic proof of trash right or pot for short I mean that could have a few implications proof of thought it might be a little bit intense um but yes so find me for any other questions um we can we can have further chats oh so yeah um you can obviously find me harith Paris I was also at HCC um and this is the Paris dot Bounty store Network there's a few bounties up there like I said UNICEF has got one up um Opera have sum up and also we'll be putting some up for feedback on the event let us know how it went and so on and we will so this is for people in the room yeah magic internet money right there yeah that address that is that is it okay and witnessed the whole Magic of it all oh what okay oh cool so we're gonna have our next speaker is he here by the stage yes so we have from new Cipher we've got McLean McLean here we go [Applause] hey everyone thanks for coming out uh I'm McLean one of the co-founders of new Cipher uh for those of you who don't know us we are the data privacy layer for ethereum so we give you a way to basically build end-to-end encrypted applications privacy preserving the apps and protocols uh hopefully fairly easily um we before I get to that basically we have two core pieces of technology that uh we'd be happy to see you build on the first is the new Cipher Network and that is a decentralized Access Control layer so let's say You're Building I don't know some sort of healthcare application and you want to store patient records on ipfs we give you a way to have those be private and encrypted but still shareable with a valid recipient like a doctor or a hospital uh you could use it to build data marketplaces data exchanges anything where you have sensitive data that you need to share across multiple users tends to be a good fit we also have a fully homomorphic encryption Library that's not part of the network but that you can also use uh you need a GPU for that we use gpus to accelerate it and get it pretty fast a couple weeks ago at each Denver someone built a pretty cool uh decentralized 23andMe type of thing with new fhe we have twenty five hundred dollars in total prizes uh actually correct this this is going to be split across uh two prizes so one prize is for the best or most novel use case of any new Cipher technology and then the other prize is for the most impressive uh technical implementation um all the information you need on our GitHub we have a hackathon repo which will get updated before things kick off tonight with all the latest and greatest materials and links to docs and repos and everything like that um including all the the prize guidelines our documentation is just the docs.newcipher.com uh the new site for network is in the new side for repo the new fhc repo and then um Ryan who's here and I will be around pretty much the entire weekend um if you want to come to our table grab us for help if you can't find us all of our entire team hangs out in our Discord um so that's probably the easiest fastest way to get uh you know accessible technical questions if you have any issues getting things installed or getting up and running uh your best bet is probably to pop in there um I think that's it for me so thanks again and look forward to talking to you all over the weekend how many people in the room have already or signed on to the eth Paris Discord Lots great so uh we'll have details on that up later as well so that's all of the sponsors and mentors and everyone else will be in there as well so that's one good central location and then all the sponsors will attempt to lure you into their Discord as well but they're hanging out and have people dedicated and have links to all of their information in there we need to remind everybody again no drinks and no food they snuck in they have snuck in there is food and there is I switched to German oh no kindness okay that was that was intense that was very good that's what German is for I mean it is a very intense language French for the good stuff German for the yeah uh cool if Paris moving swiftly on East Paris yeah also um my favorite thing ever I think in a conversation with um a wonderful um French human um they when when they asked me are you from the bounties Network they didn't say bounties they said buntis this is true isn't it it's it's a thing okay so booties how do you say Bounties in French what's the French word for bounties this is a very very complex conversations Discord yes let's do a bounty explanation in French let's do wrong okay that will also be on Paris the bounties.network cool next up scale hello so uh Hey first off big show of hands for the Youth Global team and all the volunteers making this event happen so thank you all right so scale does Layer Two scalability we make it very easy for you thank you very easy to set up a sidechain so you can take your solidity code and put it in a side chain with just a couple clicks so it runs fast it runs secure and it takes a complexity away and lowers cost Etc so when uh I think when looking at Layer Two Solutions you need to think about a few things one they have to be easy to set up and manage two they have to be highly performant we're using Layer Two so we can get speed we can run smart contracts we can get Optimum performance right that's why we're pulling it off the main net into a second layer it has to be secure has to be cost effective right we want to save costs it can't we can't have all the gas fees we would have if we stayed on the main net so that's something critical we think about and also has to be compatible and interoperable so when you're moving your smart contract into a layer 2 Chain you also want to be able to continue to use truffle and remix and Etc the whole web3 stack so last piece here decentralization so this is critical to us we spent a lot of time and effort building a decentralized network for layer 2 scalability there are use cases I think where Authority and centralization is great for Layer Two there's many where it actually just won't fit so we're trying to focus on decentralized use cases all right so we launched our devnet you can finally use scale we launched it at east Denver had some really amazing hacking uh saw some really cool stuff we're also soft launching storage so you can actually use a scale chain to do storage for your death this weekend so please check that out uh all right getting here towards the end here we've got six bounties we're going to be here all weekend helping and you know let's have some fun building we are looking for just really great use cases and and great you know great effort we're not looking for necessarily use cases that have tens of thousands of transactions per second or really fast finality is incredibly valuable at a hackathon so our bounties have a pretty broad spec and we're just looking for people who want to build awesome stuff so if you are interested please come talk to us check out our Workshop tonight at nine we're going to show you actually how to deploy a scale chain and walk through the whole process and have some fun there Christine and Stan with scale we'll put that on we'll also have a workshop tomorrow and show you some pretty cool stuff where we're going to build some digital cakes so a little teaser um for that all right hey let's have a fun weekend pleasure to meet everybody bye [Applause] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry it's fine it's fine mine is yours Perry transition slide no we agreed that it's easy okay our final um speech from the um oh there he is I was gonna do the intro buddy so ready there we go here thank you very much you're Clicker thank you uh I'm from binance Labs how many of you heard of binance labs cool great so these are my teammates Florian bar two uh we're very excited right right I I hope it's obvious who's flooring who's about to but uh so we're very excited to be sponsoring East Paris uh this time and I'm gonna give a very short uh information on what binance labs does so we do three things we start a fellowship program which I'm going to talk about we do incubation and we of course do direct investments in two projects um so the financial program we started this year is initiative to support open source development of uh you know building blocks in the in the blockchain stack uh to help you know um that the idea is to have a lot of Open Source building blocks so they're entrepreneurs uh could Cobble together service a crypto service or or business quickly and focus more on a Time on product Market fit and and go to market stuff um so these are the stuff we're looking for but we're generally very open-minded on what uh open source uh you know projects we support uh the the details so we provide a very modest monthly stipend for three to six months we provide tools and then the you know the value that binance provides is really you know fostering a active community of contributors and users for your open source project and we are emitting you know Fellas on a rolling basis and this is the website where you fill out a very short Google form and we'll get in touch if you're interested and next thing we we're doing is incubation program uh it's really kind of like a y comedy style program to identify where you know early stage teams or projects and we help them achieve our Market fit um uh we actually the the second season uh application just closed you know last week and we're starting second season uh late March and the third season would be sometime in Q3 2019 10 week program and we end the whole program in you know in a demo day we call Builders day um to to learn more go to displayinglabs.co website um one other thing I wanted to talk about is our Bounty program we're sponsoring uh at East Paris which is uh how many of you heard of trustwallet so trust wallet is now part of binance it's open source erc20 wallet as well and now they support Bitcoin and other chains as well so they at East Denver a few weeks ago they open source uh what they call wallet core which is SDK they can use to build wallets and wallet applications very quickly um so we're sponsoring a bounty to um uh to get you guys to build stuff on top of wallet Court uh specifically we're looking for uh Layer Two support either plasma or state Channel support on top of wallet core or anything you can think of so any kind of good application you think of to integrate into wallet core would be great um that's it I think uh if you have any quick questions all right thank you very much [Applause] okay are you gonna go first you go first okay there are 35 000 in prizes I don't actually know which kind of dollars oh USC USD okay yeah I'm from Canada so it's confusing uh so zero X will award 1500 USD worth of ZRX to the best use of the Xerox platform and 1000 USD in ZRX to the runner-up um our weave will award a thousand Euros wow yes uh to the best use of the are weave API all right binance Labs will award 2500 USD in finance tokens to the team that implements the best state channels or plasma sport for trustwallet core Library and then Finance Labs as you heard I just literally did that one oh did you I'm sorry you see Jacob keeps messaging me and he goes check your telegram am I I'm in the middle the middle something what is it okay okay so we should we okay we should read let's let's read it okay okay last minute prizes says Jacob Ave offers 25 eth ooh for building on top of the Ave SDK the prize will be split between the teams building the best Solutions at the distression of Ave Mike so do you like Game of Thrones it and like knife other teams so they're better or I don't know no no okay no amazing okay cool awesome that was a very smooth we should do more like this just keep sending us messages yeah maybe even you're doing great guys it's awesome chain link will award a thousand they have the dollar sign and USD so very clear in link to the team with the most compelling and ready to run prototype using chain link Dao stack is offering 2500 USD worth of ease to the project with the most creative use of the holographic consensus protocol the best app integration or the best Dao tool built on the stock people know who what does dow stand for I feel like the people over here are good at speaking loudly so this side one this time distributed decentralized autonomous organization okay cool those d words um ens will award two hundred dollars to be paid in eth or die to each of the five best projects that incorporate ens which is ethereum name service so can teams one project win more than one prize yeah exciting okay this is exciting stuff um is it you it's you the best four application that uses near protocol alphanet or leverage bridged die on the near chain awesome and then scale you saw them earlier they will award 500 euros for the best five dapps and a thousand Euros to the very best app deployed on scale we're also available for reading your Awards should you need them for voiceovers on YouTube or other audio channels or record your your um voicemail message this is this these are young people who don't use voicemail the web3 foundation and parody technologies will award 2 000 Euros to the best projects using substrate and one thousand years to the runner-up team so substrate is a a tool chain for building blockchains of your own some and new Cipher again you saw them earlier will award two thousand five hundred dollars for the most interesting broad project built utilizing any new Cipher technology including proxy re-encryption for managing permissions over encrypted data or new FHA I'm not sure so well look you now do mine tons tons of bounties available to claim at isn't it it is it is yeah you had one job Paris dot Bounty stuff no I'm I'm joking of course you have uh a million yeah so yeah but that's so Harris got bounties on network thank you oh yeah okay and then ethereum foundation will award bounties for scaling and privacy Solutions based on zero knowledge proofs just as bounty's plural please come on down hi my name is Alex I'm Pro I'm working with ethereum Foundation it's this is a little last minute sorry for not having the proper slides and not having a link for this but we posted the link just now in Twitter under if Paris you will find it there ethereum Foundation has a budget oh um can you hear me well yes okay a budget of over six thousand dollars for prizes for scaling on zero knowledge because this is such a promising technology for scaling without sacrifice of security and decentralization please look at it the one of the great things about ethereum is that you can just plug in you take it you have solidity you have all the best toolings it's super easy to work it's not like this yet with zero knowledge proofs but it's also very interesting to be pioneers and to explore New Frontiers and this is why we want to encourage you to do this we have links with tutorials with great um examples how it can be done please come talk to me after the ceremony I'll be happy to to help you and also uh the team from meta labs and ethereum foundation will be happy to um over a mentorship on this yeah thank you awesome thank you Alex uh and and we'll

basically um all of those details that you've just that we've just kind of went through there's a lot more detail at this URL um and uh yeah you can check them all out and then if you have any questions go to Discord ask them in there it's very active all of the volunteers and all of these I don't think you should ask questions you should mainly just heads down and build as quickly as possible sure but if you do I have a question not about prizes but about like technology right then go there okay did you just do this via telegram right now no um very skillful I believe there are tons of bounties there are at this URL there are steps but sponsored by bounties Network that's right but also there are like I said earlier there's a bounty for Unicef there's um some Opera bounties as well and we'll be putting more up throughout the weekend so keep that in mind and keep refreshing it um Okay so this is kind of what's going to be happening and these are the main things to keep in mind um in terms of what the Run of show will be workshops are starting right after this um maybe with like a five minute break then we're also going to have some tech tech talks tomorrow and then you have the sponsors and the mentors you can access mainly through Discord so obviously they will be around here physically but to coordinate any meeting point any kind of conversation kick started get to know each other use use the um the Discord free food and drinks I mean and it looks pretty good um I haven't had a chance to taste any of it but it looks delicious I'm really excited that there's

is the space this wonderful space um this is the Discord so make note of this take photos let me go back for in there sure we should have a round of applause for the sponsor yes so good Boris this is no you're so good yeah um I get on a roll and I just must must the end okay so there this this redirects to the Discord link that you can get into it's very important um oh yes these were all the rules that you totally skipped ahead but it was very good um so now the rules for the hackathon very very important you must have a maximum of four team members per team very important uh must be physically at the event so I.E that doesn't mean that we're locking you in here so you can leave if you want but the point is to spend your time here yeah and you can't have a team member who's like elsewhere right so it's not kind of an online thing the team has to be here um no PowerPoint again the PowerPoint rule I don't love PowerPoint anyway it's very annoying so you must show the demo so when we get the teams to present they must show the demo again we love any errors that should be a wonderful natural exactly all code uh must be written here so you're not reusing things that doesn't mean that you're not like using open source libraries or anything else like that but no like oh yeah we wrote budget code open source it earlier and then we're going to build on top of it sort of thing uh you're doing projects that should be new and from scratch here uh disclosed uh meaning that put them somewhere that they're accessible online under an open source license Apache MIT GPL other things like that I personally the sponsors and uh organizers are not doing this I'm recommending Apache because it includes patent protection if anyone wants to talk about open source licenses feel free to come uh see me and we can talk nerdy about legal licenses exciting I'm excited uh finalists now these are the criteria that the finalists will be chosen on based on so technicality originality practicality design and wow factor wow [Music] you said that that was amazing um so more information again on the prizes um so now the rules this was the stuff that you said um so there's like a good time to talk about it good it was good so these are basically what Boris said earlier oh do not use the elevator we accidentally used the it was actually really awesome but don't use it do not use it it's the best experience you'll ever have in an elevator but do not use it do not just don't touch it and I think I covered all the rest of this again there will be other students here students from 42 please be respectful of them um and you know this is their space in their home that they're using well is curry part of the youth Global Network that's true um what is the next is this it that's it wow we had so much fun look at how quickly the time oh man I wish we could do this forever um Okay so okay so next we're gonna have a quick break unless everybody has any questions on everything yes it's a small elevator and we're a lot of people a hell of a lot of people and if it gets used a lot then it will break and everyone will be angry there are consequences to the fun that can be had in the elevator but you know we want to leave 42 with a working elevator so that's why we're not using it they just kindly asked us so we're gonna do that anything else can I get a summary of the number of prizes that are available yeah okay that will be announced tomorrow over email Discord or Discord yes let's go with that let's make that the Okay Okay cool so the truth will set you free okay so workshops after this go um have a little break have a little um don't bring the drinks back in yeah thank you very much good luck thank you have an awesome weekend Mercy hi excuse me okay so the the next thing that's going to happen here is team forming so if you are looking for teammates uh if you need you know if you're a three and you want one more or if you don't have a team at all stick
