okay so for this hackathon we have 650 hackers from 61 countries in 18 different time zones uh so basically for the presentations uh each team will have four minutes for their little video flash gmail and then following that it'll be three minutes for a q a session with the judges and after six eight teams will go on like a ten minute break so in terms of criteria you'll be judged on technicality originality uh practicality ui ux and dx and then there'll also be a thing called wow factor which is just like anything that can maybe surprise the judges this is just a reminder that it is in the competition and people are just here to learn and maybe develop new types of technology and so these will be our judges for today and if you want to introduce yourselves sure i'll i'll go first here my name is morgan miscalic i've got a an organization called deep sex i'm into blockchain technology things leading us with longevity really interested in the environment and i call myself somewhat of a pseudo artist so really interested in hackathons in general and i think the collective culture of hackathons is a beautiful thing to appreciate i love that i love hackathons i love seeing what people have built i love the scrappiness i love the like prototyping and the rawness hi i'm austin griffith i'm a builder on ethereum uh i focus on tooling and developer education and developer onboarding uh just trying to see lots of really cool generic components get built in the space so it's really easy to build your next product or hackathon project uh on ethereum thanks for having me all right thank you for that and now we'll get started um with our demos so here we go cameron if you can uh promote the next team i'm so sorry i told her crowd i didn't realize all right one second give me a second sorry all right you can go ahead and get started team the fire together moon together uh there's audio playing you need to click on a share share audio setting because we can't hear it right now my bad uh how about this you may have to stop sharing and then reshare there's like a little setting when you share screen to share the audio also okay cool no sound still no audio right now oh man if you select a little button that says share computer audio okay cool in the bottom left corner right there that's exciting frame first and then we're going to go get a demo with some tech integrations so d5 together moon together the idea is you can get a bunch of people you can invest in defy and do it in a way that is safe and doesn't require trust with the friends involved so no rugby pulls now this is the on boarding flow what the person is going to do is they're going to set up a nurse's safe with themselves as an owner so that's what will happen here create wallet then they will add the modules modules are custom business logic that will impact the user experience so here we have rage quit to add a new member these are defaults add a new members quite simply a new person that joins the group has to add a proportional amount of capital vice versa rage where it means someone can leave the group and when they leave they will get their share basically their proportion of funds invested back uh but then we've got stuff like dynamic protein you can take various chat app type features and bring this into the mix stuff like kicking for example um all right here the owner will set the amount of starting capital so for our example we're just going to use one each this means that new members invited here will have to send one each before they can add themselves as an owner all right so we've got one join two pending and then we're just going to go to these fight together home page so our friends have been invited the balance of the wallet is for eth and now we're going to look at the proposed transaction flow so propose transaction basically select what you want to do from the drop down menu that will have various default integrations um and then consider rationale so this rational will be saved to ipvs via ceramic um and yeah that's that's straightforward but we're going to look now what happens when a transaction has got three or four signatures required and the last friend can basically go into the details and see this conversation around the transaction so yeah that is super safe two of his friends agreed at this point the user can leave a comment and then sign and confirm or reject it so in this case yeah the user is going to sign and confirm and the transaction will go through updating the total balance to three and one ave have a width so that was the concept what we have here using scaffold.eth is the tech integration between the nostra safe and ceramic so i've already added my wallet address as it comes one um we've got starting capital that will basically send uh the initial amount of capital to the to the nurses safe or you send some funds in and out at the moment invite friends so what i can do is let me just get a random mother's address and the new threshold for signing i'll make that two all right so we've added that wallet address as another potential co-owner um and we can now also propose a transaction so we can send money to say this signed in address some ether points for [Music] uh and rational say try it out and submit so what we'll do is we'll see this ah there's a signature missing um so we haven't built that into our demo to basically handle the extra transactions all the extra signatures but it does mean that's working so that's good and then here is just a brief um demo of using ceramic so we have another page where we're just testing out the ceramic integration all right so what i can do here is just test the tiles when i submit this you'll see we've got a ceramic uh identifier here and then we've also got a specific stream id so if i cool and that's that's that i'm going to cut a short stop it over okay thank you and now we'll have three minutes for a q a you know i love this this is like something like we're building with scaffolding too did you use vera's starter kit or did you have to kind of roll your own no totally uh so start off with the hazard starter kit um and then the adding new owner was something that uh flying octopia worked on and and also there's ceramic based chat there is that right did i catch that last bit so it's not just transaction proposal but there's some kind of chat going on yeah so that that's actually we spent the majority of our time and majority of struggles so we started using the ipfs uh component initially but then we had this issue of like auth um my ceramics got something in the pipe works that will allow nurses safe to basically be the owner of a data stream and then the various co-owners of the safe can write it unfortunately it wasn't ready so we experimented first with using the key as identifier then we went to using each individual owner as a writing their own stream so we're kind of messing around with that but i think that's not something that we could in the time frame figure out and how they execute to kind of get this more chat like experience what we have is like basically everyone can just write on the screen so long as they are a co-owner of the on the safe i'm i'm so excited for gnosis safe front-ends i think that there's going to be so much innovation that's going to happen on top of any any like key insights there for me as i go forward kind of making these for more developers like what maybe something that was like oh crap i didn't expect that to happen and it fell apart or something uh well modules is really like where you get that custom user experience so you can get like if another notes are safe and it's a multi-sig it does what it says on the box but yeah you can create this custom business logic which will turn it from a multi-sig to something that resembles a chat app or something that resembles like a high-end defy application to do treasury management so and so forth so integration with modules which as you know like oren's working on that so i think you're ahead of the game in terms of like integration awesome that's great to hear great bill really cool i love the fact that you can uh sort of manage things with dows using gnosis safe and the fact that you've built a little bit of a ui i'm curious to know if you're interested in other chat platforms or if you plan to build out your own ui ux with the uh i think you use the starter kit there really cool yeah um i mean my background i actually used to work for wechat and then i worked with status.im um i've always i've dreamed about it pretty much from day one uh my origin story is like frustration with wechat and the banking apis and that's how i got into ethereum so 100 um thought about doing some different um different iterations of the chat experience but using decentralized technologies um with regards to interface uh we did we really didn't get that basically just using the amp components with scaffold.e to kind of make it more a reddit type ux of like commenting posting and commenting but um yeah there's definitely a lot of room for for different um types if we put if we put a module into a starter kit what's a super simple like how about like spending limit module or something like that is there like a default like really obvious module that would be good to ship with a starter kit uh yeah i mean there's a few already written um so if you check out token walk is making a bunch specifically for dials oren with zodiac is doing a bunch of us specifically with dallas they're actually the one that okay that's not uh we can shadow flight but there's there's a bunch great build cool thanks a lot uh really enjoyed the experience thank you for that and just a reminder that when your presentations are done um our admin will either will demote you and then you'll either stay in the zoom and watch or you can just leave and then our next team up will be team ferry i don't know it may be me or i'm lagging a bit it seems that when i press promote unless it's working now okay never mind sorry um yeah hi did you call the next team to start uh team theory is up right now if that's you then can you guys go after green chair yeah yes it is it is me but um for some reason i don't see two of my other teammates here um do you see them in the attendees list um oh actually no oh okay okay i'm okay i do i i do see ben ben um yourself yes yes yes if one of you guys could just screen share and then uh start the video if none of you unless your roommates are like in the zoom then i don't think we can do anything okay um okay cool um cool okay yeah i've got my video um ready um oh wait i think someone just joined cameron can you promote them sydney is she in your group yes yes yes sydney is okay maybe we can wait like 30 more seconds yes is that be cool yeah oh their internet cut out okay okay but yeah i think they're coming back in okay 20 more seconds just waiting for our full stack developer to come differently that's okay on my end i'm just enjoying some hummingbirds come by so i'm cool to wait oh thanks that's awesome what never mind hey guys really sorry about that okay cool i can share my screen i'm going to be sharing my screen and i'm going to be showing my computer audio hello hackerfest this is ferry a ux friendly web3 file transfer tool built on ipfs filecline quite simply our tool sends files from one person to another similar to other web 2 tools you have used before but now decentralized millions of people depend on centralized file transfer tools every day which proves the need for decentralized alternative the web3 ecosystem needs solutions that let people migrate from web 2 without even realizing it ferry provides a familiar workflow for file transfers one that mirrors what people are already comfortable with fairy is the ideal tool for anyone who wants to use this tool for work as a tech industry freelancer journalist or creative who needs to send files that are larger than the usual email size so how would this work fairy leverages content addressing to minimize our storage usage and we pass these savings onto our users we are using versailles and magic to create a did for our users for upload we are building on protocol labs new web3 storage service to store our users files through this we can give the user temporary storage space where they can get access to space for free to send their files they can get more storage space and longer file persistence with a paid subscription we can periodically reclaim storage space on the free tier of the system in order not to be wasteful this ecosystem is made up of four contracts deployed on polygons test nets two of these make up the governance token ship and its taking rewards module the core theory contract handles payments pro subscriptions and integrates with ave to earn yield by lending out the protocols dime the fourth contract is the nft mentor which integrates with chain link and zora to bring true randomness to the rarity of our nfts a gift for any pro members who subscribe for a month or more so let's get into the demo let's start off with how anyone can just pick up this tool and start fearing files immediately without any subscription or payments step 1 they will log in and create an account with a drd using a magic link after the file is uploaded on ipfs we get its content address which we can use to create an ipvs gateway which can be used as is or emailed to the user's recipient after this all we need to do is ferry it lastly the receiver will get an email and download their file like this easy and done now for the paid version let's jump to after the login step and connect our wallets so here we connect the wallet in order to buy a subscription our users get more storage for less cost but more importantly they get freedom from the cloud storage provider homogeny on the dashboard is where we can see a list of all links generated we can see how much space we have left and check how many governance tokens we have and which nft we have been issued these gifted nfts will unlock more rewards in the future this is how we plan to create incentives for use of our tool for more on our roadmap you can see here or go to our deployed website at this address we hope we see all hackerfest hackers and organizers using ferry as soon as possible so that when they have files to transfer they can simply ferry it all right all right now you guys will have three minutes for q a i just want to say i really love the ui you guys did an amazing job with the greens all the it's very pleasant from the perspective and also the sort of flow that you've took us through i found it being quite incredible so kudos to that i wanted to know if you had any issues with web3 storage for ca implementations with the certain specific use cases you might be looking at other than what you mentioned i must say the developer experience was amazing um it worked really really well um i guess the only issue we ran into was that the ability to delete files through the web3 storage clients the javascript line hasn't been implemented yet but i'm actually planning on making a pr to do the last piece of it myself um so maybe that'll hurry it up but besides that it works like a dream great to hear good job thanks okay so zooming in on that design a little bit the the ui is beautiful what did what does your stack look like to build that app what did you guys use so yeah we're lucky to have some fantastic ui designers who figured out how it should work um visually in figma and then we built this using an xjs which is a react framework and then we deployed it with result um it actually also heavily leverages versus serverless functions feature so it essentially has separate apis for each of the things like login logout upload a file etc and magic for the wallet right magic email yeah to generate the id so instead of having so we essentially have a list of users in 400 db but instead of having usernames with passwords we just have um emails and there was one like curveball you threw in there about there's an nft with vrf randomness like what what is the i get the file and i get that we're sharing the file and i get that we're logging in but where did what does the mft do like what is that where is it that's the drive um that's to drive adoption and use of the um of the app so we want to kind of incentivize people who buy a pro subscription that they can get an nft it will be randomized there's four rarity tiers and based on the rarity tears people can be um air dropped government tokens um when uh we launched a maintenance but ben then did you have more ideas about the nfts yeah i know that i think you pretty much touched on it um basically just uh we wanted to create a really nice package for our pro subscribers um so we wanted to put a bit of effort into the nft experience and so it's uh yeah it's using chain links vrf to ensure the randomness and the rarity and then it's also minting through zora so then it's tradable already on their platform how long did this take to build there's a lot there's a lot here but how long was it start to finish for you guys uh like two weeks i think okay yeah great work yeah really some sleepless nights oh sorry yeah this last weekend was it was a bit sleepless to say the least and and i'd ask next steps but it sounds like i mean that you're you're purposefully you've got this governance token like you're you're trying to deploy this thing as a platform and and mainnet ethereum or mainnet polygon we're probably going to start on polygon uh just because i think the cost of of paying the subscription and minting the nft and is sort of a chain link callback thing so that you have to pay and then wait a bit for that vrf to issue you a random number and then you can mentor nft uh that'll get quite costly on ethereum so we're probably gonna launch on polygon first really really dope build really complex really beautiful i if i if i could give any feedback or or criticism i would say maybe you made it too complicated like maybe focus just on the file sharing maybe focus just on the internet but that's it it was too easy just to show the file sharing like too fast we actually had to put it in web 3 storage it was too easy to use it's so good that's so good well good luck with this like this is uh you know it's not this moment it's the next moment when you guys go live that's the big moment you guys have already built something amazing here so this is you know take a victory lap and enjoy it and and get ready to go live good job good job thank you thanks amazing work really really happy to see you thank you team fairy so next up we'll have team open labs if you want to go ahead and share your screen hey everyone yup i'll go right ahead hi i'm quan and today i'll be introducing open labs the problem that we are looking into is the reproducibility crisis in academia which according to a recent poll as much as 90 of scientists believe to be a big problem the problem is that a lot of published results in fields such as medicine or psychology simply cannot be replicated and this is often attributed to the lack of replication efforts within the community and a very opaque structure in how data from research are being shared around we propose sort of like a github issues for scholarly research to help mitigate this situation number one we want to create a blockchain platform where all researchers can upload their project materials the files that are uploaded are tracked by version control and can be openly reviewed by any other user secondly we also learned that reviewers are often motivated by the wish to give back and build up a reputation we want to create a hub a permanent record where their contribution can be publicly credited lastly we also want to experiment with decentralized governance of the platform by allowing researchers to form their own decentralized group and vote on which projects to admit into their group we are a team of three i'm the lead engineer alexey is the front-end developer and jackie is our webtree developer we use three main technology for this project ceramic for version control project files webtree storage for the storage and file themselves and polygon to handle the peer review logic and to track social credits we also how to integrate the graph for data query and chain link for more fine-tuned user authentication in the future let's take a look at the app itself here we are at the home page and we see a list of projects from other researchers let's take a look at this one and in the middle part is a list of all the materials that the authors have uploaded now it seems like this author has uploaded a survey let's take a quick look and i can write a review having written my review i can then submit and then stake a portion of my social credit to back up my claims as you can see my review is now tracked on the blockchain if it is not marked as fraudulent within a fixed duration of time then i can unstake and gain rewards for my participation the labs feature is also an important aspect of our platform let's create our own lab and start inviting other people's projects to it after filling in the information i can then spend 10 social credits to create my own lab as a founder i start with a certain amount of tokens which i can spend on other people's projects i click on the vouch button select the relevant lab and select the amount to vouch for this project now that this project is affiliated with the lab anytime that someone reviews this paper they will also gain some tokens from the lab itself which they can then spend to vouch on more papers or to govern the lab itself we foresee that labs will become a big driving force of community engagement on our platform as it provides researchers with a very simple way to connect with others in their niche as well as to run a decentralized organization and directly influence the future direction of their field all right three minutes for q a starts now i like the use of the 1155 uh that's a that's a cool way to do that like the the vouch system with an 1155 it makes sense to do that uh i'm i'm just digging into the code yeah i don't have like a specific question yet maybe i'll uh yield to morgan and then come back yeah sure i just want to say i think that the the game for a lot of science and psychology is really changing and i think that doing this type of labs as a service protocol is like a really cool way it's almost like the social credit system creating more trust and able to get resources to the right data [Music] you know it seems like this sort of cross tokenization can sort of create this like dao as a service with these labs i'm wondering if you thought about something related to you know specific use cases with institutions or are you thinking more about like the sort of like myself which is like a you know independent researcher where do you see your focus um fitting in yeah absolutely we are looking at uh this labs are sort of a tao uh we are thinking that it's uh more decentralized and more like democratic in a way that like let's say you're someone who's very passionate about cancer research then you can start this own lab and it sort of acts again a celebrity of sort where you can start helping to curate projects that you think are interesting you vote for them and then those people of those projects start start earning those tokens and they become part of the community and they can like vote for more people to join uh the lab and our core concern is actually around the issue of peer review and you know there's not that strong incentive for very busy researchers to be looking at each other's paper uh but what if we tied that to this idea of reputation and like building community and that's what these labs as a doubt kind of incentivize they will start reviewing each other and then gain social credits and then build this reciprocation reciprocal relationship with one another i think so the i i feel like one of the hardest things is actually getting like getting people to use it right i love that you're like trying to align incentives and trying to set something up where people can use it uh kind of like two paths here like let's say this gets adoption and people use it what how how do you get that adoption and then if you don't get that adoption what's next for you within ethereum if if this doesn't hit absolutely so you want the adoption to be very organic it'd be good around the way like academia work i personally am an undergraduate researcher so i know like there's a lot of like actual like labs with like professors phd postdocs and that kind of stuff and so one way we could see adoption being incentivized is kind of like you know within the lab like uh professors encourage the students to use this to start gathering feedback for their for their results and also for especially people in like soft sciences where credibility is a big issue you want to be able to stand up from from your competitor so imagine if you could write in your paper that oh yeah all these code and scripts has been reviewed by the open society on open labs yeah so you need to find a professor or someone on the ground and get this in their hands and get them using it absolutely like this great good hackathon project yeah appreciate it thank you thank you team open labs now we'll go on to team medibank hey so let me just share my screen can you see my screen now okay so i'm just gonna start playing and okay hi i'm lowell and together with george and frank are team metabank there are 1.7 billion adults who lack bank accounts and one of the major reasons is because traditional banks require a multitude of factors such as steady income history maintenance fees and credit ratings in the metaverse such problems didn't exist in fact there's even an opportunity to create a banking system that is advantageous in a global scale such advantage include the opportunity to borrow money with lesser requirements compared with traditional banks this is where metabank comes in medibank makes it easier to access high-yield savings account and under collateralized loans that serve as digital credit cards all within the confines of a metaphors they can even purchase an nft through various platforms we use ipfs avi and polygon and for the product presentation here is george okay so to get started you want logging with metamask it should be connected if you haven't already join as a member to the bank otherwise you can't deposit or withdraw your savings or get a credit card or and what not so once that's done now you remember you could deposit into your savings you have your credit uh you don't have any right now but you can get one once you deposit savings and you have the pool of overall amount uh interest garnered and also the number of members so let's so now let's uh deposit into our savings uh you could only deposit dye so if you don't have any already then deposit some dye in some swap some eat into dye so we'll just do one eat all right now that you have your now that you have your dye uh you want to pause your die so we'll do 2000 die you want to prove that and then you want to deposit the die in there so now you have two now you have 2 000 die in the contract uh it's confirmed also in the dashboard so now look at your dashboard you got 2000 died and because you have uh some some savings in your account now you could make a credit card so make a credit card is pretty easy as long as you have uh some money depositing your savings you can generate a credit limit so i have a credit limit of uh almost 500 dollars if i'm satisfied with that then i just get my credit card okay so now you have your credit contract uh and all you need to do is activate your your so-called digital credit card so now you have credit available um that you can use to spend on anything just like a digital just just like a regular credit card um and then you have the option to always repay back uh repay that credit um you know whenever you need to but it has been usbc um and that's it i go back to the dashboard you can see the whole summary of your and you can see the whole summary of your account savings credit and the entire pool thank you so yeah we are now open for questions if you want to sell online yeah i had an initial question here i know that uh ave kind of have some intricacies with their their uh contracts and so it's great to see what you've got going on with there um i love to see the fact that credit people can pool their resources together have you considered things related to reputation or how you might involve you know whether the credit creditworthiness of an individual or groups together in some dynamic whether it's through culture or other mechanisms like reputation or identity yeah um so i ideally would want to add in like verifiable credentials um so whether that be like hyperledger aries uh we looked into ceramic with the idx or uh some other digital identity where um you know you could you could validate yourself uh as of right now since we don't have anyone technically verified it's just your your wallet uh you know it's just it's just pegged to 101 at most um so depending on the amount of savings you have you could only borrow up to that amount uh otherwise you know once you have verified credentials then it could be like we have it where you do up to 3x borrowed amount so you could actually have undercollateralized uh you know credit and then it just works essentially just like a credit card and how does it map in if other people in the pool assist in [Music] your connection's a little choppy i'm not sure my internet was i think it's i think it might be morgan's yeah it's the hummingbirds they're fluttering around messing up your wi-fi here's the frequencies yeah awesome you can go ahead with the question i don't want to take up time so uh did you guys i i went to go check out your code and the the link is broken i don't know i'll i'll paste it in here maybe it's someone else's yeah i think something like that i have it on private if you guys wouldn't mind yeah if you guys want mine and and my question would be like did you guys have to write any custom smart contracts for this or is it basically just piggybacked on avi and polygon uh it's mainly just on top of ave which is dope which is dope that's just a question yeah essentially when you when you like uh you know ask for credit uh you actually deploy your own uh contract that you have complete control over um as the user um so trying to trying to organize that where you know your credit contract interacts with the savings pool um it was a little complicated in terms of trying to make that interact at first but we were able to figure that out um so yeah it was not too much customization it which is more of how we organized the code okay to make sure i understood that so to paste your paste your link into your contract if you guys have it but you guys do deploy a custom contract and it basically acts kind of like a smart contract wallet where it's the identity and it's taking out the credit line okay cool i so the the custom contract thing was like just a question like i think that some of the best apps that we see are going to be built on top of these services that already exist and yeah sometimes you'll need a smart contract for and what's cool is if you have that smart contract there you can do things like gasless transactions and some more magical things where where that that is the identity and you can just be signing messages and relay them in cool cool build i i i liked your design too what what did you guys use for your front end like how did you how did you guys create that uh we used an xjs and then um a lot of it was custom css yeah it's a nice clean design thank you thank you yeah okay uh thank you for that metabank uh next up we have team sid sign sorry if i messed up the name but you can correct me if i'm wrong good all right please share your screen and start your presentation welcome to the presentation for sit sign which sign saves with domain names this is a hack fs 2021 submission my name is nick west of james github vandal at nickwestjam uh this is me appreciate wildly hockey code and give fun presentations uh the problem is lack of easily verifiable and permanent way to sign documents without modifying them uh think of a school transcript these are hard to sign uh we typically there's a team working at different academic institutions uh who send out hard copies or respond to queries people these hardcovers are signed with a physical stamp uh unofficial transcripts are sent out in pdf format which are unsigned so think how could the schools more easily currently sign these documents in an open way how can you save on employee time responding to these requests i employ them both for the institution and for the employers existing solutions difficult to use typically they work within a corporate internet and they require high barrier to entry deci infrastructure is not user friendly and they often require modification to the underlying base file solution is what it who uploaded that document this allows sids to be signed by domain name owners and this signature should be easily verified by anyone it has spell uploading with web3 storage should sign using ethereum blockchain and using safety domain name records to verify ownership of ethereum addresses let's go to a quick demo so we're a page thinkingzoo.com we need metamask right now for this we're going to select the file test.txt this could be any file any transcript what this does this uploads it it gets the cib and queries our smart contract for that cid uh this is using the injected web food provider but could be used for something like computer also if you don't have uh injected website providers we can see the different ethereum accounts that have signed this sid in our smart contract what dates and what linked domain names to sign this document it's very easy give it inject whip through provider click sign it's going to pop up a meta mask type solution and we're just going to assign it no problem so we'll give that a sec see if this works okay one second here okay right now we can see we're waiting for it to send okay it's been sent we can see this is our current time and a most recent update here uh for these link domains what happens is we look at the domain txt records so we can see westjam.com here cxc record we've got an address stating ownership on this theorem address so got an api endpoint you can add domains to this and it will search the domain records for that app that ethereum address so let's say i want to add westjam.com to this real simple this has been added i go back to our wedded page refresh it we can see the ethernet gross ownership has been uh it's been updated so very simple there's also an easy browser extension here uh this is a hack fs page i can see some of their addresses on here so i've got an extension here which will just check regressions on the page and i just verify the ownership if that exists in our system so this tech stack can gone through front end no surprises back end django rest frame request some solidity and add some css for the browser extension lots of limitations education is not really captured security needs to be uh delve into deeper but this is just going to show us what it could be this all live demo all working as you've seen it and github pages up inclusion uh this is a way to permanently assign a document but modifying the base file it's fully open and the links domains to ethereum addresses enabling easy understanding of who's signed to sit uh more work to be done but definitely see some space some opportunity in the academic space thanks for your time okay now we'll move on to three minutes for q a i'm not seeing the github repo there well i i clicked through to your github repo and i just see a readme and a license am i am i looking at the wrong repo i think the wrong repo if you go to nick west jam has the user and then the repos did sign yeah i was able to pull it up i just posted in the chat really great work tying in all these different technologies it's uh it's cool to see the the signatures with the normal dns and doing that stored in a decentralized way i'm i'm curious to know whether or not you thought about like specific use cases or people that might be using it other than just the broad term of institutions or um it seems like it's kind of like a mix between these decentralized and centralized kind of parties here where do you see the first user yeah i really see it actually is for academic like universities i'm thinking like my brother just got his transcripts mailed off but it cost him 20 canadian to send them to each institution you have to send it to at least nine different locations so a couple hundred bucks um i just see that so easily being done as like a pdf that can be digitally signed for your transcripts um also another easy one would be like if maybe that's a little more formal if you have an online course and you want a more official certificate i could see that as an easy use case also awesome yeah the credentialization of uh domain uh domain names and like institutions i think it's really interesting you can even have you thought about like ens as as well in the future uh i haven't dug too too deep into that i wanted to use like the really the existing one uh because i want to like make it so almost like the opposite of not being anonymous i want to make it like very uh like tying into traditional identities of who who this is cool yeah i really like the practicality great job great work on the technical side too thanks yeah speaking of practicality like you get extra points when there's like a live demo that i can get into and click into and log in and you guys did that and and it's not pretty but it's live and it works and that's how hackathon projects need to work so yeah good job good hackathon project like morgan said you guys brought a lot of stuff together i noticed even like a chrome extension like you needed the chrome extension to do the signatures or what what was the chrome extension like why did you need that i didn't need it i just thought i could do it and i was like like 20 lines of code the most hockey chrome extension ever i was like i'll throw it in there why not good good hackathon project nice work guys you're going to overtake metamask in the institution cool thanks okay if you guys are done we'll move on to team dai and just wait a minute just sharing 2 hello everyone i'm from uh team de ai and uh in in our uh hackathon project we have tried to combine two big technologies of the present world known as machine learning and blockchain so uh now i'm going to tell you what our project is really about so data privacy is a big concern uh people want good recommendation engines uh but they don't want to give their data also getting data for uh making medical machine learning models is a very big deal as a patient data need to be kept private and very less uh medical data is available on the web so dea solve this problem by giving an architecture however you provide your data to train machine learning models but nobody owns your data nor your data is exposed to any anywhere only a hash of your data is stored in our data handler we have used with three stories as a data handler here and yes so this has this hash is irreversible and is used to keep in check that the data that we are providing to our uh modern training model is not duplicate and uh nobody is just spamming uh uh same um same data so uh now as we have moved inside the inside our app so uh now we'll be uh we have deployed a basic machine learning model which is the sentiment analysis model and uh we'll be demonstrating demonstrating uh this model sentiment analysis model so uh as we see uh the bottom uh section this is the tray module uh so anyone uh who is willing to provide data to train our model i can write their data here and restrain and the given data shows that the given uh comment is a positive commit being converted to the smart contract for training so uh when you press train it asks for uh to take some ethereum this is to make sure that the data provided is good so whenever the model's accuracy is increased the model is updated and disposed to the web3 storage this model then can be used for getting predictions any user who wants to get predictions has to uh by subscription we have used unlocked protocols for buying subscriptions here here so now we will be demonstrating the getting predictions then get prediction will be right because you are toast below that so the subscription has been pursued here it is so as it shows uh this is a uh positive uh review positive review so this output has been given from uh the from our trained model that has been trained on the smart contract using users data and uh the data is not uh revealed or exposed anywhere so that was all about our project uh thank you and have a nice day see you around the victory space combining ml and something that's like something that's like expensive to process and store with blockchain where it's like you can't you can't kind of run that stuff and store that stuff it's it's an always an interesting way to mix those things and see how people figure out how to do that so good work cool cool project it's a fun hackathon project yes actually uh last summer like this june or july we were really working on a research project that includes some medical data and uh we lacked that uh medical data and there uh it's kept private for a patient's privacy uh so we have actually failed this so we needed a solution in blockchain was the only solution and in this hackathon we found a really cool tool to build this project and went for it yeah really really cool i love the fact that you know different medical institutions or different places can have different options with how they're processing their data um you're curious to know the uh the tech stack with where you're storing it is just through you mentioned web3 but i'm wondering if also the model gets stored as well and tracked because i'd like to see you know some type of yeah go ahead uh actually uh first of all we were uh like training the model on the smart contract as well as storing it over storing it on the smart contract also but uh that included a fee uh and the web3 storage uh such a great storage tool that reduced our uh cost uh reduces the cost of storing our data uh that model that can be used uh by any uh applications that uh just needs to use that data that data model to get predictions uh like if you wanna uh any hospital wants to train their corona detection model then it can just build and uh can access that with three stories a model uh only it does not need to uh be connected to the smart contracts okay uh the that segment can be built separately also very cool yeah i'd like to see more development with like the ability to choose different biases from models and the ability for a doctor to become like almost a pseudo scientist with ai as well as like this augmented tool really really cool i had to dig i had to dig into the contracts and look and sure enough like you're normalizing weights you're like finding the prediction and you're you're in a for loop looking through the weights and adding them together so like i can't i can't believe you put this all into solidity but it's really cool how how you you're classifying and you're actually like bringing this data in and you're running it through the evm so again super neat hackathon project being able to bring ml data and solidity and smart contracts together yes sleepless nights that's what it's called good work keep packing i want to see you around the ethereum space more of course of course thank you okay thank you team dei and next we'll move on to team weather timeline hello i don't think you're sharing audio if the video is playing sound we can't hear it yet fine it should be a setting for screen share hi i'm christian monk i am a participant in hack efforts and i have made the idea whether timeline that is only a idea i haven't coached yet [Music] [Music] i'm [Music] results uh what is the wealth like today if you ask you would impact my day we can accept using pressure data in our open charge process which we have rather have from open with our map on the weather from [Music] um the image [Music] from windows [Music] with precious [Music] um timeline i like to use weather better yeah um and the ushers can share content hey good good hackathon project it's it was in the white paper and vitalik wrote about how we would have weather and insurance together and how oracles would do this and we still don't see this built so are you going to continue building this yes i have contact with another hacker from [Music] so we hope to make the back end for something with a weather timeline for but the devil they belong but and uh big uh firms is the idea uh because they are not uh any open data yet not enough open data on the web to get used to your copy or save on epfs or something fleek and slate are something i think of another one i'll share is google weather from chainlink they do an oracle service and i'll share it in the chat and you can share that with your developer too yes so have to learn to program and have to learn all this blockchain and you can't even i have been with you since last time so it's evolved and my day i haven't found any weather data or weather apps or steps onto this so i think my idea for an end user is unique yeah like austin mentioned i uh i think that there are some open open weather sourcing but it'd be cool to you know tie in more developers into decentralized hardware that might look at uh other sourcing that uh you might be able to run nodes on like ipfs or something like that where it goes direct to source that might be an interesting hack as well i i love the idea of hardware out in the field too the gathering rain and and and reporting on how much rain it picked up that that's another interesting angle yes the old data uh the tmi in denmark weather service working for a new uh open data and all weather from service from the national interest no time work for open data at weather so this well keep hacking keep building say yes i want to see it get built yeah christian i think i just seeing uh seeing your project from last time and this hackerfest it's great so hopefully we get to see the first ever weather dab from from you read online thank you so much thank you team weather timeline and uh we'll be moving on to team crypto devs nft but uh following their presentation we will have a 10 minute break hi everybody starting to share my screen here hi my name is rory and this is my project submission for hack fs 2021 the name of my project is crypto devs and is an nft for aspiring crypto developers um i came into this hackathon looking to hack solo so i could gauge where my skill set was from brainstorming all the way through to coding and this is what i came up with so i will do a short demo first i developed the contracts and did all the testing in hard hat and first thing i'm going to do is show you my show you the hard hat tests and there that they are all passing second thing i'm going to do is i've set up a local hard hat node already and it's running so i'm going to go ahead and deploy the contract to the local host now that we've done that i'm going to go ahead and show you the front end here and first thing it wants to let me to log into metamask or our favorite wallet here we're going to go ahead and do that and that lets us that shows that our wallet is connected and we're going to go ahead and fill out our portfolio information before we send it before we mint it as an nft first we choose our image then our name and i went ahead and pre-wrote this and i'm going to copy paste it so that this demo goes by a little bit quicker but this is just a brief summary this will actually appear on openc um in the description field and we're going to go ahead and select some of our skills here solidity hard hat node since this is my first react project we're not going to select that ethers js has been a great help during this project so we're going to select that we also have the looking for web3 development job checkbox here and you can turn that on or off depending on what your situation is and next we're going to go ahead and copy our project details here and what this is is this stores on ipfs a markdown file which has you can use to showcase your your projects we're gonna go ahead and paste that and we're gonna click click the mint new nft button here um while that's working what's going to happen is in the background it's using the web3.storage api and it's sending that image there getting a cid for it and then changing the source of the html to look for that proper image there um pretty soon here it will be asking me to confirm a transaction lately my uh metamask has been a little slow on my local host but what i have done is i have deployed this to the rinkeby test net already and the great thing about this here is that you're able to display all your nfts um currently right now there's only one minted these are these nfts are non-transferable and there's only one allowed per address but i i think it's really nice that you can be able to integrate into openc like this and i obviously i use the web3.storage api to build the metadata file and then submit it and get the cid and mint the token with that um as you see here there's our description here that we filled in and then the properties are here as well the job status you can see is looking um ethers js hard hat so our skills are highlighted here and that's that's how it appears on openc alright thank you for watching my demo i appreciate it thank you for the presentation we moving on to the three-minute q a now so so it's an nft that represents a developer's abilities and then as you were building it you're kind of like registering your own abilities as you went through it it's this is a very meta but very good uh uh hackathon project i i almost wanna i want my question to be like more meta in terms of how how can we do better as a space to to onboard what what was maybe the hardest part for you in terms of getting this built and getting it shipped um honestly the the part the hardest part was the brainstorming and okay i i came into this looking at all the sponsors i'm really new to the web 3 space so i was trying to absorb all the sponsors and the seminars and all that and just there's so much available and there's so much interesting to look at to me it was about narrowing down what what i could look at what i could you know absorb because it was just too much i was trying to absorb and put so many things in that i think i got just a little bit distracted so the brainstorming was tough um there's so many things that i that i that i wanted to do but i just felt like i needed to kind of pick one and you know narrow down and that's you know there was there's so many things and like so many of these projects that are in this hackathon are amazing and there's there's like so many things to look at and so many things to really deep dive into but what i wanted to make sure is that i had a development process so i had to cut short a lot of the you know exploring and you know expanding what else was available to to kind of narrow down and get a project done at first at first i was going to say like was there the inspiration available it sounds like the tooling was good and the inspiration was there and you had a bunch of examples it was just kind of synthesizing it down to what what are my abilities to apply these to this tooling to these one of these ideas and what can i what can i get done so it sounds like you had the inspiration and you had the tooling it was just about like narrowing it down and attacking it is that right yeah that's that's absolutely it cool maybe maybe as an ecosystem we could provide a little bit better tech tree where it's like you get you get this ability and then and then it upgrades to disability and this ability and you start with like nfts but then you get to like a dex eventually or something like that this is a better comment cool hackathon project thank you very much i appreciate your comment yeah i really love the ideas there the extra add-ons and uh really cool to see the sort of non-transport side i know that with nfts sort of just as an identifier you can be sort of weighty but when you have sort of like this ens type thing that represents not just a name but also extra add-ons with skills and whatnot can be really really cool and a lot of use cases have you considered looking at like gnosis now or incorporating with other types of social networks um you might uh i i haven't at this point really really what i wanted to do is just absorb myself and get a get a project and i definitely had to pivot on a couple of my ideas through the through the project just because i didn't really know what was available um but i think the most exciting thing is that i was able to get this all done in the browser and i didn't have to post anything which to me i'm a i come from php and older to me when i came into this i just assumed that i needed to have a server running and post it to there and working with the web3 api and learning react and getting it all to work in the browser was was really impressive to me and it really it really was something that was like an eye-opening moment like wow we can do this totally different way yeah awesome love to see more of it i wanted to dive into your contract real quick to see how you disabled uh token transfer and it looks like you hooked into the before token transfer and then uh you just require that the address is zero which would make it uh impossible or possible yeah cool to do that i wrote test cases and it and it passed all my test cases so that was good enough for me so that's another thing to give props to is you you you led with the test cases you said here's the starters the first and here are the test cases that's how i did try and develop it was test test first and make that work keep hacking and building on ethereum i want to see you at the next one excellent thank you very much for your comments guys appreciate it thank you team crypto does nft we'll be taking our 10 minute break now but after the break we'll have team t chan all right we're going to get started again our break is over so the next team going will be team d chang we'll wait for everybody to come back though there's a quick note austin is uh there we go all right if we're all ready then team d10 you are good to go hey guys what's up okay let me just share my screen um so hey guys i'm representing decentralized memes and blogging uh the reason behind this hack was because uh people sometimes feel scary to be who they are and in normal platforms uh you know normal platformers don't help people express their opinions because uh you have your login you have your profile like oh people know you and like if you say something wrong they're just gonna bully you you know they're just gonna talk about you and they're gonna come after you so uh i'm actually i i don't think that's human at all because there's one secret about being human is that talking and listening come together you got to respect that so on the channel you can post your memes transform them into nfts and monetize on your ideas and topics so let's go to demo uh so localhost right uh we're here so first things first you can actually create uh your login so cute pikachu and uh we can get an image here from cube pikachu and this is created on ceramics so uh i already have a login i'm not gonna you you get the image picture the image login okay and you just set your profile so i'm just going to read my profile from my wallet and it's my name is obi-san so i created the obi-san and report and uh here it is you know it's a picture it's a picture of obi-wan if i actually uh open it up it goes to the image link yay well of course i know he's me if i ping one two seven zero zero one okay so let's let's have some fun here in each hand so i'm gonna post the picture i came into mecca because i love my cuts so gundams will be real you have to believe me uh so i'm just gonna create this simple meme here you have to believe me and i'm gonna sell it for a 0.3 matic prize and i'm pretty sure i have a gundam picture with me so let's uh where are you here you are gundam jpeg so this is gonna go to ipfs okay it's connected to inferior so when i create this post it's it's going to be sent there and there's going to be a pricing list for the platform so it can maintain itself and later we can withdraw and if you don't love me yet at me at my then you don't deserve me at my best so gundams will be real uh let's just test it out i'm gonna buy this and it's gonna show up in my collection so uh you can collect your memes and collect your topics from people posting on these different topics and um there's some i really like this project and i i just want to pump it up here i just want to create many topics i want to have i don't know maybe have two lines of navigation uh and i also wanna hack in some cool chatting and posting uh chit chat you know like kind of uh components and i'm really in love with this project and that was the chum yeah guys that was my demo i like the topics across the top that design with the color scheme with the topics i think that's probably my favorite part so just to zoom in it looks like it's cool it looks like you you made a post and then you're able to sell the post is that is that a single one is it fractionalized is it an erc 721 it is an 11 55. oh sorry well it's not 11 55. it's an nfc uh it's 721. so when you post the topic you can actually just like put the price in a very high price and people will never buy your post but you want to just permanently put it there you know like uh i don't know like i got some info from the pentagon and you put the price up and like it just stays there on topic you know and people can won't ever buy that or maybe the pentagon will actually have to buy that to hide up the information so yeah it's 721 uh it's i'm using concat to reverse so every time the post it's always the newest post that's going to be showing up and the last post is going to be post number one another thing that i want to pull into the contract is actually the token number so like uh maybe dubs and trips and quads will exist on blockchain that's going to be awesome so like that's gonna overprice the price because like oh it's the first quads ever or the first uh the first dubs ever on the chan and i think that's actually pretty cool idea i'm gonna pull that up too yeah the colors the color scheme took me like forever i had to like read one and read 500 and just you know start pulling it up [Music] what are all these okay there's like a ton of contracts in here but i think they're all just 721s is that right they're all very yeah they're basically the same contracts i just changed the the typing on them and the market and uh and like where they're pointing into so that actually every time like we can actually have different number of posts so like uh if you enter into 4chan or another chat like you can go to a topic and there's over 333 million posts on politicians but if you go to mecca there's only like 200 000 posts but that's the cool part about it it's not that it's just one nft contract but there's various nfc contracts bringing into the different numbers of tokens yeah i also like the design at the top it almost looks like a spectrum of uh information flow going to this like decentralized chan mimetic uh culture that you're trying to create here curious to know that the the tech stack like the uh how are you posting it is it using web3 storage or is it done ceramic or well the ceramic is just for a profile it actually you can you can actually post without making your profile it's just so that it's just one extra flavor that i put into it you know but i in the future i'm only going to make posts if you have your ceramics set up you know so it was kind of hard to actually make it all functional because there are over 73 contracts working there uh can you redo your question somebody's calling me i just asked myself sorry master morgan can you redo your question uh yeah no just curious about the tech stack and also the aspect of moderation as well okay so techstack i use basically next js and i use the link to link all of the contracts and i also i'm for the chit chat i'm using i didn't post this one on the github but i'm using aws to to actually start making posts and also i'm using master ryan's discordion but to actually do that to actually use uh ssl and and file coin to make a decentralized full chat chit chat thing uh i'll need to actually have the entire domain so i would have to buy d chum slash x dot com and all of that ssl to make this like special h h r e f i think that's a link to these chit chats you know um i think what else can i say about the the back end of it yeah it's basically next gs and and i'm using hard hat and i'm using uh yeah i think that's that and react and next and cool yeah yeah interesting concept thanks a lot master morgan good hackathon project keep building i want to see you at the next one hey i'm going to conclude this one this one this one's awesome take care austin bye-bye yeah thank you team d-chan and now we'll be moving on to team discovery which should be our last team of the session hi so hello everyone we will do a short intro before starting the video and yeah before diving into the demo focused on the technical and functional aspects we would like to present our project in simpler terms discovery educates and onboard users and developers into the future of the web how do we do this by providing qualitative courses with reliable information that can be proposed validated and updated by the community and now i'll share my screen discovery is a gamified learning platform where members of the official web 3 protocol teams collaborate yeah i don't think you're shooting the audio uh uh i'm sorry for that i checked in the box i think it is but it's just really quiet it's there yeah if anyone else in the team can so let me see just crank it up as much as you can and hit go we can we can deal with it we'll turn it up it is a max volume right now so i am freaking but i'll reshare and hopefully it will be better discovery is a gamified learning platform where members of the official web 3 protocol teams collaborate with community experts in various fields such as content creation and research development or security to create high quality courses that are built around open source trustable and verifiable content the first step for users will be to log in with their metamask wallet or other web3 wallet through the polygon network when you first log in you will need to sign a ceramic string and here we do that and once we get logged in it will go ahead and take us to the starter profile page it does take a couple of seconds to create the the new user did all right and here we are on our projects path and we're going to go ahead and start with the polygon path and we're gonna go with the best defy projects on polygon and let's open up our quest and once these questions are answered we'll be able to mint our nft so yes there is polygon or ave available on the old matic network and the test net is called mumbai so we'll submit these it is adjustment or nft it is at this point that we will use chain link to verify that the user has completed the quest successfully and that they are attempting to claim the reward chain link will check the ceramic stream and verify that the user's did uh will match the record completing the quest related to the reward that they are trying to claim and only then will the user be allowed to mint their nft this will actually directly be stored on nft.storage in addition to creating our own lessons in quest in-house we also plan on making our entire platform completely modular we focus on this by creating and providing a template and working with the official protocol team so that they are able to create courses and challenges for the things they would like to see their protocol used for with this protocols will not only be able to suggest and work with the discovery team to create content but they will be able to actually create their own content as well as offer their own rewards in conduct in conjunction with the standard discovery nft rewards and because we are emphasizing modularity we're also using git book to create content like many other protocols so we've used a or we've created a plug and play github action that can be used in any repo getbook or code health of the repo will be uploaded to ipfs through web3.storage we then generate an nft that contains metadata such as the cids of the files of the repo the name of the authors the github id the github commit id etc we then upload that nft to nft.storage and create a ceramic document that creates that can that contains the cid returned by nft.storage all right we'll move on to the q a you have three minutes i really love the the concept of education here where people are sort of passed through these paths of education and learning and tooling um so really kudos to that and sort of the question and answering concept can kind of even like you can even possibly incorporate into some type of ai or something like that but i could be curious to know if um how you plan to incorporate new types of tooling into the pathways that uh you might be involved in uh could you specify what you mean by new types of tooling like for example ai or not well not necessarily ai but i guess um involving you know you mentioned like polygon learning these certain sort of almost like micro credentials and minted as nfts how easy it is for other people to incorporate that or add on other tooling sets in the decentralized ecosystem i see so like the the one that will pass the quest will receive an nft and he can use that nft anywhere um [Applause] so i guess i'm not sure if that answers your question you want me i think what he might be getting at and i could be wrong is so what we've got it set up as is if somebody wants to add on to the polygon quest they would go to the get book page and they would try to push uh this new uh you know let's say they wanted to add a couple new course little mini courses or many modules they would push that to git book they actually get an nft if it gets merged by the admin and there's something called only approver uh in the contract that would make sure only the approver's address would be allowed to minute but um once you push that on there then that will then become part of the polygon quest and and that will be part of the new nft and will actually keep track of that with the versioning within the nft i don't know if that answers maybe a little bit what you're getting at okay exactly i want to understand the flow i think it's really cool yeah yeah that's the flip yep so another great design another good looking front end can you guys give us a little bit of your stack in terms of building that that experience uh sure i go with the front-end and then jamie if you want to follow so we've used nexjs and um ceramic there's a ceramic instance running in the browser but we also have a ceramic instance running in server uh and those contain different data uh we're using idx on top of ceramic to index the data um we are the chain link using chain link to read ceramic data i've never heard of someone doing that that's so interesting like when i think of a quiz i think maybe they're going to do like some commit reveal on chain no you wrote it to some ceramic and then you used an oracle to make sure that it's in ceramic and correct it's good stuff so one other uh uh kind of uh kind of comment to make here is you want to think about when you're building a platform on ethereum you want to think about incentives and how to incentivize folks to create quizzes is that something that you guys are thinking about like i don't know there's a lot of different ways to incentivize something maybe i'll go ahead sure yeah for sure so like we're actually planning we are working with a couple of members from the token engineering academy as well to create like some kind of squads so which would be sub-dials inside of the the imagine to become a da so they would be sub those and we will create incentivization compatible programs to be able to keep the squads collaborate with each other and like also kind of create contents where the project owners or the subject matter experts can validate the content of the course and they will be prices you know from the coming pool as well one one little piece i dig into too is like quizzes are okay but if if you're already having this almost like results oracle kind of thing that happens like i imagine more of like a like a build challenge where it's like can you create this thing can you build this and we can give you nfts like going through a quiz is good but it's really just kind of like testing a thing like that going through the quiz isn't that fun of an experience but if you could make it something more uh you know really onboarding them and saying okay you got the tools up you got this thing built it's deployed here we can check that now you get this so so that's another like thing i'd love to see too is is more of a build challenge maybe kali you could also mention branchline decrypted courses yeah so we have branch paths that are focused for the end user and then we have decrypted paths that will be more focused on code challenges bounties etc and those would be like tutorial educational courses like tutorials made with the themes like course structures would be made with the project members and would be uh created the content would be created by the community and gets validated by the project team as well so it's like a decentralized own chain and the content would be decentralized as well good project let's onboard some people good job thank you thank you very much thank you guys thank you team discovery uh that was actually our last team of the session so i think we're pretty much done now so thank you judges uh thank you to all the participants in the hackathon this time around uh and if there's nothing further i think we can go ahead and end this seminar uh judges i think this will say receive an email from card tick too if you want to say something card tick i don't know if there's anything else we need to cover that this is great thank you to all the hackers who uh presented and uh i'll uh we'll follow up with all the teams on discord and then i'll follow up with all the judges uh over email so thanks again thank you guys thank you very much uh cameron if you can go ahead and end the meeting i think all right thank you i think you're the host oh me okay yeah okay i guess i'll just end the meeting okay have a good day
