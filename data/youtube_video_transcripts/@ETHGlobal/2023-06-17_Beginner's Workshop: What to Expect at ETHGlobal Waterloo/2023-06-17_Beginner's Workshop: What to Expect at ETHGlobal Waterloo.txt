foreign hey everybody how's it going I'm just let some people join nice okay yeah we'll just give it another minute as people are that's nice for all give another minute so people kind of start making their way in we're always called jokes he's got jokes I like that though nice Nicaragua okay Waterloo yeah Madison Toronto where's ajaxa I know where Kitchener is I'm assuming Ajax is in Canada thanks Kevin I've only been to Canada twice and both times in Montreal so this will be my first time uh fine in Toronto and then uh go into Waterloo late late in the evening but I'm looking forward to it awesome okay so we got a decent size here so yeah um I'll uh continue letting people in as people join um just an FY this is being recorded as well so we will uh stream it it's being streamed and we will share it with folks who aren't able to join so if you're part of a team maybe then they couldn't make it and they ask you to take notes or something then you know you don't have to worry about that because we will be sharing it on YouTube with you all as well this is the first so I guess we'll be back on Mia my name is Rory Arredondo I am the hacker success manager here at East Global and I've new to youth Global for the past three months basically and uh my one of my main tasks really is uh as the title says you know ensuring hackers are successful whether that's you know their you've learned something from an event or you found a job that you were looking for or that your project or received funding um or anything basically uh submitting a project pretty much it could it can run the the full gamut and you know we have these events and you know of course their prizes and uh you know there's our top 10 finalists that are selected but really it's just about you know how do we make sure that devs Builders are taking advantage of the full capabilities of the ethereum ecosystem and the protocol and how do we how do we continue onboarding folks from web 2 to web 3 how do we continue bringing anybody who isn't a Dev at all on into into this space and onboarding them and basically you know onboarding the next billion users for ethereum so it's kind of the main you know goals of Youth Global and our events in the hackathons um yeah like I said you know that the prizes and everything but really it's not just about that it's just you know what how can you stretch your get out of your comfort zone how can you you know expand your knowledge how can you test your abilities over the course of a 36 hour hackathon weekend which is you know can be quite quite intense so um I I I'm assuming most of you all are maybe brand new to Global hackathons or to our events um so welcome if this is your first time if not welcome again if you are a veteran and just curious about these you know would love to hear any comments or feedback that you might have to wisdom to to share for the new folks here um the main goal of this really is just to because we've since since being this role I've received a lot of feedback that hackers would love to um have some sort of Workshop or some sort of onboarding before an event happened just so they know what to bring uh what to expect um you know what the course of events are where certain pieces of information are um so I don't think maybe in the past we've done that good of a job of relaying this information so this is an opportunity for us to to do that for you all so if there if you do have any questions you know definitely feel free to um I'll I'll try and monitor the chat as best I can but if I'd say the best thing if you want to just take yourself off mute because we will be streaming this so actually that's I'll just do that yeah so because we're streaming this if you have a question just feel free to take yourself off mute that way I can you know we can hear you and I can just make sure that I understand the question correctly and then that the the people who will be watching this via stream can also you know understand and make sure they interpret they understand the question correctly as well because we won't be able to see the chat or the stream won't be able to see the chat so um so I think it'd just be easier for me to to verbally hear people ask questions so yeah and so I mean this feel free is I don't I don't want to talk for too long I definitely want to hear you know here what questions you have so I'll just go over a couple of things and then we can just continue you know uh open it up to q a so that's kind of the flow of things and I'll as I said I'll continue letting people in but um so yeah anyways welcome uh yeah youth Global Waterloo obviously starts next week um it's it's definitely coming up upon us and we wanted to get this get this out there before before then um one of the things that some people I think always get confused about is that you know we do have other events as well uh beforehand so if you weren't aware we have pragma Waterloo which is more like a conference uh uh just you know 9 A.M to like five or six p.m type an event we have invited guest speakers for this um it's this is a separate event though than the hackathon so I think some people times get confused by this so this is a separate ticketed event um if you're a hacker though or part of a a club like a nomad club or um I think it may be like some other clubs that are part of the the Waterloo ecosystem then you do get discounted tickets as well um so uh this is this is a great opportunity to talk will be one of the speakers here um but I just wanted to highlight that this is a separate event but this is on the Thursday so if you're in town if you plan to be in town early definitely worth checking uh this this out it's more of a conference like I said a couple of different speakers are are will be present and um it's it's uh just really great opportunity just to hear from these these top Minds within within the space no hacking involved but it's also a great way to potentially get project ideas if you're still unsure of exactly what you want to want to hack on uh for the weekend is the speaker's schedule going to be published I was considering attending but I'm only going to arrive about midday and I just wanted to see what what I'll be missing um yes I arrive late it should be Let's uh let's go in there real quick let's check it out so we do have the schedule yet but the speakers are here but yeah I'm not sure yet so the actual the the uh the actual schedule has not been released just yet but it would start generally in the past like for Tokyo and there's been the the the talks um we'll start yeah like around 10 30 and then kind of just go out throughout the day there is a lunch break um but then after lunch break from like maybe 1 or 1 30 Eastern Standard Time until four o'clock you'll have the rest of the speakers but yeah unfortunately it's not uh it has been released yet and so some people what they tend to do if you wanted to go to also Cafe as well as pragma because Cafe is the other event that I will go over in a bit um you know some people will attend pragma and then head over to Cafe once once the Prague mode is finished or once they've you know listened to the speakers that they've wanted to listen to um the schedule should be released fairly soon though um I would keep an eye on your emails and the Discord uh for that though okay great and um uh if we don't buy our tickets right away like we'll tickets still be available up until the event starts or or is there a cut off yeah we um there there isn't a right now we don't have a hard cut off just yet I think ideally the sooner the better um but what we can do if you if you're unsure we can issue refunds as well so um if you do get a ticket then maybe I don't know there's a flight issue or a travel issue or something goes on you can't check in or make it then just let us know send an email to hello edithglobal.com and we will um we will take care of that or issue a refund for you not saying that I'll type the email in the chat as well so hello google.com yeah the schedule should be released fairly soon though so but yeah definitely keep an eye on like your email and your Discord um and yeah the other event on Thursday is the co-working cafe so this is only for admitted hackers uh confirmed admitted hackers to Waterloo so it's not open to the public uh this is just a space for you all to come gather chill beforehand uh some people they can't check into their airbnbs or their hotels just yet so this is a space where people can come you know for the Thursday and just hang out you know grab a cup of coffee grab some food uh what we've noticed in the past for other events is that people just to kind of start meeting each other and networking sharing uh ideas project ideas having a team formation uh within that so and even at Discord like if people want to meet up beforehand like this is the perfect place for for hackers to do so we we thought this would be a great idea an opportunity to give hackers the ability to kind of meet each other before before the hackathon begins and then we started having team formation sessions at the cafes as well so um for those that maybe if you're still you don't have a team yet or you're looking for people to join your team um this is the first opportunity for for hackers to sort of get together share their ideas say what they're looking for say say maybe you're a team of three and you're looking for a designer or a front-end Dev or something this is a perfect place to begin doing that if you haven't done so already we understand that you know the the discord's been open for a while to find a team channel has been there but uh maybe people drop out last minute or your teammate can't make it at the last minute so you need to find some Bales to replace them so this is definitely a great way to to do that so if you're chatting with something on the Discord right now and you want to meet in person beforehand definitely invite them over to the cafe um and again this is this is free you know to and only for admitted hackers confirmed hackers so um you won't it's uh you won't there won't be other people there pretty much so if you are trying to invite people who aren't confirmed or maybe yet tell them to sign up submit an application for water if Global Waterloo applications for the hackathon close I believe this Monday I don't know exactly what time yet but um yeah if you're if you still know people that you're trying to bring on board definitely you know invite them as soon as possible before before Monday at least um so that's uh this is at yeah byte75 um which yeah it's a yeah I haven't been there yet but looking forward to checking it out okay so that was yeah that was one thing um kind of just to piggyback off of that so that was one information session we do have another one that's Friday um Friday evening that I'll kind of continue to go over later but um one thing to to kind of uh reiterate and emphasize on the uh the team formation and making sure that your team members are accepted staked and confirmed uh this is the uh the the hacker dashboard so um remember the Stars give me the overview this will this will be your your dashboard but you know we're kind of where everything or everything you'll see is sometimes if you have people that maybe you've invited already and you'll see their names here but you need to make sure that you know that they're that they are that they've been accepted that they're staked and confirmed sometimes people forget that oh actually I haven't staked yet or haven't confirmed yet and they haven't told the other team members so make sure that you are communicating with any potential team members or people that you want to hack with that they need to uh submit their application if they haven't already they need to stake their eighth to be confirmed and once they do that then of course you know they can hack they can hack with you but we definitely only only confirmed hackers who have staked will will be uh will basically be allowed entry into the venue so they'll be the one they'll only be given wristbands if they're stacked and confirmed and they'll only be able to receive prizes if you win prizes if you've been a confirmed your State and State hacker so that's just we've had a few people that are new to the events that that kind of run into these issues so just make sure that you know your your teammates and potential teammates have have done that okay so one other thing uh is uh people ask about is a project ideas so let me just move this over um we have if you haven't seen this already yet we have the the partners uh area so this is I mean this all the partners for free Global Waterloo um and they're hyperlink so you can click on their you know their go to the websites as well um but if you if you go a little bit further we do have the prices so this this uh will if you're if you're unsure what you want to build on or what or or what you what ideas you have this is the prices area is certainly a great area to sort of kind of help you generate something uh generate some ideas so a lot of these different the partners they do list out they have workshops that are they're coming up they provide resources um for for for how to use build on top of their stack how to build on top of their protocols and then a lot of them will also provide you know ideas for what what they would want to see built on top of their on top of their stack as well so if you're if you're having issues or not really sure what what to what to build on or what to you know what what to do definitely also you know check check make sure that you check this out um it's definitely it's a lot of information for sure um and you're that you're certainly not limited to one particular partner that you have to build on teams are able to select multiple partners and multiple Stacks to build on top of it's up to the partners to decide what you know how they will how they will award the prizes youth Global doesn't doesn't have any say in that each Global we have our own specific prizes which would be like the the top 10 finalists that were present at the closing ceremony but uh the partners will decide themselves um how how they award their prizes so but you're certainly by no means limited to which which um which Partners or Stacks that you can build on top of um but yeah that's just something that that they determined that they decide on their on their own people more people than and then the other thing is we have uh the different a lot of different workshops so if I go to the um if I go to the schedule uh page here if it goes So currently um you know we have this is what's going on now uh but then next week week two we have uh uh upcoming oh so here we go the deadline supplies Monday June 19th at 11 59 uh PM Eastern Standard Time so this this should automatically change to your time zone if you ever are unsure if like the the time someone something like a deadline or a submission project submission deadline or deadline to apply you know make sure that it should be on your own time zone but if you ever have issues with times that's that would be a way to clarify that um and uh so this again kind of just going over what I talked about with Cafe and pragma but then Friday Friday we have a lot of different workshops before hacking begins so these are certainly the great opportunities for you all again if you still are unsure what ideas to build on um or just kind of having having some uh blockers when it comes to that these are also here to kind of give you some other an opportunity to maybe hear something from a speaker that you could potentially build on top of as well um so a lot of these are taking place you know right after registration opens at one and then at 2 30 you know boom we have the first workshop and we'll have about three different Workshop rooms so some of them are due coincide at the same time so that's something to also keep in mind but you know I would say right now take advantage list out exactly which ones which workshops you want to attend uh plan that out for yourself and then and then attend them and so again yeah we have you know a hacking doesn't begin until later in in the evening once once this is all over so you won't have to worry about missing like any any part of hacking um but this is also just I mean I highlight this because this is a great opportunity I think for hackers to take advantage of to listen to The Divided speaker and to again just kind of hear what they have to say and you know potentially you know you might come across an idea during one of these workshops and the other thing is we do have we do have mentors as well so a lot of people sometimes uh don't seem to note know that this is here but the tech mentors these are also uh folks who have been uh screened they had to submit an application and screened and then uh we we invited them so we're basically looking at folks who have you know who contribute in public build in public so that GitHub is just stacked with tons of commits and repos and different projects and everything but they have a variety of skills as well and so they're here to basically help the hackers you know throughout the weekend um a lot of the so we have you know their names what uh organization they're with unless they're independent all the skills that that they bring to the table and then their Discord and their Twitter so you can reach out to them this is provided so for for your benefit I mean the mentors are here to help answer any questions you might have help you know tackle anyone lockers that you're facing with your project they will be at the at the Waterloo at the main hacking space of the all weekend there's a mentor booth there that will be set up where all the partner booths will be at in the main hacking area the main hacking Hall so um that will be that will be a place for you to you know to go reach out to them if they're if there's somebody that you see here that you that you like or that you you think would be really helpful for for your projects you're working on and they're not there definitely reach out to them via Discord or Twitter and some of these so they're I need to follow up with them because they're not everybody has uh has filled out their their Discord or their Twitter just yet but um that's that's the idea and in the future we will have a an opportunity for for people to actually book uh meetings uh accountably links so that way you can just it's I think it's easier for for folks to do that via VIA account only instead of just maybe having to go back and forth in Twitter or Discord um but but yes they are let me ask the question okay yeah okay thank you Marina I will I will take a look into that and see why it's not opening up for you um but yes so I mean this is they will one one way to identify who these are in real life is that they'll be wearing like a yellow construction vest so they'll be very bright and stand out so they'll be at the mentor Booth but they'll also be walking around they're told to walk around as well just to make if people if you're a hacker and you're working with your team and maybe not all the team members want to go up to the table that you know they will be able to walk around and come to you as well so they'll be wearing these bright yellow construction vests that um that that would be easy for you all to identify uh will there be sleeping bags and overnight provided like ethrono did there will be a decompression a chill room space one of the workshop rooms will be turned into a a chill room decompression room so but it's limited so it's first come first serve and they're only going to be around maybe 30 20 to 30 like blow up inflatable mattresses and pillows so it's very it's not you know five-star accommodations by any means and there are no shower facilities either so um it's you know kind of sleep at your own will if but also if you get there first you know first come first serve but the one the workshop room will be turned into that until later in the evening Friday evening after all the workshops are done and team formation is done as well um and the uh the in the exact address of the hackathon that will be so if you go up to the venue page well and so yeah that was basically all I had to say about the mentors as well but you know just a reminder that they are there um and actually real quick so uh let me see uh Aziz yeah Aziz if you go to the venue this is the uh the address for the the venue for the hackathon um it'll be on the venues side and then parking at the venue we're actually there is a parking update I want to say that the parking is free on the weekends but Friday there it will I think it will cost um some some amount of Canadian dollars I don't know exactly yet but um but yeah it will there will be uh some some charge on on the Friday but then there's also a lot of street parking as well if street parking is free from what I understand and then the uh the actual like designated school parking that will be that's what they charge but there should be a lot of street parking as well real quick to go back to the mentors um you know this there this currently this is the this is all the channels that you see on Discord eventually when our hack FS event wraps up to uh this weekend we'll add more of the the channels here so like the mentorship help Channel and then all the partner channels as well so to show you an example if this is your first time like this is currently what the hack FS our online event currently going on looks like so we have mentorship help project updates find a team a lot of the same stuff um but then there's also the partner channels that you'll see too and this is where you can also reach out directly to the partners if you have specific questions on a particular stack or protocol so like if whoever if ipfs is a part is a partner for Waterloo you can go to this partner Channel and ping them and ask for any help directly for the uh for if you have an IPS ipfs question or a push question um so this is just something that you won't see yet but eventually all this will populate within the next couple of days once everything is is uh is wrapped up with hack FS um sorry I'm going back to some questions now so yeah so Hector if you want I mean what people what I've noticed people do is also kind of message the the general chat so actually if I go back to the question was you know um just going to get an Airbnb then I guess uh if you go back to here like wireless chat I would message people you know hey you know gonna be hacking uh does anybody want to split an Airbnb or something and you'd be surprised at the amount of people that might respond to that so I would say go for go for a message to the the general chat here and just see see what see what um you know what people have to say maybe you might find some people that are interested in splitting something um but I would definitely take advantage of the the Discord and seeing reaching out to folks um and just kind of putting it out there blasting it see seeing see who seen who reacts because I think that I think people would definitely would be interested in that so yeah parking at the venue there will be uh yeah I think I covered that uh okay awesome thank you Marina that's awesome yeah you have to love be logged in awesome thank you Aaron for answering that street parking is free most people can park around the area just don't park in the church beside the building you will get ticketed towed so somebody's a somebody knows the ins and outs for a nuke the question for Max for a new coder should I prioritize workshops or join a team at the same time um I would I if you can I would say try and join a team now find a team now before you get there and then once you're there you know you're you feel more comfortable relaxed and then you can listen to the workshops but I think if you're a new coder um and you're deciding whether or not to uh to wait to find a team once you get there or now I would say try to try to find a team now go to go to the Discord channel here find a team submit a you know uh send a ping send a message we also have the the team formation slide so if you haven't seen this I mean people have been filling this out as well um it's I'll admit it's not the best way to do this right now um but it's it's currently like the the team formation's something we're still trying to build out and flesh out because it's it's um it's a tricky situation I think um so if you people haven't seen this yet I will send this in the chat hi yeah hello um I was just wondering um I'm not a coder and I'm just wondering if there if I got in over my head here because I'm not sure how to what I could do to contribute to a team yeah so there's a they're actually I think for because like technically I'm not I'm not a coder as well we have we do have designers we do have project managers um artists that that attend our events as well um they're and I think there are multiple ways uh depending on what your specific background is to to to contribute um one of those being like a lot of times the um you know teams I think they they sometimes can get bogged down into the details of of something and they just completely lose track of time or they they take on too much and then they just they realize they can't accomplish all that within the course of 36 hours over a weekend so I think having people that kind of can take a step back that can help the coders you know realize that this is actually going to be impossible we can't we can't accomplish all this you know at this time so um there are definitely there's definitely a need for for for people uh on teams to do that and so do you we have the the the team limit is five five people Max per team so you can't go over that so if you're you know if there's a one or two person three-person team you know having that extra two one or two people that may not have that coding background but can help really make that that project stand out and have that add that wow factor is certainly uh something that I would welcome if I was if I was uh you know participate as a hacker um so I think there definitely is a need for for folks who who are don't have that maybe that that deaf coding background um and it's just I think from from that perspective then it's just it's when they come down to you know how do you how do you stand out amongst everybody else how do you make yourself you know how do you sell yourself to two teams um or how do you you know really kind of show that what you know what how you can help what you can bring to the table what you can help the team out with um that I mean that's that'll be up it depends on the individuals themselves but I think that's um that's that's something that you you definitely still you have time to work on like you you have still have you know a week beforehand um which I think is more than more than enough time to kind of you know make sure that you you're able to to find a team um beforehand I don't know did that answer your question did that help clarify things uh yes it did thank you awesome cool cool I was just wondering also like what should we bring uh to the hackathon to help oh yeah yeah so um yeah I mean uh bring your bring your laptops um bring uh some people bring you know full-on monitors I would think but we keep in mind that you know we have us we do have um uh that we have more than enough like outlets for folks to plug in and everything but uh so people but people you know they need to charge their phones and other devices so the other the main thing for me is you know your laptop and your laptop basically as far as like other items like we we do in the evenings like towards the midnight to 8 A.M uh time frame overnight we do provide uh try to provide like toothbrushes and like deodorant and um uh items items for uh uh for for women um and but just keeping in mind that you know if you do plan to stay overnight people kind of stay overnight there are no shower facilities so uh it's yeah it's a if you're not planning to if you're planning to stay in the venue the entire time that um maybe a change of a nice change of clothes each day as well and a lot of deodorant um but I mean most people I think it's you know people do you know end up not staying there but um there are a few that do so I mean for people that do say they're you know toothbrush toothpaste some stuff like the toothbrushes we do try to provide uh try to provide deodorant um and like I said women's uh products so uh um but yeah I don't think you really need much like I mean I package just a few pairs of clothes I got my laptop but um yeah that's basically what I'm bringing and then keep in mind also that Partners they provide a lot of Swag items so they provide socks usually when we have a heath Global t-shirt that we provide um I'm not sure what the other swag items are to be honest and I I guess you know it's kind of the rest of it's probably a surprise anyways but um but there are some some items that you know Partners do do provide so I don't think you'd be short on shirts or anything if you if you decide not to bring shirts um I don't know is that do they answer your question were you looking for like something were you deciding whether or not you wanted to bring something else in particular or no I get that's yeah that pretty much I was thinking power bar laptop gotcha oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah I'd say yeah if you have maybe like a an extra you know any any sort of like extra extra stuff like that that might come in handy definitely bring it I just think as it just in case I think okay because there could be um there could be areas maybe where you find a really nice area that you want to work at but maybe it doesn't have enough or for you or your team so I would yeah maybe bring an extra power strip if you wanted to I mean there's stuff that certainly I think nothing's stopping you from doing that um but yeah okay thank you very much uh let me see there was a question about uh well the award ceremony on the last day be recorded yes so the the award ceremony will be recorded and streamed and then uploaded to YouTube same with the opening sermon as well and uh all the uh the workshops will also be uh recorded too so all anything like opening workshops closing all that good stuff will be uh recorded streamed and uploaded online uh it might not be right away but it eventually it will be will be uh uploaded and then um and then they're also even throughout the weekend we have a bunch of like a you know day recap videos and stuff that kind of just you know let people know like what's what's been happening what's been going on um yeah bring a power bar multi-outlet adapter how was the Wi-Fi in the event the Wi-Fi should be I think it should be pretty good this is at a university so if for anybody that's you know completely new or has attend a few of our events in the past sometimes we do come across some Wi-Fi issues because of the building infrastructure um and that that has caused some headaches for hackers they may have to go work out of their Airbnb or hotel or whatever or somewhere else um because this is at a university I think the infrastructure for the Wi-Fi is should be pretty top-notch and spot on um so yeah it is sometimes for events it just it varies because of the the venue um or the city in the country although we do work very very hard with our Wi-Fi partners and and team to make sure that it does you know it's it's functioning uh at a high level as close as possible we do ask that people do not use their their hot spots because that just bogs down the system even more so if there is a point where the Wi-Fi may be a bit a bit dodgy then don't use your dear hotspot just just wait until we we find report it to it on Discord or to the help desk at registration and then we'll we'll find a solution but the worst thing that you could do is use a hotspot if the Wi-Fi is having issues um and yeah Julio there was a yeah parking areas will be around uh there uh you probably can't see it but I will find the I will find Aaron's message and copy it into the chat yeah Wi-Fi or sorry parking parking is free from us people can park around the building just don't park in the church beside the building or you will get it towed um sorry okay uh there's a 24-hour store is around uh that's a good question uh is anybody from the area and are there 24-hour stores that are around there uh let's see the farmer's market if you get the chance great Crush like a doubt the presence of any 24-hour stores even Toronto doesn't have it okay open till late at night yes yeah yeah there's a pause it with some 24-hour convenience stores but yeah there will be I mean if you're worried about like food or snacks or anything well food dinner starts on Friday evening so at from Friday evening until Sunday lunch there will be food and meals provided for for you throughout the weekend there will also be a lot of snacks teas coffees drinks Waters whatever um that'll all be provided um and then the uh on the event starts on Friday at uh one one PM is when it opens so if you go to the schedule on the website and then Friday yeah oh the venue will open at 1pm but then yeah dinner so lunch won't be provided here food the snacks will probably still be catering might still be setting up all this stuff uh it should be set up already but if not dinner is definitely will be at 6 PM I've been opening ceremonies at 8pm yeah yeah of course yeah this will be on your uh if you have to go to your hacker dashboard um it'll be there this is that's the schedule link but that this is I mean what I'm sharing here this is kind of like Mecca anything and everything you can find we'll we'll be around here um so yeah I kind of I did kind of go off a little track but one thing I did want to mention as well um and so you know after the workshops on Friday then there's the opening ceremonies there's the second team formation brainstorming session so this kind of piggybacks off of what happened at Cafe the day before the the first team formation brainstorming session um and then the late night snack so each Friday night and Saturday night there'll be late night snacks as well I don't know what these are yet but I think it's also meant to be a surprise too um yeah the uh I mean yeah so Hector do we need to show a QR code ticket or will it might be found by yourself as well yeah so you'll just check in um you just provide your name and ID and then yeah we'll just we'll just or email and we'll just yeah that's how we'll be able to check you in so they're they're actually there will be a QR code that you can scan as well but that particular will be sent out uh this coming week I think yeah this week um and so yeah the other thing is uh on Saturday we have the project feedback session so this is an opportunity for teams to check in with the mentors uh or their partners and just let them know that you know what the what the state is up there of their project is how it's going so you'll see um on your dashboard a place where you can do that where you can check in um and actually so if I go to Project actually want to be a project at a dashboard I don't know so we don't have that oh never mind so yeah you won't see that just sorry no this is mostly for online events so then uh there you won't physically do anything on the site but you can this is an opportunity just for you to go out and get real life feedback um it's it's a designated time just because you know a lot of people will be around and people are aware of it the partners and mentors so you know if you're having bloggers facing any issues with your with your project or anything it's um it's this is the this is the perfect time to just you know find the answer the solution whether that's by the mentor boost station where the the main hacking spaces and the partners are or whether that's in the um in the partner channels um on Discord that you can you know individually message just a reminder for people that just join the partner channel is for Waterloo aren't available yet they will be uh in the next couple of days when we wrap up a different event um and then the last thing so uh oh and I forgot to mention there's a fun activity on Saturday as well so nothing's nothing scheduled for Saturday so you go all basically and focus on hacking the uh the only thing is um that we do have it's like a fun activity which is also a surprise but um it's just a way for you people to decompress take a little break and kind of unwind uh from a from a from you know hacking pretty much and then the last thing I want to mention is uh judging so project submissions are due 9 A.M and so the we always kind of run into issues where people end up submitting at the very last minute we highly highly highly encourage you all not to do that uh please take advantage of submitting your project at least an hour or two hours before the submission is due and we say this because as people do it a lot of people do at the same time then there might be some issues with you know the video upload or the project not being submitted properly and since these are issues that we have to troubleshoot later on and just it stresses people out uh that not not us but like it stresses you all out so we want to make sure that you're not stressed out so if you you know we definitely encourage you all to submit your projects well before 9 A.M uh Sunday morning that way it's just a lot easier and uh easier for you all whenever judging begins at 9 30. so yeah so 9 30 we have the the judging and this will be uh you know 10 to 12 different rooms there'll be two judges per room uh and two volunteers that will be there to help you you know guide you and so but before that you you check in with a green room so like The Green Room is sort of the way way where you can you know make sure that your team is there that uh that you're checked in that you're given a car that you know what what the expectations are of everything and um and then yeah then you're assigned to a to a room and you present to the two judges and once you've done that then you can go downstairs and or go wherever wherever the partner tables are and present to the partners so the final is Project judging this is for each Global finalists the top 10 finalists this is live judging um you know you with two judges and then the partner judging if you apply for specific partner prizes um that will be you know that's done asynchronously so within within the partners so if there's a if you go to the partners um link here whatever loads if you're applying for like Uma one of uma's prizes um or or hyperlane then this is that's when on Sunday morning after you do the top the the finalist judging this is where you go to the partner Bruce and talk to them share their ideas as well uh yeah teams can qualify for multiple prizes yeah yeah for sure the format um it's uh some people it's mostly a demo so like if you go to let me go back if you go to the info center and rules project submission and judging this uh Seattle this is a great resource if you haven't seen this yet the rules product submission and judging uh uh side has all basically everything I'm saying but it's just in much greater detail so it talks about the demo video that that's optional but encouraged um and you know what what you what you can use in terms of like open source libraries boilerplates how to submit your projects the difference between the finalists and partner prices or if you just want to do partner prizes only um you know if for the judging session do you have seven minutes total you have four minutes to demonstrate and then three minutes of q a with the judges um and then like what the judges are are grading on as well the five different categories and what they're looking for for the for um for the finalists judging and in partner judging again so the partners they're they're very each partner is specific they're looking for something specific for each of their you know particular stacks and protocols so um we don't that that's decided amongst amongst the partners we don't have any sway over over any of that information um but yeah then we also have like good tips and how to present um and you know common mistakes to avoid and so we're saying the demo video because if you go back oh sorry before I do that here's like some common example examples of good projects as well so um this I'll send this link in the chat and if I go back so like the reason with the videos another reason is if you go if you go to the Showcase page once the event's done all of uh your your information your project information will basically be uploaded here so if you go back here you'll see a bunch of all of our different past events so um like the last you know youth Global Tokyo these are you know these are the projects that that were that were submitted there and just an FYI something that we're working on is the filter so right now you can only filter by the by the the event eventually you'll be able to filter by you know the partners the prices one um and just it gets it would have a lot more functionality to make it easier to find find you know teams projects that did really well so like you know if I go with Blockhead he took it 2023 this has three different logos associated with it so if I click on that I'll see that in East Global Tokyo you know they want the scroll just deploy Quant stamp best use case polygon Pool price um and uh and so yeah once whenever you submitted like your project you'll have you'll have this is where your description is how it's made um this is your source code the live demo uh as well um and just a couple of like screenshots for for what what your project looks like so yeah if you do make a video then like this is where that video would be would live as well um so yeah that's kind of that's why like like once every whenever you're done this is like kind of the the uh the final what what happens and so this is sort of give me the access here if you're looking for a job or Project funding like this is where you would send potential you know uh VCS accelerator Grant programs uh employers like this is what I built you know I was I participated at the global uh Waterloo and this is a project that we submitted that we created over the course of 36 hours uh for test net faucets yeah uh so for those uh I would those you'd probably have to ask the the partners themselves so the question was what about testing at fossils during the hackathon um these are so whenever we add the partner Discord uh uh channels uh those are questions you can ask the specific partners and they'll be able to help you out as well um and if and if you want to ask them in person at the actual you know at their Booth that's totally fine too but they will be able to provide you with uh with faucets uh for for your for your project um and yeah sorry Joseph I just saw your missed question will you share each team's presentation videos to everyone who wins the prizes so change teams yeah so I mean on the Showcase page that's kind of where everything will live um if if your selected as a top 10 finalist then you're presenting at the closing ceremony uh on Sunday so we won't but that won't you won't be sharing a video you'll be actually doing a live demo during closing ceremony if you are if your project is selected as a top 10 finalist so if I go back yeah so we do promise projecting lunch sponsor will be notified around 2PM and then closing ceremonies so this is where you know we'll uh we're the top 10 finalists will will do the live demo um but so we're not we're not sharing uh I guess any videos uh basically but uh but you're if you do make a video a demo video then it will be uploaded to your the Showcase page um and yeah if people haven't like if you haven't seen if this is your completely first first um uh a global event like to give you an idea of the closing ceremony uh is this one I want no I'll just clicking it like this is this is exactly what you what would happen so this is an example of minor browser wallet this is a team that was a top 10 finalist and then they're presented in a live demo so um this is during the closing ceremony so that's only the top 10 finalists will be the ones who who would uh you know present live during the closing ceremony but they're not playing a video or anything they're just we uh everything is done is done live so that's just something to keep in mind um we don't have is there an estimate the question was is there an estimate of how many teams there will be not at the moment so um it's hard to say it's still kind of early we'll probably still get a lot of Outlet applications estimated over the weekend um but uh yeah I would say definitely probably over definitely over a hundred uh how many hackers will there be in all um again a good question I would say probably um uh you know maybe like uh seven or eight hundred uh but it's hard to say I mean usually what happens is as as the application deadline draws near or near more and more people start filling in their application so we're looking to maybe maybe uh seven or eight hundred or so but um it's it's hard to hard to tell um well no it's oh no it's Toronto sorry I thought it was city of Tokyo um if the project wins prices does each Global do VC protocol introductions so this is something we are working on so whenever you do submit your project um if you go to the project so project uh up here this is a lot because I need to create something all right well this is just a dummy but yeah I'll just pick a few things here if you go to Future opportunities there is an area where we ask you know if you if you'd like to be in touch with um you know in Grant programs accelerator programs so this is something that we are working on right now the main the main focus of the hackathon is you know the hackathon itself making sure that you're building a project that you're you're learning you're growing that you're just kind of expanding your network when it comes to the partners the mentors other hackers and then post event this is where this would come into play so it's something that's still kind of early days and we're still trying to flesh out the best way to do it but eventually we'll have to get to the point where yes if you would like to continue working on your project then we would love to certainly you know uh make sure that that does happen whether that's putting you in contact with an incubator an accelerator or a VC or even a partner maybe if you worked with a partner really closely during the event and they really liked your project and what you were working on sometimes you know Partners bring on teams to help them build out continue building out their their um their stack their protocol so anything can happen basically but yes the idea is that um you know anybody that wants to continue working on it we definitely want to encourage that uh post event so that's something that you would you would indicate in the uh whenever you're filling out your your project oh wow I didn't realize okay so it's like 10 52. I was talking a lot um is there I guess what I want to ask you know are there does anybody have any other questions did somebody I mean feel free to take yourself off mute I didn't think I'd talk the whole time but I guess I did so uh but I was also answering questions but I would love to hear you know any other questions to your comments people have before we wrap up the hour in the next seven minutes um is anyone else planning a trip to Niagara Falls good question Max uh if uh and if nobody answers that here I would definitely ask that in the um in the Waterloo chat because I'm sure people are probably going to plan you know side events and stuff um as well yeah Abdullah you have a question yeah yeah I can hear you because I live in Toronto sorry Ontario and um my like the time zone I'm in EST so right now it's 11 53 so you said on your side that it's 11 A.M that it starts so from in Canada will it start at 10 A.M or 11 A.M I said that it started uh that started at 11. that's what uh that's what you said 11. what was I talking about do you remember the starting the starting ceremony like the beginning right oh yes yes so sorry if you go to the schedule like so the time zone is America New York so it'll be like uh this opening I mean well the opening ceremony is APM but that that'll be uh that'll be uh Eastern Standard Time so like I'm actually because I'm based in I'm out technically I'm based in Texas so um it's actually you know seven for me is Central Time but yeah everything whenever you're uh in wherever your app is like this this will automatically update but you do have the ability to change it if you happen to be in a different area and you're just maybe you're working with teams that are in a different uh or people that are in a different different time zone than you that's kind of why this this functionality exists to kind of give you the opportunity to change it a bit but but yeah okay so like the beginning with the registration everything that starts at 11 em and EST correct oh the registration so no uh no registration opens at 1pm uh Eastern Time so what time do we have to be there at Waterloo exactly well so the venue won't open until 1pm so you I technically don't have to be there until uh for the hackathon until 1pm on Friday if you wanted to attend pragma or Cafe on Thursday you can attend those events um but as far as like the main hackathon venue that will not open until Friday at 1pm Eastern Time okay thank you very much yeah if yeah yeah if you have any questions like definitely check out the schedule and also um like when I was saying about Waterland pragma like or pragma and Cafe like those are two separate events like pragma is a more of a conference event separate ticket uh hackers you know get get get a discount as well um and then Cafe is just for a place for hackers to come and chill meet each other uh beforehand um so it's just a way to if teams are forming on Discord before hey let's meet at Cafe Waterloo perfect venue for people to kind of get together share ideas meet each other you know figure out maybe if they want to be team members or not um but yeah so technically you don't but you don't have to be there at these events you don't have to go um because the the venue for Waterloo the hackathon itself will not open until Friday um Friday afternoon yes there is a uh let me make sure I haven't missed any messages required uh the entire thing is nice yeah so yeah well yeah I mean everything will be in Eastern Time um yeah you won't see the future opportunities uh uh until it's probably because we haven't opened up that UI yet so um it's I think for me it's a bit different because I'm with the team but uh whenever you it's time for you to submit your project that's when you'll see that that future opportunities uh section uh shout out Texas thank you Ryan uh the only place to find side events is by the wireless giant Discord actually so there is give me a second yeah I mean that would be the only the only area there is a um uh let me see if I can find it well give me okay let me just send the water to the pragma registration link to Max but the only fight there will be um there is sort of like a city guide that we have that I meant to meant to um have ready for you all but Max there you go that's the uh the registration for pragma um and then yeah let me see if I can find that city guide one second I know where it is and because we're ex there's a few people that have sent proposals for it as well um but it's still kind of like a work in progress so that's the city guide and actually I'll open it up here too so this kind of gives people um you know if you're traveling this has you know time zone currency water safe to drink type of thing a little bit of history with Waterloo I mean that these are some of the water Waterloo alums that that are pretty big in the ethereum space um and then you know it's just uh how to get here if you're traveling uh this is if anywhere it's going to be this is uh you know map to explore City these are the chips for traveling to Waterloo and the venue so if you're coming from Toronto uh from Waterloo airport if you're traveling via by a car on the highway um okay and uh and yeah and some other some other here's some side events as well so if you can scroll at the very bottom you'll see all the side events so um but yeah that's uh basically it um cool cool so yeah that's that's basically it um we've got to um yeah I I should be up there John let me uh find it again um here it might not uh have the um that's that's the link but it might you might need to play with the HTTP in the front but that's that's basically the link though um cool well thanks everybody for joining hopefully this was uh insightful and useful and again this will be on YouTube later and uh yeah just you know stay in touch on Discord with each other we'll have more information on here every anything you could possibly ever need is on the um the the the website this you know these global.com events 2020 what are the 2023 website so uh yeah I hope you found this useful and we will see you all next week so cheers
