but it's going cool I see the little streaming service thing that's good son that is a good sign oh great you can just copy the view link right from the header so good I think we should be good looks like we've got one person stuck in the waiting room or maybe they've been stuck there for a minute but you know I'm good to go where we get drunk yes okay get ready oh I guess I'll get started then sweet all right well thank you everybody for coming out no matter what time it is and you're in your world so we appreciate you guys coming to the am a chat with Robert from compound so thanks so much for being here Robert especially at 9:00 in the morning PST yeah well excited from hearing thanks for everybody who's joining from around the world you know a theory I'm in hacking is a global phenomena so it's great to get everyone in one virtual chat together awesome cool yeah so just for everybody just for context my house is gonna run we have some questions that we go ahead of time for people who either didn't want a brave 9 a.m. or it couldn't make it due to the time zone thing so les is first and it'll open up to the crowd so you know if you're joining us live here on zoom' there's a raised hand functionality on the participant tab so once it comes to that part that part of the program feel free to raise your hand and then you can just ask you a question directory / zoom so yeah so that being said you know what get started and I think Robert a good place to start is maybe just to get a sense of kind of what what led you to to building compound and you know what what was sort of like your background ahead of time and and what got you excited about building a lending platform on monolith area yeah great question a great place to start so when we started compound in 2017 there wasn't the term defy yet it was one of the earlier phases of etherium and you know a lot of the activity at the time was focused on just creating tokens there's a lot of paisios but there was not too many people you know really using the powers of the ethereum blockchain to build you know what we thought at the time would be radical financial applications and when we looked around one of the observations that we had was that there was a lot of focus on trading which is coming up with the price of an asset right now and very little work was being done on creating interest rates or the time value of assets what's the price in the future relative to the price today and for us this was you know an important gap in what we saw is what would develop to be the market um you know there was some early work being done by maker Dow but you know the landscape is pretty empty and so we set out to create an interest rate protocol that would allow people to either earn an interest rate over time or borrow an asset at whatever the prevailing interest rate is and you know it's been a couple years in the making but you know we're pretty excited to see compound now become you know a relatively stable platform other developers can build on you know similar to the way that we've built on atheria and we're at the point now where everything we're doing is designed to ensure that compound is as phenomenal of a platform the build on as possible and all the steps we're taking today such as you know distributing governance and control out to the community is really designed to make it where people feel confident that they know how compound works and that they have a shape in the future of the platform awesome cool yeah maybe dive a little bit into compound I mean I mean compound like you said you know you've been around a couple years now and are one of you know really one of the one of the best platforms in the space around this and and maybe I guess you could touch on what do you think were some of the decisions that you made early on that led to you guys being able to have such success in the space and and overall like what sort of was the mantra that you guys exposed in in building the platform that ultimately led to its success that's a great question so there was a few things that were the design decisions early on that I think have stayed relatively firm for years now so the first was and you have to rewind a little bit to understand like what products existed nothing really existed you know we had a core philosophy that a pooled approach to liquidity would be more effective than an order book based system for matching interest and that was a very important design decision early on that no one had really approached yet you know I you know swab didn't exist yet like like this concept of a pool was basically non-existent and so that was a pretty radical design decision that we had our first white paper he in fact the white paper that still exists for compound if you go all the way back it says you know we believe that what our books don't work and that you need a pool for certain types of mental products as a large decision point so that was one and that was you know pretty radical at the time the second is that you know rather than users being able to specify I you know their own parameters similar to trading we said let's remove all of that like let's rip everything we can out let's just have an algorithm determine the interest rate that people interact that instead of you know Trent and saying I want you know four percent and Emily saying I want six percent you know and maybe they match maybe not always matching off everybody and just having an algorithm decide you know what's a market clearing rate I mean that was a pretty radical design decision as well and the third decision we made extremely early on was and this is like I tried to espouse for other people building the space is that we wanted to focus on security over speed this has been one of the central pillars of like what makes compound compound since day one and that was we wanted to go a little bit overboard and extreme and sort of the balancing act between moving quickly and building and shipping and growing and doing so in a secure way and so we've always prioritized security over speed and this led to us you know in the span of two and a half years having two versions of our product released to the world which when you compare that to a traditional software is hilariously slow even though our team is like you know extremely fast extremely hard-working extremely qualified and so that was the sort of third you know key decision that we made and I think all of that is translated into a relatively simple product that's stable death predictable and is safe and you know from there you know everyone else has the opportunity to sort of extend it to experiment with it to change it to modify its upgraded to build new things on top that you know for us we just didn't want to include in the base protocol the base of compounds very simple and we did that by removing everything we possibly could it feels like um you know certainly like as a user of compound it feels very purposeful when you guys make decisions and and as you've grown and that everything kind of seems like oh and it's time in place right and I think you know as a user who you know uses isn't it stores money and my assets and that you know it that's kind of something I'm looking for right I'm not looking for somebody who's trying to break things looking for somebody who's looking to do things and be good stewards sorry so maybe leading up to you know a larger announcement that you guys made recently and of course is alive and have actually in the last couple days actually I had an impact on the product you know governance on on compound you know you put out a blog post photo I think a couple months ago the first couple proposals went through I think in the last couple days maybe you can talk about sort of the high level larger scope decisions right what led you guys to to build this governance type protocol was this always the decision you wanted to make and and just kind of walk through a little bit about it just let everybody on the call gets a sense as well it's a great question so there was really two things we wanted to achieve with compound governance the first was you know removing our centralized ability to accidentally or deliberately break compound you know there's this concept of evolving decentralization that we've always sort of thought about and have been talking about since version 1 of combat saying one day our team is not going to be able to break it even if we want no matter what and with compound governance in a lot of ways you know right away we've already achieved that there's no one admin key there's essentially you know there's 10,000 million compound governance tokens it's almost like we've broken an admin key in to 10 million cases right and it creates a predictability and a security that doesn't exist without it's now very hard compared to what a couple months ago look like to make changes to the protocol it's much harder just even if everyone agrees on a change to make a change um so that's the first design decision and the second design decision is we wanted there to be community upgrade ability so up until now our team has been the only one that's been able to make upgrades to the protocol you know we've been required to write the code we've been required to deploy the smart contracts to merge them in it's fallen on our shoulders the second goal of this has been you know we want the community great developers other teams applications on compounds to be able to actually make changes to the underlying protocol and if enough of the community agrees for them to go through and I actually think that over time this is the most powerful thing that we're doing because it takes compound from being something that's in effect limited by the resources of one team and it opens it up to you know the 10 million developers out there that could upgrade compound or could make a change you know if you're building an application on top of compound there's something that the protocol can do differently to facilitate your app you're starting to have the ability to actually suggest and make changes directly to the compound protocol it's not designed to be fast it's not designed to be easy but it's designed to be available on that if the community needs to make something change you know maintain it or upgrade it that's available and so I think this is gonna lead to actually over time the fastest growth in the ecosystem because it's gonna enable there to be instead of a team of you know eight engineers a team with 8,000 engineers working on if they choose great that and I think that's very cool as well right and I think you touched on it in the announcement is that you know the proposals are not proposals for what the compound team should build the proposals are executable code right and I think you know that also adds I think a very interesting level of things that's you know if everybody can come in in access and upgrade the contracts maybe I security like are there any kind of guidelines or like rails for people to write on top of or you know like what what do you guys do to prevent somebody from otherwise sneaking in maybe a malicious code segment or something in their compound upgrade right like how do you guys feel about that yeah that's a great question so right now we're in the very preliminary testing phases of just testing out the governance mechanisms and systems entirely well you know the first two proposals one was written by the compound team in conjunction with third-party auditors you know we went to a very slow and deliberate and long development process you know months of work for you know releasing one new support asset using all the same methodologies that our team has always relied on the second change was something proposed by the community it was only a one-line change but it was created by the community by an application built on top of compound to modify the interest rate model for an asset with a slightly different um it was straightforward because it was only a one line change and our team also was able to review it and I'm sure that they loose nothing but let's just slipped in but over time this process is gonna go entirely into the hands of the community and so we're gonna be releasing additional information over the next couple weeks as the compound governance system develops a little bit on how to participate how to write safe code how to work with it but over time what we envision is that the community is gonna take over you know in a lot of ways you know the code repo where that's gonna be a base to merge in code to make sure all the test cases run to allow the community to interact more of a traditional open-source way but a repo still is not local unchain right it's still not what's actually running in this sort of deployed protocol unchain right and so from there you know we're really gonna you know recommend and expect and help develop the standards that you know for small changes that are significantly period of you by the community by developers that know the protocol and for larger changes that they're reviewed by outside auditors and you know I hope and expect that over time there's gonna be more community audit funds and audit pools and things that actually can step in and provide that service not just a compound but to define general and I'm personally extremely passionate about having more of a sort of public good of auditing emerged over time and you know larger changes go to an audit and from there you know I hope that you know the compound governance process is conservative is that it says we demand that something is safe we demand that you prove it's safe and that it moves slowly I know how personally you know vote for security always I think there's probably gonna be people in the community they're able to vote that are very focused on security and it's gonna be you know and a very large and public experiment and I can't tell you exactly how it's gonna unfold but I know that I'm I'm very excited about security yeah I think it's very interesting like you know these audit pools and like all these different types of standards and like you know you could see that you know somebody could build an app or something that's like oh you want to add this specific token to compound just this button and state your rep right so you know I think there's like a lot of very interesting ideas that could be built on top of comp and and the governance protocol in general maybe I don't know if you could talk about this part yet but certainly a question we got was you know how do I get calm right like what is the distribution model gonna look like I just was just curious in general so we haven't announced the exact details of this yet but at a very high level every user of the protocol is going to wind up having a role in come oncome so every single user of compound is going to be receiving comp tokens we're ensuring that you know the majority of comm tokens are going to the users of the protocol and over time you know the community is expected to sort of take the reins and run with this so stay tuned or next couple weeks we'll probably be releasing more details along with the code for how we plan to distribute the token for community review but the basic premise is that it's going to be distributed to the users awesome cool and I think just for the people that are hacking if you do want to build on top of comp for the hackathon I think you can just get some bobstine conch by asking and Channel right yeah you know Adam on our team built a comp token faucet for the rock stand test net in our discourse if you go to our discord in the governance channel and you type the phrase please give me calm and then your address it sends you drops then calm you can use that to just you know build anything or hack anything you want cool sweet I only have a couple of other quick questions and then we'll turn it over to the rest of the crowd who they've been dropping a lot of questions in chat already so it seems like they're they're out up and excited so maybe switching a little bit off of calm you know the feature of eath moving towards like 2.0 in a staking validator world and you know being able to to earn an income by by being a node validator you know in that sort of context do we have the same like this compound change at all in that context does compound keep up with that you know as people find different ways of being able to extract value from holding on to huh sets how does compound adapt and what are your thoughts around that in general yeah that's a very question so you know I think what's gonna happen at the economics of the forget change and I think it's not actually gonna be quite exciting because you know for the first time you know ether itself is really gonna have about you know right now defy it set up in such a way that you know in general ether there's no time value to it the interest rates and we clear across the board with zero and it winds up being collateral because of it right it has value based on expectations in the future but you know the size processing transactions there's not much to do besides holding unique in 2.0 you're actually gonna see this flip and it's gonna change significant and suddenly all the ether is gonna flow to those who are participating in validating the network it's gonna be extremely useful and ethers gonna have a more meaningful return to it and I think there's gonna be a lot more trade-offs an opportunity cost and so I think the very nature of ether is gonna change economically which is good it's great I think it's gonna pose both massive opportunities and challenges to defy I think you know because ether itself is gonna have an opportunity cost and I think in terms of like how applications get built it's still a little bit too early to tell I think over the next like six to twelve months that picture of how is you know solidity and f1 and that too gonna interact and how's the EVM gonna evolve and all these things are gonna be much more crystallized for the community but I think we have to wait and see that's good yeah I mean it's a tough question to predict how economics just gonna just play it like that so yeah certainly certainly very interesting thought exercise as well and then and I look one last question from from the pre question stuff is you know what are some kind of maybe niche edge cases or use cases that you'd love to have compound at the part of the stack like you know where are these like dabs that like you know otherwise like certainly could benefit from having compound or very interesting use cases that you just haven't seen yet that you know you wish that somebody built yeah so I think there's a lot of use cases that open up when you start to have stable coins and multiple currencies that we just haven't seen yet and we're still sort of waiting for compounds of support multiple currencies but when you start having more assets very and more functional assets the use cases for compound actually go up nonlinearly they go very fast and so I actually think the more interesting things that think about an task is you know what are the use case of compound that are different two years from now versus today so right now for the most part you know in compound there's a couple different etherium tokens there's ether and there's a couple of dollar base tables when that's the structure it does exactly what people expect people are using ether ER and a couple you know aetherium tokens to borrow stable it's like the dominant swamp what does you know what are the use cases when those aren't the assets right when the assets inside of compound are like many different currency stable coins and bitcoin and five years from now when it's like financial securities where like bonds and stocks and stuff like that right and the use case would become extremely different right and so I love seeing the experimentation of you know what people are building right now I think people should also think about like how does this fundamentally change and you had different types of assets because those types of assets are coming especially sort of compound company so I think in the next year you see some very different use cases and then what people are you know focused on right now very cool yeah build for the future don't build for now right yeah exactly there's that Wayne Gretzky quote you know skates where the puck is going exactly cool awesome correct so we will open it up to to the public audience here if anybody has a question feel free to raise your hands or button if you don't understand how the raising hand button works that's all right feel free to ask the question on the side group chat as well um so let's see if anybody does the head arsh it looks like you have the first question in the chat do you wanna go ahead and unmute yes yes it would go thanks Frank was full awesome in me so far so I just wanted to know you know since you guys are pioneers in this space what's the next best thing you're working on and it will be goes well that you know if you're aiming for where the is headed so just wanted to know your thoughts on you know the define space as well as for compound for us you know we really view the most important next task is handing off control to the community you know for us that's where the puck is going it's you know protocols you know in order to run forever really need that legitimately be run by the commuter and the developers that build on top of it and the applications on top of it and so you know I think our next you know period of time is focused exclusively on that and it's better than any new feature because it sort of unlocks all sorts of new features and we really want you to figure out like what comes next and we're like companies to evolve and like you know some great examples are like you know some developers might decide to bridge compound to another blockchain like polka dot or cosmos or Bickel and some developers might decide that the most important thing is upgrading the risk models have come and how it operates and how it manages collateral some developers might decide that there's you know crazy new things that can be built on top of it you know like that we can't even imagine it so you know our view is we just want to facilitate the experiments that the community wants to because you probably know just as well as we do where the is gone but I didn't have my best guess but I mean know that community as a whole business probably we find this idea so it gives you important with the psychic thanks Sarge I think we got a question in chat and they said that they're not in a great environment to say it over audio right now but it's a good question so the question from coder den is what are the major differences between compound and avec functionally philosophically or anything else yes so compound is focused on simplicity in a lot of ways you know and it's been around for a while you know there's the ability for anyone to build a product similar to compound and you know we sort of celebrate that you know it compound where folks are having fewer assets more of a focus on simplicity and being more of a platform for developers to build on top of and for us that means giving the developers that are building on top of compounds a say in what happens to compound and how it evolved and being able to actually upgrade the underlying protocol and you know that's it I think the next question we have is from James Young who I assume mr. James Young of abridged yes there we go James take it away yeah I had a question with regards to choosing discovered and framework did you build your own or did you use one like Eragon or bounce back and the questioning just what led you to either building your own or choosing a framework yeah that's a great question so we built our own and we decided to use our own because we wanted a governance system that was very closely integrated into the protocol you know we sort of have the good fortune of having you know a large development team that we don't necessarily have to take a solution off the shelf and we spend a lot of time debating and looking at other frameworks and thinking about other frameworks and at the end of the day deciding to build something that we thought would be the most purpose and custom-built to the underlying protocol and you know that's because we're so fortunate to have you know a lot of development capacity and so we rolled our own full stack from the smart contracts on the bottom all the way up to the API is and governance interfaces on top and it's been done in such a way that we hope that over time the rest of the community can sort of take what we've done with the comp token and the governance system and improve upon it so the cop token itself is actually extremely custom we built a lot of governance mechanisms directly into the token whereas a lot of these systems are built you know for different purposes and so take a look at the comp token how it's written what it does it's pretty cool we built delegation directly into the token itself minute he's up a lot of really powerful governance mechanisms which we wanted right and a lot of other systems aren't you know assume that that doesn't exist they assume that like every tokens a vanilla ERC 20 token and things like that and so we roll their own it's pretty cool take a look at comp over time we won comp in the way it works to be the base for other governance tokens we want to create the IP and like create as standard around it so we think that a lot of other projects are looking for similar governance capacity and we hope that it sort of gets the ball rolling often thank you cool I think Hadrian you had the next question I don't know if you're able to unmute and ask yeah I can actually so yeah we've seen the rates of defy and I component particular go down I remember like a few months ago it was about 7% no it's almost zero I would like to know if you have an explanation and insight on that and also I was wondering if the high weight of defy the 7% can continue to happen if we have broad adoption and mass users joining the system yeah it's a great question so interest rates around the world in pretty much every financial market have gone down dramatically over the past couple months I think that no market is you know completely separate from any other market you know and there's I think a pretty deep relationship between the two and so I think you know rates and defy our function of rates in the real world a lot of ways and you know we don't spend too much time at compound thinking about the rates or think about what they are where they're going we're just building the tools for the market to exist in whatever the rates might be whether they're super low or super high or something in the middle so I wish I had like more data or more analysis of why the rates are what they are but like we don't really set you know the market that's and so it's definitely been interesting to see them just dramatically come in especially as you know central banks around the world we're just cutting rates extremely rapidly you thank you hey drew I think the next question and my apologies for having skipped this one on the list sorry I believe this from aria I think it was tell you for not sending Aria for you available to unmute yeah do you hear me yep okay so I just wanted to know Rob what Robert what your background was prior to building compound and what brought you to that place in life yeah that's a great question so I started my career in traditional financial markets I was you know engaged in interest rate market analysis which I you know a lot of ways that the seeds will compound this today but from 2011 to 2017 I was also an entrepreneur and software founder here in Silicon Valley so a lot of building new products and a lot of bringing things to market I'll add to that real quick and just say you know one of the cool things about defy in a lot of ways so that your background doesn't matter as much as other industries you know it's really about what ideas to have right now and you know are you capable of building and it's really cool because you know background matters a lot less than if you know we were doing something totally different you know in some ways my backgrounds are relevant you know I just happen to you know have a passion for interest rates and brought that to the product of the building today one more question so wrong what was the compliment but you say that you know it this is something that you want to build I mean for what's possess so redeeming tomorrow sorry can you repeat that yeah so I just want a moment and when did you realize that you are going to compound that what that realization yeah so the realization came in 2017 when we saw a lot of people focus on trading assets but very few people focused on you know creating interfaces for them and we saw that it's just a big gap you know for us it was just seeing that there was a hole in the market that nobody was really addressing and that we wanted to create a solution for I have a question about the the comp tokens and the decision on the the kind of general ratio of how they were disseminated up between shareholders the internal founding team the future team members and then distributed to users the protocol I don't know if there's any tell us about how comp tokens be distributed to users the protocol I'm wondering if if you Michael share a little bit of just I guess I'm looking for like kind of general philosophy of how those allocations were originally chosen and how that might serve as a model for future governance systems yeah so you know to go back to the sort of two goals of compound governance in general the two goals are we don't want anyone you know address to be able to accidentally break the protocol we want there to be essentially this concept of a multi sake in order to approve changes you know it in case someone makes a grave error or you know acts maliciously and the second is that we want the protocol to be upgradeable by a larger audience and so we designed compound governance and the token allocations to really try to achieve both of those purposes you know trying to think who if you view this as a multi-sig you know distributed amongst lots of people we want you know to have the key step and we thought it was pretty logical that you know roughly it would be a quarter for the developers that built it a quarter for you know folks that helped bring it to market with capital and half for the users you know relatively arbitrary but we think that it fulfills you know the first piece which is it creates what amounts to be a safe multi-sig so that no one can like accidentally break the protocol that it requires enough people have come together say this is appropriate and to that it's upgradeable by the community and this is actually where the allocation matters a lot less so one of the magical superpowers have compound governance is you don't need any comp at all in order to have a say in the system anyone would come can delegate their tokens to anyone else so regardless of how many tokens you have it can be zero right you can have a good idea and you can say I'd like to represent you know the interests of the protocol and you can raise your hands anyone on this you know live AMA no matter how many tokens you that you can ask for delegation you can ask for anyone with comp to support it and if you receive comp you can suggest changes to the protocol and so in a lot of ways in those questions of allocation you know are less relevant for compound than they are for other projects based on how we design company they're very specific about the designing the governance system so the specific allocation and that are less than if it was some other approach to vote and so you know for us you know this very arbitrary you know one quarter here one quarter here one half here was a good way of just waking up you know controlling to like essentially a multi-sig and then you know within that though anyone can delegate to him so you know anyone whose call can have enough say and influence in the protocol to upgrade it and really it's upgradeable by all 20,000 users or more it's just a follow up is there as the distribution of the community comp tokens been decided yet or no it hasn't been announced so next couple weeks we're gonna be releasing additional information okay on exactly how it works but every single user of compound is gonna wind up having comp tokens and a say in the government cool maybe we'll do maybe two more quick questions a one from the chat and one just says a and I feel good wrap-up question and yeah so I guess the question one of that is specifically related to comp you know like as you guys sort of take your hands off on actually building out the compound stuff you know what becomes like the major milestones or KPIs or whatever that that validate that that comp is working for you guys like you know what are you guys looking for and what are the major milestones along the way yeah so the most important milestone is that the community can like genuinely take over upgrading the protocol I I think the most important milestone is that you know developers like you guys can you know collaborate and can design upgrades and change the modifications and get them passed I think that's really the most exciting milestone other than that there's no real milestone it's really ensuring that the community takes over the protocol and you know has the wherewithal to be able to maintain it up there awesome cool and you know we'll wrap on this question I feel like you've already sort of touched on it a bit at least in your you know advice to skate or the parkings go puck is going but you know what advice would you give to somebody or to people that are trying to build a new product in the defy space today and and you know what are all kind of the considerations they need to be making and and yeah it would be really good to get thought about yeah so I think general you know if you're building a new defy application today you want to focus on in my mind doing one thing very well making one chain making one experiment one iteration and leaving as many other sort of parameters unchanged I don't think it necessarily always makes sense to try to completely reinvent the wheel you know even a compound we decided to build one very specific and small and simple building block not do nine things you know the compound protocol does really one thing that's it you know we constantly get asked oh why can't it also do you know this net it's like no cuz like anyone can build that on top you know why doesn't compound on slash loans you know it's like who cares anyone can build on top of compound with nine seconds right like we try to say no and just do one thing and so my you know best piece of advice is try to do one thing that's simple and effective and you can do well and just build like you know one thing you're just testing like one economic parameter and ensuring that there's demand for ensuring that sir is useful I'm ensuring that you know someone's able to use it um we've seen this repeatedly where like you know sometimes the simpler the better you know you know swapped is hilariously simple right as a great example like it's trivially simple and that's its power that's its strength um so I would say like you know if you're building a new project in this space like you kind of want to bring some in the market that's simple and safe you know I've seen a lot of projects get mired down by trying to do so many things or you know try to like you know launch before they're ready or that they've really like you know perfected what they're trying to build um I would say just go for perfect on like one basic building also I think that's especially good advice when you only have 30 days to go further at this ball so yeah also great well first of all thank you so much revered for the game a really appreciated chatting with you and and your fielding all the questions and of course having compound as a sponsor of hack money you know we're really excited to see what people build on compound and and yeah thank you again I appreciate that yeah and thanks to everyone here on the AMA really appreciate you all of your questions you can always continue to ask questions and our discord on Twitter anywhere you find us happy to help out with what you're building I'm really excited for everyone's hackathon projects and you know keep up the great work and you know carry aetherium forward thanks so much trouble alright thanks everybody sir ever thank you we can all wait goodbye I'm sorry there we go okay now I ended
