good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i am super excited to welcome all of you to road to web3 hackathon so for those of you who are joining us for the first time we're watching this and streaming all this on ethglobal.tv which is a platform we designed to make sure the experience is amazing for everybody who's participating at the hackathon as well as the summit and if you are using this for the first time i encourage all of you to log in say hi customize your avatar and this will be a way for you to also ask any questions whether it's to us about the hackathon or to our speakers when we begin the summit shortly i will be able to relate these questions directly to all of our speakers live and also answer things to uh to everybody in the chat and for everybody who also participates we'll be giving out nft pull apps so be sure to say hi and tell us where you're joining in from so for those of you who don't know this event is organized by each global anith global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits and today is no different this already has been our biggest event in history uh we've been running events for the last four years and we're constantly amazed by the level of interest and the excitement that we see every time we run a new event this particular hackathon will be over 1200 hackers participating over a thousand people who have signed up to join the summit on just our platform alone and it's being streamed on multiple other platforms as well uh the hackers themselves are coming in from 84 different countries spanning 20 different time zones this is absolutely incredible we uh we set out to map out where everybody is coming in from and it's incredible to see such a massive and diverse representation from five different continents actually six um and i can't wait to kind of learn more about where everybody's coming in from and talk to you in the next few days not only that we also over 60 ecosystem mentors that are going to be here for the next few days helping out with all of your projects and making sure that you're not blocked by anything whether it's helping getting help for specific sdks or integrations to questions about front-end or solidity or anything in between on top of that we're also excited to work with 10 ecosystem partners who are here for throughout the next few days uh to help out and also give out prizes and speaking of prizes we're going to be giving away over 250 thousand dollars um at the end of this event so there's a lot of prizes everybody can win for just building really cool things that you yourself are excited about when especially thank polygon for making all this happen we're super excited to be working with them well they've been an amazing ecosystem partner for us for the last few years and this becomes one of our tightest ways to want to work with the polygon team and make sure that we can move everything forward in the web3 ecosystem on top of that we also have some amazing partners like web3 auth sequence chain link the graph morales uni swap grants program nft port superfluid and covalent all these amazing companies will be here for the next few days helping out and offering different prizes which we'll go into very soon so the way this is structured is that i'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about the hackathon that most of you are joining in from and we'll cover a bunch of logistics around what's going to happen over the next few days and how everything is structured and then in about 45 minutes we'll kick off with our road to f3 summit and we'll bring on some incredible set of speakers who are here to talk about everything from the metaverse to d5 to devtools and what everybody can do here whether you're looking for ideas or companies or projects or spaces to kind of consider as you go deeper into web3 so the most common question we got asked um over the past few weeks from everybody who wanted to participate is what can i actually build i want to kind of just quickly take a minute and say that this event is specifically designed to encourage and bring in existing web 2 developers and designers to explore what they can do in web3 which means that there are a lot of there are hundreds if not more than i mean there are over 500 season web 2 developers who are anywhere from leaving their current web team roles to consider web3 full time to uh just looking at them now so they can think about should they actually move over to what three and uh were absolutely amazed by the level of interest and level the skills and experience that kind of came in as everybody filled out uh the applications to attend the hackathon and as you kind of near what you want to build over the next few days um i want to just kind of point out there are so many different options and there are largely infinite possibilities uh the most common things we've seen people talk about has been building really interesting integrations and apps and kind of primitives around leveraging different b5 protocols then there's so much interest in kind of using nfts in creative ways whether it's for videos or content that's not just images and on top of that another common thing we're seeing is people are super interested in building audio and video related hacks whether it's live streaming using decentralized protocols to making something cool with music and streaming that on chain and then of course there's a huge level of interest with gaming in building apps and tools around metaverse and of course not everything has to be using smart contracts and there's no expectation for you to do so um so there's also opportunities for you to build interesting developer tools that can make anywhere from your life to someone else's life easier or simply dig into things regarding analytics you can just look at what's happening you can build dashboards that may just analyze what's happening anywhere from on chain to a given project or an ecosystem and all that is absolutely okay as well um i also want to kind of highlight that you don't necessarily have to solve a particular problem we have a list of ideas on your info center that you can kind of pick an idea from whether it's from our that we've kind of sourced from recommendations from various partners sponsors and uh and people respecting this ecosystem and you can build whatever you're personally excited about so don't worry too much about whether i should aim for this or that or solve a particular problem just kind of use the next few days to explore everything that's possible and whatever you get excited about just continue with that and we're here to to help all of you so let's quickly talk about the next five days uh most of what i want to cover now is about how everything is set up especially because we are doing this thing across so many countries and time zones and asynchronously there's a few things that that matter so i'll quickly cover what thursday friday and saturday sunday looks like we'll talk about how team formation works we'll talk about how you can get help all the prizes you can win all the talks and workshops that we have planned today and over the weekend and also what happened yesterday and we'll also cover how judging works and then we'll jump into the summit after which will bring on all the amazing speakers that we have lined up as i cover all those logistics if you have any questions or follow-ups to what i've said or any clarifications you need just type those out in the chat and we'll be able to answer them live as we see them so let's jump right in [Music] for the rest of the next five days everything will happen on discord and everything will be happening asynchronously which means that if you are planning to attend as a hacker and you have successfully rsvp'd on your dashboard you will be automatically given the right permissions to join the discord channels for this hackathon you'll be able to verify that by quickly checking if you see a road to web3 header on your discord sidebar and if all the channels from the screenshot are visible which means that you are all good to go all these channels have uh their own purpose and i'll cover some of that but quickly kind of highlighting some of these things we have a code of conduct we have the information channel where we're gonna which we'll be using for announcements uh the web3 chat is where you can talk to everybody that's also participating at the event uh the finder team channel is for you to talk about what you're looking for if you're looking to join the team or if you have an idea and you want somebody to join your team uh if you are stuck with anything technical you can go into mentorship channel and ask for help we also have a share your hack channel that you can talk about um your own progress and just share what you've built so others can anyone give you feedback to comment or appreciate and of course we want to make sure that there's a healthy amount of memes going on so you can also post and engage in the means channel on top of that everybody would have also received calendar invites for everything that's happening for the course of this hackathon which means that for all the workshops that are happening today and also everything that happened yesterday in the next few days worth of toxic workshops as well as what's happening on judging all that's going to be directly sent to you as a calendar invite but all that is also available on the hackathon website for you to just look at and quickly browse and have it automatically normalized for your time zone we really want all this thing to be asynchronous which means that everything is designed so that you can also catch up if you are not available at that time whether it's through other obligations like work or school or you are simply not up at that time zone or at that time we want this to be as available as possible and if you miss something don't worry too much about it all of that is recorded and automatically put on youtube and to quickly talk about where you can find the schedule it's on the event website which is web3.ethglobal so let's talk about how the hackathon works essentially the hackathon officially begins now so as of 24 minutes ago you can start working on your projects and you can have up to five members on your team to kind of build the project with and that gives you three and a half days which is 84 hours from now or 83.5 hours from me signing this sentence to submit your project submissions are due at 9 00 pm eastern on sunday and that is the 84 hour time from here so you get three and a half days to work on whatever you're excited about get help and also make something cool a few things that i want to highlight for the rules for this event the key thing is that all work must be done from scratch which means everything you're submitted you need to ensure that it was started today you cannot continue building a project from before if you do so you will be disqualified to win any prizes and also just from this event and as part of a criteria for this event everything that you are doing must be deployed to polygons especially smart contracts and and be leveraging what's happening on the polygon ecosystem i know there's going to be a few edge cases and it's totally okay if you think you are in one of those edge case scenarios just reach out to us and give us a little bit more context and we will to clarify that for you directly whether it's over email or discord on top of that the one key thing to note is that only rsvp attendees are eligible to win any prizes which means that if you submit something on sunday and you win a prize but you realize that your team member was not listed we will not be able to honor that and they will not be receiving a prize if they were not listed on your team at the time of submissions so make sure that everybody's actually there and is clearly identified in the submission process if you don't see your teammates on your team that is a that's going to be a problem if you win any prizes and lastly of course we can cover every single edge case here so if you have more questions as the event goes on and as you think about other things that may require any clarification just ping us on discord or email uh you can reach anybody on the global discord directly from any of those channels so simply i mentioned as i will be happy to clarify anything for you one quick question that we get all the time is yes although your project and idea must be done from scratch that mostly talks about you shouldn't be designing or coding something before today but we absolutely want you to look at and use and leverage as many open source libraries as much as possible so if you are thinking about using scaffold 8 for example as a framework or any other boilerplate code base that is totally okay but if you are working on a side project for fun over the past few weeks uh and you want to just continue that and some like that for the hackathon that is not okay but we really encourage you to use existing sdks and open source projects or boilerplates to make your lives easier and focus on what you want to build and not necessarily entirely on the setup so that is entirely acceptable the other kind of question is what if i'm new to ethereum and or the polygon ecosystem once again this is totally okay the goal for this event is particularly to bring in lots of people who are experiencing web 2 to try out what's possible mark 3 so this event is designed to be an exploratory in nature and encourage everybody to give it a try so if you're new to this thing that's why we have a lot of workshops and talks you can do we have a lot of mentors that you can ping for getting help asynchronously over discord and even if you don't get to finish what you wanted to do originally today we still encourage all of you to submit and showcase what you did to all of our judges and get some feedback or get money into some right directions for using or leveraging resources or existing work that makes it easier so this is entirely okay um and this is kind of why the event exists or you can sort of have a compressed window just quickly learn just enough to get something going and then use that to now continue building your uh your skills and your background and just kind of getting more deeper into how everything is structured another question we're getting is does the project have deployed to mainnet uh no it does not uh you can absolutely stick to test nets or even locally if you're leveraging just uh something like a hard hat or truffle um you are not required to put everything or anything to mainnet if you want to you are definitely welcome to but we definitely encourage people to be careful about deploying anything to mainnet or building anything that others can immediately use and that also may be a risk for capital so be careful about that but you don't have to necessarily deploy anything to me uh another question is can we only enter with brand new ideas um that is correct which means that you cannot continue building anything you've already worked before if you had an idea before but you had never started working on it that is you can continue doing that but if you had committed a code before for anything before this morning at least in my time zone then you were not allowed to submit that because that would be considered getting a head start and cheating as part of the event rules which brings us to another question around what if i'm still looking for ideas or i'm looking to either join a team or want somebody to be on my team to make your lives easier over the next three and a half days and the answer there is that there's there's quite a lot of people who are in the same situation and that's why the finite team channel exists and if you go to that channel you'll be able to see anywhere from what people are excited to build or what they're looking for or what they can offer and you can do that asynchronously and message people directly on this course to see if you would like to pair up um and to also make that easier we encourage all of you to introduce yourself in the road to web3 chat channel so we can learn about where you're from what you're excited about what you are here to do and learn and also just get to meet everybody from different parts of the world i also want to kind of point out that we're doing two other things today which is a brainstorming call which i believe already happened uh this morning and that team formation call later uh in the evening so we can accommodate for different time zones uh where you can come on a call live and talk to everybody who's looking for a team so if you don't want to do this over discord there's going to be 100 of you joining live and just talking to each other on the call and finding potential teammates and lastly just one thing i want to also clarify is that it's we encourage you to work in teams because it makes your life easier for the next few days but it is not a requirement if you want to build something on your own uh you are more than welcome to do so you can use this as a way to just assign yourself a solo project and just measure your own progress over the next few days and see how far you got um and you can totally do that on your own you have no no requirement to work with uh necessarily a team uh we'll talk about all i know we're getting a couple questions on what's happening with judging and we'll kind of cover all of that uh very soon so um just a couple more minutes of patience and we'll uh we'll get that and it looks like someone's already answered part of that question too but i'll go into a lot more detail so talks in workshops there is so much excitement from so many people who are beginners and we want to make sure that we do whatever we can to encourage all of you um to continue learning as you kind of learn and dig into what you want to build um a lot of that started yesterday so we get so many incredible talks and workshops and live sessions that you could have attended and ask questions to our speakers if you were not able to do so live it is totally okay all those things are available as recording so you can catch up on a lot of those tutorials and even use some of those github repos and just kind of clone that and have your basic framework set up for doing anything from renting an nft to getting started with with hardhat or having a scaffold repo ready to go so you can just work on your business logic on top of that we also have amazing talks and panels today and then over the next couple of days including feedback sessions where you can kind of come online and get feedback on how things are going so far as well as get recommendations for what you can do to anyone for make your life easier to uh to simply just seeing what others think about it what you've been building all the talks in workshops and panels and everything else is also laid out on the website and you can see more detail about how everything is set up on the road to web3 info center which is a really big button link on your dashboard as well as a link in every calendar invite that you're receiving and of course as i had mentioned before if you were not able to make a talk um live that is totally okay everything is recorded and will be made available instantly as it ends on our youtube channel in the youtube link is youtube.com youthglobal so you can watch everything including this talk itself right after we finish the website is web3.epo.com that's where you can see everything from prizes to the schedule to who the speakers and judges are and kind of catch up with everything there and after every talk it ends we'll also be putting a link next to the schedule on the talk so you can also watch the recorded version directly from the website if you can't find it easily on youtube [Music] now quick reminder on submissions submissions are due at 9 00 pm eastern on sunday the 6th i'll i'll uh share more about how the judging process process is set up and how submissions are going to be structured and we'll kind of spend a couple minutes there but that is now officially 83.5 hours from now and you'll also get ample reminders over email and discord when we are nearing the submission deadline so speaking of that let's talk about judging so there's going to be two ways that judging is structured for this hackathon there's a main judging that is a live session that we do with some really notable speakers and and people in this ecosystem and then there's a sponsor price specific judging track which is asynchronous so i know we already got a question about uh prizes and i'll kind of cover what that looks like but the two things to note are as you submit your project at 9 00 pm eastern on sunday you will have an option to pick which judging route you want to go to if you select the first one you actually are selecting both options at the same time which is you are defaulting to saying we're going to present live to our judges on monday morning eastern and at the same time be considered for all the sponsor prizes if you select the second one that means you are only considering yourself to be looked at for sponsor prizes and in that case after you submit your projects will be sent to all the sponsors to look at and they'll have a couple of days to kind of go through everything and decide who wins what prizes and if they have any questions they'll ask you directly over discord or email and clarify anything that's uh that they are they're unsure of and then they'll send us the list of winners for each of those prizes and we'll be announcing those winners on wednesday live so the way everything is still going to be set up whether it's sponsor judging or the main judging is that you will have to submit a video submission for your project and you will have four minutes to demo what you built which means that you're recording a four-minute video that has everything from who you are as a team where you're from what you built why you chose to build this thing and you do a live demo or a demo of your project in that recording and then make sure it's under four minutes and then once you have that you upload that video on your dashboard and fill out all the relevant details on the submission form which includes everything from the project name all the prices you're going for making sure that uh all of your team members are there and and deciding if you want to go with the live judging or not one thing we want to kind of note is that we see a lot of people do this the very last minute we really encourage you to not do this last minute because you want to have at least an hour to make sure you have a good video time prep because sometimes people go over and if you are over four minutes the submission page will automatically reject that file upload so don't do this thing last minute or find out that you made it too long make sure you have at least an hour to prep for all of this and uh and you can also update everything after so you can still do something immediately and then if you realize that you've made it anywhere you want to have an edit or you want to replace it you can do so after the first attempt so just just don't procrastinate on this and make sure you plan for it ahead of time and all these details again are also on your dashboard i saw somebody already links the the submissions guideline on on the chat but if you click on the info center you'll see a click a an easy link to the uh the judging and submission guidelines that talks about the process expectations you can see some sample summations from the past events and just kind of know how everybody has structured this in the past and also i want to quickly talk about the code of conduct um all the rules and our code of conduct has been laid out on each global.com slash rules and in summary we want you to be respectful this is still a online community and we want to abide by the same rules that would apply to an in-person event as we would here which means harassment and abuse is not tolerating any capacity whether it's towards anybody on the global team or any other attendee if you see somebody that should be that's behaving not the way they should be please uh tell them please tell the global team about them and we'll take immediate action and if you need any help with anything about this event you can always reach out to us in private or publicly and we'll be able to address things immediately that's mostly on the code of conduct the other quick thing i want to talk about that has come up in the past a few days over discord is everything you build as part of this event you retain the intellectual property of it which means that none of the sponsors or the 8th global team will have any rights to what you build so you will own everything that you built here and you don't have to worry about any issues around ip in the future so all that is quick overview of logistics i want to quickly get to our prizes and what we did is we asked polygon to tell us who they are for those of you who don't already know and talk about uh why they're excited to be part of this event and why we're doing this together with them so we'll have sandeep the co-founder of polygon joining us and telling us about everything that there is to know about polygons so without further ado let's welcome sandeep [Music] hi guys this is sandeep i am one of the co-founders at polygon thanks for having me here uh we're very excited to have this road to web3 hackathon in partnership with the global team um hackathons have always been a very important part of polygon journey we have been doing a lot of hackathons you know many many of them with global and across the world um you know so so so in the last two years we would have done like probably 200 to 300 hackathons so and we will keep doing that that in the future too because you know we feel that you know to have the have the grasp of the grassroot developer community from where and especially eve global from where many of the top ranking projects today have come uh it's very important for us to to to be connected with the developer community so we'll keep doing that in the past couple of months actually we have seen a lot of influx of web 2 developers who have done or who are doing already great work on the web 2 side but they are trying to break into website stack but due to lack of clear you know guidance road maps and how the technology works and all those things many of the times it's very difficult to to begin that journey this is why we are doing the road to web3 hackathon to onboard um a new wave of developers onto web3 and ethereum ecosystem uh and we see at this hackathon as a bridge for the web 2 developers into web3 uh you know as as you know you know it's clearly a very big need currently so for those of you who don't know polygon polygon is a multi-chain scalability suit for ethereum that means we provide we are like aws of web3 we're trying to become aws of web 3 and ethereum scaling uh basically when you want to build your ethereum compatible uh you know application or decentralized application dap as we call it uh and you are looking for decentralized compute uh you know you can choose from a suit of solutions depending upon how much decentralization you want if you if you are building a game you need extremely low cost and you know you are okay to compromise a bit on the decentralization whereas if you are building a full-blown d5 ecosystem where you expect multiple billion dollars to come into it uh you know then you would you might use a full-blown zika roll-up so we want to present across the spectrum and provide all the all the you know plausible solutions to the developers and then each developer each business can choose their own um you know own solution uh to kind of uh you know which suits uh their business application the best uh so uh you know polygon as you might also know that you know uh have been like you know really really popular the daily average users on the polygon chain uh has has you know surpassed even the the mother chain that is ethereum chain and if you see globally also even by the context of layer ones uh you know polygon uh the other layer ones which are trying to compete with ethereum and i forget about competing with ethereum polygon has more number of developers number of users number of active addresses than many of the layer ones at times combined orders of magnitude more than them combined right so so so this has become you know a a very popular uh platform for developers to build their dapps and uh you know the main reason for that is that you know we want to keep polygon as extremely uh compatible with ethereum where if you know how to present ethereum or how to build on ethereum uh you know you you basically already know how uh how to build on on polygon and that's the goal with all the current as well as the future solutions coming on uh coming from polygon so you know we we wish you all the best uh on on on doing uh you know or or doing your project uh for this hackathon and uh you know we are seeing a lot of things like you know on the commerce side shopify is coming in and then on the brand side recently we had adidas and prada previously dolce and gabanna did it uh you know did their nfts and things like that so we are seeing a huge amount of adoption on the gaming side like polygon has has emerged as the most used chain currently so if you are building games or nfts you have direct integration with openc if you are building something in d5 you have the access to the entire d5 ecosystem recently last one of the last protocols open you know uni swap also launched on polygon so you have the entire suit of uh ethereum d5 products on the polygon chain the current tvl over there is is 12 billion dollars and you know almost all the protocols available over here so that's why like you know you with polygon you have a full blown chain where you can do anything that you want to do any kind of composable smart contracts you want to build so you know i want to wish you all the all the best and all the luck for this hackathon and the product that you're going to build thank you so much amazing that was sandeep with a really quick overview of what's happening right now in the polygon ecosystem and the good news is that there's a lot more that's happening that can't be fit into five minutes so we'll be bringing on sundeep and halo in just a few minutes to give a broader update on the state of the polygon universe and we'll also be able to ask them questions from the audience and anything you would like to know about what's happening in that ecosystem so without further ado let's jump right into prizes there's a over 250 000 in prizes uh that we're giving away for this hackathon and all of them are in different categories as well as kind of laid out differently in different sort of ways to think about tiering and pulling them and i'll cover all that now so the first one i want to talk about is the list of prices that are offered by polygon so for those of you who don't already know polygon is the leading platform for ethereum scaling and infrastructure development and there's so much that's going on in terms of what's going with deployments on nft or d5 projects or just being able to make experiences that reduce the friction on gas costs um for your day-to-day interactions um while that's happening here and the way polygon prices are set up either are going to be split in five different categories and two other separate parallel tracks so the first one is the grand prize which is going to be 75 000 and every team that wins the the grand prize which would be 15 teams will get 5 000 each then there are five categories that will be giving out the prizes to the top five teams in each of those categories so the first one is d5 so the best five d5 apps that are deployed on the polygon ecosystem whether it's mainnet or testnet will receive three thousand dollars each the five top teams that are building nfts on the polygon ecosystem will also receive three thousand dollars then we have the same thing for gaming hacks or the top five gaming whether they're games or gaming related uh applications and submissions the top five of them will receive three thousand each the five best tools will also receive three thousand dollars each and there's a special category for web 2 to web 3 which is anybody who makes a interesting attempt or effort to sort of anyone from bridge their own skill sets to build something that offers a seamless web 2 experience but leveraging web 3 technologies we'll be receiving 2 000 each and the 5 teams of course we recognize that there are a bunch of edge cases here so for the time being we believe we will be entertaining overlapping categories so you can build something that is for example gaming in nft and possibly qualify for both categories on top of all of that there's going to be a pool prize of 50 000 for every project that is deploying to polygon which means that as long as you are able to prove that you are sufficiently using polygon from in your code base and this is also a process and part of the submission process you'll be able to point out exactly what line in your code base and it just has a a small the like yeah detour everything must also be public so your github repos must be public as part of the submission process or you will also not be considered for any prices anyway uh anybody who uses polygon and deploys to polygon will equally split 50 000 and that is not a an exclusive thing this is this does not mean you have to make a choice of the other grand prize or any of those five categories so uh for somebody who just asked does does this have to be super polished ui and look really fancy for me to win any prizes the answer is no you have to make sure that it works and we recognize that three and a half days is not enough to make something super incredible and we don't want you to do that we want you to first learn and see what's possible then i want you to make it work and then you make it better so that others can use it and the audience that you're making this for is delighted to use it so you can also qualify for equal split of fifty thousand dollars uh we'll get a lot of questions on on what the full price means in general so i'll just give you one example as well which means if 50 teams submit for the pool prize and all of them are using polygon sufficiently as part of the criteria then every team will get a thousand dollars so it's an equal split based on number of teams and another question we just got is do the project have to be open source uh the answer is yes it does not mean that you have to make everything open source for others to use you can still do licensing but we at right after submission and all of our partners must be able to click on your repo verify your code base check your command history and see that you did not cheat as well as you are using um set sdks the way you are saying you are so next up is the sequence price sequence is building a smart contract wallet for ethereum and network of ethereum chains so the best user sequence uh sdk and integration will be receiving five thousand dollars in total so the top the first spot will receive three thousand dollars and the second spot we'll get 2000 and the third place will get a thousand [Music] um another question we just got on polygon and i'm happy to answer any questions as well we'll using superfluid sdk polygon qualify for the polygon pool price yes as long as you're deploying something to the polygon network that is the the minimum criteria so you have to specify how you're using it and and if you're actually using it properly whether it's super fluid or any other protocol that's on polygon uh the criterias were deploying and and not using the polygon sdk specifically in some form then we have web3 up now web3 auth is also an auth infrastructure that enables wallets and applications to get a seamless identity and user experience so you can bridge web 2 and web 3 interfaces really easily and not make the user think about any difference in the interaction so web3 auth will also be giving uh three prizes so the first place price for the best use of web3r will receive 2500. second place will be receiving 1500 and the third place will be 500. um another question on the polygon stuff yes it can be deployed to mumbai testnet but also mainnet and uh and i know we're going to get a couple edge cases so what we'll also do is we'll also specifically clarify this on the prizes page you can actually see that again and if something changes you will be notified of that and the final version of what means what's qualifies or what qualifies will be what's on the price page next up is the graph so for those of you who don't know what the graph is graph is an indexing protocol and it indexes and organizes data from all blockchain so you can quickly access information um without querying the nodes every time and the graph is also offering four thousand dollars in prizes so the best so fifteen hundred dollars will be given to the best use of an existing subgraph uh on the graph network and a thousand dollars will be uh given for the best new sub graph creation and 500 will be given for the runner-up price for creating a new sub graph so yeah just in one more time deploying the test net on polygon does qualify you for the pool price you don't have to do mainnet next up is morales so morales is the fastest way to build and deploy gaps on polygon ethereum and a bunch of other chains and this is also one of those reasons where you don't have to reinvent the wheel and getting everything set up on your developer environment so you can use morales sdks just get started on whether you want to get some nft boilerplates in or you want to use a specific protocol you can do all that easily and spend less than 30 minutes in just being set up so you can work on what you want to build then you have and we're also getting 4000 in prizes so the best use of the morales sdk will receive 2 000. second place will receive 1500 and the third place will get 500. then we have chain link and chain link is an oracle service and it enables you to query any real world data whether it's an api somewhere else or any other service or even on-chain contracts and use that information in your smart contract to be able to do interesting things um so you have the best of both worlds and being able to understand and query what's happening outside of in a chain and chain link is offering four thousand dollars prizes so the top four projects that you use chain link will receive a thousand dollars in link tokens um for this then we have the unit swap grants program for those of you who don't know unispop is an exchange decentralized exchange which is as of recently available on the polygon network and the units of grants program was to make sure that they're able to help you and support you and being able to leverage that d5 primitive to build any creative apps so they're dividing the prices in two different categories the useful grants program is offering two thousand dollars for the best polygon adoption and uh integration of the dex contracts on polygon and then two thousand dollars divided between fifteen hundred for the first place dependent for this runner-up for the most innovative use of the unispot contracts on polygon then we have superfluid and superfluid is a d5 primitive that lets you stream money on ethereum leveraging polygon and let you transfer money by the millisecond actually it may be even more granular by the block and uh and superfluid is offering four thousand dollars in prices so the best use of superfluid will receive two thousand dollars uh for the first place and then two one thousand dollar prizes for the best financial innovation project category winner for the best integration of superfluid and then a thousand dollar prize for the most futuristic streaming related application built on superfluid and uh and then i want to talk about covalent so covalent is building a unified api to bring transparency and visibility into what's happening on blockchain across all blockchain networks so you can query things easily whether it's data around the latest state of a contract or just anything that you would ideally have to spend lots of time creating because you have to do this in a for loop in an efficient way so being able to query information is kind of what they're doing to make your life easier and uh if you expand the nft collection dashboard templates for covalent you will be eligible for two thousand dollars and divided between for second and third place for 1250 500 250 and any project that meaningfully uses covalent sdk or the api will split two thousand dollars as a pool price so if 10 teams submit and build on covalent they'll be receiving 200 each then we have nfc port an ft port is the stripe for nft so you get to simply integrate that sdk in the infrastructure and let developers build stuff and anywhere from men's to transfer to manage entities so any meaningful use of nfc port sdks will split a full price of four thousand dollars and those are all of our prices so one other question we got is what happens if they're stacking which means that if you were to build something on superfluid will you also qualify for the polygon pool price the answer is yes everything is stackable so we really want to take composability here and make sure that you are able to do some cool things and you don't have to explicitly choose one or the other so you can absolutely go for multiple prizes so finally before we jump into our summit i want to quickly remind everybody to to pace yourself we really don't want this to be exhausting to you this is especially an event for hundreds of you to understand what's happening in crypto and web3 overall so don't go crazy with doing everything and not sleeping pace yourself have fun learn what's possible experiment and even if you don't get to what you wanted to do at the end this that's totally okay we just want you to continue building and not necessarily competing to win some massive price because that's not the goal so with that happy hacking we'll see all of you on discord and with this we are ready to kick off our summit so we got the next four hours jam-packed with an incredible set of speakers and we're going to be talking about what's coming so i want to quickly give an overview to the talks we're going to see so we're going to kick off with the update on what's happening in the polygon ecosystem with sundeep and halo they're going to talk about everything that's going on with polygon and what they're excited about now and what's coming as well as the future of the ecosystem then uh we'll have ryan and pierce talk about future gaming and just what that looks like when you blend this in with web3 then justin khan one of the co-founders of twitch and currently the co-founder of fractal will be coming on we'll be doing a fireside chat and interview with him then we have an amazing fireside chat between matthew ball and jonathan click and they're going to be talking about the metaverse uh and how that is uniquely positioned to succeed now with the advent of crypto and web3 then austin griffith and mater debit will be talking about the state of web developer tooling so many of you are seasoned web 2 developers and we'll kind of talk about things we've seen anywhere from gotchas to interesting observations we made from people who are transitioning from web 2 to understanding how webster works from a developer's standpoint and our last talk of the day will be a chat about the future of ownership economy where legion and spencer known from varian fund will be coming on and sharing their excitement about how does the ownership economy and the passion economy is uniquely forced is uniquely enabled by web3 so without further ado i want to thank everybody for sticking around for the logistics and let's get the summit started so uh i want to just jump right in and introduce sandeep and mihailo on on screen and let them take it from here so hello welcome we're super excited to have you again and uh loving the shirts yes yes we were saying that we are the polygon twins today like you know mission accomplished yeah yeah we should take a take a picture of it to post on twitter also because you know this looks funny all right so it's been incredible to get the signal going um uh all summarize people who are just joining us for this for the summit piece uh this is officially the biggest event that global has done and in our first four years of running things uh we have never seen this much interest in what's happening in web3 especially from people who are uniquely leaving web2 to join the last two weeks we got a record number of applications to attend the hackathon and we had to sadly say no to a lot of people because we couldn't support them for free judging so that's already a great start to uh to this day and uh i'll let you kick off with what's happening with poga yes awesome so i will take the first part of the the presentation and then from there mihailo can can pick up so you know let me quickly share my um wait this one okay um so basically you know like i'll start with a brief uh overview of polygon and first of all like you know i i you know welcome everyone uh who has shown interest in this uh you know web wrote to web3 hackathon and then you know i i wish uh for to all the people who are already in web 3 and who are coming from web 2 to web 3 fantastic uh you know experience with this hackathon and they get to you know at least a good uh mental framework of you know of their journey into web 3. so uh i mean to to to start with like you know polygons uh journey like you know polygon was founded in 2017 uh then we did an io on binance and but you know in june 2020 we launched our main net with the proof of stake chain and uh you know by by end of 2020 polygon was already showing signs of very high amount of adoption and uh you know we were previously called matic network uh many of you would have heard that before also but we rebranded from matic to polygon because and and you know some of the things i'm going to talk in the next slide that you know polygon now is a previously matic network was one kind of chain like it was plasma uh chains uh you know to be to be scaling ethereum but now polygon as polygon we have a much larger vision of uh having this multi-chain uh you know internet of of of of blockchains for ethereum where developers can choose from various different kind of solutions that we provide and i'll i'm going to talk more about that uh you know going forward then in april 2021 a large amount of d5 started uh coming onto onto polygon and then uh you know this culminated with the with uni swap uh you know i i think three four weeks back unit swap also deploying which completes the entire uh you know the the ethereum defy community having a store on polygons so they continue to exist on ethereum main chain but they also have their you know you can say uh stores on the polygon chain also and uh it has been absolutely a fantastic journey from there and and many of these protocols have larger number of users on polygon now than the and then the then the main chain of course the the volume of the the transactions uh is smaller but you know the number of users they have there is and that's why like you know the d5 initiative is called d5 for all on polygon because it basically allows retail community to participate in the d5 because of the low gas fees and everything and then uh you know from uh from from june to uh the end of last year we have uh you know we have expanded polygon and you know kind of made polygon as one of the powerhouses of uh zero knowledge technology now uh you know the some of the the most uh you know famous projects in the zero knowledge space like polygon hermes uh you know polygon zero um one protocol that we are doing with the with einstein young polygon nightfall and uh you know polygon maiden uh uh you know constitute uh the the zero knowledge uh you know suit of uh of polygon and you know pound four pound many people have have said that you know probably polygon has uh probably uh one of the best uh if not if not the best like top two teams in the in the ethereum scaling space so uh and then there have been like multiple things with polygon zero we announced the plan k2 which is uh which is the like 100x faster than any other zero knowledge recursive proof generator you know to to kind of scale the zero knowledge technology so uh you know what exactly is is polygon so you know polygon as i said that is a multi-chain suit of these blockchains so basically polygon is not one chain like although you many of you will interact with polygon pos chain for now in this hackathon but if you see and if you follow my cursor like polygon you know has a much larger uh you know the visibility or kind of the mindset for the ethereum scalability we don't believe in one narrow definition of polygon of ethereum scaling which primarily has been you know purely layer two and layer two means like you know you have full security guarantee of ethereum that means both your data as well as your dispute resolution which are the technical terms of layer 2 are guarded by ethereum but for for easy easiness perspective just think that you know full blown layer 2 means full security from ethereum but then obviously when you are getting full security from ethereum you have to pay for fee for that right so so we believe that you know there are you know each application has its own requirements and uh you know polygon uh you know wants to be present across the spectrum where on the left extreme you see this low security low security from ethereum or almost no security you have sovereign chains like you know and the security of the chain is fully guaranteed by the sovereign validators of that chain and then if you come to the middle you will find a chain like polygon pos which is built on top of ethereum does not derive full security from ethereum but there is you know the staking rewards everything happens on on ethereum and then on the right extreme you can see the full-blown roll-ups where we have four zero knowledge roll-up efforts going on each of them have their own benefits own trade-offs and you know right now they are all four different products maybe some of them will converge with each other and then in between that we also have a polygon available which is the data availability uh solution from polygon which allows and the people who know zero knowledge is scaling space there which allows for validium where you can have the zero knowledge proofs back on ethereum but the data availability can stay on on the on off chain layer so that's basically again to the idea to to take back home is that polygon is you know provides spectrum of these solutions across uh the board for ethereum scaling and you as a developer you choose what is better for you do you need are you a d5 application who needs absolute security from ethereum then choose zero knowledge roll ups if you are if you are building a very casual game where you need a bridge from you know polygon to or your own chain to to ethereum maybe use polygon sdk or you know if you want like somewhere in the middle you want to interact with the larger d5 and nft ecosystem maybe you want to remain on a shared chain still low cost you can be on polygon pos so giving the power back to and the power of choice back to the developer for this web 3 compute right so and polygon actually you know if you see we want to kind of become the aws of web3 where you know today if you are coming from web 2 you are building an application and you want to deploy it you go to aws choose the server you want choose the database you want and then you deploy your application right in web 3 you are looking for decentralized compute in web 2 you are looking for centralized compute right so in inventory when you you will be building your application you will probably come to polygon and see okay what is the requirement of my my application whether it's a d fights nft how much security i want and how much controls use censorship resistance i want and you will choose your solution according to that but fully connected with ethereum because that's where the the large network effects lie so i already mentioned about these you know uh around uh you know seven products that we have polygon pos polygon sdk which is now called polygon edge uh polygon avail uh you know hermes nightfall myden and zero are the zero knowledge projects so so so i mean in terms of the investors in our polygon ecosystem like the largest of the largest names uh are there and then all these investors are investing very heavily in polygon ecosystem uh i mean you know we we kind of uh i mean a lot of these investors have committed multiple hundred million dollars into the protocol and if you are building uh into the into the ecosystem and if you are building something you know and and it is it is great we are more than happy to you know provide all these investor connections to the uh people who have strong product aspirations uh you know post the hackathon um and and you know in terms of the polygon project these are like very very small number of uh you know uh the projects like ave uh uni swap and and you know decent land like especially let's say meta versus uh you know people talk about meta versus but some of the largest meta versus not some of the in fact the the all the largest metaverses in the web3 space are all on polygon decentraland somnium space sandbox ave gochi all of them are on polygon some of the top games like neon district zed run police all of them are on polygon and now brands the big brands like you know uh big brands like adidas and prada dolce and gabanna are launching their nfts and you have access to this large ecosystem now if you're building on polygon um i mean i already spoke about this metaverse and the brand related things also uh you know macy's thanksgiving parade had their nfts launched on polygon nfl had their nfps on polygon polygon and on the on the metaverse side like all the blue chip meta verses are are integrated with polygon um so yeah i mean in terms of adoption polygon currently i think that by the number daily average users and the number of developers building on polygon uh you know polygon uh has emerged as the most used uh you know polygon pos has emerged as the most used uh blockchain uh globally it has surpassed even the mother chain ethereum and then uh even like all of the other layer ones if you you know take by the number of daily active users and the total number of unique users in the in the ecosystem uh we would be probably five to ten x of any of the even the layer ones uh alternate layer ones which are trying to compete with ethereum right so i mean it's an order of magnitude it's not like poly one has more than that it's orders of magnitude higher uh of these matrices on polygon and uh the benefits like as some of you would already understand that polygon will you know provides full ethereum compatibility scalability that means low cost transactions uh security and sovereignty if you are if you are looking for a polygon sdk related or polygon head chain interoperability you know bridges between these chains uh you know and user experience related things like meta transactions and all that a developer experience like if you have if you learned solidity which is predominantly the largest and the most used uh you know kind of blockchain programming language uh you have access to all the tooling including hard hat or tenderly or you know rpc providers like infuria alchemy everything so so you know these are some of the benefits but once you start building on it i'm pretty sure you'll love the developer experience overall um you know adoption i really i already spoke about like you know many of the as i was saying that many of the other layer ones that even the layer ones if you see you they would have like you know 100 200 300 application alchemy sometimes you know sometime back they posted that polygon has seven thousand plus applications uh we have generally uh you know three to four million average daily number of transactions uh the tvl on the network is around 12 billion dollars and overall market cap of the of the protocol has has reached uh you know fluctuates between 16 to 20 billion dollars on polygon post you get two second block times which makes it very very very fast evm compatibility and and in a lot of other things so and and you know like especially if you are building on nft like all the the biggest nft enablers like openc as a marketplace uh fractionalization protocol like uniquely uh and and you know like many other things like showtime uh they are all available on uh on polygon and you can if you are building an ft project you get direct access to this entire uh you know nft ecosystem community wise polygon is now one of the largest uh you know crypto communities and people and the projects which are building on polygon they get visibility directly to all these all these users now even if you are building a gaming platform uh like ndg which is the you know india version of ygg which is the play to one community you have direct access to that also and ndg is also very closely worked upon uh by polygon studios um and then you know like we have mentioned some of the stats about the you know open c uh uh you know in terms of the nft tech support it has been a constant growth overall uh on on polygon and uh you know here is a brief self-explanatory comparison of some of these other layer ones which are trying to compete with ethereum but you know we believe that uh you know like polygon already provides all those all those advantages uh on the top of ethereum so you know generally negates the need for any other uh you know other blockchain platform and you know with the ethereum's uh huge community massive massive community you know it gives every reason to you know remain intact in this high network effect community so so i mean in terms of the tooling uh you know you see the the wallets i mean almost every wallet uh you know available in the web 3 space is integrated with polygon oracles almost every oracle is integrated with polygon exchanges integrations every exchange is integrated dow dev tooling like you know it is pretty extensive in that sense like everything anything that you are used to use on using on ethereum uh most most likely you will find them those same tools working on polygon like a charm and uh you know nft and gaming you know these are some of the top games that we could mention here uh you know open c super farm battle racers i mean many of these uh are you know comet arzora and all that these are big names in the nfp space um you know some more names on the nft side of things and this is like a very small list of uh this one's like i think gaming wise we'll have 500 to 1000 various level of games on polygon uh d5 as i said that the entire d5 ecosystem is is is there on polygon like whatever you have on on on ethereum main chain if you want to experiment with dex's landing borrowing protocols everything is available on polygon on the main net so you can have uh direct integrations and testings uh of your project that you are building and uh you know this is d5 two point you know second slide and then third slide like everything that you can imagine on deep is available on polygon so that's that's that's all from my side and then uh you know that's the closure of the presentation and then i would also request my uh you know co-founder mihailo who's uh you know has been pretty prolific in the ethereum research community uh to talk more about let's say you know what what polygon uh is doing on the zero knowledge side to just give you a brief flavor of like what all we are doing on the on the zero knowledge and why we believe that this is the future of uh you know blockchain scaling yeah of course uh hi everyone first of all thanks kartik and the team for organizing this this is really amazing and uh of course we're super thrilled and humbled to see this level of of interest more than 1200 acres already applied and that's really really amazing to see and that's basically why we started this whole thing called polygon and it's yeah we're super happy to see all this uh i think sandeep covered pretty much pretty much everything that is important for for i don't know for the hacker for the builders community uh to to to know maybe as sandeep said i can briefly cover our efforts on the dk side and maybe i can take a step back maybe and cover cover actually more the the vision itself of polygon how it started and how do we see this web free because the the title of of the event the name of the event is road to web free so i was thinking maybe i can just briefly share some some of our thoughts basically and how do we see the whole web free ecosystem what it means for us and what do we want to actually do for it so uh for us the free is the the one of the most potentially impactful uh technological movements in the world at this point in time and we believe it can have significant and profound impact on the whole society on the whole planet in general and to try to kind of this is too vague of course but to try to uh um maybe articulate some of uh some points is that um one of the one of the uh things that we're trying to build with webfree is this global uh uh network of values so we with internet we established this global internet of information right and we kind of democratized access to information so prior to to to internet um information let's say education obtaining certain knowledge or skills was not really uh widely or globally available and maybe people who had uh better financial uh status or were maybe leaving certain geographies were able to acquire knowledge to go to universities etc and internet kind of democratized that so anyone in any remote i don't know village in africa or in uh whatever philippines can now access this global global pool of of um information and knowledge and that's really transformative concept of course uh what was lacking there like one major thing that that was lacking there is this global network of values so okay now we democratize knowledge we democratize information how do we now allow these people globally to to monetize this knowledge to actually benefit from the knowledge they acquired in a lot of parts of the world in many parts of the world this is not really possible like in i don't know i lived in some time in africa in tanzania and for example uh i a huge popul part of population doesn't even have ideas not to mention uh bank accounts so they are kind of excluded for this from this uh uh um current financial system and vap3 in establishing this global network of value is really a transformative concept that can actually now also democratize access to this global economy and establish actually this global borderless economy and allow everyone in the world literally to just simply spin up or install a wallet and actually become part of this this uh global open worldless economy and that's for us hugely hugely transformational concept there are some other also important concepts i i guess i can speak about polygon and they're free for four days i'll just be uh try to be mindful of about time and yeah concepts like ownership where people finally uh own their own assets of course digital assets primarily it's hugely transformational having no intermediaries you're actually in charge and holding actually your assets this is also something that we never had in modern history and several other ways the the ways web free and and its concepts can can affect the way we organize ourselves the way companies work all sorts of human organizations from companies uh to to ngos to governments even all of this can be disrupted and we believe taking everything into account webfree is in my opinion the most transformative tech movement in the world now and i i'm also personally very very humbled and excited that i'm a small contributor in this movement and yes that is uh um this primary and unlimited i guess source of inspiration for for us at polygon as the the founders i guess and and the team overall so um that being said we believe ethereum is our best shot by far to actually build this fab free and we are fully committed as a project to ethereum we are parts we are part of the ethereum community we consider polygon integral part of the ethereum ecosystem that is how we position uh our cells ethereum is again when it showed up with its energy with technology this program of blockchain uh uh emerged as as again our best shot to build this web free um the thing that we just realized along the way is that ethereum layer 1 that we originally all used for building applications and trying to realize this this dream that we have is basically highly limited in terms of throughput uh um we can there's only a certain amount of activity that can be that can happen or actually layer one soon enough we realize that in order to actually onboard the masses we of course want to hold more one billion plus people to this uh new global network that we call web free in order to do that ethereum layer one is eventually going to become some sort of uh higher court some sort of uh settlement chains the central component of this wider ecosystem that is actually tier you multi-chain that we believe polygon represents so that being said uh um i cannot transition to say what is polygon we understood that that first thing that ethereum layer one cannot um cannot support this level of activity that we need for for web3 we understood that we have to have the scaling solutions to scale it and we understood also that we are basically in an early phase of building this infrastructure okay so we want to build robust decentralized secure uh eventually probably even private infrastructure that can support one billion plus people that is our goal here if you want to have really a global global network we building such infrastructure takes time it cannot be built overnight this is basically a marathon that we that is what we understood and we will probably get there i don't know i hope in five years maybe in 10 or but definitely is not going to happen this or next year we understood that this is basically right now early phase of innovation in in web free and understanding understood that we decided that the community needs a project like polygon that is supporting all meaningful scaling solutions that is basically a hub of innovation and and r d and in development in general in this field of scaling and infrastructure development ethereum didn't have such a pro project before and we are happy that we managed to start it polygon is an unopinionated platform that supports all major scaling solutions from san diego covered from fully for us scaling ethereum is basically scaling ethereum stack so anything from fully standalone ethereum chains up to fully secured layer tools and hold that spectrum in between is something that we uh are interested in and we are working hard on providing uh that being said we are definitely a little bit biased in the long term towards zk-based solutions uh having been involved with ethereum scaling scenes ever since 2017 i guess when plasma was originally introduced as the first uh formalized scaling i guess approach for for ethereum uh we analyzed all these major approaches to scaling analyze the trade-offs and we believe basically that zk-based solutions are solutions that offer the best set of trade-offs that actually can allow us to to uh um to offer or to satisfy these strict design criterias that the ethereum ecosystem has so ethereum is ethereum as an ecosystem is really making no compromises uh when it comes to these major design principles like decentralization uh security scalability and another important design criteria and with zk tech and privacy of course ultimately with dk tech i believe we have a good chance to to kind of deliver on all these requirements so several months ago we basically announced or formalized that the bias i guess uh by announcing our zkts which is a short basic post that that speaks generally but i just talks about what i said in general now and our commitment to support these dk-based solutions and we also committed uh one billion dollars from our treasury to support all the relevant uh efforts in that in that field since then we introduced a sandeep covered several major uh interesting zk projects zk polygon polygon hermes polygon midan polygon zero and polymer nightfall for now we have a lot of meaningful efforts happening in the background everything from harder acceleration to tooling in z ecosystem etc i don't think we have the time to cover that now but what i would like to say is that with specifically with one of the projects uh polygon hermes basically polygon hermes is uh a zk roll up that is currently live on ethereum mainnet but it supports like all other zika rollouts it supports payments basically like simple uh transaction logic only until i guess six months ago it was uncertain whether it's even possible practically possible to build zk based evm compatible solution and i think with hermes now and several other projects this is becoming the reality and we are very very optimistic now when it comes to results that we have in polygon hermes we basically have the prover already uh in place we don't see any major uh obstacles on the research and design side uh we are very confident now that within i can i can confidently say within three months from now we'll have a test net for full-blown zkvm which is going to be the world's first basically zk evm roll up we are super excited about that and we're preparing a lot of uh auxiliary activities to support that announcement and and hopefully the testing that should happen three months after that roughly again so yes this is something that uh we're very excited uh about and we're working uh around the clock to to build and to deliver and yeah uh for us also one thing that i forgot to mention ethereum compatibility being of course uh integral part of ethereum ethereum compatibility is very important for us we kind of learned that as a project the the hard way i guess we started originally with this ps chain that most of the people are using now which is fully avm compatible and plasma implementation that we have that is that never really took off and the reason it didn't take off it was because it wasn't tv uncompatible to to use it you actually had to uh learn how these plasma predicates work express your application logic using those predicates etc so it was kind of a new paradigm and we understood that there's so much hunger on the developer side and as you can see there's 1200 people here now that want to build their applications they want to use solidity is mainstream already evm is mainstream people want to build their dreams basically they don't want to learn new paradigms like these predicates and whatnot so we learned that kind of lesson i guess and all the solutions at least for now that you're working on are fully avm compatible including this polygon hermes that i'm mentioning so everything you basically learn developing on ethereum and then developing on polygon now polygon pos chain is fully applicable uh for also upcoming polygon hermes and that's something we're also very excited about so you will basically have the same ethereum developer experience like you have on ethereum polygon ps you will have this highly secure robust solution that is polygon hermes and yeah i think i can wrap it up here i mean i could talk i guess a lot more but i hope this was helpful just to put things into perspective and to say it from polygon side we are heads down really working on on more exciting and advanced solutions from our side until then enjoy using uh polygon ps as a super cheap alternative to ethereum and yeah enjoy hacking and thank you so much yeah yeah thank you so much for uh for that amazing overview and uh of course lots more to come in terms of brand new primitives and ease of use for uh how their knowledge proofs will just make all this easier so thanks again for that and uh so i don't have enough time for q a but i'll relay them to you directly and we can relate those answers to our audience uh later so without further ado let's move on to our next talk so i'm super excited for this talk i'm going to bring on ryan pierce to talk about future gaming ryan recently just joined us c at polygon studios and piers heads gaming at delphi digital and uh these two have an amazing chemistry and so many amazing things to talk about here so i'll let pierce kick this off and kind of take over and interview ryan and without further ado i'd like to welcome both of them here thank you for joining us thanks a lot kartik um yeah super excited to kick this one off uh ryan uh you've now officially joined the dark side of crypto so i'm excited to be able to chat on that side of things so um yep perhaps you could kick us off with just a sort of general intro a bit about you um and sort of what led you to where you are now yeah thanks uh so i'm the ceo of polygon studios i think this is actually the first time i've said it out loud in a formal setting so exciting to do that pierce um i'm in kind of a transition phase right now juggling both roles i'm making sure uh as the former head of gaming at youtube that i unwind and leave them in good hands and uh transitioning up working with the studios team and it's been great like what what a fun experience looking forward to diving in more and more with that team but that's what i'm up to and you're right um i've long wanted to jump in full time into the web three world and come to the dark side to your point so i'm excited uh excited to do it absolutely um yeah perhaps you could sort of like uh tell us a little bit about sort of why polygon um you know where the decision came from and kind of what what the whole process looked like yeah no it's a great question i spent um so i spent almost seven and a half years at youtube and i started the gaming vertical there right and so when i joined youtube we had uh we were just under a billion users on the platform gaming was this really you know emerging vertical and uh they didn't have a team to kind of work on it so i joined the organization as the head of gaming and started to build out the team build up the vision and build up the strategy and i loved it right because in the early days you know i was a esports player and commentator and broadcaster and streamer and a lot of people back then would be like look who wants to watch people play video games right so i i kind of took that on as like uh i think people are going to enjoy this and so i spent the next 10 years of my life really focusing on that business growing the creator economy and so forth and so what happened was i started to spend you know i i i you know i i prided myself on knowing the gaming industry really well and then all of a sudden you know blockchain gaming comes up and it kind of hits me like a ton of bricks and i'm like wait what is what is this you know i was not leaned into d5 was not this like huge area of interest for me i wasn't like totally inundated with crypto and so i started sitting down and looking at this and i'm like wow you know this kind of like it really was uh very enlightening to say the least and so as i started to spend more time with people in the industry more time on it i was like this is such a fascinating space i feel like i really want to spend more time in it and it largely led me to spending more time you know back back in in early august with the uh the polygon team and just like spending time working with them and seeing what they're up to and you know such a hard-working group of individuals that have a chip on their shoulder that is buildings really something special uh on ethereum and so it really was like look like let's figure out how we can do more of this and how i can kind of join and one thing led to another and and now i'm i'm excited to jump in and lead our studios team super exciting yeah maybe you could talk to us a little bit about um you know what the sort of immediate objectives are for you and the team at polygon studios what's the next sort of six or 12 months look like for you guys yeah look there's a lot there's the the best part about kind of this industry is um it's you know it's fast paced it's growing there's no shortage of things to do i laugh you know some deep and i were talking the other day and he said yeah it's really easy to know crypto if you can spend 16 hours a day reading right and so you know a lot of what i want to do is get really acclimated with the organization first and foremost they've done a lot of great partnerships you saw us announced you know us doing stuff with uh you know nfl in ticketmaster you saw us doing something with 100 thieves the esports organization so that studios team has has been doing a really great job and a lot of work and so it's like how do we actually add fuel to the fire i think it'll be really great to to stand up our organization and hire for really key roles that we have so we want to continue to bring web to folks that are enlightened and have uh you know red pill if you will and are ready to come over and join this movement um and so i think what you'll start to see is a lot of like marquee hires come over to the studios team over the next couple months and then really it's us working as a collective group about what is our vision what do we want to accomplish what's our messaging externally and internally how do we make sure we have more operational and organizational rigor how do we make sure we're showing up big at events where you know gamers and game developers are coming together how are we making sure that we can better streamline and support non-gaming initiatives whether it's prada and adidas or so forth so it's really like you know you have this blank canvas because there's such a huge appetite and demand to already work and build on polygons network so how do we actually just add you know a really strong partnerships team to that and a really strong brand identity to it and make sure that as people come in they're excited to build on polygon they're choosing polygon because it's the best place to build on and uh that's what we're really focused on and we definitely believe we're going to accomplish that vision and more now it's super cool and very exciting to hear you know there's more red pilling of web 2 folks coming i'm going to bring them i'm bringing them over left and right believe me i think like you know the funny thing is um i think people like look they worry that you know they're interested in it but they don't know everything about it and i think a lot of uh people don't realize that there's a tremendous amount of humility in the web 3 industry of like we all don't know everything about it and everybody has different skill sets everybody is learning every day there's so much that's happening in this space to keep up on and so i think what you're starting to see is people naturally wanting to come over but not know how best to do it or what role they have to play in this world and so as you start to have these conversations with web 2 folks and you see what they've been able to build it's like no no that's exactly the skill set we need to bring over into web3 like make the jump it's going to be worth your while we as a collective industry are building something really special here um and i think i love just like the overall spirit you know i i'm working at you know former role in in big tech highly competitive you know what what are we doing against amazon what are we doing against facebook and even though this there's competition that's happening in web 3 really the spirit of the community is like we're building something special together as a group here and so it's just as much more like of collaborative and so i think people are not used to operating in an industry like that even in the games industry where it's hyper competitive between an activision blizzard and an ea and an ubisoft you see so much more collaboration and just like positive vibes and i think you know that is the spirit of like you know we're gonna make it and all of this you know and so i i think like people as as they get introduced from webtoon to web3 are naturally going to continue to lean in and i think we're going to get a lot of great talent from that industry to come over and build this thing absolutely i love it um and what would you say then i guess from your time at youtube and perhaps beyond like with some of the cool like learnings that you you feel like you're gonna be able to bring across and kind of you know sort of put to work over here curious how sort of that translates into this into this whole new world of web three there's a lot i think like at youtube um you know learning how to build apps that you know in products that scale across a variety of the creator economy so we built a lot of stuff that in at first was like made for gamers right and with gaming creators and gaming users in mind and we find out a lot of that ends up being broadly applicable so standing up products and being able to scale them is a really important learning uh that i had over the last seven years um you know i think how basically how to set up a a world-class organization that generates billions in revenue for the company you know gaming being one of the the largest verticals at youtube um how we set our strategy how we market ourselves how we you know how you handle competition right you know youtube is no stranger to significant competition in the space with facebook and twitch and the deals that are being done there in the creator economy so i think there's a lot of actually um there's a lot that i learned at youtube that had that that resembles what is needed in this field and and how we're going to continue to build out the organization at polygon studios and so i'm looking forward to kind of like taking a lot of those um those growing pains and learning lessons that we had uh and look it's a little bit different because like i said when we started when i started youtube we were just cracking a billion users and we're well over two billion now so a lot of what i've learned is how to how to take a platform from one billion to two billion but it'll be fun to figure out how we take it from you know uh uh you know 50 million to 100 million to a billion and that's actually what gets me really excited about this space is i think the one billion to two billion was quite quite the quest in and and path and i think those learnings will actually really help us accelerate our timeline to how do we just get a billion people you know on crypto and and you know working on the ethereum network and all of that so i'm excited i love it you heard it here first polygon for a billion users not too long they're lucky to have you um yeah that's the dream you know that's where we're gonna get to and i think everybody is everybody is um certainly aligned and and running in the right direction and everybody has a role to play in that you know from the developers themselves to the to the people that are working every day at polygon and then curious for your thoughts at sort of a higher level about where we're at in the evolution of these um you know the intersection of sort of blockchain and gaming um how do you reflect how do you think about uh you know is this really a new sort of genre of game a new type of game like what are the sort of uh you know differences what are the things that jump out to you about you know blockchain gaming versus what came before is this like yeah i want to rip one of you because i i i want to hear also i'm going to like i want to hear kind of your perspective on it i look at it this way look at the end of the day when you're developing a game no matter what like take the idea of blockchain outside of it you have to make a really good game like first and foremost there is so much capital being deployed into the gaming ecosystem you are seeing a lot of these big macro level acquisitions that are happening across take two and microsoft and so forth so there's just a lot of money being put into game development and so because of that there's like a lot more optionality for gamers to go play any kind of game that you could ever imagine and it's great that's why you have two and a half billion people on this planet that are playing games in some way shape or form and obviously across that spectrum it can be super casual of like my mom playing candy crush at the airport all the way to like me being a hardcore like tactical shooter player right and everything in between um the great thing about the gaming industry is there's something for everybody and i think that opens up this aperture of users participating in it and it's almost like gaming is going to just be like synonymous with entertainment and culture everybody's going to do it in some way shape or form and i don't know if we'll even call it video games long term so when i think of like what's unique about like blockchain gaming it's like making a really great game first and foremost is important and then i think opening up this economy where you can play and earn and you can do all of these things with inside of it you can have a governance token you can own your actual and have like true genuine digital ownership you have resale value there there's like you're really democratizing development in a lot of different ways and so i think yes it's like a little bit of a cop-out but it's like yes it is it's a new subsection and a lot of the counter arguments you always hear is like yeah you could do it with you know a a centralized sql database and these things that kind of already exist look at diablo 3 auction house yada yada right but the the fact of the matter is there's really not a lot of games that are plugging into what does it look like when you have these free open economies in marketplaces and so it's becoming really easy to build those you know uh uh in web3 and so i think what you're going to see is people yes they're going to make these high quality games first and foremost but they're really going to start to think about okay i have another tool at my disposal to make a great game because i'm building on the blockchain what what does that actually mean for me and like what can i actually do with that so i'm interested to see i think you're going to see a convergence of a lot of these different things and the other thing to you know be mindful of is over time like people take it takes time to make high polished aaa games you're seeing a lot of these projects of really talented developers leaving activision blizzard leaving raya leaving ea leaving ubi to start their own companies and they're getting funded to do it and they are at you know their aspirations are to build these like beautiful high polish games and those are on the horizon we haven't even seen them yet and so i do think there will be a pretty meaningful shift of players moving into games uh you know blockchain based games and you're going to see that over the next three to four years i i i look i'd love to see you know you yourself are like at such a great intersection of this of what you're doing between bitcraft and delphia like what's your thoughts on what this unblocks in the gaming space yeah i mean i think the part that excites me the most still is definitely obviously this whole thing is a spectrum right degree of integration of these technologies we're going to see a lot of very high polished games that are exciting that do like pretty vanilla nft integrations for you know pure cosmetic non-balance impacting stuff cool fine new way to monetize new way for people to engage that stuff super exciting but i think this whole new like you know further out to the right end of the spectrum this whole new sort of um it's like what is like uniquely enabled by you know leveraging these technologies for the first time right i think the way you can like sort of start to build things where there's this kind of emergent gameplay in a really interesting way and like literally the community picks up some kind of you know base that's been built around these things and like just runs with them in such interesting ways so a lot of the stuff i've seen around on chain gaming things like dark forest and all the stuff that ox park is doing um that kind of stuff excites me enormously um it's like you know the community is um playing a material like front seat role in the world building itself after the developers kind of define the parameters and like primitives for those game worlds and whilst we're like you know probably a decade away from those things like the concept of one chain gaming reaching the stage where you know you can do it with any kind of graphical complexity or anything like that that stuff's really exciting to me um and i do think you know the the when we can build ecosystems where there's like meaningful community governance and you know people can actually like help drive the game in interesting ways and contribute to it that stuff's really exciting to me because we just don't really see a great equivalent um you know in terms of what came before so we'll see it'll take time i'm here for it though i'm most excited about things you know trying to ask the question like what can we do now that we couldn't before like in a very meaningful way so we'll see what comes with that we'll see and it's kind of like you know you what what we see now is is simply just scratching the surface of the possibilities and i feel like you know when you look at conversations publicly are happening where there's like strong kind of um it's very polarizing on just the topic of nfts right for a variety of reasons and i think as we're able to as a collective industry illustrate more complex examples of what like nfts can do and what blockchain gaming can do and point to those examples publicly and say like this is it like this is why we were excited because i think right now it's very hard for those that are not really in the industry it's very hard to articulate that vision in a way that makes sense and is coherent you know to somebody that like is not you know that might be like very foreign to this concept um and there's obviously a lot of things that are going to happen between now and then we'll address some of the more macro issues environmental concerns and carbon footprint and so forth but i agree with you i think like game development takes on a whole life of its own uh when you start to look out four five six years from now i do think to your point it's like right now when when when developers are looking at like how how do we really harness our community they're doing it like via twitter or reddit posts when you can actually make genuine product decisions and game decisions at a macro level because of governance like that's a really cool participation or to your point like games that evolve because you're like able to democratize development of a game and really you just are kind of setting the parameters to your point and letting letting the community run free this changes the way games are inherently played right now in a whole different way i also think too um these shifts and user bases that will be coming over and participating in these you know ecosystems and games is going to materially change the way free to play is looked at right because i do think you're going to see a shift of you know for better for lack of better terms you know whales that are participating and really hold up free-to-play games right it's like a combination of people with money and a combination of people with time when you start to see the player base that is actually investing heavily into these games start to find equivalent games that are blockchain based that is really going to change like the the the entire industry and i think it will require then aaa publishers to really re-evaluate what kind of games are they making how are they making them and how they should be participating the other thing too is like not every game needs to be a blockchain based game so we don't have to deal with like absolutes on these conversations it's like i you know i don't want my son to have to worry about like you know buying ethereum and playing you know playing in a like a volatile economy or anything of that nature when he's like seven years old right like there are games that are going to be much more well designed and so i think the other thing in these conversations are people too largely are dealing in absolutes when having these conversations it's okay to like have a unique subsection of the gaming industry where this is happening 100 and like you know we often hear pushback around even just the notion of governance and games right like the community is never going to make good decisions like you know handing over the parts of the development roadmap so there's gonna be a car crash like again that's not binary it's not like one or the other there's like this intermediate scenario where you know you have things like delegated governance right there are people that emerge from the community which other players recognize as really dial into what's happening in terms of direction of travel how the economy is evolving and they might be willing to basically you know delegate their votes to these people who act as like representatives of the player base to you know help coordinate these decisions and stuff i totally agree it's not about absolutes it's like everyone assumes it's always binary when it's not i think we'll uh i think we'll find a healthy middle ground on it um and that stuff takes time and like even a democratic approach to like what you're talking about like almost like elected officials within communities that are the ones i mean like i love that right i think that's like a great like that is you could never have something like that in today's environment and these are the things that are going to come up and i feel the more that we can kind of talk about these really unique opportunities the more it like it creates really interesting thought processes for developers and then in turn they make great products that users are going to be able to like you know genuinely enjoy and love and and i feel we are just cracking the surface of that yep totally and it's super exciting to think about because obviously all these different games over the years like mainly these random rpgs and whatnot have these legendary players that emerge right you had zesma and runescape and whatnot like everyone loved that dude they still do all these years on including me um if he you know he was so dialed into how the game was evolving and whatnot obviously was grinding maximum all the first levels like that's exactly the kind of person that can meaningfully contribute to the world building that's going on right and people will be willing to support again almost like an elected official so anyway lots of fun design design space there um i wanted to double click a bit though on uh you know the current state of things the current lay of the land in terms of the absolutely shocking backlash that we've seen in in so many scenarios around um you know just sort of broader game of populations i wonder you know where you think it comes from and how we get past this because it definitely seems to be a major obstacle currently yeah look i obviously have spent a lot of time on it you know like i you know made this jump from youtube over to polygon knowing that you know there is a lot of controversy around the topic of nfts i think there's a there's a lot to unpack there i think one um sometimes it's like i question how much of it is a like you know vocal minority for one like two i'll give you an example the hundred thieves drop was yesterday they did it they did it on polygon they came out with communications they didn't use even nft as a term they came out with communications that like the carbon footprint for a redemption is like the equivalent of two emails right that they had a quarter in the time window was only a couple hours it was open to redeem it it was free right so like that you know take that with a green assault but they had a quarter of a million people redeem it right so it's like okay there's something here i think there's a little bit of like web 3 maximalism speaking past hardcore gamers hardcore gamers are notoriously known for digging in they have done it on a variety of things like i even think of when i first started at youtube gaming it was like you'll never be able to be in like gaming video like twitch is supreme and rules all right now i think the messaging has changed a little bit on that right and so people come along look at like the resistance against free to play there's a lot of misunderstanding around you know like look you think about like mining right people still remember when they couldn't get a a graphics card because of bitcoin miners so there's understandably a sour taste and gamer's mouth for what some of the behaviors have happened you can look at nft projects that you're getting rugged or you're getting scammed on those definitely exist right you can look at like you're not in the nft space and you see like an ape going for a half million dollars you're like what is this right and so i think there's a lot of understandable uncertainty and misinformation that is kind of fueling this like strong resistance behind it right um a lot of this isn't going to be solved in dialogue and communications right like i can talk to people to on blue and face about this and talk about opportunity if you don't want to listen to it or you're so strongly adamant against it it's not going to make much progress the one thing that is tried and true and over time always wins is if you have a really great product and users want to and want to play in that product that will prevail and so i think a lot of what we as an industry need to do is worry less about that that you know one we should be listening have empathy for the counterpoint of view but i think a lot of is develop great products and people will come to them over time um and i do think it's a little bit of marketing and messaging like i think we do need to understand like i i i go back to that hundred thieves example because they nailed it right they threaded the needle there they get ahead of this conversation it's about how you land that messaging that's really important the other thing too it's like you have had people that are just jamming this like idea of nfc into like a game right and i don't think that works well either right it's like people want to be able to play the game that they've been playing because they've enjoyed it you don't need to just throw over and like put that game on the blockchain like people care about these open economies and marketplaces people care about governance some people just want to play a chill video game and that's cool too right so i think over time some of this stuff will will settle itself out and i'll be honest with you like i really i'm like zero bothered by it like i do not i listen i have a really i feel like a really good understanding of the counterpoints i'm empathetic to that i think there's a lot of work as an industry we need to do because they're valid counterpoints we shouldn't be dismissive of it we shouldn't be elitist about whatever we're building but i think it's really important to like keep your head down and build and and hear some of those concerns adjust your adjust accordingly but keep building it and show great examples no love that love that um yeah wanted to touch on before we before we got to wrap up um sort of where your head's at i mean i'm always skeptical of predictions but to the extent you might be willing to share some thought just on you know both the intersection of crypto and gaming and just gaming more broadly like sort of where we're headed um how you're viewing that trajectory obviously you've had pretty unique insight into it after you're sort of uh you know youtube career and now uh now digging in on the web three sides so curious where your head's at yeah i mean i would say anybody that says they know where we're going i would not trust and would call him a liar flat out i think the beauty of all of this is we're building the plane that's already in flight and we're going to figure out where it takes us and where we land and i think that's the excitement about why we're in this industry um it's it's anyone's best guess i do think though you're going to see like i said like kind of touching on this point like your people are going to continue to be shown great examples and you're going to start to usher in more people into this space you have a lot of gen like gen z is kind of ruling the world right now and they look at gaming as their number one form of entertainment they look at gaming as their number one form of social community a lot of them are purchasing crypto it's becoming really easier to do uh as far as access i think regulation is gonna be more than welcomed right like obviously we all have opinions on what does that mean but it takes away like the ambiguity of it right and provides much more clear guidelines i think you're gonna start to see that and this convergence over the next like 24 to 36 months is going to lead to like just more people being crypto native right they're going to be really familiar they're going to come into these games and these apps and experiences and totally get it right now it's like dude you know trying to explain to somebody that doesn't get like you know how you set up a metamask like what is all of this like what is this versus this right like what's l1 versus l2 explaining that to people that are not spending time in that space you know it's the moon to them right but all of that like the education and evangelizing is going to change and so i think where you're going to see is in two or three years we are going to stop having these like conversations about onboarding and educating and i think there's going to be so many like crypto native people it'll be such common knowledge in this net this younger generation of gen z that are going to be you know inevitably in five to ten years will be key decision makers at big companies and and be leading big roles and i think a lot of it will become abundantly more clear i also think you you look at from a regulation perspective it's a lot of you know i don't want to say boomers but it is that that this is a while this is wild to wrap their head around right and so you're gonna also see millennials start to come into powers and positions politically that understand a lot of this much much better and much and can articulate it much more clearly and so i think a lot of them there's a lot of really positive long-term tailwinds that are starting to happen and i just think it's not easy for everybody to see it but i think we're starting to see like a great convergence and we have really great leaders across the web 3 industry that are able to articulate and help bring these people along so yeah my prediction is like it will not feel like the wild wild west in just two or three years time and there will be a lot more like certainty around the space much more appreciation around the sp space and much more understanding absolutely yeah i know couldn't agree more on the uh you know the web 3 sort of um proponents who are very articulate and concise around this stuff i think they're doing a great job but sort of a you know laying down a potential playbook for regulators etc um that's still one of the things that keeps me up at night uh you know obviously i firmly believe the vast majority of economic activity is still going to happen in regulated markets but i'm i'm still concerned that maybe they'll be in like an over extension right because that tends to happen when people feel when regulators feel like things are getting away from them a bit so we'll see how that evolves uh my fingers are crossed um you and me i'm i'm cautiously optimistic my friend yeah yeah absolutely um so yeah before we wrap wanted to wanted to also um basically give you the opportunity to sort of share any advice i guess you give people coming into the space uh whether that's developers people personally professionally um you know idle curiosity you uh you tell me yeah uh look i think now is a great time to jump in you know again don't be afraid that you don't know everything right like a lot of people like we are all learning things are changing every single day this industry is you know rapidly evolving um if you're sitting on the sidelines and you're looking for an opportune or perfect time to jump in it never does exist right so make the jump there are so many jobs open across web3 i mean it is absurd like polygon studios we've got like 15 or 20 roles open right now across polygon there's like probably over a hundred you know so no better time to build there's a lot of capital no better time to raise money to start a company so if you're an entrepreneur go start it you you know there's a lot of funding coming out into this space if you want to be a builder and and just like you know work in this industry there's a ton of job openings we need all the help we can get across web3 there's so many different opportunities you will learn as you go and so don't be afraid to build don't be afraid to join the initiative and i think like there's never been a better time than now to do so so i i give everybody as much encouragement i personally have made the jump and like i can tell you only even a couple days into it i couldn't be happier that i did and i'm like ecstatic that i made the jump over and honestly i can't imagine a world where i didn't at this point already so uh come come come we'll take everybody i love it how's that from cool to action to wrap on um brian it's always a pleasure chatting i'm super excited that you're uh you know diving in uh full time in the space now and um yeah i'm super excited to see how this whole sort of landscape evolves how polygon involves with you at the helm so um thanks thanks a lot for making the time yeah likewise thanks everybody take care ryan pierce thanks so much and it was a perfect note to end on yeah thank you thanks again next up we are ready for our next talk and when i invite justin khan for a an interview i want to take this opportunity to kind of welcome him and introduce him most of you know justin as the co-founder of twitch but as of recently justin is ceo and founder of fractal so we're going to cover a handful of things around how this event is going um and a few things that i think you are uniquely suitable to kind of give your insights on and uh we'll kind of jump right in welcome thanks for having me how are you i am doing great i kind of did a poor job at describing uh your background so um what i'll do is i'll let you kind of give us a quick overview of sort of what fractal is and sort of how you got to it and uh and your journey from kind of twitch to to where you are now sure yeah so i've been an internet entrepreneur and investor for the last uh 18 years now kind of started my career right as uh web 2 was kicking off and built a lot of different companies the one that people know about is twitch which started off as us building our own streaming platform actually us trying to build our own streaming show first and then turning it into a platform and then eventually really focusing that platform on gaming and it turned out to be much bigger than we ever thought and uh we sold twitch to amazon in 2014 and after that i've been investing in companies incubating companies and most recently been really interested in crypto and 3 and a couple months ago i started working on a new project called fractal and the high level of fractal is fractal is a marketplace for digital in-game assets so uh gaming nfts uh i think there's this huge wave coming of gaming you know blockchain games that are all reaching you know a new capital market new player base through selling the assets digitally and we want to power that revolution you know so that's that's what we're doing that you introduced me as a ceo but my co-founder dave is actually the ceo and i'm uh you know i found it with him in an amazing team um well i apologize for that um this is great um i do want to dig into fractals or how you sort of landed on this idea but maybe um i'd love to kind of learn more about just sort of why or how did you decide to jump in now into crypto obviously i think you've been exposed to this space for for a handful of years so i'm curious to kind of get your background when did you kind of hear about crypto when did it become interesting from a hobby to sirius and what that experience was like yeah well i think i first heard about bitcoin pretty quickly i mean it was like 2011 something like that but i you know i was kind of like it was an experiment you know i think it's probably illegal it's like i don't know if it's gonna work so i didn't pursue it all and then in 2013 was when i first started buying bitcoin because i sounds like you know the price i think that was one of the first price run-ups and i was trying to invest in coinbase and my friend brian's company and kind of missed proceed around by someone goes just gonna kill me you know so i uh i bought some at like 800 which is and immediately crashed like 200 and i was like i'm like literally the bag holder i'm just i'm such a sucker uh and then i just forgot about it you know and so then obviously like years later the price was accelerating again and i was like okay you know something's here this thing has existed for years now um and i saw ethereum come and start to get some traction and i was like i don't know what's gonna work here so i just invested in some crypto fonts like i will be a few crypto funds that turned out to be a pretty good idea but as a programmer i was like i don't know if any of this stuff is going to work for the type of thing that i like to do which is you know consumer based applications and really see kind of like a high transaction throughput application being able to work and so i actually at the time became an advisor a few people building projects that were applications one was called audios uh which is you know like a decentralized music app platform and but i was like still like i don't know if this is going to work technically and then it was really about a year ago where all them builder you know launched their application and it was you know pretty streamlined application like you as a user who just goes to audio code you don't have to know anything about to like try out about the whole thing running in this decentralized way and that was very inspirational to me so that was like made me think okay this is you know this is something that's gonna work and at the same time another friend built this project uh called brain trust which i think is on polygon actually and it's a decentralized platform for work and um you know i saw them get a huge amount of traction by distributing their their token to this community of freelancers uh and you know that's started under here's the power of of um you know sharing ownership among your community and it occurred to me that if we created twitch today we would do it you know in a as a decentralized form um because which is something that created this tremendous amount of value and a lot of that was captured in the form of you know kind of uh partner payments or sat you know for streaming right to the streamers but the streamers didn't have any way to like invest in the upside of the of the company or the project so uh that got me really excited about researching ideas and understanding like markets you know and you just like start getting excited about building something oh that's amazing i think you uh you already set up the base for the rest of the questions i had because this covers in all these themes and uh and it's interesting because obviously the last talk also covered kind of how we think crypto will change gaming or just weaponry in general and uh well my kind of first question to you here is um was it specifically a timing thing or was it just that you guys are more naturally excited about gaming and just that as a frontier because there's experience with twitch they realize that's where the biggest opportunity is and kind of how do you kind of think about gaming versus ownership and are they the same to you as you kind of thought about starting fractal yeah so i think there was probably like a timing of when you know there's a bunch of infrastructure now you know like uh solana or polygon or like there's all this infrastructure make uh i would say a higher transaction throughput application happen right in crypto and um those are the apps like things that are more consumer focused are probably one i'm naturally interested in you know the d5 stuff is like very interesting but it's not really my area where i'm like okay that's something i want to pursue as my job you know so um for me i think that there was this timing where the technology like now plays for creating something that's you know things that can be like used by normal people and that was very exciting to me um so gaming specifically i think you know i've watched this whole nft uh rise and was a very tiny investor in open sea and it was like this is you know really interesting and so how inspired huge boons art market and uh is a way that creators can you know now like a new business model for creators so that was really exciting and i think you know the next wave of nfts is pretty clearly to me it's like entities that have some form of utility and gaming is very natural as a place for that to start because you know the idea that digital assets and gaming have value has been something that's you know 25 night concepts it's like 25 years old you know i played ultima online when i was in the 90s i was in high school and i used to sneak downstairs and play with my mind like from like midnight like 5am when my parents were asleep and uh you know that game was like people were buying and selling stuff in that game like on ebay back then people uh you know other people weren't players were mind blown that anyone would value this stuff but you know now that's become the predominant business model of gaming is uh selling stuff in the game you know whether that's skins and in fortnight or or counter-strike or like um other types of assets it's like that's that's how people um that's how gaming companies monetize now and so to me the next step the national extension is like making that economy from a closed one to an open one uh and giving the like ownership of those assets to the players so that they can not just buy them but they can also sell them or trade them that to me is like a very obvious evolution that is going to happen over the next 10 years in gaming i absolutely agree and i think this kind of kind of opens up a whole series of questions around just how do you think gaming and web3 would be like so my kind of first question there is do you kind of believe that using blockchains or just different parameters in crypto is just a different abstraction to how games are built right now or do you think crypto games will be inherently entirely different from what we see from all these studios well it'd probably be a blend i think that you know crypto in gaming or web gaming is like a it's a mix of different things right like different innovations one of the innovation is it's access to a new capital market it's like a new funding model right um where you're selling a set of nfts or or other digital tokens to an audience of early supporters and those people are oftentimes before you have a game those people are basically pre-funding the game and you know they've done that for a long time you've had games like star citizen or something that that are starting to solve where they've raised 400 million dollars now in terms of uh platformer i have like players get the opportunity to have some sort of real ownership in the asset so if the game is successful maybe they're you know their assets increase in value but you know they get something and uh so that's one part of it i think another part is um kind of like this putting the stuff on the blockchain makes it open and programmable and so um there's going to be this open ecosystem where games you know create their assets as nfts and and then other people like make experiences on top of them and as a program that's what i'm particularly excited about it's like the opportunity to um kind of like connect all of this stuff that's online and like and i think people will invent new and interesting ways um and like experiences and utility that that can sit on top of the nfts that are created for these games and metaverses and i'm really excited for that future yeah no i i think that's one of those things where we kind of officially unlocked that world and uh being able to see different universes that have the same basis is an incredible theme that i think we're just seeing very basic implementation applications of so we haven't even seen that to uh to full capacity yet um i'm curious to kind of hear your thoughts on sort of what are some interesting ideas either you've come across or what you would like to see that actually take this level of composability um to some interesting experiences yeah well there's some like very obvious ones you know like i was just talking to founders of this company web with two bees and they you know they let you take in your digital avatar from other pfp projects and like they render them as they have like a they run them them as um like a 2d sprite and you could like use this you know as your avatar in this 2d world right like it's kind of like an 8-bit uh realm like metaverse and um so it's like kind of like an obvious one i know other people are working on that uh as well for their their various pfp projects which is doing something like that as well uh so they're that's fractals fractals 100 000 uh fractals so these are unique uh digital snowflakes with attributes and they belong to different factions uh with different rarities and then there's you have like you know velocity and spin altitude and we kind of thought of it as to be like a gaming primitive on top of which people could build various experiences so it's everything from very simple things like you know certain fractals getting uh whitelist access to buy into certain sales but then it's also like um people building experiences like special levels or tournaments or events for fractal holders all the way through like different cosmetic pickup grades within their golden fractal and so um i'm just starting to see that happen right now and that's you know i think it's excited about is the stuff that i can't even i'm not even imagining right now you know because when something's open or programmable like people are going to create new stuff that you never would have guessed exist fair enough um no 100 um in terms of kind of kind of contrasting that with what's happening on the web 2 side um we obviously all of us are excited about sort of gaming becoming a really nice way to uh bring in millions if not hundreds of millions more people in uh because they understand how that works uh it's a clear engage audience but when we talk about mass adoption um do you do you think it's do you think scalability or maybe the transaction costs are the only bearers to entry like how would you kind of think about what's preventing right now from getting like 100 more million people trying out what three games from you know uh the last talk nailed it where it's like it's all about product and it's all about ui ux right um so it's it's really how can you like that's one of the innovations with twitch and justin tv before i like we you know there was streaming on the internet before but we made it like really easy and like have to install any plug-in or anything like that so i think that you know what i what i'm excited about is people are creating more ways for uh crypto to be easier to onboard you know uh that could look like different things it might be you know custodial wallets for example or um it's there's there's like i feel like there's a lot of things that that games can do to make the ui ux just like much simpler in terms of like how do you onboard and actually provide some of that uh like make it like provide some of those rails for for users and so i think games are are a good way to do that because people are you know the games like the gaming industry is like highly optimized in terms of you know getting players on and like making sure that marketing dollars are very efficient and so um i feel like that could be that is potentially a way that um millions and tens of millions of users get onboarded into into crypto in that world do you do you um how do you kind of think about the trade-offs between the abstractions needed to sort some of those ux barriers versus kind of compromising on anywhere from decentralization to the end user owning the underlying asset i think i feel like usually we've seen them at different ends of the same kind of rope and um right it's a trade-off right there's a trade-off between uh abstractions that are forms of centralization versus decentralization right and i think there's the question is like how much not every app needs to be fully decentralized i mean there's probably some you know evangelists who believe that to be the case um you know they're uh but that that's you know that that's the um i think that's true right like so if you're moving huge amounts of money in db5 and then perhaps you really care about the decentralization and sovereignty but if you know you're playing a game where the stakes are much lower perhaps you're willing to at first try that game in a way like where you load it through a custodial while it's provided by the game so you don't know anything about you know you don't have to know anything about um you know uh decentralization at all or crypto at all and then once you maybe if you're very invested in that game you're investing a lot of capital tokens a time whatever then you can you know take that sovereignty back and like put you know take that wallet once you're like you understand what's going on you know and so i think where when people create these applications uh you know there's a little bit of user of a trade-off a user trade-off i mean coinbase is a great example you know they've onboarded you know tens of millions of users into crypto and um you know there's a off there because you're using you know most of those users are custodying their their uh crypto at coinbase right and and you don't have to expect everybody to kind of do this too and they as long as they have a choice um they get to kind of pick the experience they want either as well um no i agree does that matter to you for for fractal or how do you kind of envision people who are practical users kind of experience this i think what's interesting about nft is like in general and then gaming nfts is that by putting to something on a blockchain it's effectively like it's almost like an asset backed by blockchain right um a lot of these assets you know they're not going to be successful if the game itself is not successful they don't create a client that like does something with this asset and so it is there's a point of centralization that's really important right which is his initial game eventually maybe the set of assets will become big enough that they exist beyond one game experience and so they have like some durable value there but i think the blockchain component at first as like a weight if people uh you know it's kind of like how the us dollar was backed by gold and that that might be people confidence to invest in this as a currency to use it right uh and you know but actually from that there's probably different philosophical views on good idea or not but i think of that you know the the the idea that you put your ass that's a watch i think is this way to give people confidence and like they have ownership and and software that gives them the you know plays you know to participate in the in this market or this economy this game uh ecosystem and um so i you know to me that's like that's kind of like the important part you know it's it's almost like uh it's more ideological than it is technology actually i think that's a really interesting way to kind of think about it um i i guess in that in that world it's sort of related but not my director related but do you feel like the nature of everything being able to be priced or or resold or or repackaged in some form whether it's creatively or not um affects kind of the nature of the games themselves do you think everything becomes too transactional and people don't play things for fun because they think there's money to be made or not made or lost or sold here and and do you think the second we started battling everything that ideally we couldn't to the full extent in the web too uh kind of any from ruins to it diminishes the the gaming experience well i have two thoughts on that one is that since before you know a couple years ago before the running blockchain games games were primarily played for fun right there's probably a scale of like you know and they were mostly fun and maybe there was a little bit of economic activity you know there were a few people who were selling world of warcraft gold on ebay or something but mostly people were playing for fun 99 of players and then now you know with blockchain games in these early games like actually infinity like maybe people are playing more you know there's a huge contingent of people are playing as a job right and um maybe if they're you know if they weren't able to make money off of it they wouldn't play the game or some percentage of them wouldn't play the game i think what that as the games you know what will happen is the games will shift back to be more fun most people will be playing for fun like maybe 80 and then 20 of it will be like oh i can you know i do have like i can if i want to play different game i can like sell the stuff in this game right like it you know there's some economic component of it but it's not their like primary reason for participating in this gaming universe i think that's like the end state you know can most people do want to play games for fun i think so that that's kind of we'll see this shift back as the games become you know more gain you know better experiences right we're in this very early phase of blockchain gaming it's kind of like free to play in 2008 where you know like the free play games that we're on like social networks like facebook like these games were more they were viral you know they but there was a lot of criticism of them but because by you know real gamers because real they were saying gamers would say this isn't a fun game like it's a you know wonky business model i don't believe in it uh and you know now 14 years later that's the predominant business model gaming right and you have games that are much more immersive experiences like fortnite that are built on a free-to-play model so i think blockchain is going to go through blockchain games that will go through a similar transition the last thing you said is like the financialization point which i didn't address so you know do games become less fun as like everything becomes has the ability to be financialized within the game um i don't think like in these blockchain games i don't think first of all i don't think like every asset or every interaction will be like something that can be monetized or like turned into an nft you know oftentimes what i've seen is like people are you know there's some core assets and that are nfts in the game like your player or your avatar like some some major things but then there's a lot of stuff that's you know interactions in the game that are not like monetized um and i think that uh with these with these um with these games like it's you know like i kind of think about like the creation of the car the automobile right like in the early 1900s like we created these like cars and people bought them and then there's this whole industry of financialization that popped up around it right like you could get a loan for a car then and then you could uh you can you know rent your car out or like people would buy cars and rent them out at airports or whatever you can like rent your car out on get around and turn it into an asset or you can like get a loan um against your car right like uh and and um use it as collateral and so i think that gaming assets will go through a similar um transition yeah where like gaming assets started off as like you know there's just something you have right you buy to play but then eventually you know if it's something that's valued by other people then you can and it's programmable it's online it's easy to like uh do all this financialization around people will will create all these different you know methods of financialization and that's that's going to be pretty exciting i don't know it's interesting yeah it's good it's a really good analogy because i think i'm also by the way i'm mixing some questions from the audience so for the audience feel free to type any questions and i will be able to ask them in more time with the list of our questions but there's a question around just how do economies work in crypto because we've seen games that have like immensely tweaked and kind of curated economies for how their in-world works but now you get to interact with everything else too so you're basically thinking of a virtual country a set of countries and and all these kind of primaries that we understand real world can be applied we haven't seen them to most extents but it's kind of becoming popular so this car analogy works works really well it's a that's a really good way to think about it i want to kind of get to an interesting point which is our kind of topic here which is understanding the role of existing game studios and what two sort of game publishers we've kind of seen a handful of uh them kind of talk about or hint they're thinking about doing nfts or just think about what in general and it's just going to come with massive resistance from whoever's online basically and and kind of the question is i'm not asking you to comment on any of that but uh it's more of a sort of how do you think they they'd get to adapt what they should adapt or or maybe like what their role becomes in this world like will they be forced to transition do you think we'll just get dethroned by what three native things or just what happens in this this point that we're at yeah i think we've seen this movie before right like with free play like when you know free play started off it was and and then mobile you know like was kind of the next uh was the real catalyst of this like at first all of the new all the successful games were new entrants right it's an innovator's dilemma right it's you know you have these incumbents they're like we're making all this money making games for xbox or pc or whatever do we really care about mobile that's kind of nascent and then new entrance startup you know the zynga's of the world and then people those become successful companies and then like the incumbents are like okay we need to pay attention and i think the same thing will happen with blockchain games where you know the comets get get all this criticism um because their players are like oh that's not serious that's not gaming that's like not what we know right people are resistant to change and so uh they'll be like players will you know someone a traditional company's like oh we're going to sell nfts and then players are like this is a cash grab this is a bad premium there's all these criticisms right and incumbent like new entrants like there's a ton of people who are uh game developers from big studios you know they're from riot or ea or active vision and they're transitioning you know they left their jobs to build something that's a blockchain game and uh they don't have that innovators right they have nothing to lose so they're going to go out and create these new games and then some of those games will become incredibly successful and then in five years you know we'll see the incumbents like kind of just fight the bullet and like they'll they'll participate yeah gotcha and so and i guess if i were to kind of analyze and just see if i can tie this into something you said earlier it seems like one of the things that sort of eases people's kind of opinions on this is if they have a great experience and a great game then sort of makes it easy for somebody just like okay we should consider this and uh and we just haven't seen too many of those moments they're coming and we're seeing hints of what's kind of happening but uh uh seems like it's uh anytime soon kind of kind of the window of opportunity and maybe we'll get a bigger crowd to turn over i mean it's like this this whole industry is like i mean i know actually got started like in 2018 but like it's like one year old really because they you know it started accelerating like a year ago right or maybe 18 months ago something like that so like it takes time to make a game right like if you want to make a good game it takes like a year or more i mean so you know like people these games are coming um if you are in the industry if you like kind of peel back the curtain you're like talking to people in the street there's a tremendous amount of talent that's coming to this industry but you know there's a lag time it's not like uh you know it's like not like you know refractively like conceived of it in november like release it a month later right because it's a website and we were we have an amazing team we built it but we couldn't have built a full aaa game in like a year right so it's going to take some time so i think there's um you know these transitions seem to happen they they seem slow but then they're it'll be all of a sudden i think like so absolutely i have a question from the audience and i'll kind of just uh phrase it out there i think it's a little bit uh abstract so i'll kind of give you room to uh to parse but how do you think about copyright ownership in this world and sort of um do you think that's going to end up either being a barrier or an issue as people think about ips for these assets yeah so obviously you know having just having an nft of something doesn't necessarily uh dictate like doesn't necessitate a certain level of copyright ownership right and i think projects have tried to do different things right um like whether you know maybe they're reserving them maybe they they're they're giving granting those to the empty holder i think what we'll see is like um you know every game is going to want to become a platform with their nfts right or well i i don't know if they know that right now but they will eventually because that answers my prediction yeah if you if you um you know become a platform and and people start building experiences on top of your game or your game nfts then you know you there's the durability of those assets is higher and you know the value of your ecosystem goes up right and so the question is like what legal framework is going to encourage the most of other people building on top of your stuff while preserving value for for you know your ecosystem right i don't know what that is but it probably you know it depends on like if i'm a developer i'm going to build on someone else's ip like what assurances do i need what protections do i need i i think that's what the framework people should be using to think about it it's also an interesting education we just talked about which is of course it's in the best interest for the game to build a platform for their users and kind of get more but they largely also will have a separate parallel universe that's built by others which can equally be more successful or just successful and i don't think we've seen too many of those scenarios in web 2 yet and uh and the times where we've seen that actually just ends with like a clear way for somebody to just kick them off the platform um and we went to those things so i think that's one thing where i just noticed that that that's gonna be a new one where we don't know what that looks like where somebody can build a better platform than you can using your own assets or user base yeah but i mean the point of web3 is that you have a way to benefit from that right if you hold down you're selling nfts you hold back some amount or you're like have a you know open token you're you're holding some in your treasury if you create something that that is an open ecosystem that creates value then you can you can benefit from that and i think that's really interesting because we saw in web too you know as part of that is like there's a lot of promises by um companies saying oh we're an open ecosystem but there was no like way that that was actually you know they had complete control over whether that was true or not right and so that was true until they decided it wasn't true right if you were twitter you could build a client or if you were on twitter you know you could build a client and build all sorts of like different ways that to build on top of twitter until they decided they were like oh this is like actually suboptimal for a business facebook and and singer right like yeah exactly true for facebook i mean it's true for all these platforms and so you know and it's probably only not true for twice because we weren't like early enough to like you know really build it as a platform to be honest so like uh you know i think that like this what's interesting to me about web3 what i love about it is it's it's kind of like there was a way for it to be you to be economically incented to create an open platform right it's primarily the things that are successful are primarily even platforms and it's on the line it's subject to to create the open i think that's important because that's the internet that we want to be part of is one where it's you know you anyone can build on top of what's out there i think i think that's the best for innovation it's the best for the consumer and um yeah i i totally agree i think this is one of those things where um yeah it's going to be hard to imagine what we can't imagine yet and obviously there's a catch in that sentence alone and we're just seeing what people are going to do with this i want to end on our final question uh which is um there's i mean there's over a thousand developers here that are considering going into what three from their existing website jobs and that's not a small number obviously a lot of them are just seeing what's possible it's a two three day hackathon but a lot of them are also concerning full-time and think about what they might be able to do do you have any advice for people who are sort of thinking about getting into web 3 kind of comparing this with your transition or anything you want to think about for how they should think about building businesses here what would you kind of tell them yeah well first of all you should come work attractively so the fact of that i asked you hit me on my twitter dms but um you know i mean seriously if you're you're not working on web3 yet uh i just like don't know what you're doing i mean it's like very obvious to me that this is the most exciting part of the internet um i think there's a lot of innovation like when i started in web 2 it was like um like it was like we were just redefining like how people were defining how people would interact socially on the internet uh back in you know 2005 2006 2007 2008 and now it's like we're you know it's being defined how people will uh regard value on on the internet and that's pretty cool like it's it's it's um it's a place where you can experiment and and see what happens i mean there's obviously all these like financial motivations to do it as well but like i think for me i'm someone who's always primarily followed my curiosity and that's why i'm excited about web3 uh so you know i would do it for sure and then just like it's a great time to get started um you know there's plenty of companies to work for lots of different places to innovate i think one good area to look is like what are the marketplaces markets that will be disrupted by distributing the value to a large group of people that's kind of how i was thinking about it when i kind of came up with with fractal so yeah good luck awesome well justin thank you so much for your time and uh really appreciate this amazing thank you great thanks um and with that we are ready for our next talk so without further ado i'd like to welcome effie ball and jonathan click um to come on and uh have this amazing chat about what is happening with universe around here i want to quickly do a brief introduction and i'll let jonathan uh take over from there but matthew ball he's the ceo of papillion and it's a reverse focused holding company which invests and advises in c2a stage growth companies and he also created uh round hill ball um metaverse etf um in collaboration with jonathan and jonathan invests in the intersection of metaverse and public protocols and he's also an advisor to many of the world's largest media companies support leagues and blockchains so jonathan matthew welcome and uh i'll let you take off and uh that's what you're excited about hi hi everybody um hi matt how are you i'm good good i'm good uh okay so uh we're here to talk about uh the metaverse and so let's let's um uh first uh thank our hosts and and uh and uh thank cardik for having us so um we can have this enjoyable conversation but with that out of the way why don't you um uh give us your understanding of what the metaverse is and why it matters sure so i'll start with why it matters in the economic sense then i'll move into the societal and then we'll move into the topic at hand the first and foremost anchoring is to understand it as a successor state to today's computing and networking paradigm and conventions we've had three antecedent waves the first was the rise of mainframe computing and networking in the 1950s through the late 1970s succeeded by personal computing and the coincident rise of tcpip or the internet protocol suite succeeded of course by the era we're in right now mobile and cloud for which the social giants or web 2 as we broadly describe it uh ruled we're now at the advent of the metaverse i typically describe it as the following a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3d virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by effectively everyone online while supporting and this is key to the interoperability element continuity of data such as objects identity payments and history why does it matter well from an economic perspective we can understand that every single time we've had this networking and computing shift we've seen massive value transformation we've also seen the digital economy grow those two things leave the opportunity for new companies but also for users for developers for consumers for voters and governments to actually change how society is organized which companies rule but also the principles and so right now we're seeing this concurrent wave of decentralization while we see this shift towards the metaverse and that's actually where so many are excited about the idea that it's not just new technology it's not just open source or uncontrolled technology it's an opportunity for everyone to say things can be different we can be more involved our rights our data ownership can be better thank you so as you said the the the era that we're we're in now and we're i suppose leaving in you know as we progress towards the mataverse is one that among other things was led by social media and social networks to what extent um are social networks like the metaverse are they are they the parents of the metaverse cousins too how will social networks and the metaverse coexist or will one replace the other i think there's a few different ways to think about this number one is when it comes to social interactions online we've seen this progression towards the metaverse across the last several decades in the 1980s and 1990s when you and i first started using the internet of course how did we interact online we interacted via a username or an email address by typing in text it was an asynchronous experience every time that computer memory or broadband or latency improved we started moving to more featured more media-rich forms of interaction at first that was just having a website then it was a web blog then it was a social media page then shifting towards ugc video or constant streams of relatively high definition content that's your tick tock or your instagram stories online interaction really underpins most of what we do online but then critically as those opportunities have expanded we see that ugc or that content which is built on top of these applications and underlying technologies is paramount most of the social networking content is not created by the platform not endorsed by it and of course we saw news yesterday that youtube yet again is generating more ad revenue from ugc content with a wide distribution than netflix or disney have and so in many regards we can think of social networks as that antecedent towards where we're going but it's also very clear that digital communities especially those organic scrappy often strange ones and then video game communities and collectives a lot of what we see in discord today still chat based and audio based are at least the more spiritual antecedents towards this next generation metaverse but we should think about it as community evolving changing adding more functionality and in particular collectivizing in unique ways in this instance around the aggregation of capital so with that in mind and and perhaps in the context of yesterday's facebook results um do do you think it's likely that social networks have us an advantage uh to in the metaverse will they be able to to port their their social graph and their um their their their rich data into the metaverse to have an enduring benefit there well so let's talk about two things about the meta platforms announcement that actually validates their shift and refocus on the metaverse number one is they identified that there was going to be a 10 billion dollar operating cash flow hit this year as a result of apple's att policy shifts that's not unique to apple snapchat has lost roughly 70 of its market cap that's a good example of why people don't like the gatekeepers many don't like facebook but we're seeing the seventh largest company at on earth lose 10 billion in one year due to the policy changes of a dominant platform one that happens 14 years after said platform was announced the other thing that we saw was the first ever decline in their users mark has previously said that the primary problem is not decreasing engagement of facebook products from generations such as you and i but in fact non-engagement from younger generations we know where younger gen z gen alpha users are they're on roblox they're on discord and so the challenges that meta platforms is are encountering is exactly inclined to why he's focused on the metaverse and why he's focused on his own hardware platforms avoid gatekeeping and go to where the audience is it's doubtlessly true that meta platforms has extraordinary advantages still 50 billion per year in operating cash flow they're investing 12 billion a year in hardware any platform with 3 billion maus 2 billion daus and the dominant destination online has their advantages but what's important here is we've seen this story before microsoft released their internet title wave memo in 1995 reiterated in 1998 they were first to market in mobile they believed in the internet they believed in mobile and yet they were supplanted in most online services in the web browser and destroyed in mobile shutting down in 2012 or 2014 why because resources and conviction are not enough you have to have the right premises and most importantly you have to be able to attract developers and users that was the primary problem with microsoft not just the bet on the fact that mobile phones would be the secondary not primary device that you would generate money from licensing your operating system rather than software distribution not that they just bet on physical keyboards rather than touch screens not just that they bet on businesses not consumer users it's that they fundamentally could not attract developers to their platform and thus it was like an empty mall and so i think we can see a lot of validation in mark's approach and meta platforms but we've seen this before if you can't get developers you cannot get users and that identity system that they have doesn't generate the content and doesn't attract the developers in and of itself so so on that and and connected to this this role that apple has played in changing the nature of the ad ecosystem um should we understand apple as a hindrance to the development of the metaverse or are they perhaps an accelerator it's an interesting question and look there is to some extent a false distinction between centralization and decentralization of vertical integration and control versus disaggregation it's very obvious that we're not for apple in 2007 with its tight integration of software and hardware distribution and payments the mobile ecosystem today would be smaller than it is it would be less lucrative the challenge is of course how things change over time right now it's obvious that in a number of different ways apple is curbing the growth of the digital economy not necessarily in just bad ways but certainly in ways that protect their hegemony we see this in their ability to control certain technologies certain business models the take rates are obviously absurd and there's just no compatibility with the nft ecosystem and their in-app billing policy the fact that they say that you can purchase bitcoin in robinhood but you can't purchase an nft is absurd the fact that they're arguing that a cryptocurrency versus a token behind a jpeg is a meaningful differentiation is obviously absurd and of course were we too fractionalized in nft into many tokens that are fungible they somehow represent exactly the reason why bitcoin or ethereum can be purchased in robinhood and yet they're blocked because they're seen to be competitive with the app store again every platform has the right to choose what they want but right now their control and influence is so great that they can shape the rest of the world i think if there's one reason to be encouraged by the communities and organizations we're seeing right now is that there are so many users who are saying that's fine you're saying i can't have a native application that runs on the blockchain or uses nft i'd rather have a more primitive browser-based experience that does have the values than a more graphically rendered one that is curved where the 30 take rate goes to apple so i think we're seeing these natural economic effects of bad policies will eventually come to harm or at least come to change that policy some of the sharpest critics of apple's gatekeeping role have been video game companies like um like epic fortnite what percentage of the metaverse do you think will be video game-like experiences it's a good question if we're talking about virtual communities and in particular real-time rendered experiences then it's very obvious that to the extent in which we'd say the metaverse looks like something that came before it it will look very much like the video game world i think one of the reasons why that's important is let's think about one of the primary differences between social media and games social media is designed from an algorithmic perspective to sustain engagement the goal of the 15th minute on youtube is to earn the 16th minute it's to earn the 17th minute thereafter it's actually one of the reasons why many of us use social networks and don't feel good about it but we're still stuck doing so why do we use games well we don't play a game because we feel bad we only play it because we feel good it's in the name and so one of the reasons why gaming companies seem to be so foundational is because the technology real-time rendering virtual communities virtual worlds and virtual spaces are so obviously the precursor but the second is design and culture principle they create places we want to be not feedback loops that keep us addicted so what do you think the potential is for for for the blockchain in video game spaces because presumably that tells us at least something about the connection that the blockchain will have to the future of the metaverse i think we can think about it in three ways or at least that's the way that i do first of all is the gallon smart contract structure and that has two sub-components one is to recognize that every time we have a massive leap in the ability to congregate aggregate share and pool resources resources however you want to define it time attention spend computing resources we tend to see revolution and the more efficient that is the more efficient and healthy and dynamic the economy is the second component of that is to recognize that if we ever need to contend to the you know multi-trillion dollar power of large corporations we need to do that in a manner that actually draws upon the collectively greater value and resources of the users and developers and communities that's a really important part the second thing that we can understand here is the way in which at least the principles that we're seeing in the blockchain are educating and inspiring the rest of the ecosystem there has long been this question do people want virtual good ownership rights do they want the ability to trade do they want the ability to take it from a to b those have been open questions and one of the problems is even if you believe the answer was yes you had to convince others and you had to invest to achieve that irrespective of the degree of speculation it's inarguable that we have seen that those user rights plus the confidence that when you're told you own something you do own something has led the rest of the gaming ecosystem to understand that those things are valuable more importantly understand that those values are good for everyone in the ecosystem and so in that regard blockchain is an important illuminator the third is the way in which it starts to solve that from a technical perspective again this has two sub-components one is as we see more and more companies hooking into nfts or cryptocurrencies we start to achieve a common technology and standard to facilitate exactly what i just mentioned before i was talking about the philosophy and design principles now we're talking about the technical solution the second component is to understand that one of the reasons why so many have been fearful of interoperation is the belief that their economies will crash that's still tricky i mean look we're decades into globalization we still don't exactly know how to onboard a different marketer given protection or to unwind but the fact that we can use smart contracts that we have trustless arrangements that cost very little helps the fact that someone can produce an asset for their game and then continue to benefit from its use or sale after even outside of their ecosystem gives all potential market participants a belief that if they opt into this system they won't be the loser in fact they'll continue to benefit as the product they created produces benefit and so we see really three different things the users empowered the philosophy being affected and the technical solution of course we are very far from having that technical solution sufficient of course most files aren't stored on the blockchain the fact that you have an asset there does not mean that all of the necessary data to use that asset in a 3d environment or even a 2d environment are there but with progress in consumer demand we start to solve those problems in time but most importantly it's the philosophy that's going to matter why do you think that so much of the video game user community has been so hostile to nfts do you think that opinion will be enduring and and what does that tell us about the role that existing video game communities might have in the metaverse if it's based on blockchain principles three answers number one is the gaming community has always been a particularly vocal and engaged community and so that naturally means that they're more skeptical they're more vocal than you just see in other categories we don't see movie fans get as upset and part of that is just habitual and i don't mean that in a pejorative way to criticize the gaming community in fact the gaming community has been very successful at changing policies that have been excessive in the micro transaction space we just went through a decade of excessive micro transactions and loot boxes and it's no surprise that as we see the rush to nft they're saying at minimum do not want it and at maximum or at maximum do not want it at minimum please slow it down this connects to the second thing which is i have net never before seen such a rush from major publishers to say we're doing this and here's the financial return before justifying it earning it from any product standpoint you have to start with a community you have to start with value you didn't see dapper labs telling people that hey top shots are on blockchain and therefore it's valuable stop doing this old thing this is a better revenue model they just made a good product i'm not going to say that the gaming community is ever going to be excited about nfts but as with micro transactions live services and subscriptions start with the product earn trust don't offer it as a thing to shareholders that will generate greater revenues and don't tell users all of a sudden you should play this game so that you can generate an income start from something fun and playable and then the third thing is also cultural look the gaming community has existed for decades it's relatively recent that they were anything other than looked down upon and ignored and so it's no surprise that people for whom gaming is close to their identity myself included who now see this influx of wall street of the large mutual funds rushing into cryptocurrency then the ceos releasing memos to shareholders saying we're going to increase revenue by selling things to these users simultaneously seeing m a of their long beloved studios and publishers going to tech companies to build multi-trillion dollar mouse traps i totally get it uh it's it feels invasive often and that exacerbates the aforementioned problem of starting revenue first not product or experience first a lot of the criticisms both from the community and from other external analysts have centered on the concept of play to earn uh the notion that you could play games and make money from them um where crypto games have been really successful that seems to have been a component and it's inarguably part of the criticism that you hear from gamers that that sounds like work and isn't isn't a game anymore um you're an investor you invest in video games do you invest in play to i haven't invested in any games that i would consider to be played i think play and earn which is an increasingly popular distinction can be viable but we have to start from a few premises first and foremost look you and i have discussed this before it was no surprise to me when axi infinity started going to sub subsistence and sub average wages why because this is the nature of any competitive market there is a belief that pure play to earn games on average will always offer less than minimum wage and average wages why because you have absolute mobility of laborers you have no fixed cost in the sense that you don't need an office and the onboarding is immediate you don't need to fill out paperwork naturally the loss of all barriers of the reduction of all barriers will really will result in more competition and so that doesn't surprise me and of course financially i probably should have made more bets than i did but ultimately we have to think of it in the following mechanisms which reward people for the provision of anything valuable is important and we don't typically have that in virtual worlds the ability to design a game around work like incentives is actually distinct from whether or not something that someone does or earns or builds in a game has value no one debates that developers who add something in roblox should be compensated i think the distinction is when the game is played is based around income and when the purpose of or the value created and extracted comes from the uncovering of code that was deliberately buried that actually does not produce much value but we're seeing a lot of companies that are saying look can we use tokens or other incentives that say jonathan when you host something when you build something when you create something when you contribute to something when you organize when you design or perhaps when you sell something you earn through your success and play that produces income that all makes sense why because we're saying there is genuine value that's created and so finding this is going to take time discovering automatically and new economic model that uses marginal costs without suffering from the uh marginal edition of labor is going to take time so you you've written a lot about this this this topic of you know what the ingredients of a successful entertainment business are and what gives entertainment companies you know lasting advantages as we look towards the metaverse and as we examine the successes and failures we've had so far with the blockchain what do you look for in an entertainment or media company that is optimizing itself for that future it's a great question and we've seen versions of this repeat several times at a basic level i always focus on this idea of love which is intangible but you should think about it as the operating leverage for a business simply put it doesn't cost you any more to make something that someone loves but the more that they love it the more that they spend on it it's the difference between telling your daughter an elsa dress at forty dollars is too much and recognizing that your daughter just truly needs that else address that can come from high quality creative but it also comes from the engagement of the audience it's the reason why going to disneyland is so impactful nothing compares to a child being hugged by their heroes but it also connects to whether or not a community feels invested feels heard and is a contributor around the world but in particular in asia and southeast asia we have seen intellectual property owners a lot more invested in their community and a lot more liberal with whether or not the community members and independent storytellers can use that ip to tell stories and be paid for it and so when you see i think they announced that wme or caa was now representing some board apes when you see that that's starting to be used in an intellectual property i'm not a believer that we're going to see crypto native entertainment franchises reign supreme but we are going to see some sort of structure through which all entertainment companies say we have to focus more on what the audience wants to do what they own how they use our intellectual property they have to be heard and most importantly we need to find a way to compensate them for creating value for driving more love and for wanting to be involved storytellers you and i grew up imagining fantasy tales we couldn't share them with anyone no one benefited from that we now have those structures so directly following on that what advice would you give to um developers dreamers who are uh fascinated by the unique affordances of the metaverse and of the blockchain and want to build something amazing for the future what advice would you give them the biggest challenge that i see right now is you know not all together dissimilar from the play to earn element which is most of the most famous franchises today began as very pulpy inexpensive mediums that everyone participated in one of the challenges with the fluidity of the blockchain ecosystem right now is frankly that the most valuable things go to either the people who are first or the people who have the most money to be able to come in late that's actually not a good system for community-based storytelling we should not separate the community as in a vocal group of discord members who are among the 4 000 to own a pfp collection ip is actually a very very broadly distributed idea it has to reach millions and so this question of how do you actually cultivate a community that has value that recognizes the extraordinary contributions and value of a given nft or pfp while making sure that it's within reach of the average people uh average person is the big challenge here what we see is in effect a new version of the oldest problem which is when do you prioritize revenue maximization versus reach it's typically reached that precedes revenue maximization but there's always an inclination towards revenue before reach if you take a look at the primary challenge that most sports leagues have gotten themselves into it's that all of the tickets go to the wealthiest buyers and that actually is not a good way to sustain or build up generational love it's certainly not a good way to be a mass media product it's good in the short term but if the average person can't participate they can't share it with their friends their family their parents or their kids i think that's going to be the big tension now it's also why you see the large ip owners for good or for worse trying to take a more democratic approach to pfps and nfts they may not understand the dynamics of the community nearly as well as those who are native to it that's doubtlessly true but they're a lot less focused on how high things can go or even how in control market dynamics are of bid versus ask this is great thank you matt um kartik yep um i know we're at time uh we have a couple of questions in the audience but i'll just pick one that encompasses a collection of a couple of the other ones and so the question is around just gatekeeping overall you've already kind of covered apple here but um are we fundamentally submitting to the fact that this whole cream doesn't become a reality unless the hardware manufacturers are bought in and they are agreeing to this thing do we just see verticalization on everybody's going to come up with their own devices and maybe we'll just have a fragmented world and just what happens in that so it's starting to change look you can install some blockchain based applications on android obviously we can do that on pc sandbox is not struggling despite the fact it's not distributed on smartphones the oculus suite is fairly open it's using webxr and openxr facebook has committed to keeping that open that can change at any point but it is open more recently microsoft announced that you would be able to use its web browser to stream from google stadia and from amazon's luna uh among others without using the xbox live player network or the xbox store you can use blockchain and crypto based games so we are seeing some progress to openness i'm mostly hopeful that we're going to see regulators start to unbundle the app store that seems inevitable it's a question of to what degree and when and so i'm hopeful but look ultimately these are rational businesses the larger the blockchain economy the more fervent the economy is right the more we'll see change over time sounds sounds perfect i absolutely agree um well i want to take too much of your time thank you so much to both of you for making this amazing conversation happen and jonathan really appreciate you moderating see you everyone see ya thanks and with that we are ready for our next amazing panel and uh this one is about just the state of web3 developer tooling and uh joining me will be austin griffith from ethereum foundation and matter david who uh is the lead developer relationship person from edunote and the graph i did a pretty bad job at introducing you both because i want to uh kind of give you that option so uh we'll kind of start with austin and i'll see would love to kind of hear more about who you are what you do and that's sort of how you got into this space well yeah got into this space building i am a tool builder i love building things and making them very forkable for other people to build i love seeing weird forks of my things in production right so i work for the ethereum foundation thinking about developer onboarding thinking about how we scale it up to to all these new developers coming out and i'm here to learn and build and uh wrap with you guys about web3 and tooling awesome yeah so i would say one of the reasons that i'm here is because of austin when i started learning about web3 and um how to kind of to create gaps as a developer the first person's name that came up was awesome so i started diving into some of his tutorials and then started creating my own tutorials so i got into web3 after being a traditional software engineer and developer relations uh developer advocate at aws uh writing code for about nine and a half years and then um got really infatuated with web3 and have decided to kind of uh take the plunge and having the best time of my life so far that's awesome well i'm glad that you were able to uh share that here uh with austin being on the other side there um so the context for this chat is essentially this event is one of the biggest ones we've ever done actually it is the biggest event we've ever done and we have over 1200 people participating and about 70 of them are coming in from web c to web three for the first time and that is an incredible uh metric from even kind of what we see usually for all of our events and not only that it's not just that people are learning about programming it's their season went to developers who are actually in writing and so okay we're considering leaving their jobs or i'm trying to do something here in this space and i think it's an opportunity for uh for me to kind of try something out for a weekend and uh that sets up a pretty interesting base because while somebody can be really good and seasoned in programming there are obviously a lot of gotchas when you kind of get into web 3 and and sadly the right of learning those gotchas after it's too late is not a not a really acceptable route for for too long at least but uh the thing i wanted to do here was talk about sort of what you've seen yourself over the past few years as you've transitioned and sort of any anywhere from observations to things you've noticed that you kind of thought were things that you'd either unlearn or or kind of relearn or just adapt to uh from the web 2 to web 3 side so i'll kind of start off with an actual specific question which is as you kind of interact with a lot more people who are pinging you or you're designing any of the tutorials or or any information from a content firm what are some patterns that you notice that uh anyone coming from up to web3 sort of falls into as they're going into this and maybe we can start with that or here i think one of the things that i can kind of speak to from myself is that i kind of tried to take my ideas and my experience from web 2 and apply those directly to web3 and i think that that was the first uh i would i wouldn't say mistake but like in hindsight i would have probably tried to understand all the tooling and the different um protocols and the primitives that we have that are just different and you can't really apply all those same ideas to web3 instead i think we have like some of the same we can do some of the same stuff but we now have new things that we can do and there are certain things we we can't yet do so therefore we can kind of like maybe rebuild some of the tank the same types of applications that we're used to building in web 2 but maybe not all of them today at least but we have these new things that we can do so uh to me it kind of feels like more of an extension of my skill set that i can now now apply and kind of build more things as opposed to like a replacement of my existing skill set and i think that that might be a good way to kind of frame it for developers that are like in web too like you can still do all the things that you used to be able to do that's the great thing you're kind of like taking all of that knowledge and all those skills that you had and all those opportunities you're just now creating more opportunity and you're now able to kind of build out new types of applications in addition to what you have and you're just kind of like now creating more synergy and in the knowledge that you have and it kind of just opens up a lot of doors i i want to talk about like that's a perfect like plus one like almost all of your skills are going to translate right into web3 from web 2. it's not like a our our troop first your troop kind of thing right uh the the uh place to like dive in here is sometimes like people use it as like a slow asynchronous database at first right you see first smart contracts from most developers after they get the syntax and get it down and it's like a raise of structs and they're using it like they think that like they're storing everything in these giant arrays first name last name let's write it all on chain and so that's one of the first like gotchas that you have to get over is like be careful what you're putting on chain understand that you're like making all the thousands of the nodes on the network all have to update that value and keep that value it's like a crazy amount of redundancy compared to your read replica of web 2. but other gotchas we should probably dive into are just like big numbers and and way versus eth and the things that like you didn't expect to happen it's like oh yeah i i can't use a floating point here i have to use a numerator and a denominator in this solidity because that evm is this super simple thing that needs to execute this stuff like there's reasons for these tradeoffs that we get ourselves stuck in no i absolutely agree i think neter i think it's a really good framework that you just kind of laid out and i never thought about that until you just said it which is if if you are learning a different programming language you usually have or even a web framework you have like oh i can do this to do list app usually in ruby and let me try to learn python or flask and i can just clone that i know exactly what to expect because what i'm learning is actually syntax and not necessarily under the hood changes on how things are in a way compiled or executed but here it's a lot of those principles are still applicable however you are fundamentally kind of restacking which layers are actually mutable versus immutable and and that changes a little bit of things so you can't just clone and try something directly i want to make a crypto version of some app that i already know and if you try to do so you have to make really specific tradeoffs which become like known at the the 10 remaining mark and not the 90 upfront work that you do and that sort of confused a lot of people that's kind of what we see a lot um as we kind of do a lot of our hackathons um so so maybe my first question is when somebody kind of does that or or comes to you from kind of that background what are resources that you point them to to anyone from get up to date on sort of how to think about coding and even smart contracts to designing web 3 apps or to actually stay updated given how fast the space is evolving what's the answer when somebody wants to learn more um i mean i would say the combination of a couple things um one of the things that i always obviously just recommend people doing is just building stuff going and finding tutorials out there like austin griffith's speed run i have the complete guide to full stack ethereum development there's literally probably dozens of high quality tutorials like that so like when you start building with these things you start if you are the developer you start kind of realizing some of these limitations maybe and you also start seeing the new paradigms that are there so that's one thing i would do just start building and start playing around with different things um another thing like i tried to address recently in a blog post called defining the web3 stack goes into specifically the answer to this question like what is the web 3 stack what are the trade-offs what can you do what can you not do and i really tried to go into depth around my interpretation of that so yeah those are two recommendations i would love to hear austin's ideas here at someone a little more senior plus one plus one now i also we should shout out patrick's like 16 hour tutorials that he's been putting out too right there's there's a handful of great ones there too absolutely maybe plus one speed run yeah go ahead no go ahead carter now i was gonna say uh matter maybe it's worth sort of going a bit deeper into that blog post so would you mind kind of going over what you talked about and sort of what are specific recommendations from there yeah so essentially when i was again kind of going back when i started learning all this stuff i was taking all of the ideas and all the experience i had and thinking about the web 3 in that way and i think not only me but a lot of developers once you've kind of gotten you know used to to building an application using the things that we have available to us um as a full stack developer we kind of have a front end and then we have these back-end primitives and kind of using all these together we can build out you know 95 percent of the applications that we need so the web to stack is what i would call that like what does that mean exactly well typically it's kind of like a database a server some type of execution layer you know to talk to database a file storage system so something like amazon s3 would allow you to store videos images and things like that and then you would have something like a front end which would be either a mobile client or a web client and that's kind of it i would say like using those things you can actually build out like a twitter clone or an instagram photo you know almost any application you can think of and then the extra five or ten percent is going to differentiate you know depending on the app that you're building you might need a machine learning uh you know api or you might need something like notifications or whatever so uh what does that stack look like in web3 and that's kind of what i tried to break down in in that blog post and the main differences are like we have a lot of these same primitives so we have the api layer we have uh the authentication layer we have the the quote unquote like database um which is a little different i mean or a lot different i would say that's kind of one of the main differences is like what how do we think about data um we have the front end you know you can still kind of use transfer all that knowledge and and mainly it comes down to kind of like what does the back end uh kind of look like at this point since the front end is essentially transferable and uh the new primitive that we have is the blockchain so we've never really dealt with that if you're coming into this space you have the blockchain development environment so this is really really important from a developer tooling perspective if you are a developer and you've been building with something like aws you have things like cdk you have things like amplify um if you're using you know something like super bass or one of these other managed services they come with all this great tooling and i think that we're starting to see some really great tooling now in web 3 with things like foundry we have obviously brownie and um hard hat is is really really great hard hat is like kind of what uh helped me get going so yeah you have your blockchain development environment you have your chain you have the file storage which you know in web 2 would be something like s3 but in web 3 that's something like ips ipfs or r weave and that is going to be a lot different than what we're used to like we're used to paying a very very small price for storage and um and it's kind of like centralized and obviously it can go down or whatever and then in web three we have kind of like two main primitives for for file storage like ipfs uh you can you can save stuff there and it's free but you can't al always say okay that's going to always be available yeah so yeah are we our weave seems really interesting to me because it kind of offers this this permanent stage storage layer where you kind of pay a single transaction cost and based on what the protocol tells you it will be available 10 or 15 or 20 years from now theoretically which is super interesting to me and then really the other two areas would be the api layer and the identity layer which is kind of really you could go into those um for a whole episode if you wanted to but um you know the ipa the api layer would be something like an rpc endpoint or something like the graph protocol which allows you to kind of index and serve data via some graphql endpoint that was extremely comprehensive and that's awesome and i'll all kind of keep you fair and give austin a chance to talk about sort of the motivation for doing speedrun ethereum what it is how you kind of got to it and where your plans work yeah no so speedrun ethereum uh is about getting that mental model sort of it's it's pretty easy to pick up the syntax right like solidity is pretty easy for a if you're a web 2 developer you'll pick up the syntax in no time and you'll feel like you're at the top of the dunning kruger but you have to go down and into the valley of despair and learn all the different things just like netter said you have to build things over and over again and ship them things out in public in front of people so hopefully speedrun ethereum gives you a chance to like build up your web3 profile and get the mental model of what kind of things we can build on ethereum and what kind of things we can't uh the what he was talking about ipfs like it's immutable and it's decentralized so it's really hard to build right there some of this stuff is is super difficult going going back to speedrun or going back to sign in with ethereum uh learning the mnemonic and learning your key pair is hard for a new time a first time user but once you have that then your identity and and your inventory follows you from app to app and that's a new thing in web3 and it's kind of kind of emerging right now what that even looks like so yeah i don't know bouncing around a little bit but as a builder on web 3 there's a lot of fun things to look out for that kind of come along with this this new paradigm that we're dealing with that's awesome and uh i'm just impressed with the the live chat here because they're they're like 10 seconds away from just posting the link of everything you're referring to for everybody else so before i could even check there's a list of every article he talked about a 16 hour video all the blog posts speed running it's just it's incredible so thank you for for doing this uh um everybody and uh well i also want to cover two links in general but i sort of asked a version of this question earlier but i want to be really specific or see if we can get into specifics which is what what do you think people get most stuck at from kind of your experience and and uh this is kind of commenting specifically web 2 devs that are trying smart contracts any kind of catch-all or very common patterns or trends you've noticed and kind of what are those things where everybody is sort of blocked in most cases maybe austin given your experience tutorial hell right like a lot of people get stuck in tutorial hell of like there's so many tutorials there's so much material out here what is the next thing i should build and i'll i'll paste a twitter thread that i have where it's just like all right you've got the basics you think it's the first challenges you're stuck what's next and it's like you know build yourself an indexer and learn how that kind of stuff work like each each of these like little places to to explore is like a whole like a multi-sig leads to a dow leads to building these new like dow tooling mechanisms uh a dex like learning how to trade things so yeah i i'll paste a link in of a good kind of next steps uh but i want to hear nader's answer too um yeah i mean i echo everything that he said you know you kind of start learning this stuff and it's the same thing with web 2. if you don't actually take some of those ideas and try to build something and expand the knowledge that you have learned and actually write some code you just won't get anywhere so definitely start building before you feel like you're ready because like that's the that's the perfect time obviously you need to have some somewhere to start from so like do a couple tutorials for sure but like at some point just say okay that's it i'm gonna go build an app and there's a handful of good starter applications you know that are like quote unquote like web3 like a token exchange is a good example he mentioned like uh would you say like a token gating or something like that oh yeah token game that's a whole that's a whole other thing yeah for sure nft marketplace is a great one um obviously just the hello world yeah just try to build all this stuff and then maybe take someone's tutorial and then extend that and add functionality and you'll run into a lot of areas but like so there's that and then the other thing would be again a lot of times coming from web 2 you try to kind of apply the ideas that you have directly and let's say i want to build out a web3 version of something i'm used to doing so for instance if i wanted to build like a twitter version uh twitter on web3 you know you will definitely run into a lot of challenges because we don't really have the tooling available today to build something that is that good as far as the user experience is concerned you have to have right now unfortunately points of centralization there so like you you can obviously store messages in something like ipfs or ceramic but how do you actually do the queries and how do you do notifications and how do you do like private messages all this stuff like all this stuff is possible but the we're not quite there yet to make it easily available to for most developers to do so in web 2 we have really really great solutions that are out there that kind of abstract away all this complexity things like super bass things like amplify and things like vercell but we don't really have that quite yet and i think that's what we're going to be building over the next few years the leads perfectly into to my next question which was just giving a kind of comment around what's happening with tooling right so i think what you just said is definitely true but i feel like that's a one layer up on the tooling side because that's on the in largely like manages the destination in the interface to code but when you look at developer tooling um obviously we've seen the evolution from how kind of truffle to where we are with hard hat now but um do you think there's anything still missing like or what can still be made better like if we just leave that open-ended what can be improved on developing smart contracts optimistically i just want to say that like developer tooling is so much better than it was a few years ago like it's it's it's pretty damn smooth every year awesome yeah i keep saying it's good so so i would say that like one of the things that might have been missing a year ago might have been more like templates and it's not the layer of tooling like hard hat you've got hard hat you've got your you can do all this cool stuff it's the you know if i want to build an nft marketplace am i going to start from complete scratch here am i going to have to build my own indexer like what things are available generically that i can grab off the shelf and just plug in here first and and so that's probably what i should have said last year i don't know what i should i wish i could see into the future to tell you what i should say right now but i don't know exactly what's missing with two building i think tooling is pretty pretty good but obviously like ux can get so much better error messages every year i probably curse error messages right like when you have enough gas and the error message is like this big and it's like right in there somewhere is the actual error that the user needs to understand but it's buried so error messages how about that yeah for me it would be kind of like the the development environment for working on a edm compatible chain is really great right now hard hat is just just amazing like if you pick that up from web 2 it will feel very very natural because like everything's well documented everything just works you're using like node.js and you're using clies and stuff it feels really great but i would say there are a lot of areas that for instance uh documentation and a lot of the other tooling so ether.js and web3.js are kind of like the two main used libraries and they're both really really great and just work really great but i would feel like that the documentation on both of those could be more approachable for web 2 developers if i go in and read that like now after having experience i still don't know everything but i can at least find my way through it but when i first looked at that stuff i didn't even understand how to do anything at all like like i could literally read all that doc and there's no example that kind of like showed me what to do with all that stuff so i had to go watch videos um like austin's and stuff like that that would actually show me oh okay this is how you use it i think we could use more polished and in documentation with more like end-to-end tutorials within our examples in there so like not only showing the api interface but also showing how you would actually use that uh because there's a lot of assumptions that you just don't understand this is this is a really good first step though in terms of if you're a web 2 developer and you're just getting in go grab ethers and learn about providers and signers and wallets just like get them and understand them providers are like your connection signers are like your your sign in the transaction and wallets are like your kind of your mnemonic where you kind of generate those private keys learn those things build a simple script that just like i don't i don't know like it's a wallet and you send money to it when money lands there it sends it on to something else like build a simple script no front end nothing like that just that does that and that's such a good entry point to kind of get the mental model of providers and signers and eventually you'll build a full-scale app that uses those same things but just that simple little script is a a lot to get you through the through the door absolutely i was gonna say that i think uh it's a pretty good segue into maybe uh you talking about developer now and you kind of talked about all these things would love to hear about sort of what what sparked that and uh kind of what happens there yeah i mean an army of developers there's a bunch of cool dows out there right now that are doing similar stuff and i would love to touch on like a handful of other ones as well but with developer dow it was kind of like um i just started diving into dallas that month you know i really just started starting understanding am i doing friends with benefits and salt was going on there and the excitement around some of that and i had seen the communities that were building around nfcs and i realized okay like there's a lot of overlap between nfts and communities and dows like there isn't a clear distinction between what each of these is um salute project dropped that week and i realized like this is a very forkable contract because all it was was just svg and i wasn't a an expert smart contract developer but i knew how to read a contract and how to kind of like update it so i was like oh this is a cool opportunity for me to deploy my first smart contract so i forked loot i updated the properties it was just a bunch of arrays of properties and instead of using you know the robe and the sword i was using like developer characteristics i am a developer that lives in austin texas and i write python and i'm wearing a black hoodie like that would be the the items in those arrays and and i was like okay so what can i do with this contract oh let's create a dow there isn't a dial that's focused for developers right now that i knew of there was uh friends and benefits that had a developer's channel but that channel was not active at all so that'd be cool just to have that and i'll just launch the contract tweeted it out and kind of left it alone for about a month or two and the community actually together formed around it created the discord created the token gating created the forum and all the mechanisms around governance and i luckily just got pulled along for the ride and i'm still definitely a huge um i'm a contributor but i'm not i wouldn't say cons i wouldn't consider myself one of the main people that's actually doing the work the community is there doing the the cool stuff i'm just i feel fortunate to kind of like come along for that ride um we haven't created a ton of we're not trying to be like i feel like there's too much stuff around investment and money and stuff and web 3 and not enough around focused on developers at least there could be more i would say i wouldn't say there's not enough i feel like there's there's like this hyper financialization of everything so we wanted to kind of be the opposite of that um almost to the point where we didn't have enough money to do so like maybe we should have like charged money for our nft or maybe we should have done something with d5 but instead we're like focused on donations and we've sold a portion of our governance token to get coin who really align really well with what we're doing and those partnerships and sponsorships are kind of giving us that runway and our main focus is on building public goods learned a lot again from austin and all the people at bitcoin because they are literally like the examples that we're going by spending their time money and effort to create things that are free for everyone to use and that kind of help people in general like in different ways that is absolutely incredible thank you for sharing that um i i do want to sort of switch your gears a little bit and come back to the question before on tooling what have you kind of commented on just seems like we're actually in a pretty good state right now where what developer just lets us do um do you do you differentiate do you do you change that answer everywhere to say is that same tooling sufficient for us going uh deeper into l2s like whether that's talking to different uh providers or services what does that look like when you're not on mainnet and that's what that's what we should have told you experiences i wish future austin would have that same like whatever happens on l2 something's about like something neat is about to happen right like we've got like games where like things that weren't we able we weren't able to do like crafting and all sorts of like strange nfts owning nfts and mainstream ramps into l2 and these mainstream experiences something is about to happen and we are going to need some specific tools i maybe maybe it's going back to like your devops skills will transition really well from web 2 to web 3 because we're about to scale up and we really need some help handling like all of this flow of users right maybe maybe that's part of it but yeah i think l2 will bring a whole new set of challenges and tools that need to go with that anything to add matter there on how you see tooling wise yeah i think that tooling is has kind of been built around the most popular protocols and the most popular used products in web 3 right now and we're starting to see new things that come out and there just isn't an equal set of tooling for that so for instance i would say when i started learning um solidity and evm hard hat was there and it was amazing but when i wanted to go learn solana there wasn't anything there so i was like oh and then anchor came around and it's a really great thing that kind of fills in that gap i don't know what the answer to that is if someone offer asked me if i want to build on um on a zk roll up or something like that like i don't know what that looks like it might look the same i haven't done enough research in that so maybe austin knows the answer to this if i wanted to usually just say i'm an evm maximalist that's usually what i say yeah if i wanted to build on something like starknet or um something like that like is can you use hard hat i don't think you can but maybe there's something that chiro i think it has its own language doesn't it yeah okay like compute i think everything at the end kind of converges to evm compatibility or cross compatibility but it's a fair bet to make uh you know i mean i think the other kind of piece here is that austin you already kind of covered is basically we're moving towards how web 2 works right now from a cooling standpoint um at the end of the day maybe a year from now like you end up with specializations like i don't necessarily always need to know how backhand works in in existing engineering company if i am solely focused on front end because there's an abstraction there there's availability of hey this is what the interface looks like and i will talk to it and we're kind of in the place where right now everybody's doing everything but it doesn't have to be the case and largely i don't think it will either and uh and kind of the most common questions we get is like i don't know how to write smart contracts can i still participate these hackathons and the answer is yes because even if somebody writes a smart contract for internet interacting with something with define nft he's like they still used to be a user interface that uses react and then everything else and that is largely decoupled from what's happening on chain and and that doesn't take away um anywhere from the arguments or tooling or the roles or your background or your skills and and that's absolutely uh still going to be the case whether it's about layer twos or joe knowledge proofs abstraction still helps at the end of the day um so uh one kind of final question when i asked and we're ready to move on to our next talk is uh obviously security is a big issue in this space especially when we're dealing with with money um any advice for newcomers to uh to kind of consider as they think about deploying things to mainnet uh whatever chain it may be uh and what should they keep in mind uh when uh thinking about smart contract security maybe austin we can start there yeah i'm i'm i'm the guy that says prototype everything and get everything out there and and let it fail and keep going so maybe i'm not the best person to to push on security you want to have audits and you want to do due diligence and you understand that it's not just this contract it's a system of contracts that are doing all sorts of complex things but also i i'm the prototyper that throws stuff at the wall so maybe nader can talk more about like writing good tests and test driven development and stuff like that long two only test nets yes right yeah i think the security implica implications of smart contracts that deal with uh with with value are orders of magnitude like more important to to understand or to kind of have um enough eyes on it and and reviews and and understanding what you're doing versus maybe something like in web 2 where you know you can't make a mistake and then lose billions of dollars or something like that or even even a dollar or ten dollars or anything like that um so like so therefore you see even protocols and teams that have the best engineers in the world still getting more people to come look at their code by hiring these auditors and stuff so you know um i guess what i'm trying to say is yes it's extremely important um and maybe the more people that can see your code the better so don't build in a silo if you're going to be shipping something like put it out there open source it like let people scrutinize it like take as much feedback as you possibly can especially if there's going to be any if you're if you're asking someone to trust you with their money and that they're going to be buying something from you through that contract or an nfc project or something you want to just do everything you possibly can to make sure that you're being a good steward of that person's uh their their trust i guess that's a that's a perfect note to end on and yes preferably the non-testing prod um so matter i'll say i want to thank you so much for your time today and i also want to give a special shout out to karate for being an amazing member on the chat and kind of context filling all the resources that we've talked about so thanks for that and uh thanks again for your time thanks everyone thank you see you and next up we have our last talk of the day and uh for this i want to introduce spencer and lee from variant and we're going to talk about the ownership and the passion economy so without further ado let's welcome lee and spencer on stage and i'll let you uh turn on your videos hi hey there nice to be here thanks kartek for having us i'm excited to host to both of you and uh i kind of have a handful of things planned for this uh largely um it's just interesting because you are co-workers uh spencer and lee are general partners at varian fund and uh what i want to do is i want to see um when i first gave you an opportunity to kind of talk about your background in terms of how you got to where you are now especially kind of from both of your ends you kind of have a different uh focus that each of you kind of are excited about and i'm curious to kind of hear what sort of made you spend all of your time in crypto and i've been perhaps maybe we can start with spencer here and uh and then we'll uh move on to to eat cool yeah happy too and thanks for having us um see i guess my crypto journey begins in 2013. uh i was working on wall street yeah and sorry i think i'd hear someone okay that was working on wall street and it was a very short stint it was like you know less than a year and it got exposed to the bitcoin white paper and immediately just went down the rabbit hole right didn't have really anyone to talk to about it so i started tweeting about it and it was in 2014 where i started a bitcoin on-ramp company um we were trying to make it easier for people to buy and sell bitcoin um like in physical locations um and we had to shut that company down because of like just a really uncertain regulatory environment and i learned a lot during that time it's funny to see how much the space has changed right i think there's a lot more certainty as it relates to regulations today but actually left the space during during the the bear market i guess officially um but then kind of came back in 2018 i started a crypto fund one of the early crypto funds called dtc capital and i was a solo gp there managing a portfolio that invested in um you know tokens as well as like early stage companies and that's where i just fell in love with um working with entrepreneurs right um building like these these new companies and protocols from the ground up uh and and just like the ability that some of them had to truly transform the world whether that's you know finance or consumer or social it really doesn't matter i think um you know just like i just got really invigorated by doing that and one of the insights that i had um while at dtc capital was how much community really mattered to the overall success of these projects and having a really healthy community was something that i wrote a lot about um just in terms of like tactically uh and someone else who was in the space and is lee and myself's third co-founder at variant is jesse walden and jesse was writing about progressive decentralization when he was at anderson horowitz and this is this idea where you know you have a company and that you know you slowly exit to your community so you can kind of see the parallels between um those two like idea spaces and um yeah jesse and i just you know ended up investing a lot together i worked at his cryptic startup school initiative that he ran and highly encourage everyone to read watch those videos they're still on the internet today and then yeah i joined him in january of last year as uh kind of the second general partner at variant and so yeah i would say one of the big things that that we do is you know we help our portfolio companies um build their own communities among other things and i manage my own community myself it's called power network which i i you know shameless plug i hope everyone here subscribes to the newsletter it's powernetwork.sub and what it is it's an on-chain analytics community that you know each week we feature four or five projects in the crypto space that are doing innovative things and um contributors talk about them on like a like a fundamental basis and use kind of on-chain metrics to just tell a story about their health and i would say that it's everyone in in the ownership economy and this is the fun thesis and kind of get into it later with lee is an investor right in crypto and so i think you know by subscribing to the newsletter you become a better more data-driven crypto investor which is something that i think everyone needs and it's just something that i'm really passionate about um so yeah happy to kick it over the way hey everyone uh really good to be here um i'm lee i'm one of the other general partners and co-founders at variant fund um so my story and how i got into crypto um well it definitely was a little bit more belated than spencer's story but my background has been in consumer internet and consumer software for basically my entire career i started my journey as a product manager initially in silicon valley i was building a mobile app this was during the wave of like somolo social mobile local apps that everyone was working on post app store release did that for a few years that company got acquired and then i went over to the investing side at andreessen horowitz to work on the consumer investing team and what initially i intended to be a one or two year stint before i went back to the product side ended up being really something that i fell in love with and i'm still working on today which is investing so i have a long history and background as a consumer investor specifically in traditional marketplaces social networks professional networks any sort of network effects product and it's that story that then segways into my journey into crypto which is that the through line of all of the investments that i had been working on for all of those years at my time at andreessen were really around using technology to improve access access to friends access to other social connections access to jobs and economic opportunity through being able to participate in a marketplace um and then i started investing in future of work consumer platforms through my own fund called atelier ventures in 2020 after i left a16z and it was there that i began to explore crypto as a tool to help turbocharge that thesis of technology to improve access um so i began to invest in crypto projects that helped to enable people to pursue their passions and to earn from that um and found myself spending more and more time there becoming more interested in crypto as a means to distribute ownership of the under underlying platforms themselves and felt that that was really the strong form of my thesis of the passion economy of how people are able to earn a living through leveraging these new tools and so jessie and i who have been colleagues um before at b16z uh decided that our two theses of the ownership economy and the passion economy were really two sides of the same coin and that we would be better as a team together collectively and so i joined the team full-time in october um and now am focused a lot on the consumer side of crypto and really interested in new applications that can help accelerate mainstream adoption thank you so much for that this is uh this is a awesome on a couple of friends one because you just made my life a lot easier by just chatting at all the tops we're going to cover anyway and it flows naturally and everything else so uh my kind of first question for for you is uh lee is um you already kind of said that passion and ownership economy are kind of two sides of the same coin uh but are we talking about something brand new here or or do you think this is just sort of like is it something that just uniquely only enabled by by web3 or crypto or was this kind of already happening in parts or pieces before and now it's just amplified like how do you kind of think about then versus now sort of uh comparison here yeah for sure so um just to sort of level set variant's whole thesis is the ownership economy so we are investing in platforms that aim to distribute ownership to their users and to their communities um and as to the question of is this new is this something that is only possible through crypto i think the the answer is nuanced because i think the idea of user ownership and worker ownership has existed for hundreds of years cooperatives like worker-owned co-ops or consumer cooperatives they've been around basically since the industrial revolution they came to being from this desire for people to have more leverage to gain economic power together and to improve their options and so for about 200 years or so we've had worker-owned co-ops or consumer co-ops like some of the biggest companies that we encounter and purchase through are actually cooperatives like rei um but i think that the strong form of the ownership economy thesis is really made possible through crypto and that's because traditionally the way that you would enable worker ownership or or user ownership is through traditional equity done through the traditional legal rails um you would grant you know all of your workers equity in a worker-owned co-op um and that obviously entails more inefficiency in actually distributing that ownership and is subject to all of the limitations of equity from a from a regulatory perspective um and and so as a result like crypto tokens i think represents the strong form of enabling the ownership economy because all of a sudden you're able to distribute value through tokens over the internet as easily as we're able to transmit information um and so it's not entirely a new thing to to distribute ownership but i think it's it's very much strongly enabled by crypto yeah and i would just maybe add that um it's it's definitely accelerated um through crypto and like we've just i think there's just an immense amount of leverage with smart contracts and what developers can do um and and yeah obviously like one of the the main like products from a smart contract as a token and and like yeah i would say when you when you zoom out and think about how tokens are just superior to equity they have some downsides but let me just give you like a rosy picture right they're basically free to deploy right it costs you know just basically the the price to see um they're infinitely programmable right you could you could literally do whatever you want with them they are accessible to anyone in the world it doesn't have to be just you know investors in the united states or somewhere else you know it's it's truly global and they're liquid if you want them to be from day one and and i think that like is a recipe for just like this this you know sounds you know a cambrian explosion if you will of new innovation in this space and it's honestly amazing that we get to invest in these projects at like the earliest most formative stages a lot of the times with entrepreneurs who are honestly just starting off and maybe you only have an idea uh but i really think the the big unlock is smart contracts of tokens that makes a lot of sense and no i absolutely agree i think and it's just one of those things where you have to kind of constantly switch between is this are we talking about the recipes or the outcomes and we have all the ingredients here for kind of coming with interesting items but we haven't seen all possible combination permutations if it's just that either um one kind of question i had for uh both of you and all going to start with spencer is that when we usually think about creator economy or kind of passion economy or ownership which i think is like a much better collective sort of super set of this usually we're thinking about people who are artists or designers or like youtubers or people who just kind of have content creation as as the core but of course um that's not so the definition of a creator or uh or shouldn't be rather spencer as you kind of look at things that are like not necessarily consumer apps or you kind of look at defy apps or anything else in the space as as an investor can how do you think about what ownership economy means to those types of businesses and and have you seen anything from new patterns or trends or any observations there yeah no i think it's a great like it's a super meaty question i think ownership it really gets the heart of like what what is ownership and and i think it can take like many different forms right um you could argue that like you take a unispot for example which is a decentralized exchange protocol um right now the uni token that governs the protocol it it like has some you know ability to take fees right from that the protocol generates in terms of transaction volume but in addition to that liquidity providers people who provision their own tokens to like help the liquidity of the like a given market they also um have ownership of individual liquidity pools in in the form of lp tokens and they also get a cut of fees um ownership can manifest in ways such as like revenue sharing and um um like the list kind of goes on it goes back to what i was saying about how tokens are are programmable i think what i would love to see more of is we're in like the early days of this um jesse our our partner has written this kind of amazing piece called progressive decentralization which i encourage everyone to read and many of the companies that you know started with progressive decentralization they exited to their community with a very simple governance token which is like this is the protocol here are some parameters and you can vote on those parameters or upgrade it in in some way and i think that's the tip of the iceberg i think as we get kind of more robust as a community there are just going to be so many different dimensions of ownership that will be coded like into these smart contracts that are just a lot potentially more equitable and like get at the heart of what we're actually trying to do and maybe i guess no yeah that makes sense and i think it's one of those things where kind of what we've seen in the last year and a half or so has just been deployments of these things but not active kind of um tweaking or iterations on them and you're basically yeah you're right it's we're seeing that and it works a small scale and the question is will that scale up to a larger number of users and sort of my question for you lee is um uh you're obviously spending more time on understanding consumer applications and projects here uh are there sort of any differences in how you evaluate consumer companies in crypto versus non-crypto or kind of what changes in that framework of deciding where opportunity is or uh or where there's potential for larger growth yeah great question um i think it's actually more similar than not where a lot of the same lessons and frameworks from traditional consumer investing do apply to crypto consumer investing as well and that's because fundamentally the humans are not different at the end of the day the people who are using these applications are still the same people and human needs have actually not changed that much even throughout the course of human history like at the very fundamental level people all share the same underlying drivers and motivations like the desire for connection the desire for community the desire for financial stability and earnings wanting to seek love and meaning in their lives and so the best consumer products i think all tap into one of those core human needs but enables them in new and different ways um so i think the way that these new crypto consumer platforms are enabling earnings or enabling connections to new people looks different than the prior generation of consumer apps but ultimately um from my lens as an investor and as a user the question is still what fundamental need is this solving for on the part of people that's a really interesting way to look at it i yeah that's that's super cool what what uh so i guess maybe it does that differentiate when you look at marketplaces versus kind of social as gaps and sort of what does that look like and how does the ownership economy change those dynamics yeah i think obviously marketplaces and social applications differ in terms of what is the user trying to accomplish when they get there and what does product market fit look like i typically say that in a marketplace product market fit is achieving liquidity meaning when you go to the marketplace you're able to get what you want that is product market fit for a marketplace versus in a social network that's obviously quite different you're you're there for entertainment connection utility of being able to communicate with your friends etc and so there's there's different core drivers there but there's still metrics that you can leverage in order to kind of quantitatively assess our users our users getting their needs met through this product in a much more powerful way than prior generations or prior products did um as to how the ownership economy applies to this model i think like the the theory which um is still very much like in its early days and still being refined is that giving users ownership helps to bootstrap networks much more effectively and grow them into much more engaged networks than otherwise would have been possible so historically building a new network is is essentially like an impossible hercule herculean feat it required you know uber to raise billions and billions of dollars facebook yeah yeah exactly and giving users ownership tower charles charges all of that and also can be used as a way to enhance retention um not to mention ultimately there's a there's a financial value proposition and that gets layered on top of the core value proposition of the product itself as well so i think all of those lenses taken together um it's really still about like how much value is being driven to users lives by these new product products and ownership um offers something new and different that is additive and incremental to the core product but the core product still very much needs to work that's extremely well put in and that makes absolute sense this is great um i'll kind of pose the next question uh for for both of you which is uh do you kind of see this space evolving as you know a parallel universe where like the existing giants just get dethroned or do you kind of like how do you feel like the role of existing big companies whether it's marketplaces or consumer companies sort of come to think about web3 and what kind of happens in a few years from now anyone can go i don't have uh yeah sure um i i can take a stab at this um so i've spent a lot of time like talking to executives and people who work at these web 2 giants and these network incumbents i think they are smarter than we give them credit for for sure and i think they're going to be forced to respond in in various ways i think the um the key thing is that i think everyone is exploring or actively looking to integrate web3 elements into their products they're looking to add crypto as a feature into their existing products because they realize this is where consumers are going they want to own nfts they want to showcase them they want to be able to um have like co-ownership of the community etc and so all of these web 2 networks are going to add crypto as a feature to their products sort of akin to how twitter added the hexagonal profile pictures um but at the same time i think what they do in terms of fully leaning into the ownership economy is limited because they're not going to be able to offer the full spectrum of what ownership entails which is you know ownership isn't just about owning a digital good and and having it and being able to view it as an investment it's also about responsibility and governance and these incumbents are structured in such a way where they're limited in terms of the amount of governance rights they can actually confer to their users um and so i think if if users value the whole spectrum of everything that is encompassed in ownership i think the web 2 giants are going to be challenged um in being able to fully meet that anything that spencer yes it's a super meaty topic and i think it it's like it's always helpful to look through like the lens of different industries and i think i have like a different hypothesis for maybe like you know social media versus um d5 for example which i think like something like d5 we're gonna see you know crypto uh we'll see like the larger banks and the legacy financial system kind of um implemented like integrated on the back end and it'll probably just like exist and and users won't really know the difference of what they're using for their financial piping so you think that's more likely versus a alternative offering that just dethrones those institutions i think it's probably a a bit of both right and and it kind of sort of depends on the product um and so but i think the important part is like crypto is pushing the boundaries of what these like legacy institutions do and that kind of um that's like universal to the entire space um at its core though i think like the ownership economy represents like like a new chapter frankly and like how we think about um like operating internet companies and and i would argue that at least our hypothesis as a fund is that the largest winners from here are going to be user owned networks as opposed to like you know extracting companies um and we'll have to see if that gets proved out but i think like some of the early signs are really encouraging i absolutely agree um when i kind of uh wrap this up and just to ask one last question and we can go in deep if we want to but uh if you want to just list things that works as well it can be independent of the the ownership economy too but what are some kind of anywhere from ideas to projects you're excited about that you would either like to see or you would like to see people explore more and i'll kind of put that in context which is about 1200 developers i'm going to be building interesting things over the next four days and uh anywhere from inspirations for a quick hack to quick improvements to potential businesses what does that look like is there a wish list or things that you want to see more experimentation on spencer do you want to take that i can fire it up so so i would say like perhaps that that may be what you say maybe kind of looking at what's happening in d5 right now and sort of what do you think things could yeah so so like historically in hackathons there's been a lot of remixing right like taking this and using it with that and like coming up with something i think that's pretty cool um but i would love to see kind of more maybe experimentation in areas that we haven't had yet um an idea is like on token levels so one thing that i've been looking at is like curves ve token mechanics and there's some really cool things that they do to incentivize liquidity through you know different gauges and voting like imagine taking that and like changing it altering it in order to get like produce a different outcome um that would affect the system i think also like this idea of cross-chain applications that really excites me so um imagine an nft marketplace the order book is is on one blockchain that's super fast and maybe like some other part is on ethereum which is like more secure um i think crosschain is something that we we should like we're definitely thinking about at variant and i know a lot of entrepreneurs are too um and then maybe if i have one more um i i'm always a fan of like innovation around like like nfts in general and like they're just fun and like doing fun things with like the programmability of nfts noun styles like a really interesting project that has this cool distribution mechanism but i think there's like a bigger idea is maybe to work through there yeah i'll just tag some more ideas onto that list um we've been very interested in the category of web3 infrastructure um so kind of the core building blocks that are going to enable the next generation of applications is very interesting to us i think there's some really key um missing puzzle pieces to enable like the next generation of consumer applications including decentralized social graphs um being able to do account to account messaging on chain that's also missing beyond that i think i'll put in a plug for fashion nfts i think this space is like all of the attention is on music nfts which we're also very bullish on but i think there is something to be built around fashion and expression self-expression digitally through nfts and i think the exciting thing about fashion nfts is that you're not limited to the human form factor that we have in meat space fashion nfts can look different than than human fashion i guess i'm not even entirely sure what it could look like you know referring to like the physical good news piece of nft's when you say fashion is that correct um well definitely it can be not linked to the physical fashion but it can also transcend like the way that we actually look physically like i i refer to um twitter profile pictures as the first instance of digital fashion or fashion nfts actually because they're essentially like adornment for this online profile that we all have um we don't change our outfits that often but it's like one of the primary instances in which we can actually dress up our social profiles i think there's going to be other places that we want to express ourselves and change our appearances in order to broadcast things about our identities or our communities um and then lastly i'll say i think the wallet space is super interesting and there are probably going to be multiple winning wallets um perhaps designed for different demographics or different use cases so excited to see more innovation there that is an impressive uh comprehensive list that i think uh gives definitely a couple hundred people good ideas to can explore and uh oh this is amazing well i think that's a perfect name to end on unless uh spencer you wanna add something oh yeah i was just gonna say both lee and i are like we're on twitter all the time uh we love connecting with entrepreneurs if you're a hackathon participant and you want some feedback on your idea no promises that we can get back to everyone but like hit us up happy to give you feedback and uh yeah and anybody who wants to chat with them uh you can also send me a note on discord and i'll be able to forward that request uh to them as well so uh lee spencer thank you so much for giving your time and for this amazing chat and uh we'll keep you posted on what comes out of that awesome thanks so much thanks so much good luck everyone see you right bye all right and that brings us to the end of our summit so i want to thank everybody who uh stick i stuck around till the end and watch all these amazing talks and thank you everybody for kind of engaging on on the chat there and also uh on discord so um this marks the end of today and the whole kickoff for road to web3 and uh what we'll do is we'll just kind of wrap it up here and without further ado uh we'll we'll kind of close this call uh we'll see all of you on discord for the hackathon in terms of next steps submissions are due on sunday night 9pm eastern and then we will be showcasing the top 15 teams on wednesday so join us again here on include tv next wednesday to see what came out of this hackathon and uh thanks again hope you have a great rest of the week and uh we'll see you all later goodbye [Music] you
