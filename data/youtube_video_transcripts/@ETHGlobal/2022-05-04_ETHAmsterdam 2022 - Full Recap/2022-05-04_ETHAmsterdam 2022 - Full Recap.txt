[Music] one thing that i love about youth global is it really is all about having fun it's about really exploring what's out there being able to talk to everyone and really mingle coming back here has been extremely re-energizing just very happy to see that you know the ecosystem seems to have fully recovered from covet lots of people are happily going around and you know talking about things hacking on things thinking about what they're going to be building i hope everyone enjoys the event i think it's going to be great i love you global i've been doing e global hackathons since 2017 and i'm a big fan of the enabling space it is here it seems like in web 3 that the people standing at the booth are like the founders the ceos the the people in charge of the company it's really exciting to be able to actually talk and interact with these people and they seem really interested in like onboarding more developers so that's probably my main takeaway it's incredible to meet so many cool people here i feel like every time we attend an eve global hackathon it's just amazing and mind-blowing and developers love it and we just want to be part of that ecosystem part of the energy the environment at amsterdam is just wonderful everything is buzzing it has a chill vibe as well it definitely sends just like the creativity that is just coming together here at the event hackers from all around the world 56 countries are here to connect develop build amazing projects and i think that that energy is something that you want to be a part of the hackathons are a weekend event where people can come and get paired up with a team if they don't already know people just spend the time in the co-working space and get to work together and at the end you have judges who are really supportive and people who have been in the ecosystem building and get to kind of give feedback on the project and i think it's just a really collaborative process through the entire time [Music] i think this is probably the highest quality group of hackathon teams i've seen through each global it just is so impressive many of these are very practical that can be used today so really amazing projects in amsterdam this year has been like really good on the projects that i've seen around a lot of projects that are making it much easier to go into web3 and to make web 3 more accessible it's been uh amazing there's been five of us and we've worked for the whole weekend 36 hours and we're absolutely exhausted but yeah just had a lot of fun that's probably the main thing [Music] what keeps me here and keeps me energized is the fact that everyone's just willing to teach and there's so many people just willing to learn and if you come with that approach i think that you will definitely find a welcome warm receptive community waiting for you [Music] being in this experience where everything is organized for you done for you people are there to help from different teams from different organizations this vibe of actually being in webfree is just amazing [Music] really make them feel like they they belong and that they can do a lot more than they thought they could is is kind of the hope for all of our events we're doing 17 events this year and i can't wait to see what that looks like the year after [Music]
