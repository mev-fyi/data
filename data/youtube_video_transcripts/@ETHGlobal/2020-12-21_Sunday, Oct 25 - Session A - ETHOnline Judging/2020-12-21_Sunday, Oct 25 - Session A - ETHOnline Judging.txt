okay all right welcome everybody welcome to day two of judging we're really excited to see all of your hackathon projects today um my name is josh i'm part of the global team uh and i'll be your mc for this morning or afternoon or evening depending where you are uh so oh sorry let's back up there um this has been our biggest online hackathon ever so we've had 700 hackers stake and participate we had more than a thousand applications we have hackers from 65 countries and 19 time zones it's been absolutely massive and you know so we're having multiple rooms all in parallel all weekend to get through the judging um we've got 175 projects at the hackathon and we can't wait to see all of them the judging session yesterday was awesome and i expect today to be great as well so quick note on the format um how this is going to work is each team has up to four minutes for their video demo and then four minutes for questions so the way this will work is when you begin your demo uh we will start a timer for eight minutes and then when you have three minutes left and two minutes left there will be messages in the chat notifying you of that and so you can have up to four minutes of discussion and q a with the judges we will do a break uh part way through uh it's kind of up to the judges so we can chat about that in the chat about an appropriate time to take a quick break quick note on the criteria for judging so the judge is going to evaluate your projects on uh five factors uh technicality uh originality practicality uh you at ui and ux and then wow factor um they've just had a kind of a training session uh with kartik who runs judging youth global and have a kind of a metric to use to evaluate your projects on this basis uh as one really important note um these global events are not meant to be a competition of course there are bounties and prizes but really we want this to be an experience to to learn uh not everyone is necessarily trying to launch a company with their hack sometimes it's just about experimentation about learning about trying to get feedback and meet people collaborate so no matter what your purpose is what your goal is for the hackathon the judges here today are here to help you further that purpose and sorry these slides are like a bit doing the hard work today uh we have three amazing judges uh we have tamlin from vega protocol uh mariano who is just some guy who talks about defy a lot uh and christina from unicef innovate um welcome to the chat thank you so much for volunteering your sunday uh to help these teams and are looking forward to getting started all right so let's jump into the first demo uh let's get joseph on to the call and then joseph i will let you share your screen and share your demo cool give me one second here all right are we good yeah all good hi i'm joe gonzalez the founder of huddle in and i'm presenting the huddle in service for the etho online hackathon so what is hudderlin headline is comprised of two components the client app and the actual service api the client focuses on short form media with the built-in wall to connect to the service the service is a set of blockchain contracts that focus on providing social features and is open for all dapps to utilize and provides a set of standardized features the huddling service will provide many different features including services for nft defy and content licensing the hack for this hackathon was to implement one feature the staked content feature and here are the steps of the feature the creator creates content and provides it to the contract then there's a round for stakers to purchase a stake in that content and they're charged a fee that goes to the creator next the tipping round begins and all the tips go to the tipping pole and at any time a staker can close their stake and withdraw from the tipping pole according to their proportion of stake compared to other stakers a percentage of ownership to accomplish this hack i used biconomy for gasless transactions and thematic chain because of the speed of confirmations and small gas fees here is a simple demo that is ran on the client side the user logs into our platform and starts creating a video a little bit of video editing here you can see the monetization section for the options that will contact the contract and set up our object next the user is publishing the con to the contract and to our platform now it is complete and that is step one step two another user logs in and sees the content that they want to stake on they see the content here on the screen they hit the little gold button which brings up the menu that you see now and the different presets for the amount that they want to stake this user is going to stake 0.1 matic and it's already done next another user is also going to stake somatic as well they see the content they select the button bring up the menus but this user is going to stake 0.25 matic so they have a larger stake of the tipping pole the next step someone is going to add a tip to the tipping pool on this uh content they're going to add 10 matic so now there is 10 matic in the tipping pool that will be split amongst the stakers next one of the stickers wants to close their stake and claim their percentage of the tips in the tipping pole as you see there's a graph there of how much they're allotted a little bug there but the transaction went through in the last step the creator can also withdraw their earnings i didn't get a chance to implement that on the client side but it is available on the contract and the contract is fully done and ready on the matic mumbai network and that's my hack for the ethonline hackathon and here's some contact information thank you great thanks joseph over to the judges for questions and comments cool um hi let me um let me begin um that is that is pretty impressive you um you did this as a solo team uh yeah this is just myself but the you should know that the client itself is something um that i've been working on for the past year and a half and it does have an mvp this is a an llc already oh okay so yeah the client did look uh like extremely polished so this would be i would almost refer to as as like uh farming farming likes uh for content right it's how do you envision the the economy to uh right so the the really cool thing is that i'm trying to implement this as a service for many daps to be able to use and plug into which means uh this whole staking feature is actually just one feature where users can choose to enable this for their content to basically act like um i kind of describe it to people like you know you have a company you're buying stock in a company and that stock gives you some ownership of that company slash content so that's like just one feature of it um i had it on one of the other slides is that i want to also implement um a feature to utilize uh like the new d5 protocols but with content instead where people can stake nfts um and and and pass those around and basically add another feature to the service so this would just be one uh feature provided to the dapps that want to utilize the service and who would be paying gas in this situation so for the create post um to uh we're using um economy right now so it basically lowers the borders you know removes a bunch of the friction for for new users um so they can jump right in and start monetizing their content without any matic at all so a fresh new wallet can come in start and start receiving tips and then from there once they receive tips then obviously their function calls would use gas but yeah you totally do not need any gas to jump right in and start using it awesome and as you're thinking about this from the example that you presented of the content creator in this case the video of the doc what would be the model for the actual content creator to generate income if others are staking on it so uh what happened well it might be better if i move the slide around a little bit um so one of the steps is uh when they state content it they uh the person staking the content actually has to pay a fee to the creator so right now the fee is just an arbitrary number but it may be a dynamic number later in the in the future based on demand uh but right now it's just like a static if you have a set like 10 so if they want to stake 20 worth of matic 10 of that has to go directly to the the owner and then that is uh how the owner uh gets their income and they can get in a separate pool and they can uh do that pay out immediately at any time and what's what's the sort of governance behind like even that choice of the 20 percent does that get right so um the the 20 is really just an arbitrary number um i in the actual production use um what i would actually want to do is base it off of the demand for the content and make it a dynamic number that's constantly changing um and probably also base that some of those variables in that equation based off of the block time so how long it's been running how many users have staked over a certain block time stuff like that great right i thought this thank you very much we actually launched um an mvp of something very similar to this back in march um and then uh ethereum hit with defy and basically knocked our mvp down and we can't unusable right now so that's why this whole hack was a really high precedence for us okay well thanks joseph that's all the time we got for q a uh thank you for being part of it online and great drill good job thank you okay so next up is tokenized music uh ben i think we have you on the call already so i'll let you go ahead and play your demo all right hello everyone the title of my pack is tokenized music just a little bit about me my name is benjamin beatty i'm a devops engineer and i started getting involved with ethereum and cryptocurrency a little over two months ago so the goal of my hack was just to get introduced to ethereum blockchain development and my idea was to create a program that accepts an mp3 file is input and then converts it into an nft why would you want to do this i don't know but it seemed like something i could do so i went for it phase one as you might imagine was just learning i got my developer environment set up i chose python and brownie because that was what i was most familiar with and can't do anything with ethereum unless you know solidity so i read up on the documentation and did a bunch of tutorials for that phase two was all about nfts i looked up the specification uh followed some tutorials on how to set one up and found the open zeppelin contract which i used as a base i managed to create a skeleton project that deployed a basic nft token and i interacted with it a little bit on the blockchain and gained a greater understanding of that and then phase three i created this presentation so i did not get very far that was all i accomplished these past few weeks so i don't really have a demo to show but in lieu of that i'd like to share some of my takeaways so the first major thing is i gained a greater understanding of dapps and ethereum this was an excellent experience and i learned a lot and then more than that i got exposure to this great community a lot of the projects going on and a lot of resources i could use to go further and learn more and gain a greater understanding of what's possible so thank you so much thank you to everyone who helped make this event possible for this amazing opportunity and thank you all for listening to my presentation oh this is this is very interesting let me let me jump right in you know as a dev so what would you say was the part where you you know what was the most difficult um because you did pretty much everything right um you you started reading about things reading about how dapps work how what three uh opened zeppelin and then started development where did you say what's the part where you said okay this is as far as i could go in this three weeks well i think that the stopping point for me was trying to understand how i would do the actual idea i had which was put the mp3 in a token to me that was sort of like okay now i need to understand how to how do how like the entire blockchain is would work with that and to me that was a little uh nebulous at that moment it was like i don't really i don't really know what's going on here so that's kind of where a big wall was and would you say maybe that did you ask any mentors did you when you got to that point did you say well now i'm i'm really stumped or uh do you think with a little bit more time you could have figured it out was this you know mostly a tech thing or a or a project idea thing i think i could have figured it out with more time i mean part of part of the uh obstacle for me too was i i somewhat over committed with trying to do ethon line so i had other things going on that took me away from doing just this and so that played a role but i don't think there there was ever a point where i was like this is too much i can't do it it was just i needed to read more i thought the solidity documentation was really good and and kind of like you said i mean everyone in there were tons of people like asking questions on the the discord and things like that so i i think i could have gotten answers if i needed them so i guess i'll just jump in there and i guess building on that um given that this was your kind of first experience learning in this area what was the most exciting thing to you through this process and what's the one thing that you could have used to kind of accelerate your learning and just i think for us judges that also helps us as new folks are coming into the community how we can best support people with learning resources or mentor things like that what would be the one thing you would be looking for so the thing i was most excited about was just in i mean crypto in general was decentralized finance i thought that was super cool but i didn't understand enough to really want to pursue something like that for this hack and then the thing that was most helpful for me were just uh these tutorials i found on the internet for like setting up a development environment and making a basic token and just laying the groundwork for things like that i thought that was extremely helpful so i think tutorials are the way to go with that stuff awesome thank you um oh sorry oh no no please go ahead now go for it honestly uh i was just gonna say so after this do you still plan to you know do more development on ethereum do you plan to learn more about d5 and or is this like does this pick your interest it it definitely piques my interest i i do want to pursue further i don't know i don't know what the rate on that is going to look like exactly but i think for now i just want to learn more and try and become more familiar with it great well welcome to the community thank you um i was going to ask just out of curiosity then if you'd um heard or seen anyone else do something similar to what you've been trying to do because i'm quite interested in the applications and decentralized finance of nfts so i think there's a lot you could build on with the knowledge that you gained today and i was just curious if you've heard of anything the closest thing i saw was audience which is this platform for uh content creators to upload music and basically receive revenue for people who download it and but that wasn't exactly what i was trying to do i didn't see anything that was in the exact same vein thank you great well thanks ben it is it's always great to see projects that you know even though you didn't finish even though you were relatively new to this um you know you still submitted you still go on the call with the judges uh it's really positive to see so we hope you come back to the next hackathon and if you ever need learning resources uh we are happy to help direct yourself all right thank you all so much thanks man okay next up our next team is supply chain hub and i will let this team take it away and play your down okay so this is supply chain hub ah so this is the main page you have to connect using meta mask all for login the owner who is creating the supply chain will have to enter his gt so now organization name his name and his address he will now have to enter the product it's of the product uh that he wants to create a supply chain for so here we are creating a supply chain for n95 mask and we can add the property we can also modify the properties here he will have an option of customizing the supply chain as he wants he can now create a supply chain according to the number of members in it for example how many roles he has what will be the names of the rules here we have created a sample supply chain that contains four rows of manufacturer distributor or fast manufacturer dealer distributor and retailer these will be the functions that will be available for each role then a sample then a smart contract will be automatically generated using the python script which can be compiled and deployed on the matic network so the smart contract has been deployed and it's ready for you these are the contract hashes and transaction hash you have to create it as a chat app using ceramic so that the members of the supply chain can interact with each other so here this is a sample of how the chat will work it's very similar and has a user friendly interface just like whatsapp or any other messaging app and it's protected by ceramic and blockchain so they can chat with each other and fix prices this is the android app which will be used by everyone that was the login page which will come back later here you uh the user will have to add the address and then you can add the user of the next row for example the manufacturer can add a dealer the dealer can add the distributor and so on so once the uh manufacturer has added a dealer and the dealer can log in so owner has to add owner can add everyone so owner has now added the manufacturer and the manufacturer is logged in he will fill up his details and set up a profile with the logitech latitude of his factory other offices and so on and then he'll create lots of the products uh he will have to give the product ids the lot ids and according to what he selected for the supply chain the owner is selected for the supply chain in the beginning so you're the locked id batchfriend and the product id is as given and now the product can be tracked so it will now directly show you how the product will be tracked by a customer so the product customer can scan the product by code and then he will get the detail information of the part the product has gone through for example to the owner manufacturer dealer and retailer there will also be a link provided for the offices of the of each member of the supply chain through which the product has traveled through so this product brings 100 transparency of the user of where the product was and we have completely built it on and deployed it on matic chain thank you so we are open to questions right now great thank you so much for the demo um obviously relevant in the times that we live right now to be uh cognizant of supply chains um wondering at the very beginning of the demo you showed uh the contracts that are essentially pre-loaded in that you just click deploy can those be modified in that screen or does it need to stay as this they can be those contracts can be modified and they are not pre-stored or they'll be generated according to what the user wants for example the product properties or the type of uh supply chain here selected for example the product wants to be tracked through the lot id uh the product id or using both uh this will mainly affect the cash fees for the transaction to be saved and uh that's the main reason it can be auto generated uh if we customized it the user or the owner by creating the supply chain and make so this looks this looks very complete for um you know for a project that i see that it does a lot of things but um is there something that you wish you could have added in addition and i'm not saying that i know it has a a lot of things already in it but was there anything that you missed if you one thing you had more time yeah yeah one thing we were trying was to integrate the open gsn uh for cashless transactions so that the uh whatever the fee is right now the fees in the server while entering the product details and registering the user the fees of uh the gas fees are paid by the user but uh in the supply chain the owner wants to cut the products but it's more like likely that the owner should pay the fees so one thing we are trying was to integrate open gsm it allows a single pmaster to pay all the fees for the transactions so if we had more time we would surely implement this um i had a question in terms of do you know sort of maybe your vision for for this how would you see it interact with say payments along the supply chain unless i've misunderstood and you have built that in apologies do you envision do you see the potential to work with like enabling payments along the supply chain for invoices correct yeah that feature is already there uh the members of the supply chain can pay each other uh to their violent wallet directly so they will get the ids in the chat as we have shown so they can interact in the chat and then from there they can pay uh whatever the amount that is discussed are to the members you'll get the list of all the members in the supply chain in the chat window just like you get in whatsapp you get all the recent uh messages you get all the members or whoever you have a number here the members listed will be the members of the supply chain of that supply is your main audience for this application would it be the members in the supply chain or is it the end consumer uh the supply chain has been made such that uh it can be used for both purposes uh yes we are tracking it for the customer also from the customer's point of view to get information about fro where the product has traveled but even the owner or the manufacturer can check if where his product has currently reached so uh this you can view from both angles uh so any member or in or outside supply chain can track the product okay thank you so much supply chain hub uh appreciate you being part of each line online and great work thank you okay so we're going to move on to the next project um which is decentralized office so benjamin if you are on the call we're going to promote you shortly and once you're on please go ahead and play your demo uh decentralized office oh there we go great this a lot of features in the decentralized app user can save money by contributing and the whole big large fund contributor is automatically saving the fi protocol and issues our n higher income there is also image storage api and for developers you can easily use the api for your image and files and store in ipfs there are a lot of problem by which this project is highly required so we use we we use artificial intelligence to dictate the protocol that give higher income and then invest user fund automatically and that's the 5 protocol and the user will earn higher income there is also a marketplace where user can do buying and selling of items in the app [Music] this is how the credits union work the users contribute fund into the contract and contract dramatically take the fund and invest in these learning protocols and the user will inform this is based on the asus as known in africa user can also have personal savings by december will be rebuilding the mobile android app and we will have already implemented and start using our api from the bottom if you check the website you will see or google already have used our api project demo is in this location here we can see the market place user can buy and sell products let me see selling one [Music] and go to scene so the ship comes in here and quickly go to the credit union user can contribute and make withdrawal to the fight protocol here can contribute to my ongoing and decide to save as individual i say you want to say 0.58 contribute and it's been saved okay so this transaction can be viewed on the blockchain user can also decide to make withdraw a lot of features in this system thank you very much for watching office a lot of great thanks benjamin um i'll pass over to the judges for questions and comments okay so thank you so much for the demo i'm hoping that you can explain um a little bit more the connection between the aggregated d5 protocol and the marketplace and that you showed us okay the product itself is decentralized office so it gives you access you have an office that you can do a lot of things so users have the ability to stake fund and identify protocols and at an end so it has a lot of features because yeah i'm making a decentralized office you do a lot of things there so you can actually sell your products in the ethereum blockchain and also buy products like this in the ethereum blockchain so there is also other features like decentralized image storage which and developers can use as content delivery network for their images and files for their software which of course i'll show you an example of an e-commerce site in our location locally here i introduced my project to them and they saw it is useful and they already started using it right now that makes sense thank you if you have a chance to use ave compound or uma yet were you hoping yeah i made use of compound protocol i have a protocol so in like if you online you the product is online you can see the office on dot link you can stick is on test net so you can when you make contributes storage is sent to the blockchain which is goldband testnet um compound protocol is already being used and other protocols also i implemented them the one on the tests on the life is on compound protocol so if you you do a test on compound protocol you can view it on the blockchain govern blockchain um can i ask what uh stack did you use to uh to create the front end and uh you know did you use custom smart contracts for the yield aggregation yeah i i use them um express js which is nodejs the most popular instant i also use the bootstrap and oil to create the front end there is a twink framework which is a template engine i use twins and he is there is a and tablet edging for express js cool perfect thank you what is the next thing you'd like to do in this project [Music] um the way you see the projects i i'll still have to improve on it like right now i'm working on security to make sure that everything goes where the user will not lose funds when they use the system so right now i'm the session on the security of the system to see if everything is perfect i can launch it on the main network great okay thank you so much benjamin really appreciate you being part of the hackathon and great work and we're gonna move on to the next project thanks okay so the next pack we're going to see is peret or pair e i'm not sure if i'm pronouncing it the right way um so holly thank you on the call please play your demo when you're ready hi can you stay all good all right welcome to paris um first a little bit about me my name is holly i work as a blockchain developer at the sandbox my twitter handle is h.a atkinson if anyone wants to check out what i do um paris anyway is a very simple front-end devtool really that i really would have benefited from a few weeks ago when i was building on top of the uni swap v2 token factory it's a tool that can be used to search for and create token pairs on uni swap v2 as well as checking out the latest pairs um using the existing unisop v2 subgraph so a bit of a demo it's made with create eth app so it has a react front-end and it's deployed to pair.eth using ipfs and ens so i'm going to just go to unisort now and grab the token contract addresses for sand and ease and just drop those in here and what we should get is the correct address so 0x32dd yeah looks about right so this is for when you know two token addresses for existing tokens and you want to know what the pair contract address actually is um it may or may not be showing on the unit webpage for instance now with metamask as well this actually works across various networks so i'm on main net at the moment but this will also work on rink big early you name it the second feature that i want to show you is the ability to actually create a new pair contract if one doesn't exist so let's just grab some addresses again and i'm gonna go for this bit i'm gonna go on to a test network and just change accounts okay so let's drop in some fake addresses that one exists this one does not exist so for this yes we would actually like to create the pair contract here and i'm going to click confirm fantastic so we have now our new pair contract address on screen here finally the additional feature that i would like to add is the ability to search for all matching pair contracts with just one token address and that's something i'm working on at the moment so watch this hey holly hey well done i think i think this is really great um i really love that this came out of a problem that you had you were trying to solve um i'm not sure if you mentioned it but what did what sort of was your tech that you used to build out this basically the full text act really i mean i realized you've built this on ethereum but the front end and so forth sure so there's some open source uh software that i used um to create quite a dynamic front end um there's create ethe app which is a react front-end but it also includes um an example graph and um i was able to expand on the scripts in there with javascript so i added in the functionality for talking to the uni swap contract factory and i also added in um or check well changed essentially the functionality in there to use the existing uni swap v2 subgraph as opposed to build a new subgraph of my own i'm curious i know you mentioned that the search functionality would be the next thing that you would add i'm wondering if there's anything else that you would add or any type of integrations that you would want to kind of add to your project i would definitely want to see how i can integrate this more with what i do for my actual job because at the sandbox we have a number of different tokens so we have erc20s eoc 721s and we have recently launched our version of liquidity mining and there will be various iterations on that sort of um i guess train of thought so for me as well there's definitely a learning curve there in terms of learning more about the token functionality and how that can benefit from from more of a defy angle so that's a bit a bit high level because i haven't got any specific integrations in mind as such in terms of specific token functionality but that's definitely the direction i'd like to go in in terms of learning as i haven't been a dev for that long actually perfect and i guess just a quick follow-up to that is how much time do you anticipate that this tool will now save you know that you have it um it really depends um how good someone's javascript skills are i guess in terms of writing the scripts but um probably a couple of hours um you know i mean i just hope someone finds it useful really someone out there thank you thanks um and just expanding on that do you uh right now there's a lot of uni swap uh dashboards that are becoming really popular but then uh maybe one doesn't have what another does and do you think that with this uh like what you built that you could continue adding you know maybe new features that uh you know like surface new uh information about this uh token pairs because now that now that you can read them and you can access the sub graph you you can start showing more and more information on them right absolutely there's so much information there that could be shown and so many ways of adding more roots to the front end i kept it simple for this because of time constraints but absolutely excellent i yep i don't have any more questions there how did you find uh working with the with the subgraph was it was it easy to get into you need to read about that i needed to do a lot of reading it was my first time using um the graph at all and it was easy to make the http requests it was less easy to figure out how to write and integrate the gql query especially the one i'm working on at the moment where you need to send params and create eth app is actually using um apollo apollo client so there's a number of different tools there that i've had to do a lot of learning on to make sure they can work properly and i think that the the docs on the making nested queries with gql um could do with a few more examples to be honest but generally um using the subgraph has been um really straightforward great awesome awesome thanks holly really appreciate being part of the event great job cheers okay all right so next up is coinosis uh and i'm actually gonna play your video for you as i understand how this is gonna work um so let me do that and then we'll jump into q a as normal perfect thank you follow my own instructions i forgot the share audio button there we go coinosis works uh first i have created an event that is called the demo for it online so i'm going to be with my colleague juan where side chain of x die which is the production chain that we're using has been super useful useful so i'm just signing my transaction is going i'm going to deposit to x die well in this case it's spoa and juan is going to do the same when the event start that is going to be in three minutes we are going to be able able to uh join a call and we're not going to have a class or a lesson but it's just thinking or we we have developed this thinking on an educational environment oh so here i can join the call um that money is going to be uh distributed among juan and i according to the collapse that each of one of us have received opportunity for us to show the word we have been doing with emilio silva too he's part of the team he was the main developer or he's still the main developer and juan and i were more on the educational part thinking how to use this platform as a way to improve the learning system hey this is me i'm juan from colombia and yeah in a minute you are going to see juan that is joining from berlin he is also colombian but he has been living there for a while and we are going to show you how to send some claps and reward people for their knowledge they are staking some money and if they do well they are going to get money according to the recognition of the group to receive some feedback from the awesome mentors that we have had through this hackathon so just to be clear this was a development that emilio and i have been doing for the last four months and juan is helping us on the educational part he has some knowledge on educational experience so that was the team emilio juan and another one and juan david as you can see on the screen so here in the we are in the step two of our methodology juan has joined to this call and we're going to explain how the collapse works and he's also controlled to introduce himself my name is project and i'm going to show you how it works the clap rewards systems very passionate about about education and academic tools like a way we see it like a way of tokenized tokenized uh participation exactly and yeah as you can see i'm recording my screen i have sent to juan 23 claps and he have sent me five claps so let's round up this number to 25 so let's imagine that at the end that's going to be the result 25 claps for juan who has been working in the education ecosystem longer than me so he was explaining something to me and at the end five out of 25 is something like one fifth of the stake that in this case is for x die so that is going to be one fifth of the reward is going to be back to me and four out of five of those units are going to be back as juan mentioned this is a way to tokenize our knowledge sorry for the audi quality but i guess you understand the concept yep uh hey one that was that was interesting um so you showed a call between two people and you know both of them had to stay right um you mentioned that this this would most likely work for bigger groups can you share like really quick how um how that how you expect the the tokenization of of clubs to work you know maybe with a classroom of 10 people or for sure uh we have done this as uh some lessons so for example we have these uh applied course of that development so we have an instructor and we have around 15 people joining to the call and so they were staking some ease at first we're using it but then we changed to x died just to make this uh viable in a financial way because i mean deploying a contract was super expensive uh so we have had for example five lessons and we we can play with the dynamic of the price so for example first it was low like 0.2 if the second class was 0.6 so you are more invested and then we decrease that so we can play different sort of games but it's really interesting to see how you prepare a class but you have different students joining and you upgrade the level of the conversation because people have the incentive to participate so the instructor roughly takes between 30 and 40 of the whole deposit but then you have different voices that they can get 20 and they learn and they get more but if you get less that means that you learn more than you teach so it's a cycle that reinforce and sell so people are super excited to be back to our events i'm wondering based on what you presented if i was part of a call and i wanted to actually increase the amount that i staked for that call because i'm finding the content just so riveting am i able to do that no i mean we just define we we start to do two important things on the blockchain the minimum fee which is like fixed on the ending of the event that's what we have have stored on the on on the blockchain and then that allows you to distribute things but also with something that i want to mention that we have developed too is that we are able to stream this so we don't want to have any extra layers so people can see the stream on our youtube channel that way i mean if you don't have the money or you're not that interested yet you can see the stream but if you want to be part of the club and the chat and be part of the call then for the next time you can do that okay thank you welcome what was your biggest learning on this seems yeah thank you for us the challenge with juan the guy was mentioned he was living in berlin and he's in the education system is to understand how we can use this on d graph i mean what we want to open the data and i think this is a useful way to signal your skills that are going to be recognized and recognized by the group so if you attend to a different event some people say yes one knows a lot about x uh skills so that's a way to show to the market or to different groups your verified knowledge i just want to mention that i likes mariano's reverse frames i also sheer for river oh that is so good thank you yeah juan fernando okay anyway don't um i think i have like one minute can you mention really quick the stack oh the time is up but um go ahead you mentioned the stack yeah for sure we have used solidity uh we have recently switched to um xdi as a side chain uh the back end is in node.js the front is in react js and we have integrated uh youtube api to do this opening the classes so yeah that's great perfect you're welcome great project uh thanks for moving for us today now thank you for the space and well have a good day so we're now going to take a uh our midway break um so we'll take a break for about 10 minutes give the judges a chance to refill on coffee uh have a snack and then when we come back uh we will be seeing the demo from stop loss so see you back here in 10 minutes folks and then we'll finish off the last four projects great thank you okay we'll get started in just a minute here it's officially two minutes left for the break uh once the judges are back though we can get started okay everybody's back so i think we can get started uh rama and manola i assume you're back as well let's get into it okay so welcome stop loss and i'll just turn over to you to play your demo and we'll get going hi this is adrian from star plus and happy to present for it online so we've seen this past year uh this rallies exchanges such as unisop starting to compete with some trade exchange it's so exciting and we've seen that services that were usually provided by some trash exchanges such as lending insurance derivatives are now replaced by distressed protocols so stop loss is a protocol to make stop loss and take profit orders on top of amms automated market makers so that's what we built for it online on top of unit swap we allow users to set a maximum amount of impermanent loss they are ready to take up so the mechanism is that you you provide liquidity to a uniswap pool and you choose a maximum amount of impermanent loss and then there is a mechanism that makes so that there are liquidators that will liquidate your position as a lp when you need to so we have a factory that creates stop-loss pools for each uni-swap pair and in this pool we store the lp tokens and the stop loss or take profit ories and there are liquidators that will liquidate nlc positions okay so let's get to the demo now we are on coven right now we have access here to liquidity providing to four pools die usdc usdt and wtc pairs with eth so we deployed fake ether for that and fake tokens so here we logged in as a user that is alice and she already has some dyes and fake eater so we can see that the pool is live you could swap some dye for fake ether on uni swap but she won't do that in the demo she will provide liquidity to the pool through stop loss so here she wants to provide 200 as liquidity in the uni swap pair we will convert that into lp for her and she sets a guarantee of die so here 180 die that means that she sets a stop-loss order of 180 if there are too much impermanent loss she will be liquidated and she's guaranteed to have at least 180 dies so here that's what she's doing she's sending the die the smart contract of stop plus converts that into liquidity into the pool and stores the lp tokens and also the stop-loss order so here we see that she provided 200 dice and she is guaranteed 180. the current value is 1.99 there were some uni swap fees in the process and we can see that there is a health ratio indeed when the position will be too close to 189 she will be liquidated by liquidators so now for the demo we'll have somebody that is really rich in fake tokens that will make a swap that will affect the market by nearly 10 and we will see how it affects alice since it created some impermanent loss in dai so back into ali's point of view we see that now the current value of our position as liquidity provider is 181 it's too close to 180 and so the health ratio is under one and she can get liquidated being liquidating means that somebody can come use the guns that she has this 5.7 sell them for die and send her back 180 die and the liquidator will keep the rest this is the way we incentivize liquidators so let's see the process in action we're going to take the point of view of the liquidator he's using the ui for the hackathon but really he would just create a boat connected to the graph api of stop plus and so now he's doing the transaction that does everything we said it removes the uni swap liquidity of alice and sell that for die send her the 180 die that she's grown until and he keeps the the rest so here's some fake ether so now let's get back to ali's point of view we can see that now she has an order that has been executed and she got back the 180 die that she was guaranteed let's see that yes she has 280 like so that's it for the demo thanks for watching and thank you nathan for the help that was a that was a really good demo i like that you use the uh the farming ui from yam that we've all come to know and created something new there um i'm wondering is there a way have you thought about uh you know instead of just having liquidators that uh is there a way for you know to add maybe a an alarm clock or something so that it is my own account that does uh the the liquidation for example so i actually started with this idea and i've made some tests so basically i created the first way for me to do that was to create transaction by with your accounts with like zero gas price and that would pay the miners uh if the conditions are met but actually the miners they don't look for like if there's no gas they don't look for it they don't process the transaction and see if there's a gain for them so we could do that but it would need collaboration with the miners and tell them okay connect to this api and and these transactions are okay to be you know that but yeah that's the other but it's more complicated because it needs collaboration for with the miners for the hackathon right but yeah i also was uh really uh really enjoyed the demo so thank you um just wanted to get a sense can you walk us through your thought process of what was your inspiration for this and if there were particular products that inspired you to come up with your demo yeah so but basically all protocols that that exist today for me they replace what some transactions were doing before so first we had the exchange and then now we have loans we have stable coins we have a lot of things that since now we're in control of our custody uh there's no party that can do stuff for us and so that's where it comes from then i think that this is defined if i is creating protocols to replace suntris parties that's that's the kind of yeah uh where to from here if you had more time what would you what would you do now with this so now i think that uh first going to mainnet like really secure the contract for now they are not super secure the oracle is a trap [Music] i haven't yet analyzed completely uh how it is resist resistant to price manipulation and of course like once we have this product on my net like in the layer one the question would be where amm will be on a r2 and and do do they need that like this is like long-term vision like doing layer two well i hope that you that you continue working on this because uh i i am an lp um on several pools and uh you know some of them do require a lot of manual uh that you have to be on top of them all the time so this is something that i would personally use i think it is really impressive thanks a lot and i also hope that other protocols will use that too because it's just more complex but yeah thank you very much and happy to to be connected with people that might be interested so thank you great thank you adrian thank you nathan um all right we're going to move on to the next project which is pool loan this is another one where i'm going to play the video so if we can get this team onto the call i will start the demo for them and then we can move into q a as normal okay here we go welcome to pool loan project it's a decent life's chip fund platform the motivation behind creating this platform was to incentivize all the participants of the platform there are two types of yields which gets generated from the platform first yield comes from the landing pools which is am stable and our way on whole amount of the pool second ill comes from the amount the loan claimer left while claiming the loan whosoever will claim the loan at later auction will earn more profit the future enhancements could be to use zero knowledge proof as credit score system to support no collateral pools we want to support multiple landing platform to incentivize the participants we also want to make pool loan available on layer 2 solution to reduce transaction cost let's jump over demo these are the available pools the data comes from the sub graph using marlin cash for better and fast accessibility instead of smart contract you will be able to participate in any loan pool by depositing collateral amount and at every auction interval there will be an auction the number of auction will depend on the number of total participants in the pool so if there are five participants then there will be four auctions and in every auction there will be a fair chance to win the loan if you bid highest then you will be able to get the loan if you bet amount to die then you will get 46 die loan and that to die will get stored in the pool and at the end of the pool that to die will get distributed among all the participant all the participants will also get the yield generated from lending platform which is away and am stable anyone can create pool from here so i am creating a pool i created a pool of am stable these data get fetched from the sub graph there is a sub graph which we have built so you will be able to see loan pool participants bid this works using factory contract and we are using marlin cash to fetch these data because that is faster i can participate in this pool by depositing 30 musd as a collateral the pool requires at least two participants so it is saying me to wait for at least one more participants to join the pool now i am trying to participate from another wallet but i don't have any m usd in this wallet so i can swap my asset using 0x protocol uh so i connect musd by swapping another assets as there are two participants now i will be able to bid in this auction which is going on auction will close in one hour 55 minutes so yes i am bidding one am usd now i placed my bid off 1 usd as uh this requires more time i am showing you another rule where i won the loan so this is an away pool where i uh who won a loan after bid because i i already won one uh bid so i cannot take part in another bid so pool will close in one minute 12 seconds so i will show you after that so pool uh already closed so i can claim my final yield so i already claimed my final lead thank you for your participation and i the total number of participants was two so there was only one auction here i can see how much you like it i get one yield because i already got a loan of 48 die thank you thanks very much for the demo just wondering if you can uh summarize the economic model for the pools for us yeah so the economic model for the pool is first of all there are pool creators which are which will learn the freeze from the pool so they will be uh configurable by the pool creators then there will be a participants like for example 10 participants so they'll have to stake a collateral start of the pool and they can uh bid on the loan so anyone can bid on the loan and the highest bidder will get the loan so it works similar to a cheat fund uh so in a chat fund or a committee there are people and they actually can take a loan and uh but the thing here is like uh there is a collateral so because we cannot trust anyone so we have kept a collateral for now so that that collateral is equal to the amount of loan so if anyone does not so if anyone takes a loan and then does not pay the stake then it is a safeguard kind of thing i think that's a super interesting way of kind of dealing with the issue of um people you know not knowing if they're going to pay it back or not it's holding that collateral i think it would be interesting to also think how you expand that for people who might not be able to put the collateral in how can they still bid um and know at least from my perspective that would be something that's super interesting but thank you very much for the demo i appreciate it yeah yeah so we are already thinking about that how can anyone take a loan uh because in a traditional trade fund people do trust each other and there are some ways to do it in d5 as well we can create a zero knowledge proof for uh credit score or something like that or even a white list so yeah but yeah we didn't find enough time to implement that but yeah would be really nice to do uh any other questions you can marry on if you have oh uh yeah i was waiting to see if you had any but um what would you say was uh the most difficult uh part of this project uh would you say was interfacing with uh the other d5 protocols was it building uh your own contracts the ui so i would say that the most difficult part was like we wanted to have platforms where we can generate yield so we had difficulties in integrating with them so we wanted a plug that they use uh the pool creator should be able to plug in any platform currently we are supporting only two away and unstable but we wanted it to be like it uh out of the box supports every platform like uh even by on or even compound but we could not achieve that because the contract itself would be really huge and it would exceed gas limit so we could only have these two but yeah some thinking on the design and i'm sure we can integrate uh like any e8 platform yeah for sure uh i think that for for a hackathon project just uh integrating with two was uh was already very impressive i think yeah and yeah sorry uh just to complete that so other challenge was like building it completely serverless so it is only client code but uh i would say sub graph really have helped a lot in that so big kudos to sub graph really awesome okay thank you so much full loan great project great demo uh thanks for being part of the event thanks thanks thanks everyone okay so we move on to the next project uh decentracraft uh kareem are you on the call yes so i understand that i'm to play your video and i'm going to start kind of at the three minute mark now i'm just noting that your video is a bit longer than four minutes and so that's going to cut into your time for q a if you do want me to stop at some point and jump into q a just just say so on the call but i'll start the video at the point i was in structure too thanks josh for that uh hello yeah we can hear you hello yeah josh can we start from 220 sure i'll do that thanks the landowners are community members who own pieces of land in virtual worlds like the centromere so what landowners do they come to the space and they start seeing different packages of resources that they can avoid players when they play games on the virtual land so here we see a common resources package containing wood containing a stick with some attributes you will seeing another more advanced resources package having rock iron and some collectibles like hammer and axe and here's something more advanced that has gold diamond service as a collector we're seeing a lot of attributes over here so what the landowner does he buys that paying a certain amount i've already done that for you so i need to go through this right now and i'll purchase some resources packages as a land owner so right now i do have a resource package it's like a wholesale it's like a store that buys a lot of items to sell it to people so now we can find a huge supply of rocks iron hammers axes and other stuff and you can find the id of this resources package now what the user what landowner does is that he put that into code and store the wording players with those resources when they play the game now moving into the game itself so here we've built a demo in the central land itself to demonstrate how the santa craft works so josh can we skip to 5 10 please so we'll build this on one of the central lens demos sdk demos now if you can skip to 559 and okay so the game's into the plugin but here we go well as a player and then what happens we get awarded with some resources for playing the game and here we open the decent craft menu and we find the resources that we are building we find some basic resources like wood gold diamond rock iron and we find some items like sticks like hammers that i've been awarded as a player for playing a game in the centerland world so the interesting thing is those items i'm going to be finding in any game and in any virtual world that supports the center class so if i go into some other game and let's say crypto boxes or sandbox and i start playing i'll get to more items and i'm going to find all the items over here and then later on we're going to have crafts so we have a way to craft more advanced items using the basic resources that we have and all those crafts and resources and items are being added into the nintendocraft world using decentralized governance process where the community chooses what type of resources and items gets added essentiacraft enabled a lot of creators and nft developers to create a lot of valuable stuff a lot of nfts that are backed by real value the value of playing the game itself not just releasing the nfc and selling it to people which gives that a new economical model the santa craft right now is being integrated with strain which is one of the nft collectible projects that had launched a week ago and right now we're building the nft structure for strain to benefit from this enterprise thank you very much for being with me today and if you have any questions please please reach out to me thanks and have a good day great thanks kareem over to the judges for questions and comments great thanks josh looks like you had a lot of fun on this project it's great yeah yeah um how does it i i'm not much for gamers i'm curious how does it compare with sort of other uh other what else is out there for this kind of thing yes so basically uh i'm not sure are you aware of decentraland yes yeah so i've been an early supporter for decentraland and i love the idea from the central land i've seen how it developed over the past couple of years so and i started i'm a land owner myself in central land and i started participating in a lot of events that are happening in central i think the thing that is missing right now in a lot of the virtual worlds is the this attachment thing is something to get the players come back to play the game again and again and again i've seen my kids play minecraft a lot they love it they love playing it every day and they love coming back to it so i've started thinking and brainstorming about what the things that bring people back to a game and i think it's this attachment to building something out of the play that you keep playing you start building stuff and you start owning this stuff so i started brainstorming about how to bring that to a decentralized world and this is where the aircraft came so basically a player start playing the games and land owners and game developers start awarding players with various resources that players can start using to different nfts and more advanced [Music] so this basically gives the nft itself more value because it is backed by the playing power of the player itself the amount of time he puts into the game it gets to the nft itself and it uh powers the value for the nft which gives it more value in in the future all right thank you uh i think one of the most interesting ideas that you mentioned was uh the fact that you could use nfts on you know different games it's like i would love to you know something that i uh that i crafted on a game that is mine to be able uh you know to use it as an nft or on another so that i i want you to keep exploring that because i think that is that is going to be very interesting yeah thanks for that that's the purpose right now and that's what we're doing with one of projects train we're doing exactly that to bring more utility to the nfts that are being created great okay thank you so much cream uh great demo and thanks so much for being part of online thanks josh and thanks everyone nice to be with you okay so we're moving on to our last demo of the day and this is going to be from trustless insurer so drew and elliot please go ahead and show us your demo ensure currently on ethereum over 250 million dollars in crypto has been stolen because of smart contract bugs and vulnerabilities every day because this industry is so new and smart contracts are so new we discover new attack vectors and new ways for hackers to steal investors money we have all these different attack vectors here reentrancy dex price manipulation flash loans these have all been created these are essentially new categories of software bugs in the current d5 insurance market nexus mutual is the leading provider and their insurance underwriters also decide if claims are valid and now this is a very clear conflict of interest because why would you say a claim is valid if you lose money if you lose your money if that claim is valid and you vote for that so these agreements should be immutable binding agreements between all parties with no wiggle room and nexus mutual policy holders experienced numerous back and forth during the bzrx act and ultimately you know they didn't have to ensure that because the terms of their contract said hey we only have to ensure we don't have to ensure oracle price fees and the contract worked as intended and 53 out of 56 of claims that have been made on nexus mutual have been denied our solution is completely trustless insurance protocol our smart contracts will evaluate claims without any third parties voting or any oracle data so this means that there is no conflict of interest because essentially a computer makes a decision and the computer is not biased uh the claims are automatically paid out to users when a valid claim is made so there's no waiting around there's no voting there's no waiting period it's just if there's a valid claim you are paid out there's two parties in this architecture so there's the people who are buying insurance and they make claims and then there's insurance underwriters the insurance underwriters provide capital to underwrite smart contract risk and they earn their yield um on their capital for insurance users and they have no say in whether a claim is valid or not so the insurance underwriters you know they can't vote in their own self-interest so now let's go to quick demonstration of the software you trust us insure connect your web3 wallet and once you're in here you can see that our insured balance of this usdc token that we've deposited into y-iron vault for yield farming we've already have one token insured and we have a total staked amount of two usdc so let's ensure that other token just enter in our amount we can also read about what our policy covers um and that will make us a hundred percent whole if there is a hack so clicking share tokens and then if we come back and refresh you can see that we now have insured two of our usdc and it's our balance so we're going to connect our hacking account which is a different account than the one that we use for insurance we can see this is the wiring usdc balance currently and we currently have zero usdc so we're going to hack it and it's going to simulate a hack where we steal all the tokens from yr and usdc and then once we do that you can see our balance is updated and if we refresh we can see that wiring uscc balance is now zero so now the protocol has successfully been hacked plus the hack has occurred with our main uh wallet that we use to ensure our tokens we come in here we see why earn has been hacked because the balance is zero now but we do have this insured token and this is our usdc balance so we come in here and we decide file claim we learn the terms of the claim if it's uh if it's shown that there was no hack then there'll be a penalty for attempted insurance fraud but here it's been hacked so we're going to file a claim go through and once we do that we'll be paid out in whole and we can see our balance is now 200 updated hey drew interesting project so um in this case for example you i would interact with the wiring vault via some proxy that you uh that trustless insurer provides right and so that would take care of you know for example the yield that i would earn and or a better question what does a protocol have to do if anything to integrate with this or is it just on the user side that they would interact with like uh middleware provided from you yes so so from the user side they just call a smart contract and go through essentially the claims process and during that claims process for each different market that will ensure we'll have essentially adapters and connectors to figure out how much based off of like you know let's say you have 10 uh y usdc let's just say then we'll say okay there's a certain ratio that we'll get by calling the wiring contract and so we'll say okay based off of this ratio we should receive this amount of usdc back and have you given any thought to what a dispute process might look like and if someone doesn't agree with how a claim is paid out so because this insurance is pretty much like binary there there is no process like that so when you buy it you just understand that hey it's just gonna like we're only ensuring like if that usdc gets stolen or if a protocol that's somewhere in this stack of d5 gets hacked and you can't get all your money back out um yeah this is interesting um what's sort of your vision for this sort of yeah how are you looking to evolve this yeah so i i think that um in terms of like a long-term vision i want this to be a protocol where um essentially an lp can provide any kind of token that they want um for people to be insured against and then so essentially kind of create a marketplace for insurance so you can spin up a marketplace and say i want this insurance to be settled in cusdc and i want to ensure uh wide usbt so there can be different so lp providers like liquidity providers can essentially provide a productive asset to the pool so they can essentially double dip on yield earn yield and compound and then also earn yield on the premiums that they're generating but then also another user essentially is making a bet that compound is safe but that you know if wiring blows up they can still get paid out so yeah it's like the contract the insurance contracts a little bit like a derivative for sure it's contract is all codified and some people are understanding exactly which primitives there or which d5 protocols are being showed against and then people can make a two-way market on that is am i interpreting that correctly yeah exactly so you can as you'll be able to kind of mix and match and you'll be able to ensure different protocols with different with different assets cool thank you thank you guys great well thank thank you so much trust us insurer uh and that concludes our last demo for the day thanks for being part of the event uh great job okay thank you everyone that presented today thank you to our judges for taking time on your weekend to do this we really appreciate it and we know the hackers do too uh that is it for this session um and look forward to seeing you all in the discord um judges if you have any questions about any of this i think you're already in touch with kartik you can also message us in the discord if you're unsure about entering scores or anything like that so thank you so much and thank you to our wonderful volunteers rama and manila who've been working behind the scenes to make this run very smoothly thank you everybody as always have a great sunday cheers thanks everyone
