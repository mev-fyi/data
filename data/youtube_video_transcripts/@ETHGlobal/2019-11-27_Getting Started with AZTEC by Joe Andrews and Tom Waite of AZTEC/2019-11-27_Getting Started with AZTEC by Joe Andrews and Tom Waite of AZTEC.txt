he was trying to use it adjustable while we're waiting [Music] [Music] oh all right so we're gonna get stuck so yeah so welcome to Aztecs developer workshop we're gonna kick off basically just without this port service so if you need any help throughout the weekend we're gonna be available on Dysport throughout so just scan QR code and to the tongue post any questions you've got them will be over time so if we can start with what are we doing at this act upon this weekend so we've got two bounties so we've got a thousand dollars for the best use of a stick in any doubt and then our second prize is for the best use elastic and a novel pin tech or d5 application to help you realize these tools this weekend so we've got job as a head of product we've got myself is an engineer's cool so always that stick just before we get into our white box important so as tech is a praxis and why do we think practices in water world as a few different reasons so first of all traditional financial assets need privacy and they operate by default life we think isn't a prerequisite for build or some of the assets on chain and lastly allows third parties access to the user to control third party access to commercial and personal data so when this in mind boys a stick so Aztec is a interoperable privacy network printing on a theory we have a toolbox of different zero knowledge proof that I like to build and privacy to adapt with custom logic we are extremely gas efficient and to just standard private send transactions so for me to transfer private value from person a to person B currently costs about 800,000 gas use Gnostic and he happy one one zero is going to be merged in the next bring it down to about 200,000 guests another really important thing to consider when you're using thermal prism looking at these privacy's technologies is how long they take to construct operate so it has to do it in milliseconds on Android phone so if you just move on so there's two toolkit so a stick is you can think of as a family of zelnite proofs each type of proof allows us to do a different type of business logic so you've got things like send swap you can change swap confidential assets you can calculate interest rates and zero knowledge assets so you can stream interest in so much and we've got a demonstration that drill and my talk through later on about something called our long duct which does exactly this you can mint directly these zero noise assets burn them and you can construct inequalities on them and so you can say that soon I'll just say a is greater than to mind so not just for example things like that so that's not talking so what can build a nest egg there's various different things and these are just some ideas to maybe get you started and so security token platforms loans bonds you can make all these confidential using US debt has been previous hackathons where people are quite well integrated as tech solutions into these type of assets you can build decentralized private payment services and there's an example that combining house tech with some sort of side chains give you remember but defy applications and but we're more excited about what you guys are going to build on the creativity of you as what brings us to this weekend cool so with that I think Joe is going to take over and do some demos of our case yes I do a quick demo with our Senate kind of giving you like a kitchen sink before possible I kind of started kind of help you get started and be like an angel pointing so this is a or people are they're not very used to kitchen sink example what you can build with aspect he uses seven proof the swap through the different food the range groups all the curve is all idea come back and blow this it's a good starting point contracts and also and it's ultimately through this the last thing we're going to do the purpose of this map is to create private life we're going to create an area where the notion is private so hundred thousand national of die and interest rates which incent pollute and very short life so images in this so as you can see here with Triple A grade class in that moment we use the mid-40s but is one night on the right hand side we are Elend them so we can see the encrypted balance below Crips yes technically there is a value on the left hand side representing Bora we can't currently see encrypted value that we can see the public variables which describe the other metrics we can also think some of these private we want to do its example just the nationalist primary so the next step is to view one of the loans this table here so a lender can decide to submit a new request for these loans in a there's one do you request in which we can now the next step is to then set the line so in this instance we can acceptable the load by swapping a hundred thousand 0h died four hundred thousand units of the location of the local mate to be traded if you want to do separately markedly expect it's one request settle here with less gonna give ourselves Liberty City browser you see the legs just accept and the really cool thing about Aztec is abusive you can now stream interest on that though in in real-time so as you can see both of these now have a ticket which is the interest is coming out so the borrower here can now site withdraw can't be accrued interest in real time using are difficult free so you can see here that they're using combinational proofs it's like plugs absolutely mean you have to use or second derivative arithmetic sentiment work so the amount of change that you can withdraw a certain amount die in real time from the land another interesting interesting thing about this is if the lender decides to withdraw the entire loan amount like so and as interest accrues and the loan we're now going to risk going to default there's now enough collateral scoring alone all of this happening to make the load being good standing and we can use a series of proofs to actually mark the learners default and potentially move platform from the lender having partners were contracted to the borrower we can this program add some people who say instead of the old world you'd have to go to port save the loads of default and then fight for that not want to be transferred it's not a contract world you can actually prove on chains in large that there's not enough platform account and any platform associated this could then be released quite a smart contract we can do that here it's valid and then some people if though this is really examine not expecting the kind of functionality this event that it's a good place is going to get some ideas of what's possible by different sets of proofs the great thing about the toolkit is you couldn't there the proofs as many letters you want to get the functionality you need so the next step I think is to quit these and get everyone lets you download the ether whoever stuck so you had to our github employers are getting national kids most every study registering smoke on track beside the eat burgers on campus it has so when you get this running together page like this as adults [Music] this means it comes quite hard to keep track of these names and that's legit doing keys to put the values this will be solvable suddenly IPS can pass by max master to have apparently so we built a developer extension while waiting for those like these to be passive them keep track of all users notes without such ever doing keys and make it much easier for developers for that step all the exception does is store to please a public key and a private key they don't doesn't only on sense it just allows you to be premise value of an asset note and that's still owned by metamath wall ever provide incentives and the extension injects into the page and as that object on the window which exposes a set of eight guys this is just a subset here for the demo but documentation here this yeah so let's just talk through this that's when you amazing Aztec and first thing is great the keys and the password and then you'll be asked to make this piece a different provider said it's just a piece of country subscribe to link my trust account the keys to this storm is an exception so sinus send it to the left once we've done that the every time a page requests access to particular assets and sensual very much it will pop up saying what the plan is and what accepted its perspective so once you approve that [Music] we start what we're going to do here is we're going to use the as an extension to deposit some PLC 28 things into a steno pool and then we're going to send some of those tokens around to another metals and what we will see is that the extension will enable a web page in both cases and have real-time access to so it's just just injecting to the page for any given up sex [Music] yeah well I will keep trying to do is that as I'm about to this nation working working web browser and then starters and to Leavenworth we walk our plan which is the simple version of this which is the same demo you've just done say you're sorry spinach death which was exactly the same thing boys the same Aztec assets but instead of being massively responding
