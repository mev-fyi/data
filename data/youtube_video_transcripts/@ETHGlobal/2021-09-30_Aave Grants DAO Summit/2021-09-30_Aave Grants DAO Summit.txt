[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of beef global and welcome to the avid grand style summit so all of you are watching this thing on eatglobal.tv um this is the live platform we're using for all of the talks today uh keep in mind that as we uh run the rest of the talks if you have any questions for our panelists you can ask all those questions directly on the chat and also everybody who logs in to the chat will get a op nft token for your participation so be sure to say hi and ask any questions this event is organized by eve global and for those of you who don't know what the global is uh global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to get 1000 developers into the web3 ecosystem and we primarily do this by running hackathons and summits so eat online is our biggest event of the year and so far in each global's history we have over 1150 hackers from 77 different countries participating in the hackathon from 19 different time zones on top of that we're doing an incredible set of summits to talk about everything that's happening in our ecosystem we had our first summit last friday which was on nfts and creators today is the avec grand style summit tomorrow will be our governance and dao summit and next week is filled with or the next few weeks are also filled with amazing summits so we're going to cover the compound grants ecosystem on the 7th on october 8th we're going to talk about everything that's happening in the world of dev tools in october 15th is going to be the finale of our hackathon where we're going to talk about all the top projects as well as talk about the future of heath 2. so let's get into the other greats ecosystem uh we have an amazing setup yep just set lined up today uh we're going to kick us off with a couple remarks from stani from ave then we're going to go into a panel around just the landscape around how grants are set up in the d5 ecosystem then trios is going to talk about the feature of ave grand style and then we're going to talk about what does it mean to successfully receive a grant from the ave ecosystem and we're going to have a showcase on some of the incredible projects that have been funded by the ave grants program and they're going to talk about what they're working on and how you may get involved and then lastly we'll have shreyas uh give some closing remarks on how they are thinking about the future of a grant and will be a wrap so before we kick off with our very first talk i want to welcome stani who is the founder and ceo of ave to share some opening remarks on the future of the ave ecosystem so without further ado let's welcome stani thank you kartik for the uh great inter introduction and it's uh amazing that uh we have been able to have this opportunity to organize um the grants of a groundstall summit and uh i think it global has done a lot of uh good work in terms of like expanding the uh developer ecosystem and culture around uh not just in ethereum but in the web3 space in uh general and uh the other grounds thou summits is is quite important especially like because like the objective of bronze tao is to uh propagate uh culture and uh especially the developer culture around the different ecosystems that we have in uh not just decentralized finance but in the tree and especially the overground styles uh mission is is pretty much to propagate this culture within the other ecosystem and grants can be anything essentially there they can be a small uh pull request into current infrastructure that there is in in the the protocol uh the the front end that is uh community governed at the moment or any other kind of a tooling that relates into the uh ecosystem or it can be just something that benefits uh beyond what uh ava is today and i would say kind of like the vision for everything is that uh these protocols and all the tools and everything that is created in open uh source fashion uh should be owned and governed by the community and should be something that will help and inspire uh newcomers and other developers to build new things and also educate themselves and learn more about what is decentralization why it's important and and why we why we need to nurture this culture and decentralization especially important because not for the perspective of being able to build things anywhere from any part of support and contribute code but also being able to participate and govern these protocols because if we don't actively govern the protocols uh essentially we lose the power of decentralization which means having a wider consensus on protocols that in the future will uh be maybe servicing uh hundreds of millions or even billions of users so uh this is kind of a short introduction on on uh the of the grand style summit and during this summit it's important uh that we are able to give you as much as context on on what are uh what are these ground styles are actually doing and what kind of uh grants you can actually apply what kind of grants you can apply for different kinds of projects that you're building how to contribute uh and how to find also friends to help you to contribute into and we'll delve into multiple uh grant style programs uh and that's about it amazing well thank you so much for that uh interest donnie and i think this is a perfect segue for our very first panel so for this i'm going to introduce uh four amazing people stanley from ave who's already here we'll invite robert lesner from compound neo boris from the unit swap grand secret system and moderating this chat will be imran from d5 lines and uh we'll kind of cover what the entire d5 grant landscape looks like and some of the lessons learned so without further ado let's welcome all of our amazing panelists and let them kick this off [Music] awesome thank you so much kartik um and so i i was a part of the grand obvious grand style and i've been interviewing many of the applicants there and what i've realized is that uh many people don't really know how to interact with grant styles so maybe you know we'll start with could you talk a bit about the importance of establishing a grand style and uh how has that been so far from a process perspective and maybe we could start with you robert yeah so i think the importance is extremely high um it doesn't matter whether it's of a compound every new protocol being built by community members once a protocol gets to a certain size um the number of contributors starts to scale far beyond the initial team that created the protocol or you know application and so in order to organize this at some point you have to have you know a different type of structure um you know one approach that you know some organizations have tried is having you know a central company or foundation organized grants but i think for a crypto native protocol like ave or compound or maker dow what i think will work best is actually having a decentralized process to award grants to the community and there's a blurry set of lines between you know ongoing participants contributors you know um rfp you know and bounty hunters but at the end of the day you know if you have a global and decentralized community of people contributing to a protocol the easiest way to organize that is with you know a dow type structure um in which you know applications and participants can interact directly with dao and there's not you know decentralized bottlenecks to its success and boris or stan if you have anything else to add to that no i totally agree uh you know just the other day i was talking to other units of grant program uh committee members and we came to the conclusion that it's better to have more people trying and failing at things than you know to have five people executing flawlessly uh crypto right now it's all about innovation different ideas and yeah we you just need to include as many people as possible because you know if they if many people try uh enough times there will be great ideas uh coming uh and that's that's what these uh projects need i think yeah i could i could add up pretty much i agree i agree what uh robert and boris said and i think the interesting part is is especially the fact that the the founding teams usually uh try to kind of like kick start an idea uh a build a a protocol and usually protocols aren't uh actually monoliths they're just something that inspires others to build new things on top uh or improve the protocol create additional features and and essentially giving a bird to something that that has ongoing uh development and this is nothing new in terms of like open source development this is how linux is developed uh until this date i think what's interesting is that uh we're just living in a time where now essentially we can you know open uh open source open uh kind of like an open system and then transparent way actually contribute into financial protocols that actually bring a lot of efficiency transparency into the financial system and at the same time now it's possible to anyone kind of any part of the world just to contribute and uh improve this this financial system and i think like what's especially important is that uh what the grand styles and all these programs are trying to achieve is that there's strong enough community to being able to take a community-owned project and being able to do the operations that is involved and also continue building and it's not an easy task because the space is very young uh meaning that we don't have enough necessarily professionals and and people that can help and it takes a bit of time to get into a level where there's sufficient amount of community developers that are actually uh uh taking care of the code base but it's a process and end of the day and this is what the grant programs is all about and also tooling because if you go a couple of years back building uh d5 or any kind of like a ethereum based application and smart contracts uh wasn't as simple and easy as it is today so definitely tooling is something we always can uh put more effort into and and have more plans boris you mentioned something which was quite intriguing which is um you know getting as grants as to many people as possible there they have a really good idea uh previously in the web 2 world um you know if people had an idea they actually had to go out and get venture funding for it uh but now those ideas could come to life um and bring in products much faster into the ecosystem so i guess like what were some learnings on that regard like um you mentioned like uh giving grants to a bunch of teams like how has that been how has been the reaction to that and uh has how has it helped uni swap in this regard yeah it helped immensely for example uh the tooling was mentioned so unisop grant funded for example in first four months we funded two python sdks uh and you can see that uh some of the developers and builders prefer one while the others prefer the second depending on their needs or how they're used you know to code the you know the first one is much simpler it doesn't offer as many possibilities so people use it for some quick projects or like a bot or something while the other one it gives you full control and then if they want to go really serious with their project they'll use this one so yeah you know uh we kind of think that uh enthusiasm uh is more important than the actual thing that people are working on because if you have enthusiasm you might you know spread it around to people that have really good ideas uh and we want to uh encourage uh that enthusiasm um and yeah it it in at the end it's important what you're working on but uh even if it's a small project we welcome you to the universe grant program family you join our slack you join the discussions you can contribute to other projects uh yeah we had a couple of members like that uh one member was working on a really simple twitter bot and then he joined all kinds of different discussions and projects opening pull requests documenting stuff uh and yeah we just want to reward this enthusiasm and you know the correct ideas will come along eventually if you have enough people really working and thinking about the protocol awesome thank you um so there's another area that that i learned from this conversation which is accessibility um incredibly like it's incredible that you know all of the people all over the world can get access to this grant whereas you know previously it was very hard to get funding how has that shaped the ecosystem and developer ecosystem for all the protocols and what have you seen that work really well and maybe standing out i can start with you well i think grant's program that they're that's super new i mean ethereum foundation had their trans program and i what i see it's interesting is that kind of like it definitely uh sparks some innovation and then gives some incentives to to create and contribute so definitely it's a way to to kind of kick-start the ecosystem and before the community grounds program ava had its own like uh internal grounds program and i think we funded over 50 different grants so i think like over a period of time like this decentralized like doubt-based grants program will just expand but also like it might speed up a lot of the development and actually maybe projects that normally you wouldn't necessarily want to do uh from kind of like economical perspective for example it might be a tooling or something that is very valuable for the ecosystem but maybe it's it doesn't have some sort of like a uh you know protocol perspective or a product perspective but it's just like very valuable so definitely like in those cases like it they are very helpful uh programs uh robert or reverse if you have anything after that yeah i think the thing that's magical about it is that you can have people participate that otherwise would not be working in d5 um you can have people participate with part of their time you know you can have people participate in ways that they didn't think were possible before and i think you know an open program has the opportunity to grow the sort of ecosystem of you know d5 contributors in ways that you know weren't imaginable even a couple years ago i think that's really cool um one of the things that you see you know in these grants ecosystems are contributors that are also learning new skills in order to be able to contribute um and i think you know in a way this is kind of like you know the new age business school or coding boot camp in that you know you're having people you know growing their you know in some ways professional careers with protocols and this is entirely new what you know i find really exciting about that is that you know you can have people who are anonymous or you know known and reputable entities and everything in between contributing and it just leads to such a different like format of participation than anything we've seen in you know traditional software traditional finance and traditional markets this is entirely new and the way that you contribute is entirely new and that's really cool and i think it's going to evolve you know i think there's going to be best practices that emerge um and things that change and i think you know five years from now the way you know a grants organization works might be a little bit different but the core of it is just so novel that i think you know this is the future yeah good burst yeah i just wanted to add one thing so uh like grants program are always doors are always open but when giving out grants we we are really careful you know to not do any kind of king making for example uh so one good example with uniswap was when v3 was launched you know then you had an opportunity to move your liquidity around to maximize the profits and we had a lot of you know projects uh sending application for a grant and we thought that there's already such a big financial incentive that we shouldn't really uh you know do something in this space this early maybe later you know if there will be some contract audit something like that that then that's okay but uh you don't want to get involved in things like that you know to skew the open sourceness and you know promote somebody who maybe is just lucky that you chose him uh because he was early uh so yeah the grand doors are always open for contribution but when giving out grants you need to be a bit careful with what you're saying with that grant that you're giving out uh so it it takes a lot of thinking uh and yeah i don't know the projects that follow the ethos of your core project is uh really important so decentralization and open source so it's not so simple with giving out grants maybe there are some great projects that you think will do great but they are not good candidates for a grant so that's that's just the detail that i wanted to point out i guess on that note what happened some what are some of the challenges that you that each of the dials are going through and uh and how are you thinking about uh you know either finding the next possible solution or is just just learning challenges we'll just learn to learn a little bit more about that i'll start just because i have a very visible example um so you know yesterday there was a new proposal that was um launched in the compound community that actually had a bug in it um and it led to a lot of comp being distributed to users that weren't expecting it and didn't you know deserve it or you know it was basically a bug that you know sent lots of this um you know stockpile of comment for user distribution to random users um and this actually was a proposal that was created you know specifically to um solve an rfp that was put up by you know the compound grants community and you know i think this highlights the fact that like you know you have a much wider surface area of development and contributors um you know and errors can occur um they can be deliberate you know we saw in sushi swap a few weeks ago a contributor you know was malicious and deliberately tried to undermine you know the protocol and you can have accidents um and the larger the surface area of public contribution the more risk that you add to the process just from uh things that can go wrong perspective and i don't think this is a bad thing i think you know long term the more contributors you have the faster you can move and the larger you can grow but i do think it highlights the fact that as you start to include you know sensitive work into um a grants process that you know the you know seriousness of you know additional layers of security also have to increase as well um and so i just think you know you know this highlights the sort of like technical risks of a grants process for changes to a core protocol or a critical system whether it's a front end or vertical systems built entirely on top compartmentalize the risk you know much better if you're incentivizing hey build this module you know this is purely on top of the protocol that can't you know add any risk to the underlying system that's different but when you start to touch the core systems and enable the community to touch the core systems um it changes the sort of you know threshold of risk i can maybe add that uh i i definitely agree like that's that's also like something that uh scares me a lot uh in the sense like what like how the the grants that that are like kind of like core contributions into the core code or anything close or let's say into the user interface that uh kind of affect affect the whole uh process and the the either the application the smart contract like how it will be secure and and blockchain blockchain practically kills confidence in the sense that it's just even if you review things multiple times uh there might be something there uh that the uh the the contributor didn't see or viewers didn't see and it happens because it's pretty much humans are coding and that's that's one of the things and what amazes me is still uh and what i think is a big challenge is that there is a lot of funding available uh for pretty much any kind of like a code contribution and improvement but i i think the the market isn't yet there where you know there's enough people coming in uh with expertise enough diligent and you know there is processes in place where there is multiple audits and and this this kind of like procedures to contribute very safely uh the code and i think like the mitch match is is between like having the the funding is there but then there isn't enough like uh actual contributors and and processes in place and how to like get these two parts uh closer together and i think that's kind of like a challenge that we see a bit everywhere now yeah it's almost like um you know you have this incredible uh diverse group of developers that are actively supporting your protocol in so many different aspects and it's just putting a little bit more process structure just uh making a better understanding of how the milestones are hit and supporting the protocols moving forward and there's just going to be a lot of learnings behind that as well so robert thank you for sharing that um so i guess from this perspective if uh you know from now till like a year from now to two years from now let's say um what are some of the areas that you'd like to provide brands for obviously there's people that are building tooling you know uh protocols that can help connect with or hook into uh you know ave compound or unit swap but ultimately like a year or two year from now what are some success stories that you'd like to hear based on the grants you give today uh boris you could go first uh yeah well uh for me personally i do a lot of community and people engagement stuff and my goal is to lower the barrier of entry to you know participate with some kind of a crypto project as low as possible so you don't need to have advanced solidity skills to be able to feel like you're contributing to a project and to feel part of the project so yeah that's that's like my main goal that anybody who decides two years from now like this uniform thing looks interesting i have this set of skills uh can i somehow you know contribute to it and get rewarded for it that answer is mostly yes and that that's that's one of my personal goals uh to be honest uh other than that is just you know to make the if there will be a grand program in two years that it gets within itself more decentralized because right now you have a committee of maybe five to six people that yeah everybody is really careful with reviewing applications thinking about them weighing all the options but you know maybe make it more open so people from the outside can also do some kind of reviews uh and things like that just to come up with this process of how the the cryptocurrency grant program should look like you know in the open source world but it's so early that that we are still uh trying to find the right approach and right now it's not perfect it obviously is not so yeah stanley if you want to go next and and i'll caveat by saying like i saw a really cool submission the other day uh where someone wanted to build out a mobile app for ave which i thought was quite interesting so um but go ahead oh yeah i mean that that was one of the coolest ones yeah because you know it's just like it showcases uh what you know robert said that you know you don't need necessarily like to be a smart contract developer and contribute but you know you can just start what you actually know and go from there and learn and and something like a mobile wallet is very good example where uh you can contribute from kind of like web 2 perspective and just like connect the web3 components and that that is how why like i i've seen like in the future you know the the more there is like long hanging fruits the more we get developers in because it's easier to make contributions into something that is less complex uh also because like many of the newcomers might uh contribute like on a on their spare time and they might be working in a tech company on on as full time i i think uh in terms of like what what could be successful uh idea is that we have actually people uh developers might be community members that are working for daos directly but also working working in a way in an inclusive way where they're contributing to different kinds of dials so let's say we have a developer that is making uh code contributions into the uh compound ecosystem makes the same way into the oven ecosystem maker ecosystem and uni-swap ecosystem and we have like this kind of like a inclusive way of building these protocols uh together like that would be like very uh successful uh path in terms of like how you could participate in the future as a community member and i think that's the way to learn uh more and kind of like not just learn more technology and and but learn also ecosystems and culture yeah that's actually an interesting point um because we've i've seen you know many applicants that come in that actually you know bring in like create like dashboards for avid but they also do that for compound and others as well so it could be really cool to see something where you know we'll see a contributor that's actu actively supporting many protocols and there could be some sort of like shared incentives of like supporting this from a grants perspective uh but robert feel free to add yeah i i just want to echo what everybody else said um strong points um if uh you know let's let's talk about today um and we're seeing a lot of excitement around grants and and a lot of cool tooling and things like that what would you like to see like if if you had to you know divvy up all the kind of sectors that we could support whether it's tooling whether it's d5 protocols they're hooking into our into the protocols um and other miscellaneous services um what area is most important for each protocol like if you have to give it your like six months i know i've seen like compounds rfps and i think that's a really good way to signal to the community of like exactly what you want built um but like if you had to give your six-month goal of like what would you like done that hasn't been done yet what would that be um ultimately we're in front of you know hundreds of developers today and so uh this could be a good way for them to think about what they should be building next [Music] i'll start just because i think it's relatively different from other protocols and i think at the end of the day every protocol has its own goals its own you know purposes like a great example is uniswap is really looking for an ecosystem around you to swap you know at compounds we really spend a lot of time starting to push the community forward and developing the core protocol itself um you know what i'd like to see in six months is you know a whole you know um decentralized team of developers that are able to make improvements to the core compound protocol you know add new functionality um and you really upgrade um this system that you know has been operating for a really long time and you know it's very focused on you know the core and not you know peripheral systems built on top or alongside of it um we've dabbled you know as a community and you know other approaches but i think what you know compound is focused on is really core development and decentralizing that yeah so maybe i can continue so robert is right uh uniswap is not looking for core contribution it's more looking for everything on the outside uh and the you know the weakest point of the whole uniform project it's the unisop app which is only centralized part of the uni swap and people you know there were some bad experiences where there were scams you know uh scammy deployments of an app uh and i would just like for the the core uh uniform developed uh interface for uni swap to be you know less dominant and that there are suitable alternatives so we get decentralized at this part as well you know smart contracts they can't be changed anybody can deploy a new pool or make a swap but this one core piece is still somewhat centralized and i would like to see that you know changed in the future yeah i would say that now in in the arab ecosystem i mean it's pretty much up to the like other community to to decide what like how you know the whole uh the community developers will structure themselves and and like there is code contributions all the time but kind of like what path to take uh i personally like would love to see maybe uh also more core contributions but also like uh you know building some of the parts uh uh on top that is part of the the core court but expansion but also like you know the ability to improve the whole system in general is something very interesting because essentially uh what's interesting about let's say of a and compound is that they are uh you know systems that are running completely autonomously and at the same time there is so-called like a collateral element there so so these are like very much protocols that require a lot of expertise and in a very very strong community to uh uphold and i think like this is something we're looking uh as well like how we can make it possible that we get core contributions and and how to establish especially how to establish a a process where these contributions can be uh some diligent way uh reviewed and and uh mitigated from risk perspective so this is something that i'm i'm personally looking into and of course tooling i think tooling is important especially if it helps like all of the projects across the tree now in the process of giving a grant um you know the today where the way it works usually is that someone applies for a grant they get interviewed uh and then they'll know whether or not they'll get a grant some may do uh some may get payments upfront some they have like a deico model where they'll get payments based on milestones um what what has worked and what hasn't worked um and what would you like to see moving forward from that side and just to explain like dyker model is a model that was proposed by vitalik uh which is more or less kind of like milestone based incentives and so yeah what are some models that you think may work for this and i've seen you know pros and cons for both well i can quickly jump in so there is definitely like taiko model is interesting because you know i i think uh the issue why daiquez hasn't picked up maybe is because of the name and association to uh icos a bit but you know i seen for example in the avagochi ecosystem they have a daikon it's interesting like how kind of like there's like a tap where you know there's monthly payment for the uh genesis team there to develop the the the metaverse but at the same time nothing stops to stops to create another kind of like a tap to develop some other part of the ecosystem uh so i definitely agree that the milestones are uh a good way to to uh to to compensate but also i mean if there is trust involved and you know contributors are committing into the uh ecosystem what what can be done is just like a lump sum payments i also like the ability to stream payments and i i think we've been looking into super fluid and i i don't know probably probably can explain more but i think compound has this streaming as well going on yeah we have a system internal to the compound um protocol which looks very similar to that which does streaming where um you can have basically a streaming comp grant and there's obviously external tools which might be long-term and easier approach because it doesn't have to become part of the core protocol but um compounds comp governance system can stream comp to contributors and there's i believe two active uh streaming grants to contributors apparently yeah for unisop the different models work differently and like there's not the right approach i think it all depends on the situation and what the project is but uh just today we had like a wave uh five announced of the units of grants and you'll see like four or five continuations of a project so uh we agreed on the feature set for the initial grant and then that grant went great and a lot of success around it so we continued support of it so it's somewhat like a daiko model with milestones but not exactly and yeah to be honest in the uni swap grant program uh the the money was never like the the most important part we have a lot of part-time contributors i think most of them or you know just integrating uni swap into uh already existing products so we support that partly so uh not many people's lives you know and food on the table depends on the units of grant program uh so like the funding part was was never really uh an issue it was more about choosing the right grants and giving the opportunities to the right people and involving the right people in the uni swap grants great thank you so much i'm gonna pass it over to kartik uh he has uh maybe one or two questions that he likes to ask the audience so i'll pass the recording awesome uh that was an amazing discussion i think there's been a handful of questions and some kind of very common themes that have kind of brought up on the chat so i'll just kind of condense all that into uh a two-part question uh the first one is just uh overall how do people find out about each of your grant programs and and uh what can you tell about that just as a quick pitch and how people can learn more the second part of that question is when people hear about ecosystem grants they mostly assume that uh they have to kind of contribute to the technical piece of it is that true for each of your grant programs or what are some other ways people can get involved do they always have to kind of work on something smart contract abilities you could just clarify or maybe expanding to like how the program is set up like is it based on a list of things that you want people to do or people can pick what they want to do or and all that stuff around it so just say a quick uh but also slightly detailed pitch on each of your programs and then maybe we can start off with uh stunning yeah i think like kind of i would like uh start by following you know the other grants twitter handle and just like look into updates and what's going on in the in in in in the space and and also uh maybe join the telegram group where uh there's other peers looking into uh building various different kinds of things and and discord as well but um essentially you don't always need to build like uh specifically anything technical uh grounds can be also like educational uh it can be anything else i personally i'm not involved in the background style or the grounds itself but this is how like the process works from from what i have seen and uh yeah i think what's important is that uh not taking any stress of these grants of course like if you propose something like propose in a way that you uh commit in building it and and being as kind of like realistic as possible in uh describing on the time and and what it takes to build and also you can post it in a way that you know if you need more people but you're alone uh maybe maybe there's a way to find friends to help on build from from uh the community so this is actually a very cool way to to make friends as well so i would suggest that as a role awesome maybe boris uh can comment next yeah during this uh panel i already mentioned that uh i personally tried to keep the barrier at off entrance the lowest possible um so uh one of the like the lowest barrier of entrance is every two weeks we have a community call and we're always looking for pull-up designs so yeah uh like design a pop-up for us we're not really strictly let you do your own thing your own style uh and you get you know to be the part of the units of dao um of course there's like a more complex stuff building smart contracts uh uh i don't know the testing infrastructure all those good things uh but for example if you see something cool that maybe other d5 project has and you notice that uni swap doesn't have it uh you can just say you know send an application say uh this looked really cool for ave or compound uh so i can create you this thing for uni swap so you can steal ideas for example a little bit um and yeah there is no rule to it uh if we think that the the greater uh you know uh community will benefit from this we will support it uh you don't need to be only selected developer and know the v3 so that that that's my answer to it amazing and i guess we'll close this out with robert yeah so anyone can get involved in compound brands a lot of the um outlined work right now is technical in nature but there's always a lot of opportunity for those who are not technical to participate um whether it's in analyzing markets or interest rate models or you know playing on the economic side you know creativity is welcomed um you know you can see a list of rfps and you know um opportunities that are available on compoundgrants.org and there's also an active discord channel devoted specifically to brands in the compound discord and you know fundamentally if you're interested in participating you know dfi is an incredibly welcoming place there's no right and wrong approach i think we're all figuring this out as a community and as a society and as a series of d5 protocols together so if you're excited check out compound check out ave check out units bob check out all the other programs that are out there you'll find something exciting and you know hopefully a really good opportunity to participate and contribute that's an amazing note to end on and uh yeah i think the important thing is that everybody's figuring this out live and uh that just requires a lot of experimentation so um i think just getting involved helps you uh figure out what the right model is so that's kind of where we're at so uh thank you so much for that amazing discussion and uh thank you so much imran for facilitating and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and the next talk is going to be about covering the future of other grand style so uh we have shreyas who is going to be talking about all the things that are happening in the avigrant security system and how everything is set up so without further ado let's welcome treyas [Music] hey everyone um can everyone hear me well everything is great okay i'm just gonna share my screen um let me know if you can see this also awesome um so yeah really excited to be here i think um i i first i started my full-time uh you know crypto journey actually with a an eighth global um hackathon um building something on llama so it's you know it's really cool to come back and speak here and um i think uh you know we've seen this with avi grants too but there's an amazing influx of of uh developers and talent here and and it's a really amazing onboarding experience for someone into into web3 so um yeah you know very so to be here um i'm the program lead for hobby grand style and i also am the founder of llama which helps uh dowse and default d5 protocols manage their treasury so um one thing i thought would be interesting to start with is something that um uh influenced my thinking of uh crypto protocols and and ecosystems um and this was a a post by um uh lakshman chunker from the ethereum foundation where you know he he compared um uh crypto ecosystems to uh natural ecosystems and and he was talking about how you know by the biodiversity is is um just as important in in crypto ecosystems as it is in in natural ecosystems and that um you know the the reason why ethereum as an ecosystem is kept alive is because of this constant influx of uh new developers and and builders in this platform and and the you know when that dies and when the the sort of genetic variation of the theorem ecosystem is stopped um ethereum will die and i i think um of other protocols similarly where ecosystem development is sort of at the heart of um really what makes a a protocol in the community thrive and um any custom development includes uh sort of this yeah this this community that's building the protocol and and all these other like integrations and and support and culture and and a bunch of other things around the protocol um so you know that that's influenced i think um how i've thought about the the mission at arbi grants and how we approach it which is you know building this thriving ecosystem of contributors building on our way and um we you know are a team of um niner viewers plus uh you know two to three other um folks and staff and we basically provide projects uh it grants to projects and um uh and ideas and community events that benefit the rv system and we're quite open-minded to what that could be we have a list of ifps on on our site but um you know we we're very open to people coming up with with creative ways that they can um uh have benefited the ecosystem and the broader uh so the crypto ecosystem because anything built you know built for on rv is is open source and can really like you know push the development of the space um generally um so summary of the program we launched in may 2021 and uh the it got overwhelming community support um you know i i was on the other planet like it's quite clear that the you know grants programs are uh you know really a critical piece of what to do with it with the dao uh with especially after a certain size and um it's probably one of the most obvious use cases of what to what to spend um the treasury money on when you have hundreds of millions of dollars in assets you wanna you wanna spend on um you know some way to grow and and maintain the protocol um and build this ecosystem of contributors doing that um so we've the plan is to have a pilot program of two quarters that ends in on november 10th um 2021 uh the budget that the governances has given us is a million dollars a quarter and the hope is to expand their budget um after we go back to governance with uh the work we've done so far um i think uh you know with with the with the projects we're funded there's definitely a case for um you know a larger budget especially if we need to support i think um some of the events and some of the um sort of sponsorship uh type work which right now is is being done by uh the rv company um so yeah this is so you know look forward to that over the next few months um i uh our group right now is is um you know nine reviewers uh two two staff members one um uh bill who's uh interesting that he actually posted threads uh when uh i did the initial community calls he would post threads on on these community cards and really useful um threads and what um what happened in the community called in a summary of of uh key activities in avi and so i just reached out to him saying uh you know if he'd be interested in being a sort of content indeed and stand a terrific job in in terms of um you know sort of having an avi grandstand newsletter and uh sort of you know growing the the the set of twitter community engagement beyond um beyond just what we had originally to you know actually hosting community calls and and um in twitter spaces with grantees and things like that um and then we also have uh neil schaff who who works on ground tops and ways to actually make the process much more efficient um in terms of like the review speed as well as um you know the support to grantees after um and then uh we have a lot of help with the you know design of the of the pops um we redesigned uh the logo because we you know we wanted a different branding from avi but something that was related and so we actually used this team of ecosystem development to come up with that and then yeah she's done a great job with that stuff um so the progress so far is about 37 grand so this uh with the it's 29 until yesterday where we just approved a set of uh eight more that should come out soon um and um and you know a little over one million dollars worth of grant awards all this has not been distributed yet because um it's you know these grants come in um are milestone based and so it's usually an initial upfront payment and then a payment after a completion of one or two milestones if it's a really small grant um you know say uh you know below five thousand dollars in some cases we just make make the payment upfront but um if it's uh if it's a grand uh you know say anything from uh 20 to 50 60k which is which is common um it's usually multiple milestones and if it's a larger grant we have a few over eighty thousand dollars then it's um it's typically over three payments in initial payment uh one milestone and then the final payment um and and we typically avoided grants um below 100k and so anything between 100 and 500k we can technically approve according to our initial sort of governance proposal but it would um we would like to get community sentiment on uh on whether we should approve it or not and so we'll we'll put up a snapshot vote get community sentiment we actually did this for the defy uh app that um there was this ave mobile app that was going to be open sourced and built on the rv repo uh we went to the community and asked you know basically if it makes sense funding this i think it was about a 98 000 grant and um the community you know overwhelming support of this so so we went ahead with it um but yeah like you know the the idea is to um pretty much support like any projects that really benefit the the rv custom the the focus is on um yeah things that are uh you know can show some yeah a realistic are possible to actually do and can show some um you know some positive outcome for um either our users or are we governance or um or you know just like processes for the dow um so yeah here are just a few examples of projects that have like actually shipped and launched and done well like on the left side you have flip side crypto which um you know has has built some cool analytics and building you know they have this community enabled analytics system that um i think is really um uh you know help with with improving uh the sort of data accessibility for things that happen on rv um we have symphony finance that um uh you know provides like yield on on limit orders and and uses rv to do that um rabbit hole had some cool tasks um rewards for completion of tasks actually on polygon i think it was completed within a few hours something like that and so it was cool to see the demand for something like that um and on the right side we have a gelato network that basically built a um you know a really neat solution for um to prevent um our users from getting to these really costly liquidations where they would uh you know they'd have something unique on the smart contract side to adjust the positions uh to prevent those liquidations which yeah a huge value add for for our users so yeah these are a few examples like one of the things um that we've been doing besides just the grant amount is is actually supporting projects beyond uh beyond just the dollar amounts like you know in some cases if a project needs an auditor we'll you know we will have been connect them to someone if um uh you know we definitely provide sort of marketing uh support in terms of featuring them in the in the newsletter and and and on twitter um and you know on the governance forums uh we you know uh if they need an integration with the ambi protocol we'll make an intro to some from the genesis team um as long as they have time and making sure that that we can prioritize something uh you know a review of something or an integration wherever possible uh and we're trying to grow that uh more i think i think there's much more we we can do and we'd love to build some uh some systems in place to just make that process really uh efficient and and um you know just take these projects to the next level um one other example of that is is actually um we found a d5 alliance to uh to actually um you know continue their accelerated program for two projects from the ecosystems and it'd be really cool to to take some projects that have come out of the grants program especially at a nation stage to the next level with um with you know additional support uh and and you know funding if needed or you know specific set of expertise steps about um and you know the feedback has been overwhelming overwhelmingly positive from the grantees like um you know most them uh have been quite happy with um uh you know with of course the the amount but but also like just the the support in terms of um the the receptiveness of of the of the grants group to um to the things they need and help they need so it's um yeah it's great to see that i think there's there's a lot more we can do um and uh you know a lot more we can we can set up to just make sure that um uh you know the the the the projects that we um that we fund uh you know actually like not just execute but also like you know achieve much more than um you know they initially set out even if that doesn't mean something that um you know the initial scope of what was laid out with the grant but but just like you know build this this group of people that will continue to return to rv in some way even if they you know temporarily don't and and so um yeah the the idea is as we get into yeah i'll go here first um so we get into the future of ave grants like uh the way i think about it is you know we really want um the the current set of grantees to um to eventually like have a say in in the approval of these future grants and that's how we we build these grants now which is uh through the set of contributors so if we um right now have like nine people reviewing grants like we eventually want to have we're setting up the processes right so that eventually can actually scale to um you know many more people having you know some sort of say on what grants get approved ideally based on expertise and reputation so for example uh you know if there's a group we funded uh for sort of a risk management type thing um and and and they're you know we get a bunch of grant proposals on risk-related um uh you know projects then you know be cool for them to approve it uh it'd be cool to have some some sort of um you know reputation-weighted uh way to scoring for something like this and um and and slowly build out like uh the membership of the grand style and the uh almost like you know i think of it is um you know if the the people who have a reputation in in the rv custom which is people who built for ave will have some rights over you know treasury spending power which is which is kind of different from um maybe the typical token holder board uh which you know will be dominated by uh you know investors will hold a lot of tokens or the core teams in this case you know you could actually move to a case where um your tragedy spending power is is allocated more to people who are actually contributing and building and have a reputation in the protocol which which might be a different set of people might overlap um and so that's how i think about it i'd say that um you know we want to build this uh this this group uh that will expand it's right now 37 projects but you know it will expand to uh to 50 to hundreds of projects and and um and have some way that that these these folks can benefit from each other if it can um can you know support and um and you know vet the new set of grants um and uh and yeah but build this like cool sort of network that um continues to help avi and and benefits themselves uh in terms of sort of their uh career crypto experience um just a little bit on on some of the content work that we've done like um with uh you know we've we've you know published 15 issues of this newsletter and um you know it's it's actually a very cool way i would say if you don't know anything about rv or even if you do like i still find it useful um that i'm quite involved with rv like to just get a sense of what's happening in the in the community and you know i'll be um actually you know does alive which which is something i love like it has a strong culture of bottom up experimentation um there's of course like you know the core like lending protocol but there's so many other things happening in the niyavi custom um like uh like avi arc or um or the decentralized social network that's that's in the works or um you know a set of rv deployment on avalanche or other chains and and i think it's the rv news is a cool way to track that and it's written you know build writes in in quite a easy to to access like fun-friendly way and it's a that's a cool way to i think start off just knowing what's happening in the rv custom and we also give an overview of of what's happening with the grand style and um and the grants that we've we we've funded so far um the the community calls happen once a month and um we do this on twitter spaces uh we've found that actually to be quite useful because um it gets a you know higher degree of participation and uh and it you know it's cool at the end to answer some questions uh we typically have um you know an initial intro um and then i'll give an overview of some things that have happened in the grand style uh sani will will chime in with um yeah with you know jenny what's happening with rv protocol uh we'll have like emilio or someone else from the dev team give a dev update and then we'll just get into the the community and so um you know this could be proposals that have come out uh from uh from uh contributors from the community so this could be like a liquidity mining proposal or um you know or a proposal for avid to deploy in another chain uh we might include uh you know sort of say like uh you know one of the folks from the arbitrary team or avalanche to chat about um you know why i obviously apply there um and then um yeah and then we feature a bunch of grantees who have gotten funding or are still in the um in the iteration phase and and uh just to learn more about what they're building and and get questions from the community and so i think community cards are usually always quite energizing and um give a good sense of what's happening with ave and we've also started these uh amas with grantees and with other community members where this is separate from the from the main community called but it's just a you know getting a deeper dive into you know who who the people are in the ob custom and um and you know how we can actually um you know get to know them better and just um you know again like form connections between uh different people in the ecosystem so that they can actually you know help each other and you know and take what they're doing to the next level um great this is uh kind of all i had like this is sort of a summary of if um some of the projects were funded um but i'll stop there and you know like happy to to take um any questions if there are any um if not we can we can set a move on sure this was awesome um there's a couple of uh questions around to sort of your learnings from the past few months so i i think kind of talked about the new plan but uh maybe it'll be good to dig into sort of what you did to come up with this new plan like how did you go about getting feedback from all the other grant programs out there what did you learn in terms of like how things were set up for everybody else and some of the lessons learned and i could just walk us through some of that decision making process and how you think um changes you've adopted are going to help address some of those existing issues yeah yeah sure so um i think uh in terms of like the next evolution of grants it's still definitely like in the works and like where this is like i would say it's the work in progress um but uh like i i've um you know spoken a bunch with uh with ken from uni grants as well as larry from from compound and and you know they've they've been great in terms of um you know sharing their lessons learned uh and i think you know uh there's there's a lot of similarities between our grants programs and then some differences i think just based on the way that the rv operates um and so i think the way we have gone about is like you know thinking through the um the you know the sort of talking to projects and seeing like what's actually helped them and and what's not and things that they uh you know sort of uh value and appreciate and and um ways that that can be improved and so um you know one of those things is is definitely like the the post grant support in terms of like um you know having projects with with um you know doing things like sort of get getting auditors or getting connected with uh with the uh with the avi genesis team when needed or just just someone like you know some of these are really young teams and and have no um sort of social capital in the ecosystem and so just like bridging that gap um where we can uh and right now it's been sort of you know done like 20 percent a one-on-one basis but i think there's definitely scope to um you know systematize that and make sure that you know we actually actively reach out to projects even before they do uh with with asking them for the help they need um and then i think the yeah the next like evolution if you know like slo it's gonna be a process and it might take some time but but but slowly like um i think giving us you know some of the existing grantees like um who who are interested in in doing it like more of a say in what's happening with with avi grant i think that's uh that's really crucial just to um you know make sure that they're still involved like these are these are folks who have uh clearly signaled that um you know they they wanted you know do something for the rv ecosystem and and uh and they you know a bunch of them have and they've successfully completed something and so we don't want them to um you know go away like we want them to to continue to do that and and there's some way we can um you know incentivize them um to stay in the ecosystem and and continue support like i i think that would be great uh of course like you know first with with them with their projects and um you know with maintaining what would they build uh and or or having a you know a way that um you know that they can transition to other groups who can do the maintenance um uh it's of course like helpful that all this is open source so that makes it easier but there are cases of course where um you know projects built and then you know it um something goes um uh you know still after after a few months because uh you know because the original team sort of isn't there but yeah the goal is to like you know make sure that these projects continue to engage with uh with rv after the initial grant and and i think uh having them have a say in um in the future grantees is like you know one really cool way to do that no it's really awesome um i think one thing you touched on and this is kind of one of the very kind of common themes is post grant support and then you already kind of brought it up like what are some of the challenges here and and sort of uh obviously as you're giving out grants more actively it can kind of go from 10 teams to 100 very fast how do you think about structuring the grants program or even the staff to actually position everybody to get the help yeah it's a good question i think one of them is is marketing and just like ways like i said like some of these projects like they might they might be in an enon project or someone with um with like very very little social capital and um and you know they might build something really cool but they actually needed need users and they need um you know the rb community to be aware that they built this and so uh we really try to uh you know make sure we push that so so we'll we'll invite them to the community call uh we'll um you know definitely share on twitter both uh in terms of the grand style kind as well as like you know personally all of us um and then when they um you know when they launch we'll try to make governance for him post uh we will try to make you know intros where possible it's like you know i've enjoyed a bunch of teams now the other protocols where i needed um and so yeah it's it's out of the personal hub but like i would say um just you know helping use uh you know some of the the social capital that we have to make sure that you know very interesting projects like get the um get the attention they deserve and what's great about the crypto ecosystem is that everyone's really very receptive to this and it's it's um yeah it's definitely like early enough days where we're like you know yeah everyone's down to um to sort of yeah try you know actually take a chance and on someone else's video um so i'd say marketing is one uh the the other one the other ones i would say are more like um uh you know what like they're they decided by projects like few projects have asked for for help with getting auditors um uh i think you know few projects have uh have asked um just for like sort of technical like sort of smart contract architecture type review um uh and like you know have having someone getting connected to someone who can do that a lot of times yeah it is i would say like yeah getting connected to like xyz person either from uh the the ave uh uh genesis team or from like sort of outside and and um yeah helping them with that but yeah there's more we can do and i think um uh you know it would be good to to like come up with uh one next survey i'll be grant members um but but also yeah just just come up with a you know like hey like these are actually like three to four things we should like just do but as a default for all projects and then there's something additional we can you know we can explore it case by case no that makes a lot of sense and um i guess does that mean this is how the rfps are set up for other grants like how who comes up with what is important or should be funded or we want to work on and what's kind of the process of prioritizing or getting something on that list yeah uh so we uh we've sourced that list from um one the like the self avi community basically the governance forum and and things that come up in the telegram group um and so you know we we sort of from there we source it from from the avi uh team there's there's a bunch of things that you know they might want to build that they they don't have time to build and and it's um yeah we'd love like the community to engage with building that uh and um you know as we speak to a bunch of these projects like their ideas that that come up that we have that might you know like sort of direct like um you know that that might just like have an existing um sort of integration or something like that and we will put that up uh but i'd say that yeah the top ones um you know right now listed are a governance front end on rv that's open sourced and built in the arbi repo uh that's something that's you know high priority that um you know we we're looking for uh you know basically a simpler ui for like anyone you know right now if you're technical it's relatively easy if you're not technical it's it's not straightforward to actually make a government's proposal and so make it easier to do that um the second one is like a developer's doubt that we're you know hoping to wrap up soonish but but actually have a team of developers work directly for rb protocol that um that you know work on some of the um you know core development uh but also like you know some like authored some of the um the work like reviewing governance proposals or things like that um and yeah what the dao is so the developer now is super interesting actually so how do you kind of set something like that up and sort of how do you in a way if you were to look at as like a charm like the  yeah i said the world chart but like if you look at it that way what is sort of like that the setup here of uh who responsible what and which organization manages what yeah well it's a good question i i don't think we haven't figured out but like um the the idea is to um uh it's like there will be a team lead and like maybe five to six other people um uh so the team lead i think we'll work full time five to six other people will work uh part-time uh i think uh you know they um in the beginning like avigran style which you know should have like uh you know pretty much like what one carbon from my team has been leading the process and um either him or like someone else should have like you know some type of monitoring of what's happening with the developers now um and of course the developers you know should be quite transparent with the work they're doing with um with the rv community so i'd say like some of these structures they start off maybe with especially when they're seated by the ground style where they i wouldn't say you know i'm not gonna say like sort of hierarchically come you know the ground stuff but more that we at least take some ownership over monitoring what's happening and making sure that you know if if there's a bunch of funds in the multisig it's um you know besides having something like that we also have like some human monitoring of what's happening and make sure that it's reporting to the gov the governance forum and things like that but i think eventually you know like the the pathway is like these you have these like sub-dials that they come out of avi grants but then army grand style but eventually if they're successful they just get directly funded from from the treasury and and um and you know report to javi dao and and um you know there's a mechanism to do that and maybe maybe you see like these you know you you see dozens of these uh these dials that um that can actually like you know the coordinate on some level that can function independently to some degree uh but uh yeah like you know uh are able to report to to governance and and continue that way um but yeah i i think the the structure of this like it's still you know uh tbd in terms of what what works i think we we need to experiment with it and um and you know i don't especially with the larger projects like that there hasn't been um you know too much of this and so it's cool for us to like pioneer something like this um but you know that there'll be some mistakes along the way and we can change the exact structuring of this as we go absolutely and i think we kind of just this is going to be recurring theme in all most of our talks here today which is it is a pretty massive experiment we're doing at scale and there's so much we're trying to figure out as we kind of go through it too so uh we'll take some time but given that this came out in uh in may of this year and it feels like forever and you've already given out close to a million dollars in grants it's just incredible that we've made so much progress uh already um i want to also give a special shout out to uh to bill on the chat who's been uh really uh been incredible answering all these questions and for those of you who are interested in learning more especially about what's happening in the ava ecosystem be sure to subscribe to avenues.com because that does cover all the great things that are happening and i know we're getting uh i do want to ask a handful of other questions but i feel like it will probably take away from the another talk that you have in about an hour which is on how do you actually successfully receive a grant from the ave committee so uh we'll save some of those questions for that uh in the meantime i want to thank sures for that amazing overview and we'll move on to our next uh talk so thanks tras and we'll see you soon yeah thanks all right so with this we are ready to move on to our next segment so we are running five minutes ahead of schedule but what we have up next is a ecosystem showcase of some amazing projects that have been funded and supported by the ave grand style so what we'll do is we'll kind of call up all these six speakers they're going to talk about who they are what they do and how you may be able to get involved so without further ado let's bring on our very first talk and that is hilmar from gelato and hillmark's going to talk about everything that's happening with gelato so i'll ask you to turn your camera on and uh we can uh get started hey classic how's it going good welcome let's do you guys hear me all right uh yeah i think there might be an audio issue if you're not able to hear me but i can hear you just fine yeah so it would be great to learn about gelato and you can just take it from here yeah sure so um yeah i work at a project called gelato um gelato is a protocol that automates my contract executions on ethereum and on other networks and yeah basically we help developer teams to automate certain aspects of their depths kind of like taking away the burden of all the devops related technicalities that come with running sophisticated financial products on public blockchains and yeah we we received an um other grand style grant some time ago to help build out a cool product which is um available on a website called kono finance and that's basically automate like paying back debt positions and preventing liquidations by kind of periodically always selling some of your collateral off for the debt that you borrowed and then paying back your debt periodically to avoid getting liquidated and having to pay liquidation penalties and yeah that's basically what we or we built with the other brands though and i appreciate the support of uh over there a lot amazing um yeah i'll kind of do some q a here as well so um let's kind of go deeper into what gelato is uh you've obviously been part of the global site for as a hack number it's been for the past few years and you've kind of learned so much about what's happening in this ecosystem and i think i remember just chatting with you a while ago and uh you kind of also got into the vegas system a bit early so just walk us through how gelato set up what was the need for you to build this thing and sort of just everything's happened the past year and a half yeah so yeah things develop fairly quickly um i think like two to three years ago i was still going to hackathons um at youth global hacking on some some funny interest rate swap use cases were using eatland back then or or now other um and so yeah i was always gonna like fascinated and try to kind of like build more sophisticated financial applications uh also like options on on defy um and every time you [Music] every time applications require something to happen on a conditional basis at some point in the future you kind of require this um second layer of servers or keepers or bots basically running that actually monitor all the states and then execute certain functions at um at future times basically and um yeah we we kind of like stumbled across this issue a lot of times during um just hacking on stuff um and yeah at some point um we were working on a project together with gnosis and berlin and and and we came across this problem again and then we kind of like decide okay that's for us like for us uh developers let's just build like a tool that really just like outsources that problem um and try to kind of like fix that for every for all of our future projects that we wanted to build and um yeah we kind of got stuck on this on i'm solving this issue because it is not that straightforward actually um as it may seem and um and so yeah could you dig a little bit deeper into that like what are some of the complications how do you think about some of these guarantees and also maybe some examples of what you can do or cannot do with gelato right now yeah so um there are like the the very basic problem that you need to solve in such a system is basically um making sure that transactions get mined in a certain period of time at certain future times right it may be sound quite quite easy but it's actually like if you think about the blockchain you only have a certain uh block limit right you have a certain capacity and a lot of transactions that want to get in during the same times maybe if they're like high congestion times and you need to make sure to actually fulfill the duties of your protocol to get your transaction mind in a certain time frame and um this is fairly easy if you do like one transaction but if you do like a thousand transactions in a very short period of time you need to resubmit transactions you need to cancel certain transactions then this becomes very very complicated um and doing this on one network um on the ethereum might still be okay but if you then have your application deployed on phantom on polygon on our optimism you suddenly have to run notes on all these networks you have to deal with like rpc issues um running phones and most of these networks is nearly impossible for like the average development team without like a full-time devops team around it so um yeah they're like very infrastructure related problems that you have to solve first of all and then there's the whole whole um whole issue about um okay then you are kind of like the only one running this spot right and if your company can like sensors or ex-maliciously or just kind of like goes down for whatever reason right um then your whole application this decentralized application you build is now not uh functioning as intended right so similar to of like how the graph um picked their picture like reading data from the chain problem uh we we pick the writing data to the chain on the conditional basis problem basically and um yeah we want to provide developers with just this infrastructure piece and that is uh decentralized that is censorship resistant that kind of runs also when gelato our core team at some point in the future is not there anymore right that they kind of can rely on and and this is uh it takes a bit of time we're not there yet but yeah it wasn't one step at a time this is great and then uh i was going to say i think in closing i guess uh one obvious thing is that most of people that are watching this thing and participating in eat online are developers so as i think about their hackathon projects can you give them uh some sort of uh thoughts or suggestions on how they might be able to use gelato and then what are some of the things that they can do problematic so so yeah so um every time you your application needs to execute certain functions at future times be it like every 10 minutes or be it when unison prices rise above a certain threshold right um you would otherwise like you would normally be required to kind of like spin up your own server and kind of like try to get these transactions mined for pc that might work but like in production that rarely really does so um rather than just do that i would just encourage you to go to app.gelado.network and there you can literally just um input the contract address of the contract you want to automate then all like the functions appear and then you can just like select the function that you want to automate and you can write a resolver contract that defines upon which condition you actually want that contract to be executed you can for example say hey every hour or you can say um when the balance of this user is greater than x right um and then you you just deposit some east pay for the transactions and then or like somatic on polygon for example and then that's it and and you don't need to worry about running any intra um it should work right away um and if it doesn't uh let us know come to our developer chats and discord and we can help you out amazing well hopefully everybody got excited about that because uh there's a lot of automation and scheduling you can do and there's so many interesting applications with that in d5 so thank you much more and for those who are interested it looks like bill's already posted uh a comment on how you can learn more and how you can find out the documentation for gelato so thanks again and we'll on to our next uh demo in showcase and for that i'd like to welcome eric who's going to talk about omni analytics so eric whenever you're ready [Music] better get started awesome uh hi everyone hopefully you can hear me okay um i'm going to go ahead and share my screen as i have a couple slides and so i'll talk about our project uh so basically for the ave grand style what we did is we were building what we call like an intuitive and extensible analytics framework for the ave ecosystem that was part of the work we did and so i just wanted to start by kind of talking more generally about omni analytics group uh i'm the chief data scientist at on the analytics group um and basically we're a boutique data science firm and we specialize in machine learning data analysis ai and recently cryptocurrency we've actually been active in the crypto ecosystem uh now really for a number of years but especially in this last year um we've built tools for the ethereum foundation numero uniswap bitcoin pool together and many more um and we we have a little following on twitter and you know five thousand plus people they like to kind of hear about data science crypto related topics and and basically the goal fun underpinning what we do it's always been about the power of data analytics and data decision data data-driven decision-making um so that includes things like insights from statistical modeling eda exploratory data analysis dashboarding app development and our whole goal with what we did for the ave grants style is we wanted to bring some of this to ave and the broader community and so this was basically our focus and it's still ongoing but we basically broke it down into a three-tiered kind of uh process it began with a mainnet dune dashboard uh we later were sort of contracted into doing a polygon dashboard on dune and we followed a really similar structure i'll show you both of them in just a moment um but then we wanted to take it a step further so basically we love dune we love the platform for those of you you know who are familiar with it it's just such a great way to collect data from the blockchain display it and and look at trends and growth trends over time um so we love dune but we were thinking what can we do to take this analysis to the next level and by our day jobs what we usually work in is in r and for those of you who are familiar with the r language it's effectively a statistical uh programming language it has all kinds of toolkits packages libraries that can be used to do some pretty cool analyses and we thought um integrating with the covalent api where we can pull off a data produce a customized dashboard and really take this to the next level as far as the flexibility would be what we can do to broaden the appeal of the work we've done so let's take a look i'm going to first show you the two dune dashboards then i'm going to show you the r dashboard and just give you an idea of what we have here so let me take a look at this so this actually let me go first to the mainnet dashboard then i'll show polygon so uh this is our first dune dashboard and we structured it in in such a way that we wanted to present what was the uh essentially the most important information up front and really this is like you know illustrating the growth of ave as a platform up front and we sort of broke it down into these categories so basically usage metrics where you can see like daily active users new users of the platform number of transactions on the platform and then we basically have a whole section where you can see volume metrics so this is things like deposit volume flash loan volume borrow volume liquidation volume and we sort of have this consistent structure where you can see there's always a counter and that counter is like one day seven day 30 day and then the total volume along with it we have time series so basically you get an aggregate metric of each and then you get a time series metric where effectively that gives you a view of how the growth has taken place as a function of time one of the challenges and things that we just had to overcome is of a there's basically v1 and v2 versions of the contracts and we aggregated this so you can see it dates back to june for the v1 and then i think since december for the v2 and these queries unless we're indicated are all at the aggregate level you can see this dashboard has quite a lot of statistics but we tried to keep like keep it consistent clean and the relevant stats like really prominent so that's our mainnet dashboard um the second one and i won't take too much time on this because you'll notice it's quite similar and that was uh by design we basically rebuilt the dashboard in for polygon and so you'll notice most of the same metrics some of them are still pending uh some data's recently been added to those tables that have enabled more and we're still working on some more but a similar structure basically all the metrics targeting the polygon chain so same idea there okay and then finally i want to show you our start on the r dashboard so basically what this is here is uh h r shiny so those of you who are familiar with it basically shiny itself uh is a way of turning an r analysis into an interactive web application and we basically built a similar concept to the dune dashboard but what we've added so far is basically some interactivity for the user so instead of just a big tall scrolling list of the volume metrics you can select which one you're interested in viewing and then immediately get those results you can also then filter to a specific date range so for instance maybe you're interested in since the beginning of the year to in this case september 16th to see the aggregate metrics across that time span then you can get that and we have plenty more functionality like usage metrics and these all uh our dynamic plots we try to include some ave branding it's very much a work in progress but we have a lot of great ideas for what we can do to keep making this uh more extensible and more sustainable one other quick comment just for those of you who are interested this right here is our github and we're hosting the code that basically is used to underpin the dashboard and the shiny dashboard itself on our github on the analytics group ave growth dashboard anyone's welcome to check it out follow the instructions to install it and run it locally and if you have any great ideas for what we can visualize in the dashboard we're more than happy to hear those ideas okay let me go back to the slides here and then i'll finish it up okay so in conclusion really what it comes down to we're firm believers that when data underpins like the decision making process organizations run more efficiently and so we really wanted to build upon the analytics done in the dune dashboards but with the r code we're exposing the analysis to a wider swath of users we're interfacing with the covalent api and exposing that growth data in a way that really the whole community and other developers can access and explore themselves and since this data is so rich the potential is so vast we believe there's a lot more that can be done beyond just what we've done but we're really really excited to keep working and about the potential of this and that's all i had thank you so much if there's any questions i'm happy to take them this is amazing eric thanks for covering this i think uh uh there's a couple questions so i think we'll be good to know is uh would be great to uh get your take on sort of the conversion between now focusing on doing this thing for define crypto and sort of what you were doing before uh what was that like what were some of the learnings or rather insights or the things you were talking about uh let's start with that and we can dig in a little bit more yeah that's a really good question so effectively like when we start when omni analytics group was started uh we really were focusing on general statistical consulting and we were looking at like what are especially like more underserved areas as far as like you know industries that don't typically think about statistical you know statistical insights as being something that they need to really worry about and so what ended up happening is as statistics and data science got a little bit more prevalent and and people started figuring out that this is an industry that needs to be taken seriously they need to make data-driven decisions what what happened is we sort of found the cryptocurrency community and things were starting to take off but we were seeing some similar patterns which is that you know there's a lot of data out there but sometimes half the battle is just structuring it in a nice way so that you can start to find those insights and that transition sort of was that you know this is another major community cryptocurrency and you know blockchain was exploding in 2017 but that does we didn't have all the analytical tools that we do now and we wanted to really kind of push in that direction when you say you didn't have the tools is that just a comment on not having access to the chain data or do you mean something specific that that it's it's yeah mostly that i think just at the time you know that that data was available but now we have it basically in a way like doom lets us just trivially access it and that just opens up so much potential that the covalent api is another good example where effectively we've gone from yeah that data's all there but now we have one unified api that we can just you know write some wrapper r code and pull all that and do some pretty cool analysis with it no it's amazing and then um and you kind of touched on this thing a little bit but maybe be awesome if you can dive a little bit more into what are some of these insights that you kind of hope to draw from kind of the ave reports or the dashboards a lot of this is i guess uh the way i understood it a lot of this was just being able to present the same information uh slightly differently but how do you think about being actionable from yeah great question so i actually had a discussion about this yesterday with the team because we're what we were thinking like we spent a lot of time building up the data infrastructure for this effectively to show the growth of ave as a platform and i think we were really successful in doing that but to take it to the next step kind of you know what we're thinking here is there's all kinds of metrics that we're basically showing historical data on that we're visualizing the historical data but what we're not doing at this stage is actually making forecasts fitting statistical models so for instance you know these we're seeing a sustained growth in the number of transactions on the platform but what could those forecasts look like if we were to project them you know n months out into the future and you know there's plenty of machine learning algorithms that we can do to have a pretty accurate time series forecast and then it would be really interesting to do stuff like having these forecasts produced and then essentially compared against for accuracy as a function of time so we can continue seeing and refining the estimates over time i think that would be one direction that would be really worth exploring no for sure that makes a lot of sense um is it something that requires like it's more input from kind of the community or the governance or calls or like how do you think about prioritizing which ones to focus on i i think i think having some more input would be good because like you said it's a question of prioritization we the the sky is sort of the limit for what we can do but maybe there's an immediate need we want to say like if you know this these projections are just one example but if someone was saying you know interested to say what is the you know the projected borrow volume over the next n months and we started with something like that we kind of could prototype it out assess how the model's doing and then expand it as you know the community sees fit oh that makes a lot of sense yeah exactly it'll be a case by case i guess or need base and lastly before we move on to our next stop how can people get involved in what you're doing and where can they find out more sure so lots of ways to do that but um if you want to get in contact with us directly our twitter profile is probably the best way to do it twitter.com omnianalytics and if you dm us uh and and just you know say you want to get involved with working on this whatever aspect it is we would love to collaborate and we like i said everything that we've done for the r dashboard is on github and then everything for the tune dashboards is obviously on doom public facing and we love anyone if they'd like to collaborate with us just contact us on twitter my email also eric omnianalytics.io if anyone wants to contact me directly that works just fine as well amazing well thank you so much eric and uh hopefully more data scientists and your engineers come in and help out with those models thank you very much and with that we are ready to move on to our next demo and want to welcome dennison who's going to talk about tally great to see you again dennison hello hello howdy howdy uh good to see you too good to see everyone here um that was really great presentation i was just writing out eric's email address because i was like oh that's pretty cool uh yeah so what i wanted to talk about today was the project that we worked on for abe grants ours was a pretty interesting project it's called tally safeguard and it was originally built uh from a uniswap grant so the the idea of tally safeguard was to address some concerns around the flexibility and permissions layer of dowse and our grant with ave was specifically around funding the uh audit with open zeppelin uh of these contracts so i think the best way to sort of describe um the the tally safeguard what the problem is is that you have a couple different camps when it comes to like governance and the ability of like governance to act quickly in an event of emergency as a little bit of timely if some people are following the bug in um compound uh introduced by a community proposal or introduced by a proposal there's this need to have a permissions layer around acting quickly so what tallysafeguard does is actually wraps the timelock which is the sort of authority in your governance with a permission system where you can give different addresses permissions around creating uh proposals uh executing proposals and canceling proposals the idea here is is that you can go from a governance structure where you have the token holders who directly control a time lock to a situation where the token holders directly control the time lock but they can add other folks as controllers on the time lock with different permissions so for example they could say hey we want to add this multi-sig to have the authority to create proposals on this time walk that then sit in the time lock for some duration of time during which governance could come in and cancel them right so the idea here is if you have a trusted group of individuals that um have the ability to like create proposals at will there should be some sort of administrative function where governance can come in and say no this proposal should not go through similarly governance can give someone else the ability to cancel proposal um so what you end up having is this this ability to like compose authority in your governance and the way that would look is a little bit how i just described it you may have one multi-sig that has the ability to create proposals uh another multi-sig or an individual that has the ability to cancel proposals so you could use that for example in a setup where um you know governance is open and it can create a proposal but you could have a sort of a overseeing group of security experts who have the ability to cancel a proposal uh or you could do it the other way around right the security experts can propose a proposal governance can cancel it you can also use it without a governance itself where you could just simply have different combinations of multi-sigs or different combinations of individual ad addresses that have different permissions to to create uh execute or cancel so you can kind of imagine how you could build any sort of permission structure based around that so that you can have a dow that both has true token holder governance but also has the ability to execute things in a quick manner uh or can be used as sort of like a sub group for for um treasuries a great example that we first had thought about when we were building safeguard was grants committees where grants committees themselves have this interesting situation where uh you know a proposal is created on governance that says okay let's give a million dollars to its grants committee and now this grants committee is a group of multi-sig holders but now they receive the money and they have ultimate authority over this money right it's not possible for the the governance to claim this money back from the multi-sig unless you ask the multi-sig nicely and this can sometimes be an issue right like you can you can distribute funds to a multi-sig that are worth you know a million dollars on day one uh you know defy can go to the moon and they can end up having a hundred million dollars in that multisig so the sort of trust assumptions that the community may make around members or signers of this multi-sig may be different depending on the the levels of uh maybe different like based on like how much value is being held there but this sort of like delegation of authority in terms of delegating money is really one way so the idea here around safeguard was that you could use it for example in grants committees where you can delegate spending authority to a group but the governance can still take it away without actually having to ask permission from the multisig holders to do that so what i i'll share here a really briefly is just our repo so folks can see it and uh go check it out this is what's being audited uh currently it opens upland we have uh you can find it here at github.com backslash with tally backslash safeguard uh if you go through the readme i'm not gonna go through the reading fully but if you go through the readme you can talk it talks about the sort of problems that i just laid out and the solution and vision that we have thought of including sort of a preliminary specification on how it works so this grant was for auditing it um the audit is almost complete we've just gone through the process of uh addressing some um just minor minor things that came up in the audit nothing nothing major but that audit should be completed in the next couple weeks um you know optimistically next week um uh probably safer to say in the next two or three weeks and that will be available here obviously it's open source anyone can use it and happy to really talk to folks who are interested in finding ways to incorporate this with their multi-sig with their governance of multi-sig with their you know governance multi-sig end user uh externally owned account um i always call it like and because it's externally owned accounts so we're happy to speak with anyone about that happy to talk more about that um you can you know uh uh go to the the repo here you can also always find us at uh with tally.com which is here so uh happy to take any questions and yeah that was awesome um thanks for that uh i i think uh it's less of a question more of like i want to give you more of a spotlight after the audit is done specifically what can people do and what would you like them to do so after the audit is done what i would like to see people do is two things one is i would like to see grants committees set up where the governance has true authority over the grant money right uh it doesn't feel long-term right when we talk about ave grants committee unit swap grants committee compound grants committee these are very large dows with a lot of money with a lot of prestige and it's not so hard for them to find pretty high profile individuals who can be trusted uh folks to to manage these these pools of money however you know when we talk about the future and dao is really spreading not all daos are going to always have access to these these sort of like quote-unquote famousy individuals with a lot to lose and reputation in the space to manage their pools of money and they can certainly run into situation where maybe today you know xyz dog token you know maybe it's worth a thousand dollars but you know something happens and boom now it's worth 10 million dollars and oh by the way it's managed by five anonymous uh users on a multisig that you've actually never met right of which you're not even sure they're all different people right it could all be one person so so for these smaller communities the risk becomes quite high and that becomes a kind of existential risk to the trust in the community so if you use something like tally safeguard these grants committees can sort of insulate themselves from that danger on the flip side it also potentially and i'm not a lawyer i cannot give legal advice um but it can potentially help with the claim around decentralization right so you i'm currently so a lot of uh governances use multi-sigs as their governance um but in the eyes of of uh some you know legal uh things again i'm not a lawyer um that might not actually fly right like you you have the concept of like an unincorporated general partnership which is what most multi-sigs are um these multi-sigs are you know if you create a grants committee with a bunch of friends um actually each of you is responsible for paying tax on the entire sum of money that is received in that multisig because it's unincorporated general partnership again this is not legal advice um so you know using something like tally safeguard where actually the governance has the ultimate authority and for example you know maybe the multi-stick holders can propose ideas that still go past governance and if governance does not take action can be automatically uh you know effectuated um maybe in some cases uh supports the argument that you're truly decentralized right because today um you know using just a multi-sig straight really puts a lot of onus on the multi-sigs holders and a lot of liability potentially on the multi-stakeholders again not a lawyer not legal advice um but you know the thoughts are like how do you build a safe protocol um that's both safe for the members and safe for um the the the uh participants who are maybe signers so that's where you know i think that's a really great example for your for your governance for your um you know uh grants committee oh it's awesome i think i want to also say that as a side effect of this setup you also uh get to design a system that scales with the user base like now you can have a lot of people come in instead of having two to three or whatever five people just kind of making a hierarchy around a two thousand person down so uh you also want to think about those because that prevents growing even more uh amazing so thank you so much dennison and thank you check out safeguard on the tally get up repel excellent thank you folks all right with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and introducing next is will robinson from d5 lines and what's going to talk about what the file lines is and how they work with uh ave and everything that you can do to get involved with d5 lines so without further ado let's welcome well [Music] hi everybody excuse the background i'm reporting from stairs as my house is under duress my name is will i've been at deep alliance for six months uh proud recipient of an ave grand uh d5 alliance has been around for over a year and a half building out an accelerator that helps grow defy users to 1 billion by 2025. it's an ambitious mission uh it basically means that we're looking to find new projects grow them invest in them connect them teach them through a curriculum that runs basically four times a year at this point we're finishing up with cohort five we'll be doing a keynote next week hosted by joey krug who is from pantera and auger um and there we will showcase uh 25 teams uh two of which were sponsored by ave grants to build out protocols um and grow on top of ave so interestingly uh early on we had partners from layer ones like cello and tara and al goran now [Music] lana and these ecosystems right they wanted us to bring defy to them and accelerate on top of them but at a certain point realize that like ave is its own ecosystem um it's its own platform to grow and build on top of and this is the promise of d5 right lego blocks and so ave wanting to support projects building on top of its foundational lego block like thus increasing its moat uh and importance in d5 uh you know tapped us to when we tap them i guess to to try and do that uh and so only they and uh uniswa have been like uh layer 1.5 uh for us as partners uh and i'll show you my our website so you can get a sense of what we're all about uh you should be able to see it here so dfinelines.com helping web3 startups succeed we have basically this theme around terraforming new lands and ave's logo will be scrolling by in a moment there so we have uh two facets we have the accelerators uh which are defined gaming now my own background is across both i used to be a financial auditor uh looking at crypto wallets and multi-sigs and making sure that the assets were there and that i could sign off on the books but before that i did a phd in video game design and so i'm excited to do both and think very closely about the intersection between defy and gaming as well because we see gaming is like the road to future uh defy users uh and i i suspect we will be letting in avogadro if not in this accelerator in the next one as like a very cool example of a game built on ave um and then we have this industry network these are you know companies uh that are made up of market makers and liquidity providers to help bootstrap our d5 protocols but also like lawyers who are really important and code auditors uh and community managers you know the sort of panoply of all things you would want to have to ensure success for your teams and we've accelerated some pretty cool alumni um and yeah what makes us unique is our access to liquidity and community and investment and we have these like amazing mentors like the list goes on forever uh you could come see at some point who you'd like to to meet maybe one day and the uh grant has allowed us to essentially bring these teams on without taking equity uh in their in their product this is allows allowing us to source better teams um that just want to grow and don't need to worry about like the financials or anything and so we give them this sort of like vc privileged accelerator process um and that's like covered by ave so in some ways we're like a grand re-gifter in that sense um and we have a variety of resources we also manage something called defy grants where you can see um not just ave's grants but everybody's grants in the ecosystem and we're trying to make this the go-to place to find capital so if you're interested in that definitely take a look here um we also in addition to d5 grants uh maintain something called defy jobs which is over here um and we have like 206 jobs in d5 this is all a work in progress is our old logo um but you can finally for instance the nine jobs at ave or you know jobs at some of our cohort companies and other companies we've accelerated the uh overall like goal right is to foster a really rich community full of like signal uh filter a lot of the noise that you find in crypto and make sure that we find strong builders who want to come work together from a diverse set of backgrounds and skills and if you're interested in doing that we'd really love to get your application in you can apply to defy or gaming if you're building on top of ave we'd love to to hear about you you can get your questions answered here um you can apply through our form right here so you know here's the cohort six application form which will be starting sometime we said november 23rd we'll actually be pushing it um because uh we're also as the defy alliance about to go down um we've been like a centralized organization trying to get this thing off the ground but we really want to um sort of dog food the web 3 that we're building and think that it's totally worthwhile to experience being a web 3 company accelerating web 3 companies in this way uh so deciding to do that has meant this is a 40-day delay on this cohort um i also can like show you our industry network so because we've succeeded at attracting um you know such great companies because they don't have to give up equity we have great sort of service opportunities so like if you want uh and join defy alliance i like you'll jump the line at quan steps quan stamps public queue for audits for instance or you'll get to like talk to our hype marketing team or directly to jump capital or winter mute to get your liquidity and so all of this is possible because of our sponsors like ave grants and the hope is just to grow deep by as fast as possible and be along for the ride my uh my sense of this is that we're we're kind of summoning like primordial forces when playing with crypto these sort of like self-perpetuating protocols that through value capture and then ability to redirect incentives grow a whole new way of being and interacting and i think it's terrifying and also amazing and that's that's why i'm really keen to join this like ride and to see where this goes and so i think that's the passion that fuels d5 alliance is just let's make defy happen faster and and think about it critically while we do it i am totally happy to um take questions if those do happen but otherwise i can also keep going uh kartik do you want to give me some guidance here yeah uh so we got a couple minutes i i think if you have anything else you want to talk about please free feel free to i think the one question would have is you sort of talked about the experience of the accelerator without the dilution which is a pretty good incentive and a pretty good pitch but uh could you go a little bit more into detail of like how the accelerator works what does it mean to be in a batch what are the things that you do for each of those companies and just a little bit more about that experience yeah definitely so uh it's something of a moving target as we're always refining and uh you know we're evolving with the times um currently the accelerator lasts six weeks where we do about six hours of content per week and that's like listening to pain warwick speak about how he built synthetics or listening to kenny wintermute about how to negotiate your liquidity deal listen to larry suckernick on how to structure your dow or spencer applebaum about how to give away governance tokens in order to bootstrap your liquidity that way so these are really detailed um lectures that aren't just like feel-good motivational speeches but like technically like difficult problems that you don't even know you have to solve um from the industry experts which is not like the you know y combinator who people compare us to um right where it's just like here's how you like you know beat those guys and raise your spirits it's more like this is a complicated space here are some subject matter experts um and then we have uh like our ecosystem partners such as uh ave and uniswap and solana and cello and everybody sort of helping out in polygon and uh teaching our teams how to build on their systems we think the future is multi-chain like although we love ethereum like super deeply uh we do want to see all these other platforms give it a shot and grow um maybe you know teach ethereum a thing or two and vice versa and so they're helping our teams navigate their own grants and their own code reviews and they're also giving their state of the union and their vision of how they're different so that's a pretty cool kind of value add and then we have our regional capitals so there's a european define alliance chapter where we get like a chat from ajit tripathi from ave and melton demiros from coin shares and that's always a hoot and then we give a talk from uh china with uh our chapter there um that's usually headed up by mabel jang who's from multicoin and we have our indian chapter uh where we'll have like you know the polygon people and other like wonstant people and the other amazing companies coming out of india give the lay of the land how to hire there how to market there how to like um think about your community um globally through the lens of these regional chapters uh so that's like a big part of it but it all sort of like culminates with demo day and a big part of our program is making sure you can like pitch your company to a large audience of defy stakeholders who are going to know what you're talking about and need you to succinctly clarify what you're doing and who you are and why they should trust you uh something that people like often forget is that like d5 protocols until they're like living on their own are people right and like they're going to pivot and they're going to change and they're going to make code mistakes and you've got to really know who the people are behind that protocol until it's like you know past it's like lindy effect stage uh so yeah that's that's our program um you chat with me and i get to help you out whenever you need it uh that's another part of it and uh when it comes to the game track well we're trying to get like the best game tokenomics people and the twitch people and the discord people to sort of structure your community so if d5 alliance d5 program is about liquidity um the game program that we're launching is about the community those are the sort of bloods that run through the veins of these different kinds of web 3 projects and that's a excellent pitch that uh if i ask anything more i'll probably ruin the the good note that it's ended on so this is great everybody who wants to learn more about d5 lines head over to the finance dot co and i'm sure you can contact will on twitter as well as uh through the website so i guess encourage everybody to apply and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk thanks so much well bye-bye everybody so next up i want to introduce matthew who's going to talk about llama so uh matthew's here uh whenever you're ready feel free to uh get started [Music] i think you are still uh muted so we'll just give a quick second on being ready on the audio side all right can you guys hear me now here we go cool see and you can see the screen okay everything's good full screen here awesome all right so hello everyone my name is matthew from from the llama community the llama community received a grant some time ago from from arbay and it's focusing around uh our base treasury management so [Music] and some difficulties all right so within this grant we have a few main deliverables the main ones are focusing around the vision for arbay what we would like to try and achieve with their treasury how we want to put it to use and the direction we think we can we can take it in as a community we're also putting together an asset management framework which kind of really structures a lot of the decisions allocations how we're going to implement how we kind of approach risk we're also going to put in some initial initial strategies so put forward some ideas presented on the governance forum and they'll progress to an arc over time and then hopefully we'll get one of those through within this grant or maybe potentially the next grant so and then touching on some of the areas around like financial reporting what we're looking to create is income statements cash flow statements and balance sheets and we want to start producing those periodically on a monthly basis and with that what we're going to try and try and do different for more traditional companies we want to try and make this kind of live data and we're trying to use data analytics and june to help us do that as a tool so summarizing the the first main deliberate which is the division document this is available on the rv treasury rva governance forum if anyone wants to go have a read so this document is this outlines the vision the vision with presenting to the community is to encourage innovation accelerate growth prudent financial management of assets while providing relevant and transparent financial reporting content we suggest that the community should remain overweight are they to capture the future growth upside whilst also hedging the risk against adverse market conditions uh assets are to be to be deployed productively within the guidance of best asset management practices real-time financial metrics performance tracking will be providing transparency to the community and support decisions around how best to deploy the community's capital and we're also the treasury management and financial reporting it is in its early days and requires nuanced thinking within crypto and this creates an opportunity for our way to continue being a leader in space so within within the vision we're also looking at uh what how would you construct like a portfolio of assets that are they would hold within its treasury so within that we're also looking at a lot of risks which are going to be heavily detailed in kind of like the asset management guidelines we'll go into a little bit later uh we look into some of the unique features around like liquidity considerations at a asset portfolio level but then also in device specific like on-chain liquidity so getting in our positions we're also looking at how do you remain long rv in your treasury and then also deploy it productively and some of the ways doing that is is through debt uh and whilst maintaining that really large long rb positioning we're trying to want to hedge away some of the market volatility so if we're going to stay like a crypto winter the the treasury doesn't you know substantially forward the market so we're looking to try and offset some of that whilst also capturing that upside so that's really about like maximizing the upside and then minimizing the downside and really just trying to deploy assets when the treasury productively so we can make the most out of d5 really so when we talk into asset management we're kind of really here we're trying to really create a framework that the community can kind of understand and refer back to in times like turbulence like we're really trying to drive this preserved capital whilst growing the protocol whilst also trying to like reduce risk so that's just touching on that hedging angle from a price but then the ocean crack risk is also where you're deploying your assets if you deploy all your assets in a single area and something happens to it and you've got a lot of exposure but if you spread it out across the space then you've got less specific risk on each investment so with this like the the risk angle is very important um there is there's the credit risk the market risk there's liquidity there's infrastructure so kind of touched on those few few times now and then the nuance of d5 is to d by specific risks and that's where you really start to think about like smart contract risk admin keys oracles open source code so basically making sure where you're recommending to suggest to the community that you've done the due diligence and this is a safe record safe suggestion so the way in which we tend to implement treasury management is through the aip process that means everything's going to go through the governance forum it's going to be open to community feedback engagement we really really encourage people to to review our posts and like give constructive feedback we're all just trying to do the best best we can so anyone who comes up with like an amazing idea we really want to hear about it um [Music] within the asset management guidelines we're also trying to think about long term for army if there's any strategic assets that have a place in there so that could be just equity through alignment of two communities kind of objectives um and that could be like just through partnerships as well if we introduce leverage into the treasury we really need to have a strong understanding around that like really know where our health factor is like interest cover ratios what are we going to do in certain conditions like a lot of forward planning there if you think of the the treasuries like this asset allocation nor asset portfolio periodically you're probably looking to like rebalance that and within each allocation that portfolio you've probably got bands of like mints and matches where you want to keep a certain allocation so that's something that we expect to be ongoing over time there's the potential there to do a treasury committee and the suggestion we've presented is that that would be something that would meet courtly to review the the asset management guidelines um existing composition and you know how it all kind of fits together with the overall objectives we're trying to achieve so and we look to manage the treasury in perpetuity so recognizing that like the community has been around a fair while now and it's going to be around for many many years to come and we want to make sure that we're planning for that extended time horizon so the best way for us to frame that is to consider this in in perpetuity so now this slide's trying to show some of the some of the work we've already done there's a um june analytics page that's out it was done by one of the llama community members so what this is showing right now is at the top left you've got like the ethereum reserve factor which is essentially or are they b2 b1 how much revenue or has been generated from it so as you can see here we're looking like 15.5 million which is really good we've got like reserve fact sorry the ecosystem reserve which is basically the core are they holding so and on the right we've got like the the polygon reserve factor which is how much revenue is being generated on the polygon network and you can see um from the from the charts like particularly the one on the left it looks a little bit exponential like it's a really great chart uh and you know polygon's done really well it's like coming out of the block since being super strong performance for the outback community so there's a lot more charts on this ave a analama dashboard so for everyone who's keen to have some of those financial metrics i encourage you to go go have a look so coming into some of the more financial kind of reporting side of the the grant what we've got here is this is one of the first statements we produce which is basically a usd nominated rba v12 like p l statement so what it's doing is it's showing monthly the usd value that rba is kind of is this revenue is generating usd value now you know from the previous chart when you accumulate it it looks pretty exponential what you can see here is if you look across the bottom line as you can see harvey's actually quite performing quite strongly month on month it's getting uh it's good growth you can think back and uh there's been a fair bit of volatility in the price of assets what you can see in here is the bottom line and rva is somewhat influenced but potentially not as much as what you'd see as some other protocols so what you've seen is a really strong upwards trend in this and it's uh it's it's quite a good balance sheet so this is one of the three main uh financial deliverables that we've got and these these are all available through the rba governance forum as well and if we were to look at the the breakdown of some of this what we're seeing is the reserve factor is it's very heavily concentrated in usdc um and dyer and usdt which makes a lot of sense because those are the biggest pulls on on arbeit for lending and borrowing and the the polygon network is generating very similar but just in a smaller magnitude but the distribution is a lot more balanced than say say b1 and v2 combined so that's really how what all the numbers are kind of presenting and if we were to look forward to kind of what comes next uh we're looking to build out the balance sheet that's the one piece we haven't really yet developed we've got the income statement we've got the cash flow statement we really want the balance sheet and then we're really going to start going into a lot more data on june we're going to start looking at a lot more financial metrics like how's are they performing peer-to-peer ratios or peer-to-peer comparisons so return on investment all those kinds of statistics is where we're looking to kind of develop out and we're looking to provide all this in a really easy format that the community can kind of take a glance at and really just kind of understand so and that's that's how our llamas today what we've done with our uh ave and a little bit about where we're playing and taking into the future awesome well thank you so much matthew and uh this is great um maybe just one question would be how can people get involved if they want to and uh sort of uh what are some ways to keep up with everything that's happening with llama sure so the best way to keep up with what llamas doing with rva is via the the governance forum like everything we do there is published uh if someone wanted to get a little bit more actively in involved in the treasury management side for rba in particular i'd definitely be on there on the governance forum trying to contribute and throw ideas around that's really a good place to showcase what you've got to offer uh in terms of contributing to talama itself like i think probably just reach out to us via twitter so we're not really don't really have a website with uh a discord we can come join yet that's something that'll come in time but yeah just reach out to us over twitter and we would love to have a chat well thank you so much for that matthew and uh we are with that ready to move on to our next uh talking demo so um i'd like to welcome ben uh from rabbit hole and uh we'll just give ben a quick second to uh get set up and then whenever you're ready feel free to get started hey everyone thanks for thanks for having me today um my name is ben and i am the operations lead at rabbit hole for those that don't know rabbit hole is a a platform that simultaneously does two things one for communities and protocols like ave we help protocols find the best users and participants um for their network and then on the other side for for users we we help them learn about onboard into different projects and and use different crypto applications um and help them earn crypto for doing so so we recently did a a quest the the core function of rabbit hole is is a quest where a protocol provides some amount of rewards that incentivizes a specific action for users to complete if rabbit hole we we verify using the graph that a user has completed a specific action that applies to the quest we reward them with the tokens that are provided so we recently did a quest through the out of a grants program where we incentivized users to both lend and borrow funds on ave polygon we targeted 2 000 users and actually had 2 000 users complete this quest and redeem the rewards within 12 hours um i believe were the numbers which was incredible it really showed the excitement within our community and within our users um for using and getting more acclimated with avec if we take a step back um rabbit holes is really appealing to the users who are trying to get more involved in crypto and in web 3 and to become better better and more knowledgeable citizens of of the the web 3 world and so um partnering with rabbit hole and doing quest on rabbit hole is a great way to gain exposure to educate people um and to bring in more eager participants and and owners of the network so we're extremely happy with with the way this most recent quest um with ave went we've are working with a number of other leading uh program uh protocols and communities in the web3 space we've worked with uniswap we just did a quest this past week um with polygon we're working on stuff with we've worked on stuff with the graph pull together um all different types of protocols and d5 nfts layer ones i'm really focused on how to get users more educated and more involved uh in the leading projects in crypto and then for the leading projects in crypto agave um how do we find more users who actually want to use the product we're not about speculation um we're about finding people who are into using projects want to be good stewards for your community want to be active users and i think moving forward we'd like to move further and further on um we have the as the grand vision we we look at ourselves right now as pioneering learn to earn so i'm sure most people are familiar with axio infinity and and play to earn um you know you you earn money for playing in a game we look at rabbit hole right now as pioneering learn to earn so you you earn a protocols tokens for learning about them and and most importantly actually using them but moving forward i think what we'd like to get to is participate to learn and what participate to earn means is moving more and more into rewarding contributions to networks and so what that might look like moving forward and we're working on these capabilities and we'd love to continue discussing them with ave um and and through the grants program but what participates iron looks like more and more is like how do we actually reward value that's contributed to the network and so um what what that might be is you get rewarded if you've um if you've lent a certain amount of money and driven a certain amount of yield um over the over six months period of time and what that's doing is it's incentivizing real sustained contributions real value provided to the network and rabbit hole can be the place where you incentivize and reward those reward those things rabbit hole has as i mentioned an extremely eager set of users who love to participate in wipe are constantly learning and upscaling and can be a really good partner for ave as ave thinks about new things that they'd like to incentivize and reward whether that's launching on a new protocol like we recently did with ave and polygon um or whatever that might be rabbit hole can be the place where protocols go uh to find new participants incentivize them make sure that they're the right participants we offer the ability to filter based on different skills we offer civil protection so you know that your every user you get is actually a unique human and um can be a strong partner in helping ave strengthen their community moving forward um as i mentioned had a we're really pleased with the excitement from our rabbit hole community about the object quest we did a few weeks ago and look forward to to more and more hopefully successful ventures down the line awesome thank you so much for that awesome intro ben and uh just so uh people know how to get in touch with you what is the best way to learn more yeah if you'd like to reach out to me personally at ben schechter on twitter um but for rabbit hole uh you can go to rabbithold.ggg and complete our quest uh credential yourself through our skills if you've done different actions on chain we provide credentials for that which can then be used to unlock new opportunities unlock new quests in the future and to dive further into being a web 3 user and citizen amazing thank you so much ben awesome thanks so much for having me great so with that we are ready to move on to our last talk of the day so we've already spent the past few hours talking about how each of the different grant programs are structured and how everything has evolved so far and you've also even now seen a showcase of some of the incredible projects that the ave grants has has funded but to kind of really sum it all up um i want to do this last panel on what does it mean to successfully receive a grant from ave and how do you actually go from applying to the finish line and uh having this discussion will be sharias and nimron who'll help out with the other events program and i'll let them jump in directly so welcome back uh share some imran and i'll let you take it from here [Music] thank you kartik hey sheriff how are you hey man i'm good great um you know like you know we've been working with each other for quite some time now and there's just a lot of learnings um both from you know working with other dows and working with all of the new participants that are applying for avi grads and um and there's been many questions that come up at least for me when when i'm talking to the recipients and one one question i get very commonly is um what are the right ideas or what are the right opportunities for ave and other protocols and how should i be using my resources to help let's say ave as an example and so maybe we could start with that and then we can start to think about the design space then the process and then how we think about grants moving forward yeah it's a good question i think um the the number one thing is um it's just something that benefits avi and it seems simple but um but because of the nature of um of open source contributions and and the types of projects that that can apply like you know there's startups there's um there's uh you know sort of a general like public good type contribution uh there could just be a lot and and i think um at the very least this like your project should benefit avi in some way and what that means is it can benefit other users um so you know like gennady network built something that uh saves uh you know use other users from costly liquidations it could benefit like sort of governance contributors and so you know making the governance interface easier or improving um yeah sort of streamlining the governance process in some way it could help um you know obvi protocol directly it's like increasing tbl uh bringing like sort of stable kind of criteria um uh or yeah it could it could have helped the gender like dao so like setting up uh you know uh endowed a subject that focuses on on risk or treasury or or something else and so i i would say um to start off like you know um a bunch of projects kind of get ruled out because um because they don't seem to be benefiting avi in some way and and uh and you know like it doesn't mean that like the project should go on to do other things it's just it's just that um the benefits of it shouldn't be like a really small tangential thing it should be something that's kind of a focus with the grant um and so i i would say um uh you know i wouldn't over complicate like um you know just what like hey what's the best thing that ave needs and like you know where we of course have rfps in our site and there's some things we prioritize like like the governance ui and the developers now uh but i i would say that you know the problem is is more like basic than that where you know a lot of projects um are building something that might be really useful and actually you know a valuable either public good or a valuable startup but it feels like the the rv benefit is um is really forced to like non-existent or it's just like a side note mate um and so yeah that's probably how i answered it thank you um and you've touched on some interesting things um which i'll talk about in a bit but one point that i wanted to make earlier uh with our conversation with robert leschner stanley um was the fact that accessibility has been an interesting play into how grants are being processed um you know previously you know like web 2 you could think about these grants are effectively like venture funds or bench investments to see like new ideas now the rate of seeing new ideas is exponentially growing because of all the grants that that's out there and so accessibility and then you have um kind of the rate of speed of how we're supporting these newer foundry developers into the ecosystem um and so how are you seeing that landscape and are you talking to people from all over the world how what does your day-to-day look like from that perspective yeah it's a good question i i think there's definitely um i i i think there's a there's a lot of uh diverse like uh developer and other like contributor activity uh more so than i i would say you know in inter in the in the traditional like venture type custom and so um you know one one reason for that is just uh you know like the the the nature of crypt like crypto generally is is attracted like all sorts of people from from um sort of the non-traditionally credentialed uh backgrounds and that extends to these grants programs as well um the other element if crypto is like this pseudonymous component like um symphony finance uh the god navigant fully pseudonymous steam and we we you know did some sort of kyc verification but uh but yeah that's sort of kept private and it's a fully surrounding scheme that can apply that it's quite hard in in sort of in the traditional world um and uh yeah the the concept from pretty much all over like um you know i spoken to a bunch of teams um in uh across europe uh in in this vietnam team there's a bunch of teams in india teams in the us um in canada like so it's pretty much from all over actually not thinking if it would be cool to to do some yeah like a a pie chart of these applicants um and the folks we're funding too uh but yeah i i'd say it's pretty much from smaller but like i would say you know i would like to see um uh yeah maybe uh maybe more focused like maybe more like female applicants um and uh you know there's definitely areas maybe we can do a better job just in terms of uh outreach uh magnus from shifa maybe maybe some collaboration there or something um but uh but yeah in terms of geographic um distribution i think it's it's like you know pretty much from all over the place maybe the the only restriction is you know you you do have to apply for the grant in english and so there's there's probably you know some areas that are restricted that way but um outside of that like you know we're quite uh we're quite open and accessible to like um you know pretty much all types of contributions and this includes like you know we're we're focused a lot on on developer um uh projects versus like more community oriented ones um um though the the bunch of them they're really interesting i think as we um expand our budget uh you know pending like governance approval and everything uh we would like to you know focus more on this culture and community bit um but yeah i think i think for now the the focus has been on on these developer projects but there's of course like many more skills that you can apply including like certain analysis community co you know culture like uh you know there's stuff you could do in the nft world um uh that we can fund throughout the grant so uh would like to do more of that um as we as we have more more money to fund these projects and um what's also very interesting is i'm starting to see more and more of this within just like when we're interviewing applicants is the fact that some of them don't even have web through experience right and they want to contribute in in traditional sense like the web 2 world i know we've seen like the mobile app that's being proposed to build brave i've seen dashboards risk analysis that are being proposed by web 2 founders um and that's very interesting because like i know car tick and each global team has done a great job of bringing like high quality developers into the ethereum ecosystem and now we're starting to see grants playing a part in that which is you know which i thought was a like a indirect effect so what are your what are your thoughts about that yeah it's really cool because i think um i think it's actually a very good um onboarding for people uh in fact i would you know uh just like i would recommend someone uh who has some like web to experience to just like do a hackathon at uh eat global or get coin and and like you know make it make your way through i would i would include avigrances as one of them you know along with with um union comp grants like i think um it's it's very cool way that you can if you don't know if you don't know at all what what to do just like look you know look at the rfps and then there's something that you'll be able to further with your skill set um and uh i actually recommended this to a few friends who have um who wanted to uh kind of just get their hands dirty and getting into crypto i actually think that's one of the advantages of a grants program it seems very sim simple and straightforward that you you have this application you can actually apply and you can you can you can like do something concrete and get funded for it um it's it's actually um it's very useful for like a lot of other people like most people actually aren't um sort of that uh comfortable just like getting in front of a dao and like you know just proposing what they want to do and uh you have to be a some type of person which um uh you know quite quite forthcoming and extroverted uh and and you know willing to say what you know uh just just take initiative and even when you don't know what like sort of just push something forward uh which i think is a very useful thing too um but but i think grants are very useful for like a bunch of people who kind of want a more private i think uh application if you're rejected you're rejected privately it's not this like sort of public facing um uh doubt that's right that's rejecting you there's also a way to um to just like you know get like a lot of times the rejection isn't um it's just something they can tweak or like you know maybe maybe it's it's not a fit now because of what we're focusing on or something uh but uh it's it's the relationship is still there and can continue um and so yeah i would say um it's it's definitely you know one of those like really um uh one of those things i would say that that a web 2 person should um you know should consider applying for one of these defy grounds to get in uh i would also say like you know it's um uh you know what once you once you do one of these like it just um you know you can you can then go on to like walk you know work for the developers that are like you know work for other company you know it's it's a really cool like like almost career path and it's not gonna i don't know how long it's gonna last because you know we're at at the stage where you know we we know every every grant that's been funded it's not um you know it's not sort of that we have a lot of inbound but it's not that overwhelming and so each of these projects get a lot of i think attention and are noticed and you know um and so that that's really cool too and i i would like to i think expand our um uh like sort of reach inability to you know do this more where we can um you know actually be more targeted i was speaking to the blockchain and berkeley folks uh earlier today and you know there's probably ways we can we can coordinate with with some of the university groups to um you know to to sort of source uh sort of develop a work in talent that way uh there's definitely more we can sort of um uh push from our side but from from the inbound perspective like i i definitely think um you know there's there's a lot of people who fit that category of like you know they're not they're not like solitary devs with a lot of experience they they just like you know they're iterating and and bringing their way out and and um and the grants is like a good safe space to do that yeah um and i want to touch on a very interesting point uh that's happened many times throughout just like the crypto like crypto history which is like high quality founders will or you know people that want to become entrepreneurs will find any way to get access to funding so they can see their idea and this is for all the developers are listening today i mean like giving like a clear example of the one-inch team and how they built uh the first iteration of one inch at a east global hackathon or sao may and and and team at eat san francisco and eat india and so like a part of like like you know for founder like people that are aspiring to be founders you know seize your idea right you have this great opportunity there's so many grants that are available to you and there's just a lot you could do with dave ecosystem and others and so like for potential founders this is like a great opportunity and maybe sri is maybe highlighting like have you like what were some of the success stories been like um for for those that received grants from from us yeah uh and i just wanna comment down that i want to add in addition to um to like the the money to um yeah basically you know without diluting yourself you're getting uh some some capital to basically build something and and learn and iterate and experiment uh you also have like um i think a community that um that that's you're almost like taking along with your project and so if you're if you're if you're building something you know alongside um avi or you you focus on one or two protocols and you're really like sort of tailoring or integrating with them um you you have the sort of uh support i think uh which is very useful especially if you you know you're you're a project without um sort of any um any visibility like it's it's cool to have that initial um backing and integration to like then do other things um and so that that's a that's i think a value that i've seen um some projects comment on uh in terms of yeah the success um success stories like you know pretty much like a lot of the grants for funding are really useful and important things and uh the main the main thing is just to actually ship it and execute it and and if if like 100 projects do that like you know all of them would be you know really great and useful in different ways um and so in terms of the ones that have uh gelato comes to mind they they ship really quickly and uh they built this this you know useful solution to um uh to to prevent users from these costly liquidations i think they um they they had a lot of background on the like solidity uh and smart contract side but but um i think they are using other groups have to build uh build a ui um and so you know they they were just like sort of hacky and quick and uh built something um the symphony finance did just um went public i think on uh launched the beta on polygon um and so you know they're equal too like they're building um you know basically a way to uh unyield with limit orders i think that there's um uh omni analytics was another one where you know they kind of like took over the um the the sort of analytics uh function from some of the stuff that that ave company was doing and uh we we actually wanted um like in rv grants like human analytics kind that they're helping manage uh they they put putting out some really cool analytics on avion polygon on dune and and they're also i think building up a separate dashboard in r because um you know june is limiting in some ways um and so you know the way i describe success is honestly like completing what the the the the scope grant that these projects have laid out and and a few that they're definitely more that um that have completed it successfully but i'd say you know just just doing that is is a big enough step because uh because some some of these projects are uh like ambitious uh but but all of them are like you know quite useful to the ecosystem um which is why you know why we're funding it so um you know there's a wide spectrum of of things from um sort of yeah analytics to uh some more ambitious projects say like um you know uh build bringing zero capacity loans to rv or something like that that you know is more ambitious and will take more time and has more steps uh but yeah like our our approach from from avigrant side is you know if if the project has a higher you know grant size we just we just split into multiple milestones but we don't shy away from from funding those it's just that we need to make sure that the execution can can actually be done and there's clear is a clear road map to that and i guess we're almost at time but one final question is um how easy or hard is it to apply for rave and get and receive a grant yeah it's uh very straightforward to apply it should be like 15 minutes to finish the application um and uh you know the um the you know there's no like trick questions or something like it's quite straightforward just see what what you're working on uh what one like one thing to keep in mind is again like like clearly i learned that like why why are you applying to the to the rv grant like you know the benefit to rv the other customer or users or the community in some way um and then uh we'll um we'll get back to you with uh uh you know if it makes sense to schedule um an interview with one of the grand debuts and then yeah and then you know after the interview um the interview basically you know if if there's any feedback to the other uh grandstand members we'll we'll um ask for feedback but then you know besides that you know we should we should get back to you um uh with the decision soon i i uh the the only question is we like to batch things together so um so you know we'd like to send sort of like maybe 10 uh decisions together so you it might just be a little weird to just batch them together but yeah besides that it should be quite straightforward to um you know apply um and yeah like we you know if for some reason we we think um you know the project can be tweaked tweaked in some way to uh make it better suited or maybe the grant amount is too exotic and there's some there's a smaller amount that makes sense like we'll definitely let you know and it's not you know it's even even the interview like it's sort of meant to be a conversation to understand just uh you know what you're building like um you know it's some some evidence that like you know you you actually execute on this um and then yeah why it's why it's useful to the rv custom um and that's that's pretty much like you know a summary of things and you'll have maybe specific questions on on the direction you're taking or something oh well sure thank you so much um i'll pass it over to kartik um for the final yeah thank you i'm sure that was an incredible chat i i i feel like trash already has a whole pitch prepare for this thing but i'll just ask you the the uh kind of closing sort of piece of it how can people get involved uh what's the next uh takeaway and uh just everything around it yeah uh thanks karthik this is great uh i do want to like shout out like you know a bunch of uh our grants members um you know imran has done an amazing job with with um yeah quite especially according with events besides um besides reviewing uh grant applications um i'm gonna miss on some people but yeah like you know uh nick from from garlic has done a terrific job uh alex uh you know a bunch of others from the grand style so um you know we definitely want to um uh you know shout out to them but we're we're farming the developers now uh carbon page from our team is leading that and and so uh if if anyone has an interest in basically being being part of uh you know a small group that's actually you know working directly for uh ave dao and being involved in core development uh it's a really cool opportunity it's i think probably the only opportunity in in in like you know among the large d5 protocols where you can uh directly work for the dao and and um and and be part of something you know quite quite unique so uh would would recommend uh applying there it should be on on the avigrance.org website i'd say um uh in terms of applying for a grant like you know where we just accept things rolling and so you know if you have anything that you think could improve the rv custom uh you know other users the community you know feel free to apply uh the application is short should be like 15 minutes and uh if you have any questions just reach out to me or um you know dm the rv grants twitter account or something um but yeah i think that you know should cover it like i i also want to yeah thank i guess the the projects that have applied and build things you know it's it's it definitely is quite like inspiring and energizing like the the abi community is really um yeah it is there's just a lot of a lot of experimentation and uh openness i think of the culture so um you know definitely um uh uh yes sort of want to continue to support those projects and um and new ones as well and and we will try to build our our um process out such that you know folks who have done a good job in the in the in these first rounds of grants like you know are they get some way that they can be involved in the
