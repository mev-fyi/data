all right just gonna get one more confirmation that this is recording properly and then we can get started great okay so again uh for those who just joined this is the market make demo feedback session so what we're going to do is similar to the first one if you'd attended last week we have a couple members of the ave team david and mark will be joining a little bit later and then nicola from run miscap and they're going to be giving feedback on what you've been working on so far so again like last week you'll have a few minutes to present what you're working on and then they will give you some tips on how to improve your presentation or maybe some things you haven't considered and in general hopefully this is part of improving your submission for next sunday the february 7th so um i'm really excited to get started um nicolas since it's your first time do you want to give a quick intro to who you are and what you do sure sure um hello everybody thank you for for having me i'm with lemnis cup uh shasha my colleague and partner give an introduction last time so you know a crypto native investment firm venture capital focused on uh very early stage uh crypto networks and and blockchain startups i i joined landscape in early 2018 so since the outset basically we we speak with many projects um try to give us many feedback and and and support their roadmap in terms of uh product token economics and and all the protocol canvas and the participant and agents and how they interact with each other in the protocol that's something i try to give a lit a lot of focus on when when we examine projects but that's uh that's about it great simple straightforward thanks for joining um i appreciate you uh giving a little bit of time to hackers and then just the overall event so i think we will start off right away with lev marco are you ready yeah hello everyone i'm red i'll share my screen okay so i'll get started with some transactions and uh because it's quite slow uh with the fork in my net and while it load i'll start explaining about our project [Music] let's confirm this okay so levavi it's a platform to open leveraged position powered by uh other liquidity and one inch exchange uh it works with flash loan uh so basically it started from the one-inch bantyadiya where in just one transaction we can open the leveraged position putting some collateral first tagging taking a flash loan doing the trade on one inch and then uh repaying the flash loan uh after we made the uh trade with one inch and we deposit the collateral on ave protocol so we tried to made a quite simple interface uh taking inspiration from unit swap and all the others aluminum market makers we implemented some functions uh of course for the leverage uh part of our app so for example we can okay finally here we got our main transaction so the first two transactions the first one it was for approved the collateral to be spent on our contract and the second one it was for approved delegation of the debt token uh that we need to complete the whole operation actually to allow the contract to borrow on our behalf so yeah confirm it and execute the trade at the moment it's a bit expensive it's around 1 million gas we believe that with some optimization we can go maybe to around 500 000 and 600 000 but consider the flash loan involved and all the transactions uh we're not sure we can go below that so we opened our position and here the app is showing us uh the position that we have open uh we have put uh 10 well as collateral and uh we have bought a position of 882 links and here on the up when we are interacting with it here we can say the position side which is basically the a tokens that we will receive while here smaller we have the swap price which is uh the spot price with uh five uh drop leader uh how many links we would get on the spot price so we can then close the position and go ahead actually again because it's going to get slow again and yeah we have to approve the first time again because this is another token this is the a link that we are approving to be transferred by our wallet and so yeah going back to the interface here we can decide to either open a long position or a short position the moment we decided to go for just a few fixed leverage amount axis and yeah finally we can close our position and yeah it's not closing instantly because uh yeah we're still improving the ux so there's just a polling going on every two seconds but uh yeah the final idea would be to just close it automatically once the transaction is confirmed so yeah about the leverage we decided uh to offer a more user-friendly uh user experience for the user uh just three fixed the amount of leverage and for the long position is to extract some x while for the short position is 1x to x and 3x actually uh based on the collateral shows and the leveraged asset not always it will be possible to open a 4x long or a 3x short based on because you know different collaterals have difference long to value and so even if there's no position open on the protocol maybe if we choose some particular pairs it will fail uh because of not enough collateral to execute the rate basically it would go below factor one that's the start of the trade uh marco do you want to you want to wrap up there and then we can move on to feedback sure yeah okay cool yeah um nicola david and i think mark joined uh you want to just go ahead and give your feedback or thoughts on this and it doesn't have to just be it can remember we're we're talking about the concept we're talking about a little bit of the presentation but there will be more of that next week and then the ui is pretty fleshed out so you can also get feedback on that so uh i can go on unless debbie do you want to start i'm not go ahead oh nicola whatever doesn't matter but well go ahead mark go ahead mark thank you so first thing good job on the ui like the units of model is like super simple like the the communities uh already used to it and what you were able to build in just a few days is like super simple to use uh i that's the first time i saw your demo and i already know uh in terms of ux how i can use it and what to do and that's a super cool thing i will have a few subjects here if you want to improve from that point the first thing is that it's very close that what we can already do on defyserver.com you're probably aware of it where you can automate your leverage position in terms of gas optimization probably as you use flashline you will have to do leverage loops so basically you borrowed the new deposit to increase your collateral then you borrow again and so on and so forth so the higher your leverage uh the the higher the cost in gas is probably probably is and what i could suggest maybe as a pathway to do it it may be explore credit delegation so you can use flash loan to take some liquidity from the away protocol and open position and then at the end of your transaction pay back your your your loans but maybe it's uh it's a pathway to consider to have credit delegation to directly take a credit line from a third party and basically pay the interest from your position because it's a leveraged position so you have some interest to pay as long as the the position is open and maybe that can be a pathway that nobody did to the best of my knowledge yet and uh that there can be something fun to explore and uh last things just details uh all a tokens uh oh okay so i see uh i see the comments all a tokens and uh all uh avec tokens in all the protocol version two support the permit method so it's just a small thing but i see that you still use the approved path to close the position all this kind of stuff uh in order for your user to save on some gas because uh right now you are using a main network but on main neck like just an approved uh transaction can cost four five six dollars and take some time because you have to wait for that transaction to be included inside the block to then execute the the actual operation uh using the permit uh a pathway can save time and money in this kind of interaction so that might be something cool to explore as well thank you mark okay i can go ahead if you want is there anybody want to comment ahead mark no yeah there you go you go nick okay david yes thank you marco uh quick um i mean very sleek i like it uh simple intuitive two quick things one is would you uh you know you think it would be interesting to have um a loan basically to collateral ratio exposed there in case of you choose the collateral that you want to deposit and you know do you think it might be useful to to have that somewhere so you can actually see uh you know the availability and in a sense also the the leverage that you can use with that so that's the first question and and the second um it's about the stop-loss that you mentioned the other time uh i think it's interesting and i think on on futures on on leverage positions um it's something very useful but it's it's quite complicated so i wanted to know if you had an update especially on thinking or um how you would go about it uh to to create that one and and how how you have been developed the idea so far okay so about the subplots unfortunately we decided that we probably won't have the time to do it uh for the time of the hackadon so yeah we've we've been focusing on improving the up and have it uh those basic functionalities work uh as fast as possible but yeah for the implementation of the incoming s was suggested by the one inch bounty idea i think it would work with a chain link oracle but actually we didn't dive in and researched about it so i really don't have a clear answer for that and about the first question uh so do you mean uh to check uh how much liquidity is available to borrow from ave for flash loans also but also on on terms of like your ratio and and how powerful your leverage would be and how collateralized you are depending on on on which collateral you can choose from right so yeah it's a sort of like uh you know which one i choose and and what's the ratio just to have it there in instead to do the maths on your head basically actually the idea uh it was uh maybe not to show too many stats that could confuse users but make all the calculation on the backend and uh just less than no users in the ui if the trades that he wants to do it wouldn't be positive and also show all different stats like health factor loan to value and makes sense makes sense okay thank you thank you i think some some good comments have already been made uh any comment uh i'd have like by the way this is fantastic ui really sleek and everything as well it's a really good implementation uh would be uh yeah like they're saying you can pull you can pull out um i guess the ltv values of certain reserves so you should be able to sort of calculate on the fly if they select link or whatever collateral you should be able to know that you know they're they're capable of this amount of leverage so i think on the ui that's pretty important because you don't want someone over leveraging and then the transaction failing and you know spending whatever fifty dollars on transaction costs um and i think that that would just be that would smooth out the ui of it and then another ui thing would be um on the rv app one of the things that we do is when a user takes a borrow position it will say you know your current health factor and this will be a new health factor uh so if you could have something like that because i think that helps people a lot um because you know leveraging can seem like free money um but there's associated risks so if people see that you know taking a 3x leverage actually the health factor is going to be like 1.2 right which is pretty dangerous um you know it might you know that can help them decide on the risk so i'd say try and implement something like that it doesn't have to be a health factor it could just be like a little message at the bottom that's in red that says hey this could be dangerous or this could be safe or things like that that's all the feedback thank you though awesome what a great start thank you marco for presenting and we're going to move on to the next project uh watchful eye do you want to get started with your presentation yeah sure um i apologize my webcam is uh kind of messed up right now so um all right are you all seeing that yes okay um sorry just to just check is this a demo or are you yes yes okay this is just yeah i just had the pdf open great so this is the diagram of how things will work um but this isn't important right now so uh we have the watchful eye which is uh it is an automated stop-loss bought for um that uses obviously ave flash loans as you can see up here um so when you pop onto the website um this is what you're you know presented with a money bag with an eye on it so uh this is the dashboard um and right now there are only two actions you can make um we don't have the actual uh the the stop-loss bot implemented yet but we have um a a a a debt repayment and collateral swap using obvious flash loans so the first thing you can do um i mean in fact the fir when you come onto the website this is what would happen in the first place anyway uh you'd begin the watchful eyes ritual um which is just obviously putting the information about your loan and the the price limits that you that you want to like act upon um so i already have these filled out but uh let's say that we have 100 die in debt and the collateral is uh we have 10 link is collateral that's being locked up right now um and the price limit for die it's usually around one so let's just put it at one and let's say that link is at 23. if it link goes but below 23 then we want to uh get take out a flash loan repay the the die debt get the link swap that for die and repay the flash loan and then transfer the rest to back to the user so yes for the eyes blessing there we go we're going to have quite a few transactions um because we've had to uh in this version we've had to mock the swaps and the debt um hopefully before the end of the actual hackathon we'll have the uh the debt repayment um implemented using ave um so first off we have to set up all of this data to be remembered but to be saved into the contract so we can act upon it later second we have to second we have to approve the transfer the the the watchful eye contract to transfer all of our link which is our collateral and uh i might have clicked the the button a few times whoops third uh this is actually part of the dem like part of the demo version um we have some fake contracts that are set up that will uh kind of act like uh the the um the the swap and the debt repayment should be this should say die not exactly sure why uh demo gods are not with me right now like i said i clicked on a few times i think that should have been fine regardless okay this is the one that i was expecting so 000 die and this is transferred to another contract which will swap the link for the die and this these the last two would not be there in the uh in the full version so confirm that that should pop up once that transaction succeeds there we go so when we have the actual bot it will do it will it will check the position and we're planning on using chain link oracles uh to to implement like the uh we're going to use a cron initiator which allows us to to call a smart contract function on a certain um on a certain interval so we would check if um the oracle would check if the price limits have have crossed over what the actual prices are at the current moment every certain interval and if those prices are have been reached or or surpassed uh then it would make a flash loan and liquidate the position so we're calling that the eye's blessing so i'm going to do that manually and metamask should pop up in a second there we go so uh gatsby is kind of expensive by the way you can or you can't we can't the gas fee is .016 eve so i went ahead and confirmed that and uh instead of waiting for it to complete and then show up on ether scan i actually have one that i ran right before this and we can all see this window right yep all right cool so um as you can see it goes from uh the ave uh lending pool to my contract the the watchful eye and the watchful eye sends that to uh repay to repay debt and since 100 die the the debt amount gets back 10 link and uh there's some extra things that happen to make sure that the collateral gets to the watchful eye contract the watchful eye sends that the the link to a swap and gets 200 die in return and uh the um the original flash loan gets repaid plus the fee and then the difference gets sent back to the user and uh that's how the watchful eye works at the moment [Music] thank you awesome looking really good i appreciate the use of scaffold eth imagining that probably saved you a ton of time yeah yeah it was pretty helpful oh yeah anybody just jump in with their comments or suggestions more than comment and suggestion have you thought about uh it's pretty cool uh very useful i can tell have you thought about integrations and and you know not really as a standalone but product but maybe something that could be you know applicable to an existing protocol or or something something like that have you thought about integration and and where you could go down the road you mean um do you mean for uh the debt repayment or the the swaps yeah actually um before the end of the the the hackathon we're hoping to um well it's kind of the lowest hanging fruit but to allow debt like debt repayment um or liquidation on um on ave uh because uh we're using a test net and those those those token addresses are obviously they're the same as uh on on like with borrowing as they are with flash loans um on ave for um swaps we actually intended initially to to use one inch because there was a bounty for that but that ran into some issues which is why you know we made the the mvp be kind of a mocked uh debt repayment and mocked uh token swap um but the you know the end vision for it would be to you pick what you know uh what protocol you want to do that a you want to repay the debt for liquidate on b uh what protocol you want to uh or what decks you want to um swap the colo the collateral to uh the flash loan asset with um and obviously have more selection on can you like on what your collateral asset is and what your debt asset is um but you know for for the hackathon this is what this is what we hacked together thus far good stuff thank you good stuff yeah thank you i think it's a it's a it's a great start um sims what mark mentioned previously uh uh using the permit function uh for this would probably help and so what the permit function allows is you don't need to do the approve and essentially they sign an approved transaction and then they they hand it to you somewhere and then you can run that transaction [Music] before you you know do before you do the transfer transaction um so i can save on some gas costs uh and then i'm not sure if it's good for for now or for later um but what you could also do is similar to d5 save and instead that they have like a smart wallet or proxy contract um so the trouble here is that you have to do all those approves and you have to make sure that you know all the proofs are proper and all that sort of stuff yeah which can get a bit unmanageable or difficult to manage um but if you use a proxy contract like ds proxy and if if that proxy owns the position uh it becomes quite a bit easier to manage these sort of things yeah we initially were were we considered having uh a we didn't call it a proxy contract but a proxy contract that would uh take out that like take out the the the debt um yeah initially uh yeah okay yeah sure yes i think maybe not for the mvp but i think that's something to definitely consider that could improve the ux quite dramatically yeah but yeah good good one thank you yeah uh on my side uh i have to say i'm a big fan of the watchful eye and illuminati stuff i really love the design it's super fun uh what would be my main advice is to the less you ask to the user the better so for example in the the dashboard you ask for the position but all this kind of stuff like the price the it changes all the time and uh the better us is that uh the user uh initiates something and then forget about it because it just work in the background for him and uh all the information that you ask here are either available in the lending pull contract uh you have a view function get user data that you can call anytime and you can maybe run a script in the background that asks every x minute or whatever if the situation change and uh if uh some conditions are met to to enable some action and also for for the price you have all the schengen price feed contract they are super easy to read as well and free to read as well so i would recommend if you have time obviously that would be a major improvement if you just connect with your wallet and then everything is done on the background and you collect all the information without asking the user okay yeah we'll look into that um go ahead and give it give your last thought we initially we initially considered um we actually initially had a little bit of a like this is a dashboard we had a little view into the uh the the user data for the for the current user um but we ended up scrapping that because it kind of looked uh we just couldn't make it look uh like it fit initially but we'll take a look at that again and see what else we can scrape from that cool super cool thank you thanks for presenting yep thanks trent all right uh next up is audits are dead jack you want to go ahead and start hey how's it going uh just just generally really quick before you start um we do have maybe like we have 13 projects so if you can just we're going to try and condense a little bit more um not not saying to like speedrun your stuff but uh just keep in mind that there are a bunch of projects they want to present so uh go ahead cool we'll try to get through it quickly uh i think everett should be here as well my uh teammate on this i'm gonna share my screen real quick and uh let me know if you don't see what i'm seeing um okay so our project is called audits are dead we're creating a new insurance protocol where basically we have a two-sided insurance marketplace projects on one side that pay a tiny percent of their total value locked to get insurance in case of a hack and on the other side we have um stakers that get one of the highest yields in defy to kind of put up their capital in case one of these hacks happen and i think maybe it's easiest to show you um explain it from this side as well so we have covered protocols these are basically projects that we are covering so we're covering you know maker for seven million dollars of their tbl covering paid out for three million dollars of their tbl total insurance um you know outstanding claims is 15 million potential outstanding claims is 15 million and then pool strategies on the other side so all that staker money we put into different strategies so of v2 we put six million into that and we get a yield from that on top of the fees that these protocols are paying us and then to run you through quickly how it works basically we've got the staking pools you can see there's 10 million dollars in it you're earning 7.46 right now three day lock up um let's do a quick example here where we put in we'll call it a million die this and you should be able to see you have a million dollars in there now you start earning on it immediately and full size grows and we've got more locked value that is now backing these uh protocols so that's the quick gist of it um if ever wants to add anything go ahead otherwise we'd love to hear you guys thoughts yep i i love this uh i love this project i mean from from last week the discussion um we had like it's great to see it in action uh yeah i think it's fantastic the only feedback i have is that the allocation should be 100 are they [Music] [Laughter] uh yeah marco nicola marco okay yeah look it it's pretty it's pretty intuitive uh i mean i heard the conversation last time basically if i if i'm not uh mistaking the only the protocol themselves would be able to to to participate right so it's a it's a choice of a protocol right exactly so a lot of the insurance protocols right now seller the consumer we sell just to the protocol and we go for you know big amounts of tbl i guess and we have an internal audit team that like prices what we think that protocol should pay okay okay and the and and since it you know it's pretty quite technical people right it's it's not like defy users it's it's really hardcore uh devs that that would choose to go for for this solution um i i would disagree but okay okay no oh okay but in in terms of um the strategies that you can uh deploy who is gonna who is gonna decide them and is it your is your input or that that also a sort of like like a choice that every single uh protocol can can decide where to put them uh their stick at work yeah so the protocols aren't really staking it's the uh like average defy user that we want to stake and they don't have to know anything about insurance or smart contract security we kind of we kind of do the the leg work for them on pricing the protocol insurance um and then they just see a yield and you know they just kind of put the money in and get the yield and they don't need to worry about um the smart contract security and then to answer your question on the pool strategies maybe everett wants to talk a little bit about this but it's kind of based on i believe how iron does it where we kind of allocates to where the highest yield is at that time um so it's sort of an automated strategy that just tries to put people in the highest yield final a final user can actually uh stake their token or i i i didn't get that i thought that just the just the protocol themselves were were sort of like ensuring ensuring the the functioning not not that not the users see what i mean yeah yeah so uh sorry uh yeah so the protocols are basically doing a deal with us and saying hey we want you know 100 million dollars of total value locked insured so we say okay we've got you for that hundred million and then on the other side it's average users coming in and staking money because they see a high yield and that is you know that's the pool of money is from users and then the protocols aren't actually putting any money in they're just getting covered for for their uh hack risks i see ics it's it's like uh an extra service that they offer to to their users let's say we are affiliated with this insurance basically exactly we think you know instead of getting a bunch of audits and paying money for that they're just going to say hey look all of your dollars are covered by this insurance you don't need to worry about hacks anymore and we think a lot more people want to go to those protocols that have insurance uh versus other ones okay and does the party call give anything in return for this the protocol pays a small percent of their total value locked so they pay a small fee basically to get covered and because it's uh like an under leverage you can see there's 15 million covered versus 11 million locked um protocols are basically going to be paying an even smaller amount than they would if it was like one-to-one leverage or like one-to-one collateralization and that adds to the yields of the stakers exactly contribution exactly all right uh if there are any final comments uh we're gonna move on to the next project thanks for presenting jack cool thanks so much guys appreciate it derek uh your project is free to go whenever you're ready hey what's up eater family how are you guys everything okay yep okay awesome so uh i've been hacking with the governance protocol uh first things first i developed an erst 721 that i can actually just punch like the number 1500 or you know maybe unit number 100 000 or a million thousand because why am i doing this is because i believe that people here in brazil suffer a lot because of document laws and a lot of hacking happens here in brazil like the second country that's most hacked in the world so a lot of people lose their documents and lose their money so i was thinking about actually just giving to the people a blockchain id where we could divide by districts so for example if you live in the north northern part of brazil like like actually my city you you're distributed from i don't know 500k all the way to 10kk like this little place where it's responsible for those ids and then southern part of the city is the same thing from one uk all the way to 0.5 so let's get to say it's very simple so like there would be different districts around the city where people would be giving out the rc 720 ones they would have the mentor role okay and all the main thing would be done like from i don't know from 7 00 a.m to 6 p.m after that uh the packers the the mr rose would go into github or actually any other platform that does json numbering and they would just commit the numbering so like if i don't know if i registered 100 ids i would just do i would commit that to let me show you where is it here hey derek real quick can you just give us uh like a one or two sentence summary of what the project is sure yeah it's a it's a it's an id 721 that we can use for voting uh and i'm i'm hacking with normal erc721 zeppelin and uh for now i haven't been able to completely hack with the governance 2.0 but acting with her where i'm so i'm actually using these drc 721 to make votes i i changed the api this this is actually a code that i hacked from eve scaffold and i just changed it up so that it can actually be accepting uh erc 721 instead of your d20 so this is like an id that people can hold they can use it on their cell phones because metamask already captures your your rc721 so like let me show you guys i actually showed this last week but i'm going to show it again so i've been testing this with mumbai and we're good and i'm gonna start hacking this thing with mum as well basically uh you validate all the votes on that erc 721 it just runs validation it goes into a google form script and it gives me the winner so like if people can have this id around the around my city and later on we can get votes and do different democracy aspects of it you know like we can actually bring a global not actually not even global but city-like and then maybe think about a big a better place where people can just be you know them themselves choosing what they want so in this case uh i was winning i made a million votes with the same uh the same zero five zero five zero five so it's trying to do multiple votes but it only has one token well as the cow this guy he has his token and his daughter's token and this other guy he also has two tokens so actually the cow's winning by 0.000 uh so i have to change this as well so that we can script script it so i think that's that uh so there's this code that i'm gonna i'm gonna change it up here in the the ui for sorry so like it's very simple each place would have their own district and it would be giving out not giving now but selling now the easier c721s and the participants can come into another dap and use their erc 721 so like each week i think we can making like democratic changes in the city because we can express uh different choices before actually putting up what or what we're going to be voting for i actually like the idea of having a forum so structure form so people could be like choosing what they want you know like what what the changes should be happening on the next month and things like that and just up here and we would have a validation of what's going to happen you know what should happen and i really think the system is incredible for so like uh not just having it as a global id but like maybe an industry with a thousand workers like meant their ids and and the business can actually be creating and you know like creating ideas like what are we going to eat friday like lasagna or parmigiana or spaghetti meatballs and you know just create a mech where their votes are secret uh and it's all captured in a google form so yeah using zapier uh real quick sure what uh who who is eligible to create votes only people have your e721 so you have to have this specific your c721 so it's hardwired to the hardwired to the api and hardwired to like the number of the contracts so this is all working up on girly it's all girly okay okay like and then you and then you said votes are secret yeah how does that happen well you come in you vote right so like let's say i just sign up uh i'm signing up for it let me see the account i'm using here give me one second no i'm just curious how votes would actually be secret if it's all stored on chain so well it's going to be it's going to be so like right now i just voted on the cow again so i can actually use this hash and follow it up and i can actually find the user but since we're talking about decentralized we don't know who's in the back of the car you know the wallet it's pseudonymous so i can still link it to an address right yeah you could you you could probably go all the way and follow it up to the address this forum the only person that can actually be seen is the centralized uh in this case like example of a business the boss and probably the tech engineer where they're like actually applying this in the system to you know join the business and create a dynamic with the users as well as for the democratic votes or for city things it would also be the centralized system that could actually validate these votes and that's that's that's where where it comes actually the user and the the business where you're like okay business uh i i i believe in you so you're not gonna be going all the way hashing hashing to see who i am and even if i did that it'll probably be impossible to actually discover who that person is although she does have a terra id in this case the terror id uh does have like certain annotations so come on internet charge up so it does have like you know like it has all the specifics of that person voting so the person uh the person wouldn't see like this votes she wouldn't be able to see the goal because uh the system would see it but like if i went all the way all the way all the way all the way all the way yeah i could certainly find out that this guy voted for the cow you know okay gotcha yeah that's that's good uh good context um david or nicola mark do you guys want to jump in with any quick feedback here um about the presentation or the app itself uh hello uh do you know about existing voting systems such as hang on hang on portland um we're gonna go with uh the ave team first because they set aside some time to be here oh we're i just want to get the feedback from david and nicola first i'm i'm i'm answering answering to derek derek do you know about existing voting systems uh aragon and dao stack for example [Music] no i don't know about them yeah you can continue master victor victor i had to meet you we're gonna stick with with the structure of this event um sorry i had to meet you but david or nicola we're gonna we're gonna head back to you guys victor if you want to connect with derek you're more than welcome to outside of the call but um david go ahead sure uh yeah uh thanks for the presentations uh derek it's interesting uh but to be honest it was a bit confusing for me um so i think the feedback for the pitch would be you know try and make a you know one to two sentence uh explanation of what you're building and then build the narrative around there because it seemed to be going into all these different directions and then i see emojis of cows and cats and then saying about voting something about secret voting and some other things like that uh and then i see some like windows i see you have league of legends open you know the screen's a bit distracting as well so there's a lot of stuff happening um so so maybe that would be my feedback um on the pitch side yeah just try and um yeah uh yeah maybe have a clear narrative yeah i'll uh i'll follow it with david similar similar feedback basically you know it was a little bit hard to follow my bad maybe i didn't have a lot of context but uh you know exactly like david said start with the core because it seems to me that is you know a tool or a protocol that could be applicable for many different use cases so start with the very basics and then you know broaden the discussion on you could do a b c d e and the use cases are a b c d but at least use the the recipient understands the core and then the brainstorming can start thanks a lot mr nicholas thanks david of course uh mark unless you have anything uh i was just gonna say yeah going i know this was like a demo focused session but it was a little hard to even though i've already seen the the your presentation last week i can understand somebody coming in fresh like nicola that might be a little hard to understand what the project is about so um just be able to you know construct a framework of how you're thinking about this before jumping into the app or just explain it a little bit better maybe we can work on that thanks a lot guys i'm sorry about the league of legends that's not actually open it's just my framework you know no worries uh mark you're gonna add anything or if not no i think okay it was pretty sum up by uh david nicole okay great thanks derek thank you guys bye-bye victor you follow me yes would you like to present your project uh thank you i represent only changes compared to the previous presentation previous demo session or uh from the beginning beginning um i think if you want to just give a quick intro to what you've done previously and then any changes but just remember that there are other people so we have to keep these sessions a little shorter than i'd like i wish we could spend you know 20 minutes on each person but um just try to keep it you know as brief as possible uh thank you the changes in the app are not impressive this is the app for anyone to receive a salary for common goods uh anyone can register for a salary i'm registering myself now i have a salary if i'm talking every second i can withdraw at any moment sorry i'm withdrawing it appears on my account etc anyone can donate in the gh rc1155 here c20 in refugee in university 721 uh et cetera i won't show it it's not interesting main changes in there their new test net uh a and connection to different uh providers and metamask uh it has also a bitcoin version that i submitted to bitcoin for testing it's the same up but on bitcoin with their they'd wait to store the condition id conditioning is here one i'm the first user in this test uh so uh my main thing i did sorry it's something wrong ah i have a drone network uh yes i have a new network i'm switching the network it's linked by it does not work sorry it's not my bug again does not work it's not my buck it's a buck now it works so i created uh also related to this project request your wallet or funds we choose a date and the her the any serial address click request it does not work yet or cancel request it will be a button to request to my uh to this project to this of huge salaries uh here is request all funds on acknowledge safe smart wallet it does not work yet i am now working to make it work directly in gnosis now to explain uh how it works in internally it's the most interesting thing or uh i have said already enough for this demo okay great yeah so it's good to see you you have made project progress since last week but for the other people who weren't here last week so i think i can summarize what victor is working on it's a way to distribute funds or time lock funds for streaming into the future so people can lock up funds or request them and then you can benefit from the future and i believe you're intending to support scientists uh as a first use case right if scientists free software developers it may work also for journalists etc carbon carbon encounters my received salaries or carbon accounting companies etc in fact any kinds of common goods that can be accounted well enough and this uh system all those who pay money to search engines to create oracles who will finally decide who gets uh finding like this i explained very shortly it has many uh details like that it creates a new token at every transfer away from their salary recipient account uh account lost accounts can be restored etc does every new um bequest get a new contract instantiation or are these all routed through the same contract it's all on the same contract uh uh it's the same contract has uh any any number of condition ideas for example i'm a scientist with a condition id uh this condition id and any number of oracles oracles uh interference oracle maybe the oracle that distributes money between other oracles by uh global voting there may be can be many related and unrelated oracles and oracle can uh be in a sense sub oracle of another oracle so the global dow will distribute funds between oracle's tutorials can be search engines etc okay um condition id does that mean is that just the user id uh conditional user id is a seller recipient did this condition id is a number of a project uh it's enough for maybe it may be enough to have one condition a dpr user uh but uh najin prevents the users to create mars more than one okay so maybe maybe i would i would call it not condition id but a project id or something something that's a little more obvious for its condition id technically conditioning is there is a concept of condition in prediction markets that are used in turn internally so maybe the right name is indeed condition id but project id would be a good name too yeah just condition doesn't really tell me what it's actually referring to i i've talked too much so i'm gonna let nicola or some of the ave guys jump in if they have any feedback maybe i can start i'll be very quick look i think that the core idea could have several applications we've seen actually several projects doing uh you know some proper proper products around this um one problem that they occurred at some point it was um and i can give the feedback was basically the the ghost cost the gas cost was too high uh to make those you know trench payments in a sense right but the the low hanging fruit would be uh sort of like subscription um subscription payments or i mean you you started with salary and donation which makes a lot of sense but also think about uh a business that wants to you know receive uh that sort of money on a length of time so that could be also one one extension of the of the project oh first there is no such trouble or we withdraw we can withdraw for example once a month it's not required to withdraw often tokens are received every second but it does not use any gas as they are just counted without gas uh and using for business maybe for science or for climate it makes sense to look for 50 or 100 years for business it may make sense to look for two years for five years so we can't just create a different oracle and use it for a more usual business uh it's not that the main intended use but it's an important uh additional use to use it for financing startups got it thank you uh thank you very much for what you built uh so far and can say can't wait to to see what we will what uh you will be in the the remaining time uh the idea is very close to sablier which is already in the ecosystem so i invite you to check what they do maybe to take some inspiration or things like that i think that's a killer use case for when we get that you can build only once but that would be like so incredible on youtube when we solve uh the the transaction fee and transact gas cost uh for this kind of interaction uh my advice uh in terms of feature it would be uh for use case super useful for for example the the daisio model that was explained a couple of years ago by a vitalik buterin so you can have like a daiso so decentralized autonomy so that's the mix uh like veteran buterin wrote in 2018 a cool research paper on that daiko so to be honest don't know what yeah i don't know just just wrote that uh in the chat so you you can google that and you will find the the vitality tutoring article about it i put it in the chat it's dicey oh d-a-i-c-o um yeah so basically the ico uh a way to uh raise and then distribute money uh from decentralized entity and he described the tap method that is very close to what you are building where you can uh allocate for x amount of time y amount of funds uh with the rate that you decide on this uh that would be like a cool use case donation as well uh subscription as well all these kind of things one cool feature would be to have trench of payment because usually uh when there's a project that starts let's say you agree to have 2000 die for a project maybe uh the people that are working on this project maybe they need 500 i know to cover their cost and start the work and then they will be more than happy to have 1500 uh die on the scale the scale of three months for example or whatever amount of time so having associated to milestone uh the ability to do batch payments in one go or have some some kind of payment curve that it's just not linear that will uh have uh implication for the project that will be like super useful to be honest i don't understand you would you uh send to my email my english isn't very good i just didn't understand you i understand some words but not all it's okay we we can talk here uh in a written form on discord we are more than happy to support you directly in the global discord all right i guess thanks mark yeah um victor if you don't connect to them i can i can relay some of that uh information as well i think the the big part of what mark was saying was it's definitely a really compelling use case um you know time locked payments or streaming payments um so there's definitely demand for these kinds of projects um uh david did you have any comments if not we can we can wrap up just one one bit of feedback uh victor i think one area you could approve uh for the the interface is that there's a lot of information there that's not necessarily needed so you know trent's comment about the id like it it might be technically accurate to call it that but then from a user perspective they don't need to know about you know what it's normally called in prediction markets just call it a project id i also noticed the time stamps you had you know you had including the like the time stamps are really huge including seconds and a time zone but so you don't really need that information so i think if you clean up the ui a bit it could make it uh just a lot more effective and easier for someone to look at initially and i think that would be helpful i don't think it's a trouble because uh it's just to look uh it just to register once and then work it's in they withdraw it it does not influence usability uh the more yeah yeah just i mean just it's just it's just it's just feedback victor so yeah they take it or leave it um and yeah it's just just feedback and that's yeah i was actually i was actually going to echo david's comment um there's a lot of information like some of it's needed at the beginning but maybe not all of it right away so take this as a suggestion from both of us maybe either simplify some of it or work on the balance of what information you present right away and then what you present afterwards i think that's all i have though okay thanks for presenting victor next up is malice warned you want to go ahead and present hello warren are you lisa warren okay there you go i see a warrant popping up you want to go ahead and share yeah sure um let me go to share okay so let me just mention um um two things first so um so this is um a project that i've been researching um for like the last um six months right but i think um i did already discuss with um trent about that i already started researching on this project and um this is my last semester in university studying computer science so basically the whole idea of this project what i was trying to figure out is um um is there a way because recently um is there a way for um us peer-to-peer cashback within within the ecosystem because um recently i've been noticing like a lot of companies i've been offering like cards with like cashbacks and i think the danger one of the dangers that most people don't realize is that um you have to really like trust these entities with your funds right to receive these um cashbacks um and recently um i don't know if you guys remember um we saw recently we are some of these companies want you to stay and then the price of what they asked you to stake it crashes severely and then this is something i was looking into um if if there's a way we could have like a peer-to-peer um cashback system so the so basically the whole concept of this idea is that um i see a way in here so basically basically all of these are um all of these are smart contracts right and they can be deployed by um they can be deployed by by anybody right and basically think of each one of these um contracts as a store right each one of these are a store right when so basically the whole um so basically the way this would work right and i kind of i kind of built off this idea that um maker dial has where um you actually stake in the beginning stages where they actually state either either as collateral and dyes produce i started saying on myself um if there is such a way where ether could be staked right and as collateral for something that would be produced as um essentially cashback so so for example right so right now i have a rate of like a seven percent cashback right so let's say um for example i'm running my store right and i have my assets right here right i have ether right and i could stake right so if i stake let's say seventy dollars worth of ether right and somebody comes um comes to my store right they so basically um up to a thousand dollars could be spent right when this money is spent right after the merchant or whosoever um stakes the 70 dollars right it would be locked up as um as as collateral right it would be like um locked up as collateral and basically it could only be released back if a customer comes back with that token right so that token is that would be produced would basically um i would call it fruit right but when when the the ether is locked up as collateral the thing is the thing that you have to remember is that it doesn't that the fruit it doesn't it can't only be used at like one specific um location so it could be used at a variety of different um locations you could search and see where it is so for example anybody could set up a store right and one of the main things i was thinking about to distinguish stores differently um and i um people haven't been on paying much attention on using it a lot is probably e s names um i think it's one of the best ways to probably distinguish like so for example let's say let's say um i have like um i have a ice cream ice cream stand at xyz location right and i bought the e s name on ice cream dot eat right i could create sub domains of the of of that that dns name to define um different probably different locations of where i would actually have on these locations right so at the initial stages when you deploy one of these so right now i have a lot deployed with this account um i could probably switch to a different way can i jump in really quick sure yeah so i'm just going to summarize what i've heard so far and you you tell me if this is correct so yes what you have is a a way for stores or establishments or somebody who's selling a good can create an account and then users or customers can stake um eath let's say to that account and then in return you'll get something akin to a loyalty point which you're calling fruit and then that can be spent at other locations so yes but um the thing is it's not the customer it's not the customer that would state right it was that it would actually be the merchant and the thing is there is no sign up required right all you need is just a metamastic extension or any browser wallet right and you could just deploy one of these um contracts right each one is designed in such a way where right and remember it could be anybody it doesn't um the the best thing about it is that it doesn't even have to be a merchant right it could also be a customer that just want anybody could deploy one of these right you deploy it you lock up an amount of ether right the amount of ether you locked up is that that's the amount of um collateral you could basically produce so this could be used in a in a variety of different ways because instead of like for example like if you think of the situation that's going on right now where a lot of businesses um where a lot of stores are closing out of business if something like this was in place right where for example you were previously running one of these on stores right and let's say you had a lot of collateral right you could do things like um you could do things like buy and sell collateral with different stores right and then customers could like find are if a customer can't really find locations to where they could actually go on so um break where they could actually use these tokens they could also bomb they could also buy um bicollateral right and use the tokens they have to release back at a cheaper rate right if that's making any sense another thing that i've been researching um so i've read like like three different research papers that um vitalik wrote so most a lot of these d5 projects are kind of like scared of chardon um would um come with um with how um contracts would be called because with richard you would have to do things such as yanking with this right the do in terms of the research that i did right this would be able to work across all shards right so each so across all charts you would have one set of stores right and basically what we what would be what would be moving across the shards is actually the token that is produced when somebody actually buys something right okay gotcha um can you go back to just the main page so then i'll open it up to the rest of the uh so so from here right so basically hang on hang on hang on what i have right here is like a verified hang on one sec so when when you jump into this page is there anywhere where i can see like the the summary of what the project is or like a quick intro for a new user coming in does that exist anywhere so so no that would be like the the welcome page right oh yeah yeah there's not a welcome page right now at the moment right but i imagine it as something like saying like with like like seven percent cashback no cars required right that would be like something on the main page right what i have right here right each one of these cells are each one of these cells or stores they're smart contracts right but there are there are a lot of things i had to take in consideration when designing something like this because each contract right the first design that i have the the contract size was too large i reduced it probably by 10 times because at the current stages right we are not in a charted network as as yet right but this could actually work in the current ecosystem we have right now right i reduced it to somewhere below um 300 um about about 2800 kilobytes for each um contract right another thing that i take into consideration for each contract is that they're recyclable so oh if you go right here you could change the owner right you're recyclable so you're not wasting memory and there would be incentives for you to actually recycle recycle these so and that could actually be used in terms of on privacy issues so for example this this contract with this address it could be used for example today by somebody in argentina and if they want to change it to somebody in um [Music] in um london the next year um so that's another thing that i took into consideration is that the memory is not wasted right you're actually recyclable at the same time um when you hover over each each arm so when you over eat over each arm one of these um cells right you see i put like this defining thing at the bottom that shows the available funds the collateral the stake and the collateral relief that's inside of each store the collateral relief is basically you're saying that you want to buy collateral from a different store right and you set a rate that you want to buy that collateral at so if i have some collateral and i want to sell it i would be selling it at a loss but and then there are there are a variety of different reasons why why i might want to do that for example i'm not getting enough customers to come back with those tokens to release that that collateral um to to so i could get back either right and finally one last thing i took into consideration is this thing called extensions so an extension is basically a contract that could be applied to each store individually and this could basically anybody could write any type of um extension to interact with different d5 um protocols so this is like um so right now i'm still so so i had to re-engineered the the ens sub graph and along with the sub graph that i created with this recently it's currently deployed on on the graph protocol um it's working fine so far the contracts are currently working fine um i'm still working on the client but so far everything seems to be fine but the way i he warren um i'm just going to jump in really quick uh because we've gone for i think about 10 minutes now um one thing that just for me i don't know about the others but for me personally i think you could do some work on improving how you explain the concept um when you make your video next week uh obviously you'll you're only going to have four minutes to explain and demo your concept so sure there will be a little intro you know where you say very very concisely this is what this project does um it see i can definitely see that you've put like you said you put six months of research into this yeah which is great and you have a lot of concepts which you're trying to put into here but for me personally i think it could be clearer or you could maybe boil it down into the key things that you're trying to do like what's the main idea that you want to get across that there are these stores that can you can register and then somehow get collateral out of it's unclear to me what they actually do um like is it deposited into ave or some other yield producing facility um these are things i'm it's unclear to me now i have like a rough idea but it's not entirely clear what these things actually do um and i'm gonna just open it up to questions because we've spent quite a bit of time um not not to cut you off but we we do have to get to the other a few other wraps so david do you wanna give any feedback about like the explanation or how he um presented the project and i think uh nicola yeah yeah muted so you can go first oh sure look look i i i just resonate completely with trent i'm i understand warren there's a lot to unpack there's been a lot of thinking behind but especially because next week is going to be four minutes you need to find a way to start from the basic and you know 30 seconds maximum one minute you you need to convey the message and you know i think that's going to be very helpful for any traction any good market strategy you want to have any conversation you know and have the people that are actually going to use it right so start with the basic and then you know beat from that and and can have a conversation but uh that's that's all for now sure yeah just i guess adding on top of that i think i think warren you're obviously like a really intelligent guy and i think that the ui is like quite polished so it looks really nice i think the thing with like us developers and engineers is that sometimes we get too excited with the underlying technology and all the little bits and pieces and efficiencies that we did and all the little hacks that we did to get to that point but but in the end especially for like hackathons like this uh people at least the consumer doesn't really care about that what they care about is like what's the problem and how you're solving that so i think if you focus the demo on those things i think it would make it a lot clearer and then later on in in somewhere else you can talk about other technical details but really it's just like how do you solve that problem i think that would be it okay got it i have just one nice thing to add is that i think that the idea of recycling uh contract and maybe uh resell it for secondhand market is just genius because of the gas price for example uh cdp's that are now called volton mecca dao they are pretty expensive to create but not that expensive to deposit to interaction with it so if they were like keep pushing on that id because i think there's a market for that yes thank you yeah so to summarize i think we are we're all on the same page of like there's a ton of stuff that you've built into this but we need to see a little bit of a clearer more concise explanation for example the core the core features are so based so basically just the core general concept so if next week i just showed a concept where i staked and then i send eater and then what i staked is locked up as collateral and then the tokens that i received after i sent ether as purchase right and then i send it back and the collateral is released back to the the merchant would that be a good concept to to demonstrate how the project actually works yeah yeah and and if you compare it with some sort of graphic that just shows like the flow of funds or how the contracts are structured you know not not like a uml diagram or something complicated just like a very straightforward diagram of the interaction between customers or users and the owners of the store that would be perfect um don't mention anything about sharding even if it is like a really impressive concept that's you know we don't have to worry about yanking contracts for a while so like a simple a simple white white paper on like outline showing some details um the general concept of it yeah and this is specifically for your video i would just because like like i said you have a lot going on so you want to make sure you distill it down to your core core ideas yeah not even a white paper like think of it like the abstract of the white paper thank you thank you thank you cool all right um thank you for for sharing that appreciate it thank you uh we're gonna move on to not real if they are ready uh hopefully they are we have about five minutes left um so again we'll try to get this last one in before david mark and uh okay i love this project there are def cats am i okay so hi everyone uh so uh my project is basically centered around ai generated art and um the idea so that you know ai generate art is this infinite space and it would be very cool to add a price discovery mechanism on top of that which would be this uh this trading marketplace so um you know i've been working on this for a while but i have also started on something new during the hackathon so um you know just you know full disclosure i didn't all build all of this during the hackathon but the landing page gives you a good idea of what's going on so there's a fixed supply that's minted every day with rolling auctions and then also you know just because we're minting and selling something out of nowhere i thought it was only fair to you know give some of that to charity um so that's all going to be part of it but um it wasn't so this is the uh auction interface which is what i was uh basically completing um you know or only partially done when the hackathon started and i and this hackathon gave me a lot of motivation to complete it so um so basically these are the rolling auctions and this current user they have won an auction here which they have to unwrap um by making a contract call and basically it's just a standard english auction that takes up and uh you know uh the auctions last for 24 hours um and uh you know once i joined this hackathon i had some new ideas about how i could integrate beefy so i would love to get some feedback on that so um one thing is that the the bids that are locked up in the auction um in our locked up in contract might as well be staked in ave so that's one interesting way to get a little bit of um of return on that would probably just go but it would just be ethereum so they'd be just like you know one percent per year or something um but then um also i had this other idea that the 50 of what you end up you pay for the uh the nft would actually be uh staked in ave so that you you actually get return for um one upon purchasing the nft which would incentivize holding and take some supply off the market um and uh yeah i mean those are basically my ideas of how to integrate ave it's using the graph protocol for for some data which was awesome another another thing that was inspired by this hackathon um and uh yeah um yeah that's basically that's basically where i'm at with it so i have this auction interface been basically done and uh next step is i'm integrating ave into it so nice uh it sounds like mark is a big fan of cats so i think you should take delete yeah uh i think uh the nfc market is like the the next big things especially uh when it's d5 board um so uh like i have no uh bad feedback to give basically so a good project keep working on it thank you if you have anything david or i can i can go ahead up to you uh i mean not much i mean i'm a bit of an nfc hater um but i think like integrating something like ave whether nft has some sort of value uh i think makes sense um so what he said about you know half of the purchase price goes to rv and that sort of underlies the value i think that's a good thing um but besides that yeah it's it's probably not my really area of expertise nfts at the moment good stuff uh look i i think it's it's the right time uh to to develop something like that uh and and market timing is actually you know something can really help you um so it's it's it's a platform but there is a there is a component of creation and a component of of trading a marketplace correct right it's both of them it's uh it's mainly curation actually um at this time so yeah the platform right now is creating all the the ai generated art up front i would love to turn it into like a creator's platform down the line it's just out of scope for the first version okay okay yeah maybe of course if if it's going to be a final product and and something where you know a final user lends to as a page maybe have a little bit more clarity of what could be done um and you know a little bit more friendly in terms of like i would i would be a little bit lost if i just see these right so uh maybe that that's the only feedback on the guide a little bit the user into the experience but good work for the rest thank you um i wanted to show you guys some other ai generate art real quick just to just to show you like some of the possibilities so this is a koi model that i'm working on which is it's just kind of interesting um and then this is watercolor flowers um it's just it's just cool stuff that's why i love working on this project but yeah okay thank you how sorry so question how's the um like where do you train who trains the models who creates the generator yeah that's all uh the platform or or me at this time so i'm training the models um and uh yeah and just like pre-minting basically all these nfts yeah i mean maybe not for the first version but for later versions it'll be interesting if you had some sort of um like decentralize that the training of the models or creating the the artwork and then that sort of like a proof of work that is actual like someone's dedicated compute resources to create this ai art that might help underlie some value yeah and probably that's not in the scope of the i don't know given the the available time but most nft projects like avigocci comet c variable they all move uh to the scalability uh sidechain of matic right now so maybe uh and the main reason for that is to ease up on the cost of minting and transferring nfts so maybe that that's some pathway you want to explore definitely um so the i having not used matic is the friction of moving funds between matic is that a blocker for users do you do you have any uh they have bridges so i'm not an expert on matic i have to confess but they have bridges uh i'm not aware for years uh like nfts but they have like four regular erc20 development yeah cool yeah it's not it's not too hard to move move assets between uh l2s but i think also you asked about uh having more like d5 integrations um maybe one obvious one is like obviously follow the erc i think 721 standard um so then eventually you know someone buys this they can also sell on openc secondary markets as well i think there's probably be like some collateral markets in the future as well so yeah it is it is the rc721 so that yeah that should be impossible yeah very cool thank you very much appreciate it everyone uh right thanks for presenting not real ai um we are actually at 11 30 eastern or past it so um i want to thank mark david and nicola for you know jumping on and giving feedback to teams i think they probably have some other things going on or they're heading to their evening europe so i'm going to let them go unless they want they're more than welcome to stay on of course but i just want to say thanks for giving feedback to the team so far i'm sorry thank you very much i'm sorry i'm really sorry can you give me just for five minutes i'm really sorry because we worked all the week but nobody will listen to us please give me another one i can stand for five minutes okay because last week also nobody listened so please yeah absolutely i'll i'll stay on no problem meet you don't worry well i mean there there are there are did you uh there are like eight other teams that probably would also love it back from david and nicolas so i'm sure if it's quite fair for you just to jump in oh yeah you're jumping the line um okay trent let's go i will wait i i know it's this isn't a personal thing i'm just saying like there are seven other teams ahead of you that would probably love to get feedback from david and nicola but um i can't obligate them to stay for another hour um please remember we are accessible basically all the time we don't answer right away because we are based in europe and if that's not your time zone maybe you would have to wait a little bit for an answer but you can always contact us on discord and we would be more than happy to support yeah um maybe this week trent as well maybe think about like just flipping the order of this that's the card to all the people that are at the bottom now maybe they can go first or something like that next week yeah that's a good idea um bogdan did you did you reach out on discord to any of any of the teams or were you not able to get in contact with them what do you mean yes of course we are on discord but i thought that today's uh today's meeting is to show what we did last week and i can show it now right yes but but yeah there's a there's a list of projects um who have signed up so i mean i i don't know if i can just like jump ahead of all those people so we we had to do it in discord i mean no no the sign up the sign up like there were people who sat through this whole session um and added their names on the google doc so i um i think we're just going to keep going on that list i'm going to stay around i'm just switching off and waiting for you to call me okay okay um david mark nicola are you gonna start yeah i can stick around at least after 25 minutes okay perfect um i'll stay for one more and then i'm gonna head off okay great um then we'll keep going on the list and the next one up is fuji uh boyan if you wanna start presenting yeah hi guys uh thanks thanks for having us so just a quick overview of our project it's called fuji and it tries it optimizes borrowing rates for uh pool of loans by by constantly refinancing for the for the best rates on the market what i mean uh there are different borrowing rates proposed by different providers of divide dx and our our protocol our protocol so it's indeed in that case um it's a a market where we can borrow die for by supplying heat uh so people are supplying the collateral borrowing die and receiving uh and receiving for uh for that debt tokens uh they're much like the avid debt tokens they're just a fork of of of it and uh how we are optimizing for the best rates like uh the there is a controller uh which uh checks uh constantly where the best rates on the market and if there there is a better opportunity if there is a better opportunity on the market it by a flash loan it switches the collateral and the borrow from uh from one provider to the other like that uh people who borrowed who borrowed here they uh so they they gain from uh they pay less interest uh uh they pay less interest for their inter for their loans so this is the the core idea and um we come up with a with the prototype with the ui prototype so here is the home screen it's just a figma prototype it's not a browser front-end app yet so here is the the home page we connect a wallet and now by now we can just borrow die but we can imagine in the future that we can borrow more uh currencies and supply more other collateral than eat so we borrow we get go to borrow some day we want to borrow uh hundred die this is here we can see which uh which is the provider that is that we are currently using uh in real time like which one is supplying the best uh the best rates we get a quote and uh here we see uh for example some estimation of the the debt we we are going to pay in uh one month three month one year and the the interest uh that is gonna be saved uh for the for this amount so we click borrow we approve and here we get our 100 die in our wallet close our debt tokens so here is the at which we are right now that's very good uh there's a lot of landing and supply side agriculture there but uh almost not a borrow site in order to optimize the the boring cost of having position on defy and the fact that to the best of my knowledge or from my understanding of what you are building at fuji uh you can batch the loan position so users basically deposit their assets and their collateral inside the contract and the contract borrow and on their behalf in order to patch the action and reduce the operational cost of operating those interaction is like super useful and i see a lot of users that would be interested to use this kind of services to repay you you will use flashlight right in order to swap a full position from one protocol to the other right yes exactly yeah here when we we spot a better better opportunity uh we we we do a flash loan by repaying and borrowing again from the other uh supplier yeah that's impressive yeah since the time constraint you know be quick and it's it's very interesting i see a lot of market as well uh it's something we have actually thought about it either as an integration on top of our existing protocol or as a standalone product so keep uh keep asking that's the that's the good direction for sure thank you yeah agree it's a very very good idea i'll be interested to see how you actually implement it um in in code uh because that would be quite fascinating but yeah so far it looks yeah it's very good good idea okay yeah basically really clear really clear and targeted use cases yeah basically for the for the tracking positions of users to our vote uh it's uh it's just uh yeah we are using other other debt token standards so it's just a kind of partial fork of other yeah very cool okay thank you anything else for boyan um yeah i appreciate the you know the very clear diagram that shows the flow of things maybe maybe uh this is just my bias but i it's something that's really helpful for me um to understand projects you know you've been working on these things for a couple weeks now so um explaining that graphically is sometimes helpful at least for me um i'm assuming this is going to be hooked up to contracts for submission uh sorry if we you have like a you have a figma mock-up but will this actually be hooked up to contracts yeah sure yes we are actively working also on the on the smart contracts and yeah uh the uh the idea will be if we manage to to put all this together for the end of by the end of the next week gotcha okay yeah that's great um okay we're gonna move on to the next project and remember anybody who has questions or you know they feel like they didn't get sufficient feedback the discord is perfect for these kinds of asynchronous um feedback types you know he doesn't have to be on a call you can take screenshots of your project there's a ui channel um all of the sponsors are in discord and are responsive there if they're not please let me know or emily know and we'll reach out to them but there should be ways to get feedback other than this this live session uh we're gonna keep going um i'm just gonna i'll just kind of bounce now that's totally fine yeah appreciate you joining even feedback again this week that's right thanks for having me enjoy everyone great work see you there bye-bye all right uh mark are you you sticking around as well yeah i think i have time for one more okay appreciate it so mark and nicola this is uh blossom with chris h jnc and priyanka i'll let you guys start presenting yeah first think uh thanks for uh staying around sticking around for us i uh so we're team blossom can everyone hear me yes yes awesome yeah so what we're doing is effectively uh patreon for for uh for ethereum uh so we're doing is uh we want a way for fans to be able to fund the creators and have creators be able to share a link where they can uh where fans are able to fund those creators and for on the creator side um we're taking the donations from fans and sticking them into ave and grabbing a tokens so that they generate yield and they don't have to do anything even if they're not super familiar with crypto they just need to share their link and their fans are able to send them ethereum or ausd or usdc and we'll take care of the conversions so here we have our links say i'm one of our teammates is actually rapper so we can pretend that he's sending a link to his fans if we click the copy button we'll grab a link i'm just going to use some of our bookmarks for that uh so yeah so say a fan clicks this link that our our teammate sent we connect our wallet we'll send like one to three of them because they're feeling extremely generous today we click send [Music] uh we click send and something's not working uh yeah of course um yeah uh essentially well we don't have the smart contract ready but it would send it and uh the creator would receive the a tokens in the end and they would just generate yodonna and uh the creator would see their balance and then cash it out yeah so basically go to work because yeah basically our idea was you know we have this balance here with ausdcc um but we also want to have the opportunity to let this donation grow over time so it's not just you know oh fans send money through e to the creator it's that they send money and this grows so it's almost like the gift that keeps on giving yeah so i think that's all we have okay makes sense uh for sure mark has more to add on the on the technical side or the implications but uh look we see a massive uh movement around i would say social token and integration and uh and tokenization let's say a tokenization of uh of social groups right and it's something we are actively looking and deploying actually so the patreon for ethereum is you know uh us very clear and direct use case it's good direction um it's a it's a very good idea maybe uh of course it it would be easier for um you know for the user to have it directly maybe on telegram or on discord on on twitter and stuff like that there is a lot of uh integration going on in that direction make it super easy for for the user to to be able to donate to the to the to the bathroom basically okay thanks yeah i just wanted to add that we do have uh telegram and twitter share buttons where um you do have the opportunity to share your family via those channels yeah and i think uh there's a very good opportunity for this kind of uh app and use case to uh promote the fact that is some sort this is censorship resistant donation so basically nobody can shut down the fact that you want to support an entity or a creator or whatever and given the the current trends that may be a good selling point that's awesome thanks yeah i don't have anything to add to those um it's a pretty straightforward concept um and i think i have a good good uh understanding of what it is okay thank you so much all right well mark if you're gonna sign up thanks again for sticking around thank you very much for your presentation sorry for for the one that uh didn't have the time to present uh with us uh old uh derby team and uh let's see uh see what you built next week we can wait and keep keep pushing thank you very much for your time guys dear mark thanks mark uh all right we're gonna we're gonna keep going um again remember there will be two we're gonna plan to have two submission feedback sessions uh next friday um but it looks like there might be some people we won't be able to get to or who missed this session so potentially we'll have another session on monday of next week sometime but we're going to keep going here uh with dear phi go ahead hi everyone okay me yes yes okay yeah uh thanks so oh give me one second did we lose you are you still here what i'm guessing happened is he went to share screen yeah and then he had to update his zoom he's rejoining feel good all right sorry sorry uh uh uh some sharing session uh problem so um thanks for watching i'm gonna share is uh we built a permission list a marketplace for flash long flight strong is very cool but right now the flesh zone is only available for like major stream tokens and we want to build a platform that's uh having this flashlight for all tokens so the idea here is that basically like anyone can create a flashlight pool for any assets they like uh for example here we build this uh unit swap like info page shows all the top top posts and then there's already some pro created and then um so to create a pool you have to go to our portal which is dfi.com and we have deployed our smart contract on on like mainnet and all the testnets and create pool is very easy just simply by click and then uh choose any uh assets you have and then put the amount and you can supply the liquidity and then if it's a new new token it will automatically create a new port just like uni swap and then once it's done you come back you will see the port now so for example this is a dipole there is already like uh 277 die provided in the pool now developers can use the assets in this pool to execute the flash loan uh how do how do i do that just come here and then right now you know flash long usually is executed by uh from smart smart console level right uh so you usually we are not able to demo that but here we pre prepare a uh a contract that can demo you by having a dummy flashlight to do so you have to come to etherscan and then in each scan you can directly interact with our smart contract and then here you can see the flashlight so to execute and flash long there are several parameters you have put first is the flash long contract you deployed which is the dummy flash loan contract we have and then you have to specify like how much uh flash long uh like how much die you wanna to ask you for the flashlight for example here you can uh let's say you want to borrow 100 die uh yeah that's a hundred die and then the data yeah for for this example we don't have to put any data uh because the our smart contract handle everything and then once you execute it uh you wait for the confirmation but yeah like you [Music] let's see once it's done you will see like there's a flash long event shows up here um and then each flash long we charge five pips as a fee so everyone who joined the pool to provide the assets we share all the flash loan income within this pool so we built this because we see less up-charge opportunity and uh and and also like collateral's rep demands for uh many many kind of other assets and right now major asset can uh major flex loan provider cannot provide this and then that's why we built this which is a fully permissionless and decentralized flex loan protocol yeah thanks cool um first question is are these just one it's one-sided pools like in unisoft you have the base assets which is you need it's two-sided liquidity is this just a single asset that you need to deposit so as you can see here it's a single asset so once i said one pool and you can create unlimited pool and then there's no like a impermanent loss okay and can you can you just restate the limitations with other flash loan providers yes so basically we don't only limit to like these pure assets you can actually deposit a token uh c token or even like lp so units of lp token here so that like hacker can actually uh flash along the lp and then you know unwrap the assets and then use it as well so we basically we use whatever assets available on the market okay cool uh that makes sense to me um are you did you uh work the unit swap interface yes we modified from your unison for the time thing yeah no that's that's that makes sense to to reuse something that already exists uh then you get a great ui for uh minimal work nichola you want to go ahead yeah it's look it's it's uh it's a very very needed use case in a sense right it's a sort of like democratization of flash loans which you know it goes down a little bit to the normal users right and and the ability to put them together uh it's gonna drive adoption for sure um and it's a it's a good uh tangible bridge between you know these two words basically right where you can actually use it for for for easiest use cases in a sense so it's um it's interesting of course the uai is very intuitive and uh it's even more intriguing the fact that you can unwrap uh you know other tokens and and and not use just uh you know you can use the lp they they they see token they took and so it's it's quite a little bit of to unpack but it for sure he does legs and that's a pretty powerful idea thank you so much of course um why would somebody want to flash loan uh an lp token so sometimes say they don't they don't have a availability to borrow the token they want unless somehow someone deposit lp here first thing is that if you provide liquidity on say unit swap and then you get lp most likely you don't use it at all you put it in the wallet right so if you deposit the lp token in our platform then someone can flex on that lp forward for temporary unwrap the assets and then execute the flash loan and then pay back by wrap the lp and then basically pay back the lp which is okay i see really but in our platform it's possible i don't think that would be a major use case anyway because we just launched that on mana too because we have a contract audit and then right now majority users still deposit like major asset token they don't deposit lp or a token c token as we imagine yeah okay cool yeah no that makes sense i just didn't didn't realize um yeah uh will the front end be hooked up to you know that you i saw you jumped into the ether scan for the actual demo are you gonna actually have that hooked up by next next week so so yeah next week um right now if you come here this fake interface flash loan actually is a add liquidity remove liquidity page or we plan to actually separate make this uh tab as a pool and then we add a new tab so that's uh yeah basically we implement this section on our interface so that's even though someone's going to rely on the ui they can use it but again like flash loan usually it's it's not a ui thing it's it's it happens on the smart console level yeah right right right good stuff thank you um one thing i appreciate is how the idea is very very simple um yeah thank you very much i i gotta drop off but um i can you know for sure or reassure all the teams that i'll be on on discord i'll drop my handle and you know all the team is on on discord and you know always happy to to hear and and provide feedback yeah i think we're we're gonna organize another session for monday um if you're available then then we'll we'll try to link you in but yeah we want to make sure people get get time to present absolutely absolutely thank you thank you thank you of course of course my pleasure thank you guys thank you all bye guys see you nicola bye-bye thank you all right uh salty.nft you guys still around yes yes yes let me see if my video works can you hear me yes cool can you see me i can alright sorry about the hair anyway let me see if i can share my my screen uh there we go can you see this question are you on like an ipad or something no i'm on the browser isn't mike oh okay just because um there's been a few presentations and then yours included where it comes in as a portrait mode so i'm just curious how it's happening or if you have like a vertical oh vertically oriented screen is it is it still portrait no no it's landscape this is bad okay yeah this is just the uh this is just the figma presentation for a second it's just touching you know it's kind of zoomed out but you know that's the entire screen anyway so everything's okay all right cool so uh essentially this is our project we haven't really decided 100 on the name we have salty lend or nflend loan ft anyway so the point is uh the problem currently that we're trying to solve is that there's a lot of nfts out there that are just sitting around doing nothing right so uh and also there's a lot of liquidity sitting around doing nothing so what are we so what's the solution the solution is we need to allow nfts to be used as collateral and it just so happens that ave has credit delegation which is a fantastic way to give you know more interest to depositors and we decided that we can use nfts and create a marketplace for getting loans uh anyway so this is our ui essentially uh there's two sides obviously there's the borrower and the lender borrowers can create a borrower request and stuff but let's first go ahead and move through the the ui then i have the the contract architecture here anyway so this is a tentative ui it's going to change a little bit it's not final but uh it does it is essentially the gist of it uh you'll be able to see all the loans you have all the assets that you have deposited your collaterals um as well as the uh what you're owed right what you've the bar requests you've accepted so here you've got your uh this is essentially what you've borrowed right this is essentially the assets you've deposited et cetera we'll be able to also we'll be showing a gallery of different nfts that you have that you can set up a bar request for so here for instance let's say you have this wonderful adorable little cryptokitty you're able to create a bar request you know that we'll be able to use any whoops any a token that's available uh you'll be able to set a specific loan duration specific uh interest rate this is a coupon that's fixed uh et cetera right so yeah we want to get a little bit feedback on how the card looks but uh but yeah so that's essentially uh the idea here right and on the other side you'll also be able to browse borrow requests that have been created you'll be able to check the nft check the nft id the address etc right and also view it on openc which is cool and and yeah you'll be able to make your calculations on the lender side obviously there's more risk because you're borrowing from ave uh with an nfd as collateral right so if the nfc goes under uh your your loan right obviously then there's no incentive for the the uh borrower to repay anyway so that's essentially the gist of it up till now i know we're short on time but uh yeah so there's a little bit more technicalities and there's also a fee model that can be enabled that allows for a percentage of the coupon to be going to a certain address maybe a doubt one day who knows anyway so that's the ui um and that's the user experience largely right behind the scenes just a little bit more this is essentially a little graph that i made here a little diagram i made actually just before i created the contracts which are now done more or less um but this essentially explains it's not pretty but it gets the job done it essentially explains the the architecture of the backend contracts of the entire platform so uh from the borrower perspective there isn't much that you have to do right you just have to create your bar request it's a pretty low friction thing even the gas cost isn't that much um of course you do need to approve your nfc and then your nft gets locked with the bar request okay and as for lenders right we can as we've shown you can browse different bar requests see their data uh see which one you'd like to delegate your credit to and then you know interact with the avid debt token which will be available on our website obviously to do um delegate the credit to the contract get the bar request fulfilled and uh and that's it and then obviously after a while the lender has to or the borrower will be forced to pay interest because there's a liquidation threshold uh and if they if and the debt accumulates like a debt token on average accumulates in real time which is kind of cool and uh yeah so that's so essentially they have to repay before the liquidation threshold uh gets passed or before the loan term expires so this is essentially the structure right right you lock your nft in the bar request which is on the contract right um and yeah lenders can liquidate any bar request that they that they're you know the lender uh in so yeah that's essentially it that's the gist of it we're still working on a little bit of stuff but yeah hopefully i explained that okay sure one question is sure um maybe maybe i missed this but where do what's the oracle what's the price oracle for there are no price oracles how do you value the nfts yeah so this is actually something that we were considering right because it's actually impossible technically or it's actually highly manipulable right so what did we decide to do nothing we don't need to value them right we'll leave that to the lender and we actually believe that there's going to be a market that's going to be you know i actually highly believe that there's going to be developments that are going to be showing that collateralized nfts will likely be valued at a low collateralization ratio right to prevent the risk for lenders obviously it's external we don't need to manage the price necessarily that's on the lender's side right in exchange for the additional interest that you're earning for your delegation you take on the risk of having that nft and being stuck with it right uh if it if if eventually there's no more incentive for the borrower to repay the loan okay yeah i guess that makes sense um just really quick uh for anybody who's still sticking around i think i just confirmed another session in one hour from now so if you want to jump back in one hour and i see we have seven more teams after this so if you want to drop off now and then come back i will put the zoom link in um in the discord and that will be with austin griffith if uh if you know him he's done the scaffolding stuff so if anybody is still on this call and would like feedback from austin um that will be in one hour at or 50 minutes at 1 pm eastern victor you don't have to stick around this is you're not obligated to stay um so like i said in one hour there will be a session with austin and i'll put the link in the discord uh if you want to stay on this one that's totally fine um i know some people are in different time zones but we'll jump back to peter um so you said that uh you're not worried about valuations which is i'll have to think about that a bit more um i mean logically speaking right we're not this isn't essential like this is for collectors right you got to be able to value an nft right you shouldn't be able to take a loan on an nft or to borrow to fulfill a bar request right to be a lender against an nft uh without bearing the risk of that nft to begin with uh and i don't know creating a price oracle for nfts is way beyond the scope of this there's no way we can it's not that i know of right because they tend to be highly illiquid markets to begin with so for specific nfts right but there's nothing stopping a lender from going to see the price history on openc or anything like that right yeah i wonder if like at a minimum you could just pull in the eth amount and use that as a proxy obviously there are fluctuations in the eth price or whatever was paid for it you know yeah yeah we could we are planning to integrate open c prices and stuff like that the only problem is um you know if you own that nft then you could potentially bid on it with another address just to spoof the price or something like that oh yeah that's right so we'll need to so we'll need to be [Music] and you know even worse you could do that with multiple addresses to make it seem like the nft has been traded often right so it has to be we have to think about that but i think that as of now getting something off the ground like this uh might be a good start but it's definitely definitely a big deal if we could create a price oracle for nfts yeah one day there's probably some some crypto economic mechanism similar to like a prediction market where you can have people stake on the value and then whatever wherever the value converges that's that's like sort of the rough range but that's probably out of scope for this this hackathon um can you jump back to your ui really quick i just want to see it sure sure yeah it looked pretty good um is there a specific page you want me to move to no no i just wanted to just look through it again um i appreciate that you have like it's it's easy to see the hierarchy of information so that this is good yeah that's to you theo is like a beast no it's good stuff i don't have any any other feedback um cool but you're definitely looking good um cool okay so i just put it in the chat um but i just confirmed that austin is going to be available for a session in one hour um so if you want to let's see we have seven teams are all of these teams sticking around right now or do you want to get feedback with me and austin in a bit um if you want to just unmute and let me know that's that would be helpful who is still on the call wario and morgan you're going to come back at 1 pm eastern okay so that's two teams um who else is still here who needs to uh needs to present on this session i'm i'm still here hello okay you want to present during this one yeah okay yeah but i just didn't understand you you told you said that there is there will be something in this court or what some possibility to show this court also um that would be like if you wanted to connect with the ave team specifically because i know they have they're much more technically minded they have more uh expertise than i do so if you wanted to connect with ave you could just reach out in their uh sponsored channel and they will give you feedback directly okay i will try it if you need feedback from them okay so it looks like somebody is ah somebody's showing already somebody is sharing their screen who is this help me um john i think there will be a new zoom link that i will put into the discord austin's gonna austin's to provide it i'll put it into the market make channel uh who is that uh avish are you done um you want to present in this session and not the next okay yeah go ahead um okay i'll share the screen uh so our ui is not fully complete but we have built a smart contracts i mean and and i will explain you this flow so can you see my screen yes yeah so we are building uh credit default swaps so we have two entities one is the let's say corporate agency that takes loans loans from the uh away and there is another called uh insurance who would be a risk taker who would basically hold the debt tokens so the insurance would basically allow the corporate agency to take flash loans and uh uh with that flash loan with flash loan capital uh sugar uh this flashlight capital uh this uh corporate agency can uh you know do anything uh do arbitrage and earn profit from it uh but thirty percent of that profit would be transferred to the uh the insurance uh as as he uh the insurance is taking the risk right and then uh based on the performance of the uh corporate agency we are as uh that tokens cannot be erc depth tokens cannot be transferable so according to the performance of uh the corporate industry we are creating uh nft uh the derivative token uh which can be traded on the secondary marketplace so whoever buys that derivative becomes the insurance now uh now the amount 30 would be transferred to that that particular person and we have built a chain link we have built a basically api that contains all the profits so we are fetching the uh profits from there and uh basically uh fetching the profits from there uh to the corporate agency and uh creating a crown job that periodically you know uh hits the this contract and uh checks if the if the corporate agency has some profit or not and if his performance is good and based on that nft is created okay um do you have any sort of ui or is it just it's just a smart contact smart contact and uh user flow okay yeah uh i'll admit i don't have a really deep financial background so some of this stuff is probably over my head but i think it seems to make sense um what you're proposing uh but beyond that i don't have a ton of feedback um i appreciate the use of the frogs if you're integrating link so i know you'll get some points there for the mean value um what other go ahead uh it's basically credit default swaps right yeah uh what other sponsors so you're so the best so based on uh the performance of the depth of uh that a corporate agency uh nfts will be created which are uh double-a rated of or if the performance is bad then uh triple c rated nfts will be created uh yeah gotcha and how do people actually bid on the the nfts or is it only linked to the uh no no uh no one's gonna bid on it but people can buy it so the double a rated nft would be uh highly priced because uh uh it ensures that the the corporate agency is performing well so if anyone's wants to become the insurance who wants to buy that nft he would he would have to pay the higher price higher price okay gotcha yeah um would you would you try to integrate this with existing protocols or are you trying yeah so media engineers uh we are using our way correct delegation and chain link chaining okay so then the output is the nft which represents the cdo yeah yeah which uh represents the depth derivative okay yeah i think i have a handle on it i'll have to like read a little bit more about what you're proposing but it seems to make sense do you think you'll be able to have a ui for next week uh yeah i think we will basically ui will be three pages one page for you know uh registering the corporate industry another for uh registering the uh the insurance and another for uh creating a secondary marketplace where the nfts can be traded okay gotcha yeah i'll look forward to seeing that thank you thanks for presenting i think uh david and max will have more feedback on this yeah they would be perfect for giving you more specific technical or financial feedback on this kind of stuff um so again reach out to them in the ave sponsor channel okay okay thank you sure thing uh all right so next up was morgan uh unless you're coming back for the the session in a little bit i do not hear or see a morgan so we're going to move on to did you lab hello yep whenever you're ready go ahead oh okay uh so i want to present our last week work and our project our project with the you see my screen i do yes uh so as i told you we want to build the result we want to build a liquidity pool containing assets from different chains and we took as an example for the ethereum chain and binance marching so we we have wrote smart contracts we deployed them on testnet and but we we implemented the the base uh the base operation to test to test the the interchange negotiation uh through chain link we implemented to test it to to make proof of concept we implement we implemented just uh for example uh swap token so we have uh we have here see 20 like talking on the on the ethereum chain and we have your c20 like token on the finance machine so we built also a little uh user interface so now i am connected uh please pay attention we we united we have uh two wallets on our application uh meta mask and binance wallet uh so this is shown uh the the balance on the ethereum is shown on the top and this is the balance of the token on the finance marching so i want to show you the operation of swapping swapping assets from the ethereum for for the asset from finance machine so first operation is approved ah okay so okay now we have to wait for for transaction to mine okay now it is mined now we can swap one token from ethereum and we have balance you see we have 36 and the balance on binance machine is 57 so swap the first operation was a proof i didn't say that the first operation was approved so now we are waiting for um other transaction actually everything is done but we wait for transaction to be successful uh i pay you attention that this is uh this transaction goes through chain link we wrote special adapter to call now you see that we see that the transaction was successful and now we can check balance now it's 35 and 57 so we had a successful uh successful exchange of tokens uh actually we have we have uh we have deployed all the infrastructure as i told you the smart contracts and the adapter and we also we also deployed our own uh chain link node where our adapter is leaving okay so that's our work for the for this week so we have the proof of concept uh inter inter chain negotiation with chain link nodes that's it oh hello cool yeah sorry i was muted um so what what would you say so this is good in that it's like a very clear concept and very clear use case you know people want to go between chains without necessarily relying on having to go to a centralized exchange so this is this is good to see um can you tell me a little bit more a little bit more about what chain link adapters actually do like what's that what's a trust assumption there i can't tell okay go ahead okay so the truss assumption is uh i can show you the code maybe so then [Music] the api that chain link built okay it allows you to call uh smart contract uh actually we have uh our own smart contract and and we have special smart contract that interfaces uh chain link node uh the adapter living machining mode and you are calling the methods you are calling the method from uh from uh from your smart contract and it it applies exactly to the adapter to the external chilling adapter and this adapter can reference to the smart contract on another side so you have to you you have to deploy two two adapters to have one uh one side uh negotiation and you have to implement another adapter to have another site negotiation so the trust assumption is that the chain link nodes uh are are situated in the decentralized network and uh and then they can when you place your adapter on the chainlink node uh then then you can publish then we then we can publish our source code on the changing they have special market you know special special market for adapters and then anybody so the chain link network is they're centralized and the scripts running on the nodes they are like they are how to say they they are checked by notes but each other so if so you're not have to uh have to give the same result as other nodes actually we are on our only on our way on on this research uh how it will be really trusted and decentralized but and we built the base this base operation and the next step when we have when we when we will show you and ask that this theme is working then we'll research how how chain link network is really decentralized and uh and and it can work trust in trustless uh in trustless way that's it awesome you know that makes sense i i haven't done a ton of research into chain like adapters and what they actually do so um it's good to get a little bit of background uh do you could you see this expanding to other teams or is it are you gonna just stick with the core idea of you know ethereum to finance smart chain no i didn't i i'm sorry can you can i repeat i didn't understand the question would once you've you know proved this concept it's going from ethereum to binance smart chain do you see in the future that you could expand it to other evm chains yeah sure yeah no we have really we have a really big plans to build really we can we are really working not only platform but protocol for the main idea is a liquidity pools mixing assets from different chains so this is only our first step and of course we want to of course we want to implement it in different ways in different chains but for now we want to we want to make it work in minimum configuration yeah i think i think that's great to see and i appreciate that there's a ui that you know it's very straightforward um you know it's not too complicated i can clearly see how to perform the swaps and what i need to do to actually accomplish what i need to do so thank you good job on that anything else okay just uh if it will be the session on demand on monday i will i will i also want to participate in it maybe mentors yeah for sure and and like i said to other people there's always uh um you can reach out on like tag these people from ave if you want specific feedback from them tag them in the discord that would be good thanks for presenting though actually we have the question for maybe representatives representatives of chain link uh there are no people from chain link on this call okay but they will be on monday or no um i can try to arrange a session uh but there's no there's no guarantee that they will be there uh your best bet is to go into the discord channel and you know tag some people from the chain i think his name is patrick but if you have trouble finding it i would i would reach out directly okay thank you okay thank you for thank you for sharing the project um all right so i think the rest of the teams are are there any teams who need to present in the next you know a few minutes without going to austin's session um any teams left who would like to present in this session so um our guy that was supposed to present has left the call i could do a very short demo and get some feedback maybe sure yeah go ahead victor if you want to connect with bugdon i think that might be best in the discord i mean you can also join there's a voice channel if you want to chat in there but by text might be best because we have limited time for this session go ahead visilios uh what's your project by the way uh apyn oh okay i don't see you on the yes but that's okay all right um yeah so basically pretty straightforward the idea is that um you come to our site and you connect your wallet and we gather your idle holdings and calculate how much money we you would have made if that money was on other instead of being idle on your wallet and yeah you can click here these are just placeholders um for new features that we're going to come up with but yeah you can see in the future you'll be able to see here the in the chart the difference in usd with ava and usd without alva and the other feature we are working on right now is basically you come in and you give in an amount you that you want to invest in a certain coin and then we calculate based on historical apy and and the gas gas prices when you will break even so when you will make your your the transaction costs back and when you will start earning money basically great is that it yep that's it yeah nice um super simple concept uh and charts are always nice to see especially when you're trying to uh show somebody how much money they've missed out on making so the ui is coming along um looks like yeah you said there's a few other things you have to add in um yeah have you guys so this is just reading like you're not building any contracts right you're just reading uh on chain data yeah yeah okay perfect yeah that that's that's a great strategy for you know something like a hackathon um yeah i don't know if i have anything specific uh you said you're gonna add more into those tabs on the left um yeah basically these these are just uh placeholders for now um maybe we're going to add something for uh the so some um some nice explanation of how we do the calculations would be helpful right yeah yeah any little tool tips or something to give just a little more context exactly yeah and this is only only for dye or do other other assets um so this is based on my wallet so it's uh not very yeah okay it can be any any asset that's in avec yeah yeah yeah all your basically all your assets and here you got uh links to go and aping directly into ave to deposit yeah exactly very nice i i really like this this is a very uh simple but clear project composite it's useful i think yeah cool yeah so if there are no questions that's it no i think this is on a good good track forward um when you go to make your you know your presentation um you're going to want to state like what what the inspiration for this project was uh yeah just make sure to give a summary of like why this is necessary or why it's helpful to people who are just getting started and defy something like that um yeah exactly thank you for presenting yeah thanks okay i think we're gonna wrap here um in 20 minutes we'll be back on austin's call for anybody who did not um was not able to present here so uh looks like there's some conversation continuing for bogdan i encourage you guys to jump into um jump into discord and continue the conversation there but we're gonna wrap here so i'll see everybody who's rejoining the next session in 20-ish minutes and thank you for presenting uh yeah that's it
