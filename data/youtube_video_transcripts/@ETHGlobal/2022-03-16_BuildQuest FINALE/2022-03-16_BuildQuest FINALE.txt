[Music] good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of the global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to the build quest finale so all of you are watching this thing on eatglobal.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is a platform we'll be using for going through all of the the demos and all the winners today and at any point if you have any questions or comments especially if you're a hacker and you have any follow-up just feel free to log in uh say hi and ask your questions and we'll be able to kind of answer them on the live stream for you and also for everybody who's joining in and participating in this chat uh you'll be getting a nft co-app for participate participating at this event so this event is an eve global event uh eve global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running uh two things uh hackathons and summits goal quest was a combination of both so we hosted an amazing hackathon that spanned the last few weeks and we also did a summit last week talking about everything that's happening in gaming in the metaverse and just how you can use nfts in super interesting ways for the hackathon we're practicing we get over 630 people participating and building really amazing projects from 67 different countries spanning 16 different time zones so it was a really incredible experience for us to kind of talk to people from all over the world and learn about what they were excited about and make sure that everybody has a great experience no matter where they are and what time zone they're in uh we kind of put everybody on a map to see where everybody was coming in from and it still kind of blows my mind every time i generate these maps that we have representation from six continents every single time it is incredible to see all of you being interested in web3 from all over the world and uh we're super excited to show everything that came out of it today and not just the hackers we also had 18 ecosystem partners and over 50 mentors that were here uh helping out all of our attendees with anything technical to understanding how they can use better protocols or not sort of uh do everything from scratch and use existing work that would make their lives a lot easier and to top it all off we had 125 000 in prizes which is what we'll be going into today right after the demo so if you are eager to know what you want today uh for your project uh you'll find this out very soon so after all the submissions ended and we went through judging we got 140 projects that came out of this event so it was incredible to see so many cool games on this sunday and we're going to be showing a few of those projects right now but 140 projects that kind of build amazing things just kind of blew us totally away and on top of that i want to quickly thank everybody from our partner side that made all this possible specifically ipfs and protocol labs we also had partners like immutable x in ballast polygon studio stardust sequence morales chain safe tableland quixotic covalent op games nft port pinata chain link lighthouse dram and coin up uh all of these amazing partners were there all around helping our attendees really build creative projects and sort of make their lives easier with their protocols and sdks all right so let's go back to the submissions so this is called the finale because we want to use this as an opportunity to highlight uh some projects that we were super excited about from our judging process and from all these 140 projects that were judged we ended up with a list of 10 finalists so we're going to be bringing all these 10 teams here today working a live demo what they built as part of this event and using that as a way to kind of talk about all the cool things that they're excited about and some cool projects that we saw uh from this hackathon and then we'll go into prizes uh and talk about everything that every other team won from each of our partners so in no particular order i want to congratulate parcels clash of cards oliver's nifty guilds shake shock shattered realms geo nft nf3d nfc bonfire and metaverse music as our 10 finalists we're going to bring them on soon and talk about everything that they did and these are some 10 incredible projects that are going to talk about everything that they they were able to build during build quests and these are our final lists but before we go into the very first demo i want to quickly take a second and highlight that just because you were not one of these 10 10 teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong about anything that you did uh to all hunt authority projects listed here i want to thank you for taking the time to participate this event kind of using this as an opportunity to learn about what could be possible in web3 and really putting your time effort and energy into making something that you are yourself proud of and i really hope that all of you can continue building this whether it's the same project that you want to build on past uh sunday or the submission deadline or something new that you want to tackle on uh for any future uh side projects or a future week global event uh please keep building our goal is to bring on people who can help you succeed in any way whether it's through mentorship being to answer questions or being able to get follow-on help if you want to continue your project and take this to the next level whether that's wanting to connect to people for advice or making this into a company uh please reach out to us we'll be able to help uh with any of these things and connect you with wherever you're going so um i really want to thank everybody here and and just say that what matters to us is that you're experimenting with these technologies because we're super excited about what could be possible here and we're super safe to see brand new use cases that were just not possible before before and we hope that you sort of continue and don't get discouraged from this uh just not being on the top 10 finalists list so thank you so much to everybody again and and with that i'd like to move on to our uh the demos and for everybody who's interested in learning about what all these projects were you can head over to showcase.educable.com and see the list of all projects that came came out of build quest so you'll be able to see everything including all 40 140 projects and find out about what they did how everything works and how things work under the hood so as we kind of looked at some common themes in these 10 teams uh we saw that there's a lot of overlap on like how people have thought about building some of these uh projects so we have a lot of in the ten teams organization we have a lot of kind of examples of crypto native games we have examples of people building web 2 experiences and making them crypto native uh by porting some of those aspects uh obviously we're gonna see some really interesting nfts and and um and related uh tooling related ideas and the last one is just kind of focusing on the metaverse side we have a lot of cool ways to think about 3d experiences with web3 technologies so i'll stop talking these are our 10 teams and i am super proud to bring on our very first project and that is going to be parcel so without further ado let's welcome parcels to live demo what they built welcome hey uh thank you cardik and it's global for the amazing opportunity let me share my screen let me just remove the [Music] okay do you see my screen everything is good perfect uh so let's dive into it so hi i'm noe and i will uh present you our project for eth global build quest which is called parcels uh so we're a team of four french engineering students and we've made this game within the week so let's dive into the game parcels is a fully decentralized building and strategy game where players own parcel which are parts of a big common map that you can see here so you can explore the map and see other players parcels parcels are erc 721 nfts and they produces a an erc20 token that we called res for resources please note that every assets on the in the game is hosted on ipfs and uses filecon via nft.storage so it's fully decentralized and also every assets are custom made whether it's like 3d images and even the music and was made during the week so let's uh show one of my parcels here you have a parcel which is pretty empty for now i just have a hut on it let's add some items on it so you can add items on your parcel to increase the production of res token so first let me craft an item for example we can add a windmill let me craft it open metamask so i'm paying some rest to craft it and it will very soon appear in my inventory there it is so for now the item which is an erc 1155 is in my wallet so i own it and now i can build it on the parcel and building an item on the parcel is transferring its ownership from my inventory my wallets to the parcel so it's basically the parcel that is owning an nft so it's like nfts owning nfts which is very cool because for example if i resell my parcel every items on it will be sold with it but i can also remove them so let's build the windmill there so for now i have an outcome of 200 raise per day and now with the windmill it should increase 400 perfect and the 3d model should load quite soon okay it should be loading okay perfect um so there it is and it's live updating and now it's updated also in the map so it's loading the image and now you can see the huts and the windmill the parcels are all you can also display them on the kickstarter marketplace and you can showcase for now the contracts on the optimism test nets kovan so uh let me show you now our future roadmap for this game so the first thing we want to implement is an attack system so each parcel will have attack points and different points and you can attack uh adjacent parcels so this really brings a strategy a game into into a game and make players able to conclude the whole map and even to make alliances and all that stuff so it's it will really be a community based game uh then we will make a private alpha uh to get feedback to correct bugs to have a good balance it will be on optimism and to build a community then we plan to add more resources and mechanics so res will become three different erc20 tokens so gold food and water and this will allow us to add a lot of different mechanics such as different parts of the map can produce more of gold more water etc then we will do some iteration to perfect the game uh until it's really ready and then we will launch it also for the future we have some ideas that we want to put into the game so we will probably make a dao we want to implement the diamond standard eip we want to make a super big map something around like 10 000 to 50 000 parcels we want to bring a meta metaverse component so player can import nfts from other collections to display them on their parcel we want to add some other buildings especially for the attack defense system and we want it to be a free-to-play so that it's more affordable than regular web 3 games um so i think that's it um [Music] we we're really glad to have been in this uh hackathon it was really cool we learned a lot thanks to all the sponsors and all the teams it was an amazing experience thanks to my team especially um i i'm really glad they joined the event the adventure and here you can take a look at you can take a look at our tech stack so you we use the react nexjs typescript tailwind and etherjs for the front end uh python blender and figma for generating the assets the storage as i said is on nft.storage so ipfs and pylchon the backend is using hardhat and solidity and the chain we're using is optimism and kickstarted marketplace thank you so much amazing well congrats for first of all going first doing a live demo and nothing breaking and talking about all the amazing things we're gonna do uh in the future uh it's really good to see when uh uh people are interested in building this further and i'm curious to have others also try this out when you kind of fully launch this uh so this is awesome yeah we'll be sure to to include the eth global members in the private alpha for sure be happy to uh play with this and uh and spend time anymore thank you thank you so much all right we are now ready for our next demo so without further ado let's welcome the team shattered realms hi hey hi mariah uh this is david my partner who we made together this game so i'm gonna present it uh real quick i'm gonna start with the play test and uh let's go so shadowed realm is a 90s style jrpg uh inspired by the likes of final fantasy 6 chrono trigger um and so it's it lives on the polygon chain so now we press new game we're entering the the realms and it's going to ask us to connect our wallet and it's going to switch us to the mumbai testnet uh when the game is fully launched uh in order to play the game you're gonna need to have one of these nfts but for the demo that is available at this link demo the chatter rams dot io you're gonna be able to try one of the four founder characters for free [Music] so let's go uh the four characters there there's a rogue there's a mage and i'm gonna play the cleric [Music] let's go so this is this island is kind of the the entry point of the shattered realms and inside this village i'm gonna be able to discover how things work so much like uh many jrpgs if you've played any i can talk to people discover stuff that's going on unlock quests get free items and here uh i'm going to showcase one of the features we have in the game which is the utility traits nfts uh characters have can have can unlock utility traits such as wood cutting so for example i'm going to try to help this woodcutter and he's going to teach me how to cut wood so i'm getting this axe and now he's going to ask me to get rid of some zombies let's go by the way i'm gonna showcase how fights look like in this game [Music] so very much like final fantasy 6 with the action action timer system [Music] and then either experience point and gold after each fight so here i'm going to let some distill your sports get rid of all the zombies [Music] now the woodcutter is going to be pleased and he's going to teach me how to chop wood so if i tried now i would say i need to learn woodcutting before but here i discovered the profession woodcutting and now i can cut and here i get one log of wood i put this chest for the demo because i want to save time here are four more and now that i have five i gonna be uh offered the opportunity to purchase or mint the woodcutting nft upgrade [Music] which is going to open this transaction and as soon as the transaction is so right now while it's pending i can keep playing because we don't want to stop the ui while uh blockchain activity is happening and just gonna wait until this is done this is done and now if i would try to chop another logo food instead of giving me one piece of food it's gonna give me two because i'm an expert i have the nft that proves it um i am very quickly going to showcase another feature it's the exploration so outside here in the world map in the island i can use this skill explore and this is going to generate a random map depending on the coordinates where i can fight some more monsters and gather more treasures etc i strongly suggest you go check this link and explore as much as you can of the game and now i'm gonna switch to the roadmap so shattered realms is going to be so this entry point this island that i showcased and we're gonna progressively release uh portals to uh two realms that we publish as the team and we're also going to distribute our web3 plugin uh that allows people to create these realms on rpg maker and these are going to be realms proposed by the community where people can try them and can apply to be added to the official uh to the official realms uh so the gameplay like you saw uh involves exploration there's dungeon clearing collecting ingredients and crafting there's going to be an items marketplace where players can sell the unique items they can craft but they can also sell their services they can own realms uh organized guilds and there's going to be a dynamic cost system to generate never-ending quests owning the nft character and ft like you saw will give you access to these skins but also some rare utility traits and other utility traits include blacksmithing cartography artifacts artificial homesteading and arkhan research where by staking a character that has one of these skills other players can go to your character and ask them to for example repair their sword and you would get rewarded in tokens uh that's it so i'm gonna go by the way on openc and see if my nfg shows up and here it is i have the woodcutter certificates that's it thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed the demo and i hope you will join the community as soon as we announce the alpha this is amazing uh oh demo.io so for everybody wants to check it out you can go ahead and do this now i think just this is like a perfect example of blending in what's already there in web 2 and making it more weaponated with rpg maker so this was an amazing demo i'm looking at all the comments from the chat before super excited to kind of try this out so i hope you give this to them and they get to play with it and this expands even more and congrats thanks all right with that we are ready for our third demo so without further ado let's welcome clash of cards ayushan team whenever you're ready wonderful thank you very much karthik so hello everyone thank you very much for giving us this opportunity right so we are team clash of cards uh as you can see simply collect buy and win nfp monsters and you can play now for free this is a small looking nft that we have made and there are three types of monster cards that we have a one's a common card that everyone has when they uh join the game uh the second is the rare cards quite rare i must say and then the super rare like really really hard to find and these are words a lot so what is this game right you can buy and sell nfd cards you can go to battle and win cards there are something called a weekly leaderboard and you can collect rare and super air cards and sell it on the marketplace we've built it using pinata polygon chain link and sequence the tech stack is uh really impressive that the teams have built and it helps us make this game really awesome this is the team behind the samyak surprise that's mine that's me so thank you very much for this wonderful opportunity we can just get started with the game so we quickly get a pop up for a metamask you can click it takes some while to retrieve all your wonderful nfts right since i'm already logged in i might have some rare cards as well uh so let's choose eight cards for a face-off right i'm gonna use these my powerful super air and rare cards and some common cards that i think i can use let's use killerdale and then so all these cards have high uh health right so let's choose fiery kite so wonderful or there's one more car remaining that is yes so let's quickly go for what battle right so an nf a meta mask transaction comes up so that i can uh stake and move into battle right so also at the same time samyak on the other side is logged into clash of dot cards and he's gonna play with me since this is a real-time p2p p2p game so that's should be one more metamask transaction just to confirm my stake and to enter the game meanwhile let me just show you the marketplace right so this is what the marketplace looks like here you can buy rare and super rare cards of course the pricing has to be fixed right now we are almost done with the entire beta would love to have all of you play this game [Music] [Music] okay let's let's try it again right let's just put all my cards [Music] so something with a higher hand okay i mean have you joined the game [Music] seems to be some kind of knife okay so [Music] this particular demo then the other one shows up so that's how it works right you add your cards and then you're gonna touch the cards and your cards kill them again instantly because this is quite a powerful card that we have right here wonderful we are killing all the cards so i think some yuck's choice of cards are oh wonderful so samyak's choice of cards didn't really work out see so wonderful so we have one 98 clash tokens over here and so what do you do with the clash tokens that you just want so you buy stuff at the marketplace right so that's something you could do and also once you visit the leaderboard right you can see this is a weekly contest that the multiple addresses have been playing and the amount of tokens that they have the first on the leaderboard wins uh super rare nft the two to five fifth place wins a rare nft and the rest of them win a common nfd so this is somewhat of a competitive environment that we're building wonderful that's it from our side thank you for uh listening to clash of cards thank you and you can go yourself and play it on flashshop.com probably there's a minor hiccup let's fix it in the next 10 minutes amazing uh well congrats on making this uh demo work and i know it's uh it's always that one of those uh nervous moments where you don't know if live demos are going to go as expected or not but i think uh for everybody listening in this is it's just a super simple but amazing and creative game and i think the best thing about all this is that this and a few other projects you're going to see today are already available live so you can just head over to clash of cards and check this out so pending that minor bug which should be fixed soon you can all try these things out immediately and share more feedback with the team so they can improve these games so congrats again and now with that we are ready for our next demo so next up we have guy ft i'd like to welcome the gmt team up on screen so i use shinichika look to get started [Music] um hello everyone welcome to geo nfc we're going to take you through the project we worked on for the eth global uh made by ishikawa myself and ayush my teammate so what is go and fd geo nft is a platform where geolocation based nft drops happen uh that help make nft's exclusive fun and you know more interactive uh using ar uh it's a play-to-one game now how is it a play-to-one game so brands and creators drop their nfps uh for users uh to go find them in the real world using clues that are posted on the app uh each nft hunt um and each nft drop is a different game on the app we have free as well as paid game for our users uh why did we make this it was an intersection of the real world and the virtual world and it adds value for the users and creators and it's a basically a digital treasure hunt that we um have uh why again i think it's a new way for brands to you know really market their um nfps uh because this can be a good wave and you know you're at various um you know uh gatherings like mons exhibitions and events it can add a layer of exclusivity to how nft hunt happens right now uh so uh how did we make this the first is uh the brands and creators choose different types of clues they want to input and be generated for them and we our aim is to make it as dynamic as possible so that up for them so that the users enjoy um the uh search even more so how do you use it you connect your wallet using sequence you provide location access so all the nfl drops that might be near you are shown to you then uh then you find your first clue you go to the location that you have found in the first clue then you approach that you go to the second clue and this is how uh you know you find um and claim your final nft but only when you are at the location and you can see it through your camera uh this is our text tag we review sequence ipfs governance morales nft port and pinata um we'll see the demo now so let's see a quick demo of our app so this is the explore game screen where i can choose the game i want to play so i chose the pixel runs game then i choose an avatar i choose this so then i'm taken to my location and my avatar is my marker so you can see that i'm here and now i can go to the clue screen to find out where my nfp might be so this is uh this is my clue it's an anagram of where my nfd might might be so let me uh try entering something and yeah this is the location so now i can go to the map and yeah so as you can see it shows that my nfp is around me so i can open my camera and look around for it so as you can see this is my camera view and i see that i've got my nfp and now i can go ahead and claim it so when i claim it i'm taken to my sequence wallet so here i will connect my wallet and go ahead and mint it so yeah that's pretty much our demo we see uh what we have next in store for uh jionft so we want to keep all the nfd secure so that there's no jio spoofing so that will be our next step we also want to create a smooth experience for brands to list their nfps and you know again make uh the clues as dynamic as possible and we also plan to launch it really soon which is maybe next month and also have it in vr mode for you guys so thank you thank you for uh giving us this opportunity it was really fun doing this and yeah that's all awesome [Music] amazing well thank you so much for that demo and uh yeah it's really cool to see you bringing in this with the real world and uh i think this is a really cool experience that now especially when in-person events are coming back uh this will be this will be fun so hope this kind of continues uh being built and uh we get to see this in the real world sometime congrats thank you excited all right next up we have olivers so chan and hunwe whenever you're ready all right thanks karthik uh it's good to be back again and um my name is hunwi and uh together with my friend who is in malaysia malaysia right now chilean we developed an nfp trading card game called olivers sorry just give me a minute i think i didn't share the sound okay we are back now this is an nft trading card game that allows players to customize and mint their own trading cards through minting and also what's cool about this card is that they are tradable in openc and also playable in the game so why why do we build it this way well we feel that um nlt trading card games in general are not decentralized enough and that's because one centralized entity and that is the game creator has full control of the rarity of each trading card and therefore we want to decentralize the rarity configuration of our game by giving the players the power to create and mint their own trading cards as a result the rarity of the trading card is determined by two factors number one the loots or items used by the player during the creation of the new trading card and number two the identity of the player who created the trading cards which can be authenticated using the blockchain just imagine if you can own a trading card minted by snoop dogg that'd be so cool right and so because of this the game creator has very little control over the card variety as well as the meta game which is the game of the game for this hackathon we use chain save sdk to enable metamask login and we use nft port for in-game minting in addition all player card item and gameplay data are all stored in tableland and we also use ipfs to store all trading card images and metadata so that they can become nfts alright it's time for a quick demo let me switch over to unity so this is the login screen of the game let me connect my wallet okay it's gonna prompt me to sign my metamask which is on polygon network right now is on the life of mainnet let's go back to the game [Music] okay now let's recruit some new performers okay all right uh so you can see here these are the items that i've collected from previous gameplay so if i choose a comedian certificate well i'll get a comedian let's say i want to go with a martial certificate which will give me a martial artist um let's customize further by giving him a fiery background and let's call him [Music] friendly all right and we'll mint it so it's minty right now and you'll notice that there is no transaction no confirmation in this place because everything is done in game and it's only possible because we use uh nft port api all right now the mean is successful let's hop on to openc and see if it's there well we know that um it's going to take some time to for the entity to show up in opec so i'm just going to show you one of the examples one of the cards that i have minted early on so this is how it looks like in openc it comes along with the properties the performer martial artist as well as the stats of the card as well which includes attack class and health so because of this thing showing on overseas players can always sell it as a wish now back to the game so now i will demonstrate a multiplayer gameplay by playing with my friend julian who is in malaysia right now by going to the arena okay so you look for a player okay so now it's his turn so let me explain a little bit what's going on right here so these are my cards okay and this is the health of the player which is myself as well as the two stamina that i have stamina simply means how many actions i can take per turn so now it's his turn okay now it's my turn let's try to summon k-hope dancer okay so i've completed one action and one more left let me summon plenty see the card that i admitted earlier on hey so now it's his turn okay he and his turn let's see i have two actions so i'm just gonna attack him okay it's still my turn because i have more action i'm gonna attack him again okay you can see that the additional attack actually goes to his health now it's his turn what is he gonna do next okay another martial artist let me attack him again all right no one left let's hit him directly so his health is low now he's two out of ten oh you said that you win obviously right okay now the game ends so at the end of each game play players will receive items that are dropped during the game and with these same items that we have collected players can also use them to customize the card that we have seen earlier on all right let me go back to the slides so that would be all actually for a very quick demo of olivers and through beethoven i don't have enough time to show and cover everything about the project so if you're interested to find out more about the project please visit only share also ollyburst.com with a hyphen in between especially if you are wondering who is ali and why is it called olivers and also please scan the qr code if you like to connect with me as well so my presentation will end here and thank you for the opportunity thank you [Music] amazing thank you so much this was uh super cool and i'm just like enjoying the music in the background i feel like we got to put that music in the radio for people great thanks uh well this was super fun and uh congrats for uh kind of continuing to build this project from the last hackathon this is amazing yeah thanks so thank you and with that we are ready for our next demo so next up we have nf3d so veronica whenever you're ready hi kartik thank you for announcing me so let me quickly share my screen okay brilliant now let's start so hello my name is anna fridy and that's my boot quest hackathon project before we get started with the juicy stuff let me give you a quick rundown of who i am um so my name is veronica i'm computer science and ai student and i build this project myself now with that out of the way let's talk about the app so what exactly is nf3d well in a nutshell it's a 3d and ft generator that can create multi that can handle multiple blockchains it allows you to create your own 3d avatars to use in games it's here to give a second life to your nft image collection now the big question how it works let's take it one step at a time so first using available apis the app gets all nfc stored in users hot worlds like metamask or phantom or sequence then using available apis it sends a request to retrieve all the nfts in your world and their unique traits it then links their traits with their corresponding 3d parts and finally it merges them into one 3d model to prepare the model to be stored on the blockchain it converts it to the json format the meta data is then saved on ipfs the nft is created and it's sent to your wallet and here's our rundown of all the technologies i used to build this app more is ipfs covalent and nft port apis blender and 3js fantastic now let's move on to the demon okay so here we are on the main page let's follow the instructions and login to our method metamask wallet let's wait for it to pop up and here we go let's go ahead and click the sign button after successful logging we are redirected to another page here we can choose which blockchain we want to work with i'm just going to say with a ring b and in this slide bar we can choose any we can see a gallery of our nfts now choose the nft avatar you want to mint um when you click add on it you will obviously see a preview of its 3d model as like so um but on wednesdays we were paying so i would select this shape so uh to see your produce uh so ceo produced avata from any perspective obviously just as i've showed before you can just click the model and slide your mouse over it um when you're happy with the appearance of your 3d ape then click export to export it or make it two minutes on the blockchain of your choice so let me try the latter the pop-up might take a while to upgrade eventually we also don't panic okay and now let's click the button here and here we go our free model is now on the battery if you want to see more about the transaction just copy and paste this address in the first scan and that's that right back to the slides let's resume so what are my plans for the future obviously i would like to expand the number of collections available um the more the mirror right um what else i did some research and discovered some fascinating neural networks models that would automate the conversion of 2d images to 3d models which i would obviously like to try um rather than modeling each feature by hand there are also uh certain smart contract features i would like to try to handle every uh event such as transferring the nft's image to the 3d models but i won't go into too much depth just yet also finally integration with other blockchains but now it works only with metamask and ethereum based blockchain and testnet but i would like to expand it to include additional top tier blockchains that have launched uh nft markets um such as solana polkadot at siteria there is just there's no limit to that now if you have some apes crypto banks or the spicy nfts in your metamouse code you might check out the app yourself although the software is still in development and has limited capabilities any feedback is valuable so you can locate it by following the link right here and i believe that concludes my presentation thank you so much for your attention and thank you for uh letting me participate in that fascinating and wonderful event thank you so much this was a really cool demo and yeah just being able to sort of say here's a neural net that converts 2d to 3d models and just applying all these different uh characteristics and just variants uh it's just going to be super cool i think this is how we make a lot of things in the metaverse a lot more smoother and uh this is awesome i hope you continue building this thing and generalizing the generation and uh hope to see this in uh in real world soon congrats all right with that we are four demos uh away from going into all the prizes and also just four amazing more demos to go so without further ado let's welcome our next team and that is nifty gil so our paul whenever you're ready hi i am harpaz i will just share my screen now [Music] hi everyone i am from mumbai india and for each global build quest i built difficult difficulties is the application where nfd is hangout so what is the problem that we are trying to solve uh we expect the blockchain applications to be available 24 7 right but we should also expect our documented services to be available 24 7. so discord is right now being majorly used to create broken dated communities but it lacks blockchain level security mostly is controlled by roles so the mechanism is where you connect your wallet to discord and you are assigned the role which has access to those token gated channels what is a solution a solution is one click connect and access an affiliated chat rooms so all the user has to do is come to our application connect the wallet and then they are good to go they are given access to all the groups that they should have no setup is needed neither from the person who created the inft collection nor from the user that is joining the uh coming to use the application all of the data is stored on textile which is built on ipfs so data is being stored in a decentralized manner we also have blockchain level security why because you are only given access to the groups based on the nfds you own there are some alternatives however i found a gap where i could build an application which is permissionless and not are dependent on discord so let's jump right into the demo this is how the front page of difficult application looks like all the user has to do is click on connect wallet once we connect wallet right now what the application is doing is it is trying to get the information regarding all the nfv's in the wallet using covalence and ft endpoints so as you can see on the left side that i have been assigned uh or given access to some groups based on the nfps i hold one of them is devs for evolution this is i've been given access to this group because i hold a developer now nfp you can see we have stats from the nft collection like floor price volume average volume per day and etc this is done using covalent nft market data apis and we also have channels here different channels that can be created by the fellow members remember you can only get access to these channels if you hold the nfts in this collection now i'm going to try to switch to a different group resorts again i've been given the access to this group because i hold azov nft and you can i can also send some messages here to the fellow members in the group and if i want i can create more channels here also one thing to notice is based on the uh nfts you hold on on different chains you can see the logos besides the nfd collection here so the first xr ethereum and the last four are polygons so basically we support a lot of more chains pretty much all the things that covalent supports we support them all so what is our future plans we think that we should also implement rule assignments so basically having rules similar to what we have in discord and this can be achieved in nft projects which are implementing open zip links role-based access control we also think of uh implementing composable channel conditions what this means is letting users create channels like just like in discord but giving conditions to them like if a user wants to access these channels they need to have two nfts or special trait nfts we plan to also do live peer integration like we have in discord for live streams and we also want to enable direct messaging folks here are uh highly appreciated thank you for allowing us to participate in the hackathon i learned a lot and if you want to get if you're interested in this application want to check it out you can go to niftygirls.org thank you so much this is awesome uh yeah i mean especially being able to do more than just chat makes it even more interesting because now the communities can actually manage this without having to be on 500 discords uh so this is great well i hope you continue building this thing and hope to try this out for my next uh community i joined thank you all right next up we have nft bonfire so whenever you're ready thank you kartik uh two of us are going to make this uh presentation going uh paul will uh go us and lead us through the slides and i'm going to present you the live demo so when you feel ready we can start monster sorry thanks carrick we are team uh nft bonfire uh my name's paul we have alenia christian and victor and we come from all corners of the planet we see several problems with nfts the major one being the perception that it burns it's going to basically it's not very good for the environment but also that a lot of the content there probably shouldn't exist so we're going to allow you to burn your nfts and in doing so you're going to fund climate change because you're going to have to pay and we do this by by through climadow which is a dow that exists to support climate action through bonding carbon credits so we're going to build a simple web front end that allows you to go to the go to the website see the items in your wallet and pick the ones that you want to burn and when you burn them you will receive cleaner tokens where one cleaner token represents one ton of carbon but also we're going to give you a nice memorial to your recently demised nft so artwork is really important to our project so we've created a some high quality nfts based on a ghostly theme and they're based on six changeable elements uh five variables each which gives us a collection of fifteen thousand or so um nfts and with that i think it's probably a good time to show you a demo so over to you uh ricky thank you very much [Music] yes so this is going to be our web page where you can see we are going to have two buttons here which this button is going to remind an old nft we have set up uh a test an empty contract and in in openc so for this test demo we are going to remind these three nfts from coming from this right to the to the left and then after the transaction will go through the these nfts are going to diminish and the new ones are going to uh be created here apologies i cannot click on the sorry can you tell me how do i get through of this page because i cannot click on the web page here in uh from because of the zoom can you try dragging that down i think uh you may be able to go to drag down oh yeah apologies sorry about that one more thing before i would like to start with the button so first we i'm just going to reload the page where the metamask transaction will pop up and then after that is done i just would like to show you because anybody who is going to uh press this button and rim international and they are going to receive some uh klima tokens uh which uh going to get from now in this demo we are going to get it uh as an erc20 and this is going to be our uh klima address and you can see uh here that we don't have any acclimableness right now so just let's get to the burn uh now button we are going to get a screen and as you can see uh there is a loop with this mercy button when those three nfd pictures can be seen and just let's uh burn this one out first so right now metaphor metamask will pop up and then just let's click on the confirm once it's done so just let's now wait for the metamask transaction and after that uh i don't know i mean sometimes openc is a bit slow uh but uh after the transaction after a minute we should be able to see yes the transaction has been confirmed but let's just wait a bit and let just check whether the metamask has already got some clima because after the transaction we should be able to get some cleaner tokens so if i come back you can see that we actually own a very little amount of climate right now let's go to open c and see whether this yes it's already gone through so as you can see the edit button has been uh the nft has been destroyed and now we are getting the new nft uh here the memorial one and then in order to see uh the transaction going to here and see the updatement we actually have to uh reload the page and then as you can see now uh in the looping we can see that we are having the new nft here which also uh which states that this has been successful so let's remind one more thing just to see if so we can we can remain as many as possible but of course if you don't want your nft uh mean that you of course just click on the mercy button and uh it should be okay we have one more thing here uh because if you click in the enter vr section uh you can see actually that this uh we are implementing a metaverse section but this is very uh in the early stage now so uh there is a that this is the further development we are going to go through so i think that's all for now so this is uh for the demonstration uh i will give the stuff back to you paul and i will get back to the slides so thank you okay so just a quick dive into what we have built and how we built it um it's it's a simple um user interface that we are using morales behind the scenes um we have a single contract at the moment that will probably um in the future break into into smaller functions but um it orchestrates the whole process of burning the old one minting the new one but also um we'll go out to the uh to a sushi schwab at dx and claim some cleaner tokens that we need to give to the user i get to the um the person who's just burnt their um nft but this piece here um the sushi swap integration we haven't implemented yet so for the future um obviously we have to complete the ui and the contract um we need to integrate that dex um so that we can actually deliver real climate tokens we're going to add the full collection and as you saw briefly we're going to be continuing looking at 3d um options for the uni the metaverse in fact we have spoken to one of the other teams who were very interested in allowing us to burn our nfts within their miniverse longer term we see incentives is really important so we would like to see gamification and tokenomics develop but ideally it would be great if we can get you know community gainship engagement and and basically wider adoption and ownership of the project and that's really us so big thank you to the um f global team uh from all of us i think we've had a really enjoyable and sometimes stressful time and yeah thanks [Music] amazing well thank you so much for making a super cool demo and kind of walking us through everything works uh this was awesome to see and uh for the audience here there were a bunch of uh minor issues that came in yesterday around this may not be able to go work live but i'm glad that all of you made this that this happened and nothing went wrong so this is great and i hope to see this being used by more projects in the future so congrats thank you very much and all for the support as well absolutely all right i hope some of you get some sleep in in the time zones that i know of so uh congrats for presenting and with that we are ready for our second last demo so without further ado i'd like to welcome joan from shake shack hey guys how are you doing great feel free to uh demo whenever you're ready excellent so i'm gonna shut my screen okay great so yeah this is joanne and now calling from paris and we are team shake shock a multiplayer play tour in game inspired by super smash bros the team is formed by amazing game developers and blockchain developers with zoic gareth cool rodro and so how shake shock works um pretty much shake shake resembles uh super smash bros in the sense that we emulate uh battlefield but we also acknowledge how important it is for players to actually own a character and personalize the character to the level that they want so initially to play the game you'll need to mean a champion as an nft once you mean to the champion you add you you are dropped shake token from which you can buy in-game gears uh such as um a shield well sorry the light goes on sorry such as the shield uh weapons etc etc just to get extra points extra stats for your champion to fight then to get into a battle we make a escrow contract so you stake your shake token your in currency token and then once the battle is over the escrow is released to the winner and you are able to evolve your champion either leveling up to level 2 3 etc or evolving into a new civilization so um the tech stack the game has been built in using morales and we connected sorry with unity and we connected with morales api we also have deployed it in polygon uh contracts uh have been um uh created uh with the base of open zeppelin and then we storing everything uh using ipfs um so let's without further ado let's get into the demo so this is like the main page i'm gonna connect wallet first in this demo i've already minted my sorry windows i'm already minted my player and my armor gonna sign now great so this is like how it would look like uh pretty much you have each player will have their own nft that they will have their metadata which basically means um the stats for the game so health armor jump power speed i hope like the whole light it's not annoying at all speeds uh tokens with basically means it's like the in currency game and dash um then you obviously will be able to meet more players if you want you'll be able to level up so increase your stats and also evolve which basically means that initially you'll have like one civilization so for instance romans or greeks or persians and then in the future you'll be able to evolve this towards other civilizations if you like so pretty much similar to what game of empires is also doing whenever you are evolving your position here on the left side we can choose different armors so this is like armors that we have as nfts like all these gears are also nft so they are tradable as well and adds stats to the player metadata and then we have also at different weapons so once we have decided like no armor basic apple for instance we are now getting into the room settings as well as um the escrow contract so obviously to get in as i said like we need to um kind of like input the like we need to stake minimum uh currency tokens um shake in this case would be the in-game currency and then we can also create our own rooms in the future as well so just uh for for the sake of um yeah the demo i i just created a room this would be myself alone uh but pretty much the idea um is that you have your own um game here and that it's not yet multiplayer but we're working on this and then you'll be able to as you can see it's here like dash move around jump etc with your own life with your own life and kind of like attacking in with the different um yeah weapons etc etc um so that's for the game um once again is over as a set like you then we are you are released with the escrow as well as what we're gonna walk now through that are the next steps loots and so the idea with the loot is kind of like at the end of at the end of each match um you basically will be able to mint a loot which contains experience points shake shake coins as well as maybe gears uh google oh it's all uh already um the contracts are already prepared but we need to connect it to the front end we had the time enough time then later on we also want to create some uh like we want to help on the client creations and voting wars which basically means that in players of the game will be able to decide what civilizations we evolve as a game and then we they will be actually incentivized to either evolve or stay within their their or either stay within their own evolution and to keep improving their own player right so there's some sort of like politics involved and then further down the line as well like a secondary market for players to um sell an exchange so that would be all everything from my um presentation from our presentation so just please come join us on discord i've created a very creepy website shake shot that xyz and that you probably can see it uh somewhere already um so yeah please come join uh happy to have you on board as well thanks amazing thank you so much for making that demo and this is a cool game and such a nice way to think about that 3d version of doing pde so xyz awesome yeah thanks thanks a lot for your support as well absolutely all right and with that we are ready for our last demo so without further ado let's welcome jasper to talk about matter versus music yeah thanks for thanks for having me kartik uh really happy to be part of the finalist crew but want to say congratulations to all the hackers ton of amazing projects out there as part of build quest so for this project i guess i'm rounding out sort of the 3d experience category and i really wanted to think about how to create different types of metaverse experiences that are kind of non-traditional so not necessarily purely gaming or video or image based but actually how the metaverse can influence an industry like music and so i created this experiment called metaverse music and it allows users to enter songs and create spatial layouts uh of the different stems of tracks from artists uh from from their songs so i'll walk through kind of what it looks like from the artist's perspective as well as from the user perspective so first let's jump in imagine you're an artist and imagine you have the stems of the tracks of your song so imagine you have the drum track bass track vocal track etc what you can do is you can create a new song uh to create this metaverse music spatial audio experience so to create a song i have this little form here and you would first enter some of the basic data about your song so you put in uh let's say the song title and the song artist and actually quite often musicians will release uh the stems of their songs for part of like remix competition so i actually have a track from this band felix cartel they're having a competition right now and so we'll be using that for the demo today you put in a description like this is a great track uh and then what you would do next is you would upload the stems of the songs so you can select different types of instruments here let's say you wanted to upload the vocal track i would just go open this menu and i would for instance upload the vocal stem for the song and behind the scenes using a proxy server i've set up to upload things via pinata and we can see the cid of this track right here and you would do this for all the different tracks that you have so let's say we had a drum track as well i would upload that basically the same way so it would upload and then we get the cid of this audio file i'm not going to do that for all the tracks because that's not that exciting but i currently support up to seven stems for a song then you hit this create music experience button and what happens behind the scenes is that we're adding a new entry into a table and table end we can actually see that new uh row displayed and populated at the bottom here so that's how you would create an experience and now the best part is enjoying the experience so for for this we're going to enter the song nothing good comes easy by felix cartel and if you're on a computer you have access to a vr experience but if you're on your mobile device you can actually enter an ar experience as well which is a bit more fun but for today we're just going to do a vr experience so we can see the tracks that are laid out here i'm actually going to just start playing the song and it should be playing in the background a bit and we can see there's a vocal track a drum track a bass track keyboard track and a strings track i highly recommend testing this experience with speakers with headphones rather because that's where you'll have the most spatial effects i have some presets for arrangements on this side so you can imagine mono is actually putting all of the tracks in the center a stereo configuration would be kind of left and right and then you can do some fun other ones like surround sound where they go all the way 360 degrees around you and then other ones like for instance a stage that puts them off in the distance what's great about this is that a user has the ability to take different tracks and actually arrange them how they like so for example if i wanted to take let's say the keyboard track and move them somewhere else i can actually click and drag and move that let's say over here then i can do the same thing with the different tracks like let's say i want to move the strings maybe a little bit to this side and then if the vocals are for example too high in the mix we can do some fun stuff like take them and move them for instance all the way over here so now the vocals should be much stronger than the other tracks and if i leave them over there and we go back to the main mix you'll see that the the mix has changed a lot and i'm kind of exaggerating this for the demo but what's really great is you can arrange a track and then actually walk through it and experience different elements of it you could imagine this for instance musicians could recreate i'm just going to turn the music off here but musicians could recreate the setups they had for different concerts so you could experience what it's like for that concert you could even animate the movement of some of these tracks going forward you could also do great things like token gating the experience per track or even things like async music already allows you to buy the separate stems of songs so you could integrate some some collaboration with uh with a platform like async music as well this was a lot of fun to build and really just a prototype to show what kind of experiences you could possibly create as part of the metaverse that are a bit unconventional but had an amazing time thanks to the each global team all the judges sponsors and congrats to all the hackers again so thanks carter thanks everyone esper that was absolutely incredible um i mean we could see the spatial stuff on the vr side i can imagine will be even better and more granular if you were to do this on your phone and with that phone so this is this is just super cool i think just being able to do that for every track it's this is a really amazing experience so i hope you can actually make this self-serving for everybody to use it because this is going to be just a fun thing that we should try at every other place we do and any global events we do in the future so this is just great really appreciate it yeah thanks again absolutely so thank you so much and congrats to all the teams that just presented so all 10 of you here parcels clash of cards oliver's nifty guild shake shot shadow realms unft nf 3d bonfire and metaverse music uh so many incredible projects and this is just so cool to see uh what some of these cool things are and how you can also try them out a

i know there's a lot that i went through really quickly so uh we will share all these uh names and everything very soon in the next few hours on discord as well as on your showcase page and a quick note on price delivery this is the most common question we get after we announce all the winners so uh just as a comment we'll be connecting directly uh you directly with all the partners that we're working with for the delivery of the prizes some partners have different uh processes for how they deliver versus kind of how they would like to so there might be a different setup involved for every project price you have won so please be patient we'll be able to kind of connect with you with all of them in the next 10 or so days on top of that we'll be verifying everybody's code base so please make sure that if you still have that make sure that you still have your github repos uh public you may turn them private after the price delivery verification has happened but uh without verifying that you uh did indeed work on your project within the period of the hackathon you will not be able to receive any price on top of that price delivery is scheduled for the 27th this gives us enough time to check and correct anything and verify any information we need from any of you or any of our partners and for anybody who applied for a pool price and did not see their names in it and you would like to understand what happened there you have 48 hours from now to dispute any pool price additions which means that if there's an error in some form whether it didn't show up or you forgot to click the prize category on the submission form please notify us in the next 48 hours after that we will finalize that list and we will not be able to make any changes and this is the window we'll be operating it so once again congratulations to all 140 teams for kind of putting so much incredible work behind the scenes to make today happen as well as making the last kind of we really awesome in understanding what everybody's doing seeing being able to see everything from your feedback sessions to your showcase to your updates on discord it just made everything extremely wonderful so we're at the very tail end of concluding uh this hackathon and before we do that i want to quickly take a couple minutes and just say a few thank yous to everybody that made this happen behind the scenes and that's our judges our mentors our volunteers our speakers and our sponsors uh without kind of them being also in the back end of making everything work uh this would not just be an event that we're able to do easily this is close to 800 people behind the scenes involved in different capacities and without everybody's help these events just don't uh feel the same and you don't get to experience it the way you do this time around so i want to quickly start off by thanking our judges and mentors all these amazing people took up the time of their day and spent a lot of time anywhere from understanding what teams are doing giving them feedback to kind of helping with the judging process and talking to everybody and offering them more recommendations on how to take these projects better so thank you to all of our judges and mentors without your support this would not be possible i would also think so many of our amazing speakers who gave talks workshops throughout this two-week window uh whether it's for the summit or the workshops uh that we did to understand how certain technologies work behind the scenes thank you to all of you here um and without all this amazing thing content that you're making it easy for people to learn how these things work uh we would not see all these incredible hacks i want to quickly thank a lot of our volunteers to sort of help run a lot of these things behind the scenes especially as you look at judging where we're judging 500 people at the same time in a two-hour window without all these amazing people helping out and making sure everything is on track we just not be able to kind of wrap things up in such a small amount of time so thank you so much uh to all of you here and lastly when i think all of our partners who uh kind of constantly take the time out of their day to make sure that anybody who is trying to understand how to get more involved in this space or use any sdks or apis or protocols they get the help they need um being able to give feedback being able to unblock them being able to answer questions beyond how something works even if it's their own product or not their own product it's just incredibly helpful and we're super grateful that we have so many incredible people just hanging on our discord and just helping amazing developers and designers just explore more so thank you so much uh for everything that you've done to make this event successful and there's so many that i need more than one slide to kind of talk about them and then these are all amazing people that we love continuing to uh to work with and of course all of you hackers uh it is everything that you did that made this event possible all the time you put in all the time you put in and asking questions attending talks workshops uh being able to sort of see everything you've done and being able to see all the amazing work you're doing and giving us your time to be part of this event is what makes this event special so i'm super glad that we had so many excited people working on so many things that they're excited about as part of build quest and we hope to see more of you at our future events uh as well and lastly i want to give a quick shout out to the youth global team i want to say quickly thank you to kevin creed minnie anna moaz luke emily andrew jacob and liam who kind of do a lot of work behind the scenes to make this event run smoothly and uh and that the the experience that all of you experience as part of the attendee side is as polished and amazing and high quality as it can be so thank you so much to the global team for making another successful event happen all right that's a lot of thank yous but we had 10 teams present today and we call them our finalists so the question is like why do we do that what are they actually winning we never really talked about that and if you're attending any global hackathon for the first time you may not know this but we call everybody a finalist because we really don't want these events to be a competition we really want people to sort of try things and experiment and that's very much the goal of how we think about designing events and how we think about supporting everybody who's participating so we call them finals because we really don't want there to be a notion of first second third and when somebody is considered a finalist they are effectively our first place winner so all 10 of these teams have effectively come out uh first as part of bill quest and as part of their prize in being a finalist the youth global team will be giving every member that presented today on these these 10 teams uh 1 000 uh each delivered as usdc so congratulations to all of the amazing uh projects here uh and all ten of you and this is in addition to any other partner pricing they have one um and we'll be following up with the details and logistics of all of that with the same uh timeline which is late next week or actually the 27th of march to be very specific so congratulations everybody uh this is very much the conclusion of build quest it's been an incredible last two weeks uh working with all of you and uh before we go this would not be any global event if we don't talk about what's next so i am super excited to announce what is uh up with us in terms of the next thing we're doing and that is talking about how do we think about building new web3 native social networks uh you may have seen this around this is lens protocol it's going to be a new way to think about how we think about social connections and social graphs and just view social tools that are native to web3 and as part of this protocol we are doing our next hackathon that starts this friday called lf grow so we're super excited to see how people build in different ways of thinking about decentralized social networks and all the tools we can do to kind of get anywhere from the benefits of censorship resistance to being able to tap into the same social graph that we can have to be able to have composability around different user bases and merging all those experiences together in a more crypto native way so if you're interested in participating in the next hackathon please check out lf grow which starts in two days and goes for another 10 days and we want to really see cool creative things that come out of this thing so there's already a few hundred people participating and hope to see some of the build quest stackers also try to explore this event uh you can learn more about it by heading over to lfgrow.epglobal.com those are 20 prizes for this event we're also going to be giving swag for every hacker uh uh which is physical uh t-shirts and on top of that this is just a super new cool protocol that you get to sort of have a front row access to to understand what's possible understand how it's going and just really be one of the first users and developers behind this so uh please check left grow out and we hope to see a lot of you uh in the next hackathon as well and with that uh this concludes build quest i will sign off and hope you enjoy some low-fi beats so take care everybody and see you at lf grow this friday bye you
