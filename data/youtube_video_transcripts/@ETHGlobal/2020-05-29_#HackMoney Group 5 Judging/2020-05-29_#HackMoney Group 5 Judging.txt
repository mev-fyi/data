all right where can I get started welcome everybody on the live stream this is hack money judging demo day and I'm Karthik one of the cofounders of Youth Global so today is day 4 and group number 5 of our judging we've kind of spent the last four weeks working on a lot of dphi projects and we're spending this entire week on showcasing all the amazing things that have come out of the hackathon so for those of you who don't know on the live stream hack money isn't is a hackathon that's organized by eighth global and for the past four weeks we had over 350 hackers from 40 different countries and 15 different time zones work with us and their teammates to build really cool things in the realm of define we get people from all these amazing countries and an amazing set of over 40 mentors who helped out our our hackers and and the teams with anything from technical to product to marketing help and not only that we had an amazing set of companies in the d5 space who helped and put their time and resources into getting the teams to build on top of their SDKs and actually really take the the extension and the composability to the next level so let me say that again over the past four weeks we have over 350 developers work on building a lot of dphi projects and as of Sunday night I'm proud to announce that we had a hundred and eighteen d-flat projects that were submitted for this hackathon and that's absolutely incredible I mean I can comfortably say that in just these four weeks alone we've doubled the number of Bigfoot projects in this face and we're using the same time week to showcase what all these projects are doing and and how they work with other things in this ecosystem and we're excited to kind of kick off today with a lot of these demos so when I quickly go over the logistics of how the next two hours are going to work we have fourteen teams that are going to be presenting today and each team will have four minutes for a demo and then three minutes after their demo to address any questions or comments that the judges have so in grand total each team will be on for seven minutes and to make sure that we have all minimized Rab related issues over this call we pre-recorded a lot of these demos so the teams will be playing what they've recorded for these demos and then answering the questions after they've finished off the video so a quick overview of how this event was set up the rules and criteria for hack money was simple a team could have a maximum of 5 members but you could also work individually if you choose to do so and we saw a lot of projects that were done by individual hackers and the only thing they had to incorporate was their hack must have a defy primitive as part of their submission and their core use case and of course because this was a hackathon all code that was submitted for this she must have been written over the course of the four weeks at the hackathon ran so as a result everything you can see today was the outcome of four weeks of work and as we gonna go through these demos our judges will be rating and scoring these projects on these five different categories and these categories will be how technical an original project is and how practical it is to introduce this to a set of users and on top of that how the interface of that set project looks like for the end audience whether that's a UI or a UX abstraction or or something that abstracts this for developers if it's enough to and of course we have a general catch-all category called the wow factor that lets us offset anything that we've missed or not being able to address it and use those for previous categories and just to remind everybody that this is not a competition the hackers are here to learn and showcase what they've done ensure their excitement with everybody else including our judges and the judges are here to primarily give feedback in these projects and actually make sure that they can give them anywhere from advice to support on what they can do to take this to the next level not everybody is trying to become a business nor do we want them to do this in any form we want this to be a way for everybody to experiment with what's possible and we treat these events as playgrounds for what could be done with a lot of the technologies in this space and the goal is to make this a better place for the ecosystem so with that our schedule for today is that we have these 14 teams that will be going on one by one and presenting what they've done to our judges and doing all the hard work are our three judges who will be looking at each of these projects and in addressing any comments and giving them our feedback and I'd like to welcome now Linda Shea from scalar capital Anthony Susana from set protocol and I'll pour non-christian Christian from open to uh to join us as our judges and with that we will kick off our first demo for today and that is team oh me sorry oh so please welcome Oh me sorry oh to share their demo sharing the screen right okay kicking it off hi I'm Julie intrusive hi I'm William and we're here today to show you what we've made for heck money 2020 Oh me sorry for this hackathon we want to build a project that we could integrate with the Amigo network because I had just been privately released to the maintenance we thought be funds integrated with a basic game one that everyone loves like super mario with our integration you'll be able to earn aetherium and Bitcoin as you collect coins and finish levels in order to process all in-game transactions we're using the Oh music oh child Channel when the web page loads it waits for the Portus login upon which time a seed wallet since both aetherium and PBT see to a temporary wallet which controls all of the funds which place them to the user as the user collects coin and games aetherium is stored and then continuously cashed out on every child chain block similarly upon completing a level the user is rewarded with P BTC and creating a B sorry Oh we'd hope to demonstrate that theory M had potential as a layer to scaling solution for Bitcoin at the same time we'd hope to provide years is really fun and engaging as I mentioned it waits for you to log in on Portus and then funds are sent to a seed wallet as seen in the transaction hash as seen a few seconds ago the music yo network transaction hackers updated this indicates that the coins collected have been sent out in the form of material you can verify this by clicking on the transaction hash to navigate to the block Explorer now that the user has finished a level PBGC has also been sent as they may be seen by the new transaction hash below we can easily verify this by clicking again on the transaction hash to navigate to the block Explorer as highlighted the users balances are also reflected on screen for newbies [Music] oh it's really cool uh is the game playable right now yeah yeah it's live but there is a visual bug with the with the live version so we do recommend people downloaded with the new version very cool I'm excited to try it um just so I understand so in this game you're storing East but then players are rewarded and they actually catch out PPT C well actually you're being sent both it's just that we had thought there were certain limitations with the network in terms of how many transactions and wallet could send out per block it turns out I mean we spoke to a team member yesterday and you can get around them by storing all the transactions locally to build in further transactions but to get around that we had had every time you start up a game session it spawns an individual effort which we fund everything with that way a bunch of users can be on it once instead of just you know one being lot to our mean wallet gotcha yeah this is really really cool um how many levels do guys have well honestly it was a pretty pretty extensive clone it's really cool it's pretty much Mario maker but in in mario nes so there's like mods you can make your own maps and it's got the full super mario nes so i don't know you know i spent a lot more time probably playing it and I should have when I was testing oh that's so cool um how much how much each is someone earning per level or like right now not much like realistically this was meant more to be just we wanted to test out the network and see you know how integration was it was coming up on the mean yet and I don't know I thought it was as well interesting to demonstrate own like I'd said in the video a PB TC being used on it you know there are costs in terms of onboarding it you know wrapping the Bitcoin and then you know depositing it to the child chain but I'm I could see definitely some use cases in terms of just keeping money on the Chao Cheh if you're wanting to transact with a wrapped coin on the 30 okay that makes sense so it's so Demario I guess like there's some part of it that's not hosted on the blockchain right like well yeah well realistically the the user is sent essentially a 2003 F at the start and if they wanted to they can go into code and take the private key for that wallet so that's the local one we have spawned every time it's loaded and that's really not the botching part then because that's you know we're funding the wallet directly with that wallet but that could definitely be manipulated it's not you know definitely completely decentralized have you guys also thought of it like creating incentives for other people to fund the wallets I've thought in general about what you we could what the end goal you know really this is miss mostly a fun project there hadn't been any community projects that I know of in a music community at the time so you know beyond that it is I think really each advertisement money that way you could actually send out real a theory on that and do real benefits for playing game rather than just debts that money yeah and really that is that the direction you could go I think yeah that was really cool yeah it's the first time I've really seen a project when I may say go because I know that you mentioned that they recently released two main net how was it working with their dev tooling it was a bit of a pain at first but that was because we were trying to do stuff completely client side and nobody apparently a Tammy's ago was making anything with browser tools so they're their browser package just what didn't work for a week and we didn't really know what was going on so past that actually in the middle of the hackathon they fixed it for us which was really great and they completely updated all through documentation which would have been useful at the start but yeah yeah I think it's it's a lot easier now than it was and I also in the process yesterday I talked to one the devs and requested a sort of daisy chaining function that would allow you to take one transaction and then have it stored locally for you to build another one off of it which I mean I think would alleviate shoes we were talking about in terms of only being able to do one per block currently you have to call the previous transactions with a function and if it's not confirmed you can't call that so if you can do it locally it's it's it's a lot easier you could actually utilize the network realistically in terms of it being used for gaming there's no real reason to use it over stuff like X tie or Matich just because realistically you're not needing to secure many funds the idea is you're trying to use the consensus layer of aetherium with the visa go and if that's not a priority it's probably not a great idea to use the network awesome awesome boat great work guys yeah appreciate it thank you so much and that was an amazing kickoff for for the day and with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is team missing number they are having some AV issues so I'm gonna play their video instead so just stand by for this time what you kickoff [Music] hello I'm Leo this is my heart / futuristic urban core fragmented portals will be built to contain these futures futures in which we want things along the way many captures releases effective here is an architected coin pocket cup-like interface to capture this abstraction and patch once taken a trustless future it is titled missing though thoughtful missing number well-known little Pokemon games the meme was youth beautiful represent appearances of anomalous futures typed Maya keyboard interfaces problem areas online crypto commerce websites half exit cam risk for example tartlet central exchanges half-hour time during peak volatility times for example coinbase crypto based product launches sites our town during dollar drop releases for example aurora build an alternative futures market worth it underlining index key Devon website status codes helps with b2b month or site discoverability her futures factory contract makes futures signed by makers and built by takers these contracts have an expiry with an underlying index if connected to an Oracle client current implementation is connected to a prom chain link adapter that burrows various portals for their status code either one a gateway into that we're resilient static files can live to in total we're centralized processing like payment processing can take place the futures offers built up prepackaged silent messages which are posted too happy to be swarm because the signatures of the futures it is it once best interest poster proxy to get faster access to contracts making the swarm stronger other advantages isolated commerce sites can be accessed resilient Lee and can benefit collectively on portal application site owners can custom curate and design things from warehouse in the cloud as if they were using overload connecting a line Weber and Shopify p2 besides help unlock value for artists we're on chain incentives can reduce transacting risks the futures are first built us prepackaged silent messages which are posted to it's even a stock mode looking for feedback question was to try to implement something that connects various different applications and tool sets into something that is I think cohesive and in this scenario it's to represent itself as a futures market where you're looking at status codes for whether it's portals into different commerce sites or video game servers or possibly centralized exchanges and it's still a impartial implementation but the basic worked on code was for the cron job that accesses these status goes into the various different tool sets love some questions thank you so what kind of futures are possible with this so right now it's just a simple hey here's the value that I here's the contract and here's an expiry well someone take it and if so they do and once that expiry time it's processed then so it's yeah the value gets transferred out to whoever wins the the contract what I'm more excited about is creating straddled options where you can do it on uptime of a website while also doing it on some type of volume of something that this website is transacting whether it's for product drops or pure seeds etc okay so it's like basically futures on like any any boom exactly I was looking to be as most abstract as possible in the implementation so that anything could be built on top of it and right now it's just a pure linear status code that gets parsed through the chain link adapter gotcha that's really cool yeah I like that it's like pretty generalized so that a lot of people can create interesting things on this I maybe I missed this but like what exactly are using chain link for in the system so using chain link for the Oracle and the Oracle looks at the percentage of uptime for let's say a website at least at this point what chain link because it has the various different adapters you can add in any type of index that can be attitude this future so basically a feature has a value of the contract and then it has some underlying index that it's looking at and if that inequality has has been tripped then it gets to the person that won the contract oh I know questions for me just I like that you're using swarm I don't see too many projects using that these day so it's great that you chose to use that awesome well thanks leo and with that we will move over to our next demo and that is team token sets D composer and they have a video that they'll be playing but they'll also be talking over that and during that life so please welcome Andy and you can now begin yours creature hello there let me go hi let me start sure in my video okay so basically our the main purpose of our hackathon or has was to learn how to interact with smart contracts it was the first time with it something like this and for this by chatting with the other team we learned that they wanted to state certain sets or came up with my idea and they also show interesting news and one main thing that we needed to do is figure out the price of a token set in East and that so that's when we went ahead and started grading on smart contrast they're gonna her plane this video we just create a simple UI for for simplicity and we are pulling the address here from the API the public API from totem set so we take the address of that token I see the price is 242 and the component is us PC and series so by placing that in our tool we can get how many USPS he how many UTC tokens are inside this token set what's the price of each us PC in it and the price of that one token in it then you to check some other token the video I'm doing that now I'm gonna start pulling the price of a different token this time is going to be the BTC is 75 25 and just looking for it there is so this one is composed in each m PT c WB TC so then we paste that address it gets us the composition for that token which is point zero one 3w BTC and then point to delete and we get the price of one token in it which is 0.78 this is all getting pulled from unchain data we are the only thing that we rely on is on the prices for the for the tokens so we are using the other structure in Messina for using the other price Oracle because we are thinking that they go integrate this on their underside and so now this is basically a price huncle for each talking set what we can do with this mouse or e it doesn't have to be ally it can be any lending platform they can take this data and start taking deep sets as collateral for the platform and I think this is really good for poking search because now we can I can increase my letter action token sets and they also they ask us a stop order in a way because they they will rebalance into safer assets so that was the main idea that since token said pass this bill team then taking a loan on this asset who will be a safer way of getting long yeah any question yeah well it's really interesting on what happens during the rebalance or like after rebalance and is it still safe as a collateral like I guess aqua rebalance happened yeah so there are different reach levels and this is the same reason that have which is let's say a token and I don't remember which one Anthony will temporarily chime in there but there are some of them that will rebalance when the price of faithful would say beyond below to conduct in the something like last Tuesday that happened that the prices went down really fast that's the risk even if we try to rebound these tokens they might fall lower and that's like that's the same research holding it for example during the rebalance I've seen the tokens are still like you can feel pull the data also it is composed and it will give you a price but it is not stable and what I know is that token rebalances within 15 minutes at most that's what one of the engineers from talking said to me so I think it's like there are some risks involved but I think for the most part it will handle some of that risk take some of the risk of coding it away yeah it's awesome it's great to see you building on token sets I think this is really cool yeah I guess you were talking about the risk it's also that during a rebalance you can't sell a set so you wouldn't be able to liquidate yours your set so you'd be exposed to that risk but yeah I thought it was really cool using it as a price article for different tokens so that yeah that things like our baking integrate it it was yeah it was awesome I didn't have any questions but I thought it was really cool and useful like I like the transparency that it shows to people so I can actually see this being used by people so nice nice work yeah and and it was also so for my teammates and myself it was oddly for me it was the first time working with smart contrast so it took me a while to understand the change and how everything works and and that was the main what I take away from the occipital learning that's amazing nice work that's I mean that's impressive like first time yeah going for buying smart contacts is like quite challenging for like great job thanks a great job well thank you very much and congrats on your thing and I'm glad to hear that and hopefully you get to continue working on this yeah so thanks again yeah and now with that we are going to move on to our next team and we have a unique setup for this one this is our first as a global what we'll be doing is after the video ends we will be adding on another member from our community Julia who will be translating between our judges questions and and our team to make sure that there are no problems answering getting your questions answered as as the team they'll be presenting right now will primarily live in Portuguese so I just want to make sure that the team is ready can i I think I will be playing the video from my in so what I'll do is I'll just kick off that video from my side and then we'll move in the Q&A part with it looks like they're gonna do this thing themselves so with that you can get started and please welcome the team I'd been any money well it looks like we don't have audio either so I think you need to enable that zoom setting but what I'll do is I'll if you can end this thing all shared if we can get this communicated to the team topic raining I'll just make sure that we have all technical difficulties set aside and then we'll go into the Q&A then you Posada Anissa somebody took our digital say Slava hi guys you rather capivara Calder's and you will presentation on your application my name is daniel de falco full-stack my team Rodrigo Guevara who's taking the niala uses architecture a business and he has me Viera front-end what in your build I did the money the centralized a digital document validation solution that offers and trusted word identity data and give others complete control of tailored data who it works the persona creates your register and the chosen rich validator you verify the various velocity new off of your data the validator after chosen the best business strategy for its servers a provision returns the informations validated starts to persona the consumer define is what information and what it to access and the sentence request of permission to the persona how it works identity is my to contract man in this data persona data validators integrations and part was was a wallet I dated persona and the identity validation front-end to web application to interaction with the identity ecosystem stay now with the presentation of the application separate and to Mobley's identifier Sona identity validator first delegate in screen according to his tree screen for adding fields for validation and chose it the validator input fields for validate 30 teen screen that I received notification from consumers and approve or not to exits to access they can see my transactions on address can and finally I can back up my private key and mini Monica validator mod Lee login first the universe history as a validator as long as I am chose to validate my validation pending Zakhar I can access my panel and the requesters withdrawals from the validator with valor is made and finish thanks everyone bye see you so can we ask questions on translate so whatever you just ask I'm gonna just quickly translate to Portuguese and then I'm gonna be doing the back and forth okay yeah thanks for doing that um so I really like the problem that is being solved here I think this is a really important problem in the space that needs to be addressed my question is who are the data validators here can anyone sign out to be a validator so allegedly made a look at collage all problema que vocês escalating with important and she micro sistema yeah lagos agreed sabe king so who's valid a Doris coma croissants colitis and cocaine Watsonville dad or poor kid the introduces team another - Avanti she says that anybody can be a validator but validators are gonna have scores so any person can just simply set up and become a validator and start doing their job but the scores will let people know the kind of validators you have over time make sense thank you the idea of having validators and scores is actually brilliant I was just going to ask that of the question so I was supper question which is do you need multiple validators to validate your identity like or how does that work but the mancell distinction today is saying hey there's valid odorous man a key cover to support soon yellow pea Gupta are his paid to divide the duties muchos excuse me a partner can just repeat regarding multiple validators yeah do you need multiple validators to verify your identity okay citizen Z values Valley the doors skyress dodge also mention conservative cow epithelium Serio red appendage came by consumers in educating all right so she says that it's possible that you can have many validators to check one piece of data but in the end it will depend on who consumes the data so if the amount of validators required is going to be let's say X numbers then and it really depends more on the data being validator and the necessity comes from the data then you split Keiko had a mage I mean it depends on the degree of confidence of those that will consume the data thanks to you um hey great I really like the interface of the project just one question how are the reputation scores assigned and are there any cyber resistant mechanisms in there to make sure that people don't just you know assign good reputation scores to people for no reason Domingos to boston chi e everything with interests in sabe at least on the hypothesis valid odorous comic FA despotism a priest pomrenke Omo Valley dad or a secret agent Jim maitake civet are across Asia collusion Javaris valid odorous presenter particles on see boa tacky tokamak versus provenance media budget our patch she did not understand the Sybil part of the attack so what exactly is the question regarding the civil attack I might have translated not so nicely well since there's like a reputation system for providers how does the system prevent that from content from collusion as you said from people colluding to assign scores to people who don't you know good or bad actors no silly diehard oh god oh well doesn't qualify ski estimate I had Jimmy Mouskouri okay as she explains the validator really relies on the data consumer to get the credentials and the reputation so this data consumer in the end is going to be the one acting scores so if they validate something wrong their reputation is going to go lower because the data consumers are going to identify that so reputation grows as the the data consumer gives points for a proper validation splick a coherent speaker did he get things awesome thank you so much Rodrigo yes me man Daniella thanks again for hiking with us for the whole past four weeks and and this is one of those moments where just the amazing members in their community really kind of make this possible for us to interact and include everybody from anywhere in the world so Juliana thanks so much for doing this and we hope to actually continue this trend for a lot more other places around the world so thanks and with that we will move over to our next demo and that is team money 256 so I'd like to invite them to start sharing their demo I think you might be the muted or the audio is not coming okay there we go hey guys this is a money 256 and this is our hack money 2020 demo so the team consists of the Kendrick and my buddy Adrian so I was responsible for the solidity and more like the financial concepts or as my buddy agent was responsible for the JavaScript stuff like the build systems and anything JavaScript related so what we built this weekend is a priceless and I have to stress priceless contract for difference on a Dearing this means in the event of any disputes this will be all handled on you mas DVM so how it works is that users can if so the cfd actually tracks an underlying asset so for example gold we open anything that is a price if the user wants to longer use the user can mint a set amount of long and short tokens for a set amount of stable coins for example dial us DC or PETA if they would like to long the underline I can sound a short tokens and simply hold the long tokens if they would like to short the underline I can simply hold the short tokens and sell the long tokens so this price let's see if the contract process CFD component has as three key components a UI a dispute board any and the contracts we essentially designed a new CFD primitive that can operate optimistically in the absence of an Oracle this is this is constructed so that it would work in seamlessly with UNH TDM a dispute board will regularly check the events to regulate the validity of the CFD contract for example if the CFD contract has expired or this year the contract has exceeded some some price problems the UI is basically so that users can interact with the CFD contract easily so here's a little little demo we have so as you notice this is a very simple demo because we focus a lot of our engineering time on the the contracts and the logic so I can easily mince and long and short tokens if I like the mint them everything's running on a little good national right now it's the proof that everything looks and as you can see we now own 2.5 long and 2.5 short tokens we can also there's also a dispute board that regularly checks for listen to events and if there's an invalid event it was disputed and to make sure that the contract is in a valid state finally finally given before we also allow users to redeem long or short tokens before and after the CFDA contract it has expired for the collaterals assets for example who died we can convey long and short tokens back to die or USD CEO tell in the future we would like to right now the users get the long and short tokens but in the future we would like to kind of automatically automatically push them out to an automatic market maker like a balance or us or veto and we would like to build up a more robust regulation dispute bought to listen to more events and ensure that the CFD contract is in a valid state yeah thanks that's it any questions awesome work guys I had add a question on link so currently it's a CFD on what asset so right now it's basically tracking the price of died I know that having back and dived eyes a bit and intuitive so we allow for other assets at USC see all Teta so if diet loses its packet all for example it goes below above $1 you can basically sell your short along tokens to kind of capitalize on the on the Delta so right now like who sets the who sucks like what those assets are right now it's done manually but you could definitely build a token tilde sort of like what you ma does like this is all we've drawn a lot of inspiration from from you MA except that instead of having a expiring multi-party creator we have a priceless CFD contract cool yeah this is really cool I really like what you guys have built what do you envision being like some of the more popular first use cases for this well anything personally I would like to X I'm not from America from Australia so I like an easier access to the American market so for me it would be American options American futures personally speaking but I think they'll be a big market for maybe China or India or markets a little bit more there are only accessible to the big players this kinda enables like fractionalized ownership as well yeah yeah really cool project guys you mentioned that you imagine these going into poor balance of pools did you think about how these could work with sets as well on token sets because these tokens have an expiry date so the ideal situation is that we kind of put them into a balance of pool and then we can slowly trends so you started so we have we would ideally self to two cfdv tokens like one that expires in May and one expires in June and so Dean if we're in May we would have like a sorry for and April we would have 100% May and 0% June expiring tokens as the time slowly progresses we would like to kind of swap out the tokens in the balance of pool to kind of kind of create this non-expiring CFD token if that makes sense yeah but we haven't thought much about putting them in tokens that simply because balance that kind of enables that that gradual gradual change around yeah it definitely makes sense awesome thank you so much Adrian Kendrick Congrats on that's missing I can hope you continue working on this so with that we would like to welcome our next mo and that is team celebrity features and I'll be the one playing this video and they will be able to answer any questions after I'm presenting on behalf of celebrity futures with my colleague Brian Campbell hi everyone we have another teammate Vignesh who is unable to join because of time differences so let's jump right into it we wanted to create a marketplace for users to invest in the future potential of high influence individuals starting with musicians we want to do this in a global and permissionless fashion so anyone can participate at their convenience so what if you could place a bet on Drake before it became the star yesterday what if you could bet against Drake or even back if they would take taka before they went viral with our app you can invest in a rising act before they get signed to a major label the problem today is that as a curator there's no really good way for me to capitalize on the upside of a career or an artist that I've noticed thoroughly off so with celebrity future is we've created a way to bet four against an artist popularity score and their future growth potential we mean it so you can capture their future upside by guessing correctly on whether or not gonna be more or less popular today then they will be next month we took spotify popularity score a score between 0 to 100 and rounded that on chain using chain link and we use this to make a synthetic apps at using goombah we started with Travis Scott and created a synthetic asset called Travis we use the element because of token sponsors without people too short the asset price is synthetic assets which mitigate Oracle Trust permissionless creation and secondary markets such as unit swap for secondary trading we're able to get a local application running and we created that synthetic asset travis to be able to show how this works we made a front-end to do so that limit the amount of crypto knowledge required to use our application I'm gonna pass it over to Bryan so you can show you guys how it works alright guys let's take a look at the app here so we have the up consists of two pages we have a home page where we can scroll through different artists search for artists and we've got three calls to action at the bottom and we have a portfolio page where we can manage our assets so if you don't have is the first time coming to the page you're gonna either have to create shares or buy new shares so if we're creating them what we're doing is we have to provide a certain number of shares and agree to a certain amount of dye and this is going to send the dye to an expiring multi-party contract made by blue month and we have to include both the value of the shares plus the value of the collateral in case we've been wrong on this particular artist so here I'm creating the shares themselves and then we're given an option to allow our shares to be pulled into an exchange exchange tool and that would allow us to pair buyers and sellers so that's what's happening in this conformation great and so from here on you have the other option of just buying straight away so if you buy you're going to buy the shares which were just created buying the shares you just have to specify a certain number and this goes to that swap swap tool and it allows the swap tool to access my dye and then and then it will do a second transaction to actually make the swap great so once this fish is up we'll take a look at the portfolio and this is where we can manage our assets again we see up at the top our port value portfolio value over time and our history different things that we've bought in the past our value and shares that we've created our bond comes here and we see a lot of the same functionality from the first page can be got to from the portfolio page pretty easily we can also manage our collateral and deposit extra collateral if our if we need to or withdraw if our that is going very well and if we do decide to withdraw we need to wait for the liveness period we have to be approved for this withdrawal from the uma contract and that's why we have we have to request and then withdraw so that's great guys that's that's it that's the web app so I'm very happy to share thanks for sharing that Brian so as you guys could tell there's a lot going on here we had a couple issues mainly was just getting the Oracle to actually sync with the application uma itself was a pretty complicated product so there was some stuff that we had to abstract away but at the end of the day the component of us being able to do this on Shane was something really fascinating we're excited to go with it more so thank you thank money for having us and I hope you guys enjoyed our products this is really exciting I had a question maybe I didn't understand this correctly but when you buy the shares you're going long the long the person and like when you sell it you're learning short yeah so when you buy the shares are going long when you're creating shares are going short selling is just really a way to cash in so I'm teaming against the expiring multi-party contract okay okay so creating is like like going short and fine cool yeah I love this I think that like it's inevitable that something like this becomes really popular and I can totally imagine people having like their own little portfolio of musicians that are interested early on I guess like and I've actually been thinking about this a lot like how people could go like short like celebrity tokens I guess like what happens with the whole like someone's short and now they're incentivized to like see the celebrity fail or something like this like how does that how do you envision that playing out though so do you mean if a celebrity is able to tank their own celebrity status essentially that or just other people who are now incentivized to see oh wow yeah so like how do you envision that playing up I mean I think it's possible it would only really be an issue if you had a high enough market cap for this particular coin and whereas the money is gonna be spread out about not just Travis Scott right it would be a number of celebrities it would only be high high-profile celebrities who could who can have an issue with this like you could imagine a trump coin or something like this you know we'd have a lot of volume there could be an issue with him purposefully dropping himself in popularity too short all the coins but aside from kind of extreme cases I'd be happy to take that into account one if one and if this grows yeah and I think to add on side real quick we really envision this for up-and-coming artists so obviously Travis was great because you need sellers to make these markets efficient and on the other side of things we are envisioning this being markets for you know rising artists with a hundred thousand monthly listeners and in that scenario we don't think that there would be too many malicious actors hopefully yeah make sounds cool this is so cool I'm really excited I hope you guys continue working on this thank you thank you much love padding yes east of canceled culture this is interesting so what that will welcome our next team on onto the demo and he's welcome Kryptonian hello this is Kryptonian and we built a log jam page the diamond trade system actually the requirements for this project is from the real people in diamond industry so I'm happy to present my our project to understand why we built this trade system you should understand that you should understand that traditional system in time and industry that there's a broker as an intermediary between wholesalers and retailers and but broker have caused so many problems like a fraud he's been especially fraud last year there was 30 million the Diamont fault because a broker running off with diamonds and then a high commission fees and slow transaction and also other problems many problems so we want to replace broker with a blockchain system and then the transparency that blockchain wings into the system can solve many problems in traditional assistant but another problems coming up usually in traditional system we tell us don't need any money to rent diamonds from wholesalers because the brokers have established a trust or confidence between them so wholesalers borrows the diamonds to retailers because they trust brokers so and but we replace the broker with blockchain the retailer's kind of need money - I mean that retailers should have money to borrow of diamonds from wholesalers and then that's kind of the liquidity problem that retailers have so we kind of we built a crowdfunding system and are you I owe you scheme system to cover the problems that blockchain brings into this is the diamond trade [Music] yeah but and so the investors deposit their money into the crown which one exists them and we tell us the borrow the money from crowdfunding system every time that diamond trade happens and then the crowdfunding system is in need some kind of stability because if there was not enough money in crowdfunding system some diamond trade should I mean it's gonna not happen so we are gonna have our kind of the tax system in every trade to kind of to make a fund result in the system that's the thing that we built for the hack money thank you guys thanks for the presentation and I didn't realize that was actually how it worked with retailers and does this also extend to beyond the diamond business or like I guess like are you specifically focusing on diamonds that diamond is one of the one of the truly that this kind of trade system can adopt and but other than diamonds we can extend it to other Jolie's and and like anybody you're envisioning can put money into the conferences because usually this broker take out the 5% of a 5% of diamond trade as commissioner P so we can make kind of interest rate for investors in funding system and then like how do the investors know that the retailer is legit and someone that they can blame to the market public market or investors or tell us to look at what kind of diamonds is in a did this is really cool yeah I can imagine this being extended to other kind of use cases to crowdfund for for other things that have similar problems to the diamond trade have you thought of any other industries that you'd like to apply this to not yet but I think that we make a kind of NFC for diamonds so if there is any industry with NFC things I think we can extend it out rate system to them cool awesome this is really interesting for the diamonds like physically do you need some kind of unique identifier for them or how does that work I'm sorry I didn't catch you like do you need some kind of way to uniquely identify the diamonds or like in diamonds you can you can there's that some some strings in graded in that environment so you can identify you can identify the unique in itself Diamont cosmic sense they have some ABS rear part now we're able to hear the answer yes yes yeah I don't know that there's so much thank you but great so with this this our halfway point of our demos and we're going to be taking a five minute break so with that we'll let our judges take a quick break and come up and stretch and we'll come back in four minutes you okay we are and would you mind just increasing the volume GRC 20 tokens common you get let's want more want open now the innovation and ERC 20 contract which is from the open zeppelin library and then we implement the core functionality in want pool which accesses a Venus walk goal to reduce the fees of doing exchanges we built this using multi baths wheel were cast curved grid and we use the free tier of our multi bath product to speed our development and then built a front end using huge a s so let me show you what that looks like you can see the balance I have in my account of want tokens and the number of total tokens in the pool and how much I need to deposit in order to redeem it so if I want to deposit that our X token I will get point zero two zero want openness in exchange so what cause it's something that there are a little less up and I'll get 4.5 pins in exchange let me deposit I confirm the transaction great and I'll have some more one token don't me quickly show you how that interacts with multi guys we have the wand contract loaded here and if I wanted to do something like the concept tokens I can see the rest it the I call that we would make here and so go ahead and redeem some token it's a redeem one and then it's below again and excellent I got a die-in return it's not really a useful thing yet it's more of a fun project so maybe we can see if there's some utility in it see if we can support some more tokens and have some fun thank you for watching this is a really interesting I will question how do you decide like I guess like if I put down one diet how do I know this each person have their own wand contractor how does that work there's one want contract do you want to go ahead and win yeah sure so the idea is we have a central want contract and then it acts like a public pool of other tokens which people can just put other tokens in and then get one tokens out based on the rarity of the token in the public pools okay cool all right this is this is cool I think it's really fun and I could totally see people using this just like kind of Dana fiying it a little bit so I might've missed that how do you determine which token is actually given out to the user like is it random or like I like I don't really understand that part yeah it's it's random or sort of pseudo random it's based on the block number and time stamp and so yeah theoretically a miner could game it but no yeah I thought it was really cool I think you know maybe in some implementation because you can see which tokens are currently in the pool and as like you put in a 1 token randomize what you get do you have more of a chance of getting a token if it has more of a share of the pool than the other ones yeah and yeah exactly that's the point of being like random inside a pole it's like if you have more something more of something in a pool then there's a higher chance that you would happen but if something if something is there's a lot of something in the pool then of course it would not have a large value right so well yeah we don't we don't we don't balance for like to get you an even random across the different types of tokens it's it is based on the is it's the total supply yeah yeah that's that's all saying like the one tokens could go up in value themselves based on what's in the pool like if there's only stable coins in the pool then there might be worth less than if there was a 0x token or something that's worth more than a dollar for example in the pool yes exactly yeah that would be cool yeah I was just thinking of ideas in my head huh but yeah good job guys thank you thank you so much climbing team and awesome bowtie thanks great so with that we are going to call up our next team and that is eath kevin durand for this one we will be playing and a cat oh not just a bowtie we got a cat too and for this one will be playing the video on our end and uh there you go that's awesome so we'll be screaming off the a traveller video from our site and I'll welcome the rest of the team to resume call try and take it away I guess I wonder share or break for the hack money in hackathon it's called hit cap injured and they'd be a simple we wanted to build tool for communities to start teaching on how to use a three room and but a better way than with some gamification so we decided to build what we needed that is a scavenger hotend and right now what we build was just an API so for extreme communities can like give rewards to to their participants by searching who completed some tasks so how it works is that you circle to the website dashboard they input the address and the API is going to return true for all the challenges that had been complete for example one choice can be like create pretty cryptic illy or by taxi or means from a compound I create a pod stuff like that so right now what we created was only the API so it works like this the API just caused I mean that the Dutch word just called the API in returns true or false depending on if the user has access or have created this first of all this others only has two keys I'm going to try my address I don't have crypto key this over here but I have got some Chinese card activity X infinities I have used compound and idea is that if you complete all the tasks you are going to receive some some reward like I'm gonna ski or something like that right now it's made with using go we wanted to learn a new back-end server so we decided to start learning go and use code theory only for in order to read the state of publishing and see the logs to which people has completed the task and we are using Heroku for that deployment the future work is deploying the dashboard right now like I said we only have that API and Oracle and I mean the server that it's deployed but that is to actually have a dashboard where people can see it more friendly and add support to more tasks or tokens so for example adding support to the central and or click the Box I'll inspect that that's real close and Renaud is live you can see here on is the demo achievement chequered Heroku app comm just input your address and you're going to see like the current status of your application the team is greasing Spinoza Oscar president and robber mojit and we are part of the underverse community so we're pretty much feeling this tour - for our communities and we work a lot with coffee and stuff and we wanted like a small break so we decided to build something for our community thank you this sorry oh can connect can we ask questions yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah okay okay oh yeah this is so creative um what we're so what is the initial challenges that people can like how does it like what does it mean for me to have completed a challenge I guess so right now what we do is actually just read the blockchain and see if you have currently tokens or if you had in the past so that we actually also reviewed the logs and we wanted to do something different for this hackathon like I said we usually just work with the smart contracts parties we wanted to feel like that infrastructure and we really got surprised by how fast it went we go so if you saw the video it took less than a second to retrieve like all the information and we read the logs of like six how did you do that how did you like read so much data so quickly and you said you seen goroutines and threats okay yeah I think okay this is cool I've seen similar projects pop up recently like rabbit hole I don't know if you've seen that that was really cool so I'm really liking this kind of trend of gamifying things getting people to do things to get them more involved in these projects and then giving them a reward for it so yeah I just wanted to say I thought it was really really cool and you know I hope you guys continue on this yeah for sure like I said we are building this for small scavenger hunt for our community so we want to finish soon yeah I really like what you've built and I could see people using this for their own communities to make it more engaging and gamifying it um so people enter the address and then but they don't do they necessarily have to prove that they're the owners of the address or do you just continue enter like any address right now well if you put any address then you're just going to receive I mean the address is going to receive the price so if it's not yours the price is going to the other person thank you so much Christian I think one of the coolest things about this was that especially that you want to use yourselves or even better because you can continue to build and make them a lot better so thanks again and with that we'll move on to our next team and that is team and project sunset supreme so please welcome the car great dream on our zoom hello ok can we share a video go for it ok can we win see ok here we go hello and welcome to sunset supreme spreadsheet blockchain machine work group of engineers and interns from curve Creek a blockchain middleware company in Tokyo Japan we spend a lot of our time in the weeds of solidity and go aetherium but we don't actually know a lot about define for this akka thought we wanted to see how we could make D Phi accessible for anyone to hack on when it comes to numbers and calculations what is the lowest common denominator a spreadsheet we present sunset supreme the spreadsheet defy UI but really why spreadsheet well if we consider the number of blocks and engineers globally it's about seven thousand if we think about the number of software engineers we get all the way up to 26 million but spreadsheet users that's close to a billion we wanted to make it as easy as using a formula in a spreadsheet so that anybody can hack on defy we start with a Google spreadsheet and the etherion blockchain and on the etherion block chain one or more defy smart contracts how do we put these two together what we wrote is a Google Apps Script blockchain plugin it's basically JavaScript program that connects to our multi bath blockchain middleware via REST API which then talks to the defy smart contracts our Apps Script blockchain plugin is about 1,500 lines of Apps Script or Java Script code with a full CI CD test suite integrated with github actions and a demo spreadsheet showcasing interesting insights from a few D Phi projects this is what we built demo time for smooth spreadsheet style defy and then I'm software engineer here at curve grid so this is our demo spreadsheet it's view only so if you'd like to modify it please go file make a copy custom formulas that allow you to do different things on the blockchain they all start with the prefix MB and they have integrated documentation as we pass in a transaction hash and we get back the results of that we also have a helper function up here if you click on multi bass refresh current cell here's an example from the hack money public lock where we're retrieving the total supply this is all coming back from the blockchain in real time we can have a single value that's returned and we can even have multiple values what we get back is a one-dimensional array we can also compose an unsigned transaction this gives us the ability to paste this in together what we've actually got here is kind of a complete dashboard for the whole Ave lending pool core setup not only can we look at the current values but we can also look at the historical values as well the compound see either contract we were able to compose this visualization of the event activity on the compound ether smart contracts because you can't be the best if you don't test hi my name is Dan and Kim I'm a software engineer at Kirk great I'm sure that you guys really enjoy this spreadsheet plugin a while ago I have the team to build a testing environment using CI workflow let me show you this is the testing environment and pushing the ladies code to the Apps Script and a code of Apps Script API and then our spreadsheet plug-in called API of multi baths write the data on a spreadsheet in a written builder and the checking it's a true or false here's that actual workflow results solves our bills observed success detail in one case and then here is the real demo and pushing the ladies code to the Apps Script and then running tasks the tester will be running on the actual app script and result success yay sunset Supreme spreadsheet blockchain machine check us out on github this is amazing this is this is so cool I was watching the entire thing thinking uh for our api's we currently like have to write a bunch of random scripts but like something like this is just so helpful for any project that's that's like writing api's does it also have the ability to listen for events it does yep so down here we've got for example events that come back from you know this is again a public lock like hack money contract so yeah there and these are coming back live from the blockchain Wow I'm I'm so impressed it was mind-blowing Thanks yeah this is super impressive I really liked the demo as well that was quite funny but yeah overall i mean you sold it right there's a billion spreadsheet users in the world and if we can get them using you know a spreadsheet interface for four defy that that's awesome so yeah i I'm pretty blown away as well by um by what you've built yeah just adding onto that I think this is really great and I hope you guys continue working on this it's just makes the whole space a lot more accessible to people and I could also see just a lot more interesting things being built as a result of this so really great working presentation great thank you thank you Jeff in the corporate dream I think this is the first demo we're seeing or somebody's proud to show their tests so thanks again for this and actually want to give a special shout out to uh to Jeff and the rest of the crooked dream because they've been amazing help to the rest of our hacker groups for for helping out with a lot of technical problems throughout the past four weeks so they've been an amazing mentor Anna hacker at the same time and I'm so glad to see it at this awesome demo and it's just great so huh with that I want to call up our next project and that is project compose dot Phi so uh I'll let them kick off by sharing their demo we are the money level team I'm bloom and sunny I made the front end and bring you I my name is Daniel Fernandez I'm a div a cane and integrations with a small conference so what it's composed of five it's a visual tool where anyone can manually connect the defy labels and compose more complex defying operations so who is this for well is it for teachers students developer testers anyone who wants you to test the power of defy compose ability to teach learn play or just use it how does it work well it's very easy you basically grab an element and connect with other element elements get a new graph that you can deploy and execute let me show you an example to see how it works let's run let's create a graph here you compose out five in my net correctly so for example I will start adding an element either input element we start with ether sprite then let's add a splitter for example we can speed those ethers and send one part let's send it to for example unit swap right and listen the other part of ethers also to you swap but let's buy us DC now no yes so one part goes to uni shop to buy diagur one of two when you shop to buy you SEC then we won at least us DC with fuel for example to buy more dye now we have we can see that we have died here and I hear and we can send both died this one and this one to another element such as fuel this time to buy some s USD right and then we can send that as USD to an address so we can see how we compose all the instruments in a graph you know and now we can deploy this graph if you play it to my net right I'm going to make sure this goes fast okay let me go so you consider the transactions deploying and the graph is being created see here in magnet okay well it's finished I will continue with the presentation so how we made this alright for each different instrument we create a smart content and also and chain to interact with it and the graph that is deployed is such a mathematics malcontent that use those instruments they can connect to the blockchain should read and write we can scale this to any D Phi operation that we want almost any deformation because because the way we architect the operation we abstract in a way that is a black box that receives asset and return assets so we can connect anything with anything we build up we react well free and using some visual libraries what are we not doing the future with this where we control more define instrument and asset so people can play with it and some documentation on each instrument so for example a student can understand or a nudey if ideal developer can accept how it works and leave on magnet and you can test it in compost at 5 let's see if the transaction finished the transaction is still pending so I'm gonna pause the video and we'll return when it finished yes the network is heavy loaded these days yep alright and the transaction was successfully mine so we can see that the contract was created the 7ba and our say directly to the you ready with the contract we'll just load the address gets the address and it loads the whole smart content the whole graph from the smart contract if we refresh here we can see that it does the same you know lost cause I'm doing it it's all in Maine it right I know I'm going to execute this drought I'm gonna send some eaters and get some as USD but I don't have any so for example it's saying some 0.001 ethers here okay and I'm gonna get some USD in my address we can see that my current account doesn't calcaneus USD and a copy oh you have this exit here now I'm going to execute the graph to get some with all this complex arbitrage it's done as you see to my account it's ready to execute and I executed let's see if we can speed up feed there we go all right here we go transaction is being executed I think let's see okay I think it was confirm already okay that was pretty fast not yet see the transaction oh no because metamer says it was sexy but not oh yeah I finished sorry yeah we can see here that it finished sorry further was very fast faster and we expected and it did executed all the instruments and I should see there we go I got something CSD idea so it was a quite complex graph not not quite there are more complex one let me show you some other that we made also very fast I hope we have some time we have things that are which crazy like this this is you can't in here is a graphical a fresh swab you know if you use acid 0 xq u n-- swab drops it it returns everything to the flower shop so yeah you can get as complex as us as you want so right that's all for us we hope you like it trading composite fight I've a question so if you deployed a graph can I use that graph yeah yeah you can use it anyone can you certainly okay you can use it as defy is not also like a euro snaps yeah that's that's so cool I think it makes it really accessible for someone who doesn't know how to code to like go ahead and create these really complex financial instruments so it's so exciting no thanks this is just making it yeah easier for everyday people to get more involved with DES fire without aiming to code up things these drag and drop tools are awesome great work guys thank you thank you yeah same situation I I love this and this is actually something like I would send people when they're curious about defy and want to like learn more and experiment like I just loved it it's visual and accessible for people so like I really hope you continue working on this thing for sure thank you so much and with that I was well I just want to make a comment that a majority of the projects that have presented today and throughout this week are actually live on maintenance so that is an amazing to just remind everybody of that I you are in a position to just try them out live with a big asterisk though but just their life and now with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is team meadow TX so I know they've already started the screen share I'll let them take away and kick off the video is it basically new idea the first one if the method election system that a low contrast receiver to work with any method confident posture including GSM and any which is in contrast with current solution that requires a constructive are called trusted for water or having a central authority mechanism to a break in this demo will present the user is in full control which matters connection I'm going to set my name of the demo and then I will use yes so I put my name and I come here near what's happening is that the application is checking if me as a user I've already approved the open GSN you know it he says that no then they 387 one type of message that let me approve GSN thanks I have the signature I don't need to transaction I can pass it as part of a special method connection that it goes through this so here I look who I approved it and then my name is yeah now that was the first ID and the nice thing about this is that in term of of contract it's very similar to how you will implement not all GSM method is evil the main difference is that it asks the register whether the release itself is already in the deploy that don't require any specific methods connection system it doesn't need to be complex again now the second idea I want to present is this time something specific - she is an implement his paymaster that will use the eye-popping that connects the Des Moines see it before was using a p8l given by the cheese here in CF ten died there and basically yeah I will deform what this time what will happen is that my petition is checking whether a famous to has about football over beta any of us do I rely on diameter mechanism that we meet time message but again I don't election year I combine it into the alcohol that the mechanism Jason that'll add extra data with an atomic then I make sure the methyl function will do is make an easy answer but miss and mechanism to the hello it takes my die and residence here I spent these mechanism you use this work to transfer the diet to pay that's physically thank you for watching you um thank you for sending that I I really like the interface I feel like I mean I had some audio problems so I feel like I don't quite fully understand exactly there was a some issues all when I was recording but yeah I mean solution the main one I mean the one I had more proud of is basically the beginning that know which method collection they can additionally decide which system and with my solution cool yeah I like that you're you're giving people more like accessibility to choosing and yeah I like the interface I thought it was like pretty nice yeah it was really cool to see it like tattoos that you could spend your die to the free eat oh yeah yes you're a dream in the video it's the Uni stripe actually used to do that I mean I mock it only on on the test net I launched I do not have time to actually I was making a game before but then ambitious and then I was looking at how to improve the user experience and then yeah this was great giving users the ability to pay transaction fees you know in any in things that other Neath is always good so yeah great job in the project thank you awesome thank you so much running and with that we'll move on to our next demo and as a reminder we only have two more teams to go so please welcome our second last team Kahoot and they're gonna show off their quiz app oh okay I will show you the hey guys we have enough to play Kahoot challenges with prices distributed via theorem so as a first step I entered my private key and then I create challenge from Cahoon so this is the Kahoot URL and for that taku challenge I should create a crypto space I said initial bet and now what's wait for crypto space to be created every participant will put the same bed and then we will get this also looks like space is created now I'll share with volume so after space creation transaction is mind what you would be able to join the script of space let's wait for him as you can see we are using a theorem named system so I don't have to type my name in drop just appears here are you joining waiting when what do you do oh I can see ya oh and also let's wait for Anna to journals the price gets bigger oh I can see her already now let's play yeah so I enter much anything the same as on contract and actually if someone else places plays this challenge with a different name we just distribute prices evenly so it's hard to cheat and so while we're playing button could you tell about how this thing is built from this perspective we deploy this month so say it is my country when you play okay yeah but we created and deployed a smart concept that makes a place to chain in Krakow and request our back-end proxy which goes to which was to be and it's we never changed only interacts with contract people can yeah and we made some beauty so let's yeah last question for under and let's see who wins ok it looks like fun I have lost and looks like having one so Ivan gets price and you can adjust with the game engines it like why with you next week you hear this hey guys hey that was a really interesting idea I like like but do you explain it while thank you game so you're gonna lose all the eat and I'm gonna get just she's the random flowers um so each person just takes the same amount or can they stake different amounts and just in the investigation they just bed the equal amount just for simplicity I was wondering can you also like generalize this to other games like poker for example yeah sure it's like the only thing to do is to to make our proxy to parse the JSON IP to work better with Oracle and that's all we just we thought about to make a new chip chess yeah just just but then we just trade in the Kahoot yeah we were looking for games of Hope on eBay yeah not so much is this live where I can try using this now it's on Rob's turn and we have to send you an up yeah this fight um yeah I I think it was really cool I did something I would use which friends I could totally see getting a group together to play this I really like that use unis and make it more accessible to people and yeah like I I thought it was awesome thank you thank you yeah yeah the end ans support was great and I like how you're kind of merging the web to and web 3 worlds by building this app so yeah great job guys thank you thanks awesome thank you so much Kahoot and with that we are going to move on to our last presentation of the day and this is a project that is making a defy plugin for vs code and the project is appropriately titled DFS support for the yes code so please welcome Eric and let you share your video introducing defy language support for vs code my name is Eric Lau and this is my project submission for hack money 2020 the problem that exists today is that ideas provide generic support for programming languages and libraries however they don't provide any etherium domain-specific knowledge outside of solidity developers typically need to use external tools to look up things such as the interior matrices DNS names token addresses contract information and so on to solve this problem I wrote a vs code extension for defy support when writing no js' applications this gives you life unchained data live market data as well as programming model support for common if they are md5 scenarios let's take a look the extension is available on the vs code marketplace by searching for aetherium define first let's look at it Nerium addresses addresses private keys and ENS names are all detected in your source code above each address and private key are linked style you can click on to bring you to the ether scan page for maintenance and test nets private is resolved to the public key so that you can verify that the address matches with what you're expecting diagnostic warnings are shown for checksums an error is shown if an address fails checksum or if an address is not a checksum address you can quick fix to convert it to a checksum address you can hover over a theory imagines to see the live information for both the ether balance as well as tokens also notice the live market data showing the price of the tokens as well as the total value next let's look at ENS names there's two a resolution for ENS names both from the address to the UN s name or from ENS name to the address you can automatically convert from one to the other now let's look at some defy programming examples press control space to do code completion where you have options to insert various defined snippets for talking addresses a Eunice portrayed is as simple as choosing the snippet then doing code completion for the tokens that you want notice the live market data hover over a token address for its live data as well now let's see how this house will be using the pea tokens SDK insert the snippet paste the private key then copy the public address shown now you can insert a snippet for generating a PBGC deposit address to token dice Bitcoin unnethe Irian and paste the public address that you copied now let's move on to how this was made this solution uses the language server protocol this is the industry standard for providing language features in text editors and I des the extension implements both a language server and a language client that communicates with each other through this protocol this allows the solution to be easily extendable to any other IDE for life on chain data the solution juices in furor as the web 3 provider and ember data for live market data for aetherium actresses and tokens the next steps for this project are to support local development block chains such as ganesh so that you can get live data for addresses on your local chain deeper programming model support such as contract interactions and other defied SDKs and finally to get this into the hands of developers to get feedback on it and to make it as useful as possible for writing if they're empty file applications thank you for your time I love it
