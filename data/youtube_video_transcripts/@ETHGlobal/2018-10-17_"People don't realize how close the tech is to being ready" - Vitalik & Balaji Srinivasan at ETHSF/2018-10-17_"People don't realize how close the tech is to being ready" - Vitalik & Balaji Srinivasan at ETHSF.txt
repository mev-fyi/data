so we did just say this was all about hacking hackathons but we do want to keep a conversation going with people who are kind of talking about big ideas important ideas so we'd like to invite a few speakers onto the stage so our moderator will be kartik tower from heath global and sv angel and deserves a big round of applause for all the work that he's done if you see him way to go man if you see him say thank you and everybody else at each global as well we have balaji srinivasan the cto of coinbase uh x21.co and earn.com as well among many others and vitalik buterin the founder of bitcoin magazine welcome thank you chess test okay um so before we start i'll let you just clarify that i'm not the only one that made this event happen there's about a hundred people from volunteers to organizers to everybody who supported us so i think they should get a bigger round of applause than jc global [Applause] so we're gonna cover a lot of stuff here everything from kind of high level thoughts into this ecosystem to uh going granular into the tech um but let's just start off with something simple i know you guys have a really good history of uh meeting a few years ago uh baji why don't you tell us about how you met vitalik initially yeah sure so um the first time i met metallic was actually in late 2013 when i was at anderson horowitz and at that time uh blockstream or the ancestors of block stream and the ancestors of ethereum were actually all co-founders of the same gigantic startup um most people don't know that blockchain ethereum were once on the same side um and there was just huge conference room with a bunch of people there and i said who are the founders and everybody raised their hand at the same time and i was like oh this is going to be interesting so that's how i met vitalik awesome so we're also going to do a q a at the end and if you have any questions for uh for vitalik biology please tweet us at uh i'd eat san francisco or use the hashtag eta san francisco and we'll kind of moderate and get the questions up at the end um so vitalik your your title is chief scientist of the ethereum foundation or the ethereum project and biology you are the cto of coinbase what is it that you actually do um at these organizations what is kind of your day-to-day look like uh what are some of the responsibilities of projects you're involved with can you give us an overview of what you uh do um number one fundamental research on things like proof of stake sharding plasma protocol economics uh number two helping to kind of go a little further down the pipeline and actually write down the spec very often write proof of concept code for kind of testing improving and simulating different kinds of ideas or at least writing what would eventually end up kind of becoming the first version of certain pieces of code coordinating with and talking to other researchers um kind of participating in the discussion around the ethereum foundation and foundation's overall strategy um fighting with uh bitcoin maximalist roles on twitter probably the big ones yeah so i joined in may and uh typical you know typically what i do is one part technology one part management and am trying to uh we're driving coinbase towards a you know multi-asset or many asset and uh you know many new crypto technology future uh and so i'm doing a lot of that you'll see a bunch of that manifesting on coinbase you know this quarter and in the quarters to come um and a typical day is basically like you know can be writing api specs it can be um it can be you know managing folks it could be working through all the various legal details to get something new launched great um kind of taking a step back how did you initially get involved into the space and sort of what motivates you and why so i first joined the space back in 2011 and i heard about it from my dad and i actually ignored it because i thought wait how can kind of pure bits on a computer that are not backed by anything have value then i heard about it again from the internet and i thought okay this might be something that's kind of worth looking into and i popped into the bitcoin forums then you know comes the story that i already told in many cases many times about starting to write for bitcoin bitcoin weekly then moving over to bitcoin magazine what interested in me about bitcoin was that it was really a kind of combination of different things that all interested me individually put together so i was already doing a lot of math and computer science i was already interested in kind of economic and political topics um i was already kind of interested in open source software and bitcoin and at the time it really was just bitcoin and it was all of these things put together and it seemed like an idea that was kind of at least interesting enough to kind of be uh an idea and a community that was interesting enough to at least to be worth trying to sink into yeah so uh you know i heard i first heard about bitcoin i think in either 2010 or early 2011 and was following it um [Music] through the you know the initial bubble and whatnot and what gave me a lot of faith in it was uh you know the technology was awesome but it was the recovery after that first bubble crash and then uh you know come back over 2012 that made me think okay this might have legs not just as a technology but as a market phenomenon um and got very heavily into it late 2012 early 2013 taught won the first class at stanford on in early 2013 actually a lot of a lot of blockchain entrepreneurs came out that class um and uh and then you know the whole thing really took off in 2013. that's great kind of just falling from that um in 2014 when you thought about working on ethereum what was sort of the original vision and sort of how has that changed so far from your perspective as the years have passed and and biology if you were to comment on that later how has your perspective still still kind of being involved from the early on stages has changed um about the ecosystem so my uh vision for ethereum actually started off being incredibly unambitious right because i was working on this project called mastercoin and mastercoin was this uh initially this well and always this layer two system on top of bitcoin that was trying to expand the utility of the blockchain going beyond just payments into other use cases including decentralized exchange um betting domain name systems crowdfunding like contract smart different kinds of contracts and mastercoin took what i described as the swiss army knife approach where they said here's 23 use cases for each use case let's make a feature and let's make a protocol with 23 features and i was kind of hired into this team very briefly and my immediate approach is can we try to take some of these features and immediately start generalizing them right can we start instead of creating 30 features for 30 use cases come up with single features that can be designed in ways that are kind of more general purpose and abstract and allow a bunch of other sets of use cases so i started off just kind of generalizing two-party financial contracts and i basically said instead of just having one parameter which is the leverage you turn it into the whole thing into a mathematical formula then from there i created this white paper that i called ultimate scripting and the idea was basically to replace mastercoin's entire feature set with this a programming language and i sent this white paper off to the mastercoin team and um i thought like this is obviously such a powerful and amazing and obviously the right way to go and they said hmm this looks interesting but this seems ambitious and this seems like this will be a very far long step in a road map and maybe we'll get to it in a year and i'm like guys this is like so obviously the the thing that you're supposed to do and you're gonna wait an entire year well screw that i'm gonna do it myself and started doing that wrote the white paper myself sent it to 15 people and out of ethereum came from came out of that and over time the vision kind of expanded almost even more with the feedback from other people than out of my own initiative right other people started right coming up with ideas building applications and i just realized hey wait you can use general purpose blockchains for this other stuff hey wait you can use general purpose blockchains for this other stuff and it kind of slowly dawned on you know probably both me and the ethereum community in general that it really general purpose blockchains really are general purpose and really are usable for a much wider variety of things than we thought blockchain should be used for back in 2013. got anything to uh add from your perspective of the project from the initial uh phases or do you have any comments to add from kind of your perspective from meeting and learning about the project early on to how you've seen it evolve uh now yeah well you know in the early days actually um i remember some of the folks who were working vitalik talked about like colored coins uh and that was a big thing and you could if you google colored coins you can see a video from that time period and now of course we have called those tokens um and a lot of the con or a lot of the concepts from tokens are are similar um so it was interesting to see certain things which couldn't be done on the bitcoin blockchain um you know first there was exit in the form of ethereum and now there's exit in the form of many other chains and so a lot of that pent up innovation has kind of come out over the last like year and a half or so got it what does mainstream adoption mean to you um where do you think we are in sort of uh just the adoption curve for for cryptocurrencies in general um with ethereum nearing four years bitcoin nearing 10 years and how do you look at that as a broader space so you know where we are now i think is you know in tens of millions of users land right and there's a difference between that versus hundreds of millions and obviously billions right and truly mainstream probably in the us would be when we're at hundreds of millions globally it's probably mainstream in the us when we're at billions globally it's mainstream worldwide um i think it gets to mainstream in the us probably over the next decade or so and might take more like 10 to 20 years for it to get mainstream worldwide and that's still a very fast growth rate that kind of mirrors kind of the rising internet um and that's like one quantity of different definition of what mainstream is um so back in uh some i think 2011 or 2012 i think i either wrote this article or kind of expressed this idea somewhere that there that i saw three possible paths for what at the time was just bitcoin where one the analogies i made are kind of esperanto linux and the internet and esperanto was this kind of language that that um a guy named i think ludwig zamanhav came up with in in the 1900s and he thought that if we create this artificial language which is kind of completely regular maximally easy to learn and it's politically neutral then we could get the whole world to speak it and but it ended up just never taking off and you know it has a small enthusiast community but it just never grows at all beyond that and linux you know it like there's this you know there's the joke in the linux community that the link that the year of linux on the desktop is always like the current year plus five or whatever it is and you know there's the dream and the dream never ends up being fully realized but even still linux totally survives as a legitimate alternative to kind of more mainstream proprietary operating systems and it has achieved like extremely real successes in places that it didn't even think of before like you know in mobile through android and um and servers and the internet is you know bitcoin is the next great invention since the beginning of the internet itself and that whole kind of expansionist vision um i would say at this point we've definitely gotten enough adoption that we're way past the phase where we have to worry about it becoming esperanto whether it looks more like linux or more like the internet i think we're definitely still unsure and it definitely still is one of those kind of time will tell sort of issues like the big question is basically are there going to be applications that actually do manage to kind of use blockchains and use blockchains kind of front and center in ways that you know reach very large numbers of people and realistically speaking cryptocurrency is probably still the primary candidate for that but there are other candidates that are slowly starting to come up and if anything in that ra in that area takes off then great but even if it doesn't you know the linux outcome is still i think you know much stronger than anything that any of us were hoping for five years ago and that would basically be a combination of a kind of fairly nice user base for cryptocurrencies plus blockchains being used to notarize and secure a whole bunch of stuff you know being used to improve the transparency of a bunch of a bunch of mechanisms doing a bunch of things in the back end and kind of impacting the lives of billions of people indirectly so we'll see yeah so i actually i like that trichotomization of like niche nerd next big thing right but i would also add maybe to that um linux even though it was nerd it actually did win on the desktop just the nexus up right the mobile desktop android and whatnot and that's kind of an interesting way of thinking about the emergence of crypto is like linux it's initially a producer technology right it's something that makes developers lives you know better it makes investors lives better like power users um and it's actually more useful if you're building a new you know financial service or you're trying to do new things with investing than it is for the average person and linux went through that phase for a long time it wasn't good for the average person but it was great for the person who's building google and you know amazon and facebook and so on and then eventually it became useful for the average person through android uh and i think that might be an emergence path for how crypto works where it's useful for all you guys you can build you know new products and services with it um and then eventually you know just it becomes useful for the average person um as it diffuses out from the developers and the producers those are those are excellent points i actually emerges with the the next question i was gonna ask so i'll just skip that but kind of just deep diving a bit deeper into this kind of with that narrative and sort of these now possibilities how do you 10x or 100x this ecosystem anywhere from technological side to distribution to use cases how do you think about that sure so one one angle that we're thinking about there's there's many but um one angle is there's at least three ways to to get crypto you can mine it you can buy it you can earn it um and you know we did the hardest way first which is setting up you know mining farms and then buying came on a little bit later and i think earning is still something that's open and interesting uh and with the acquisition of earned by coinbase we're working on ways to make earning crypto as easy as just you know like buying it just click a button and earn and if that works then it would work anywhere there's an internet connection because you just click a task and you know make money so that's one possible approach um there's other approaches as well which are based around taking all these new coins that are coming out and really stressing the utility right you know investment is generic buy sell send receive but utility is specific you know for example send a shield transaction with zcash or use bat in your browser or use rep for something or use you know like zrx or something they've got unique things you can do with them and each of those individual markets and niches maybe those can be pulled into cryptocurrency as well because those cryptos end up doing something unique uh that's another approach potentially the other suggestion on the market side that i've raised a couple of times is just making it easier for people to buy small amounts of cryptocurrency in corner stores so just increasing the accessibility of you know i want 40 bucks of crypto just enough of me to participate in some applications a little bit and pay for a bunch of transaction fees um because like if you don't have even the small amounts of cryptocurrency that it's hard to participate in public blockchain applications that are even non-financial in nature um on the protocol side i think uh solving the scalability challenges is obviously paramount because otherwise if the user base goes up by another 10x and transaction fees are going to be back up going up to like five five or fifty dollars um and another important thing is usability and that includes kind of the traditional notion of usability of making things kind of look and feel user-friendly and intuitive but also what i call like i don't tend to talk about usability versus security i talk about usability of security so how do we make it uh kind of maximally user-friendly to use coins and to use them but not kind of accidentally do things or have things happen to you that you really really don't want like a hundred thousand dollars of your money disappearing into a black hole and like if those disability issues can be solved i think it also cuts down the fraction by quite a bit and i know there are quite a lot of great projects that are starting to work on that so i guess as you follow on biology you you had a company earn.com that tried being able to kind of monetize uh users and emails and being able to give people cryptocurrencies for the first time as like the first way to acquire them what are kind of just expanding on italics answers on how do you get people to initially own small amounts of cryptocurrencies what were some of the learnings from uh from doing.com yeah so we actually you know we got the company to like a 10 million run rate before we before we sold it um and uh the you know what are the learnings on that um well in theory you can do lots and lots of different kinds of tasks you know paid tasks uh in practice we found that those tasks that were crypto native in some way were the most popular initially because that was a community that was familiar with it and that liked accepting crypto um i do think that over time uh you know as as we get better at smaller payments as vitalik was talking about um as we have more people who are familiar with crypto it'll become very common to uh just like you know you tweet and you're sending information you know or you you fave somebody's tweet or whatever you're sending like like a bit of information effectively but plus a lot of metadata it'll be very very common to do these tiny little payments as part of doing other actions within an app right so the blockchain is part of it it's an important part of the app but it's an enabling part of the app and there's other stuff around it i mean like earn is like one manifestation of that but there's others and so that's one of the things i've thought a lot about do you think a bigger audience for or for blockchains in general is machine to machine payments or is it broader or bigger on the user side if that makes sense the biggest consumers will they be machines paying machines or is it humans interacting with machines well i think it's a completely new thing that you can have machines holding money um that like didn't exist before that you could literally put a private key on a machine and and actually have a true intelligent agent that could earn on you know on its own and trade on its own so simply the fact that that's possible is a new thing um i think it'll take a while for the fullness of that to be appreciated uh but uh you know i i know that it's already a subculture uh you know the trading bot subculture there's all these people who communicate about this stuff they they do these algorithms online and there's people who do this from college students all the way up to like large hedge funds do this so so there's definitely starting to be that movement it's hard to say whether what the percentages will be in the future though vitalik if if you were to comment on some of the most underrated technological improvements in the ethereum ecosystem what would you say some of those things are underrated technological improvements um i would probably say zeke at this point at zk snarks and specifically the extents to which you can use zks newark's um already to improve the privacy and scale and scalability of applications like there are teams already like there's the in the team being led by a barry white hat is probably the biggest one that are trying really hard on uh making the making things like privacy preserving tools for ethereum using snarks to create more scalable ways of transaction batching techniques to create more secure and more scalable versions of plasma chains and things like that so i think there's definitely kind of there's definitely a lot of people that don't appreciate just kind of how close the technology is to reality even already biology what would you say are the most overrated parts of uh of the space well you know i i always respect folks who are working hard and you know respect entrepreneurs and so on i do think that the whole you know banking movement of you know blockchain not bitcoin and private blockchain and so on uh arguably overrated and you know the reason is i think a blockchain without a native digital asset is something which you know you lose a lot of the benefits of of a blockchain i believe and i think you know private blockchains may have a v2 where people realize hey i'll do a like a private ico it'll be set up as a like a joint venture where you have 10 companies in a consortium but they have actually a percentage of the token and then it actually might work again but i i think the whole concept of blockchain without bitcoin was it was a dead end a question for both of you what is your favorite data data structure um sparse miracle trees me i mean standard binary tree is good you know hash map i'll use them all right um vitalik what is ethereum 2.0 um just can you kind of go into some details on what it is why it matters and so ethereum 2.0 is this kind of catch-all term for a combination of different uh paths toward you know seriously and fundamentally revamping the ethereum blockchain that we've been working on over the last few years where one of those is proof-of-stake casper one of those is sharding one of those is the switch from the current evm if you're in virtual machine to ewas from the webassembly-based one and one of them is a set of kind of miscellaneous improvements including things like abstraction improved protocol economics that i wrote a paper on recently among other kinds of things like that and ethereum 2.0 is basically the kind of new version of ethereum that will take all of these different improvements and put them together and essentially create what we believe is the best possible design for a general purpose blockchain given what we know in 2018 and the goal is to kind of have a road map to migrate ethereum over into kind of being that over the next few years so could you uh elaborate a bit more on when and what does that timeline look like and sort of what goes into determining those things uh sure so one of the kind of big things that's made me a lot more optimistic about the whole thing over the last maybe four months specifically is that the research side has really kind of congealed and stabilized the huge amount right it feels like the research side at this point is like there's no kind of significant unsolved theoretical problem with the left it's basically all details and kind of safety checking and verification um and right now it's basically the kind of a software development swag right and we're familiar with software development slots like if you recall ethereum 1.0 going from the original first step of the ethereum white paper to ethereum 1.0 being released altogether took 19 months and right now we're actually very significantly ahead of the initial whitepaper release like i would say right now with ethereum 2.0 and with where the protocol is and where the software development is is probably where ethereum 1.0 was possibly in maybe the fall of 2014 and that means um and there are already you know like independent companies like for example prismatic lighthouse status with nimbus and a couple of consensus parity uh starting to work on kind of independent implementations of the casper and charting spec and i expect test nets to be coming out fairly soon and then you know we'll have in parallel work happening on test nets and along with formal verification of the protocol auditing of the protocol auditing of the code and implementations and that'll at some point kind of culminate in you know like some some form of main net release so just kind of quickly digging into this what's sort of the rationale behind having other teams working parallel and kind of how do you see that versus ethereum foundation or the core protocol team sure so the ethereum community uh kind of really strongly believed in this idea of multiple implementations basically since day one so uh for those who remember the 2014 the 15 developments to log right you had python go geth and c plus plus basically developing the protocol in parallel all the way through with the intention that all three of these implementations would be viable implementations of the of the protocol that people could run and use and the goal behind this was a large part of it was political like basically we the kind of what we perceived as kind of failures of development centralization in the bitcoin ecosystem um that kind of arose from the existence of a single implementation implementation there is something that we thought that we wanted to avoid basically by saying there is no such thing as a reference implementation and the reference is the protocol and the protocol is you know the yellow paper and the protocol is distinct from implementations of the protocol this time around we're actually going a bit further because there is one version of the pro of this of the protocol which is made by kind of people who are formally hired by us by the ethereum foundation as full-time developers and that's the python implementation but python is a small language and everyone knows that there's plenty of context in which python has just set up that it's just not going to win right so it's um like if and so that kind of naturally sets it up for kind of competition between outside entities to create the client clients that people will end up using and and there will be many people that use python as well but hopefully but not in every context and um you know so the ethereum foundation basically gives grants in part and other companies are giving grants as well to uh and uh so with in the case of status you know nimbus is itself funded by status as fairly large ico raise right so the goal is to have this kind of robust tiny community ecosystem and on top of that it also mean it has this very pragmatic dimension where it insulates um the ethereum community against the risk of any one of these teams failing in any one of these teams just ending up to not being able to figure out how to do software development correctly yeah one of the things actually that brian armstrong and me and fred ursum were impressed by by ethereum in the early days was that it did have a protocol spec it it did divide a protocol from a specific implementation it had multiple implementations um you know one of the things we've actually been thinking about doing recently is um publishing like a coinbase api standard um that would have maybe a similar effect for what we do with security because not all blockchains um provide the ability for you to separate cold storage signing and broadcasting and that's like a critical kind of thing um and there's other kinds of things like how can you do staking for example in a way that it's not all with a hot wallet and what have you so there's aspects of potentially security where we could publish api specs and have people code to them so we've already started to receive a lot of questions from the audience so if you have any other other questions we'll keep uh ask them on twitter with the hashtag eat san francisco and we'll kind of roll them up in a few minutes but i'll last one that i just received which is kind of for both of you uh what do you wish people in this space would stop doing that you constantly see happening a lot uh just stop fighting online build stuff you know [Applause] i mean i would edit that slightly to uh fight online constructively but and i do think disagreement is important it's important and proposals need to be criticized and like i need to be criticized and vlad needs to be criticized and like in like every single research like every single idea regardless of the so of who it comes from you know needs to kind of pass the trial by fire because ultimately it will pass a trial by fire by people who are much more benevolent malevolent than you know trolls inside the ethereum community that makes sense um kind of branching off from one of your previous answers should everything be open source in this space how do you kind of think about what does it mean to have like the ip kind of advantage to what should be private versus public and kind of how do you think through that or how should one thing through that in this space well you know a possibly perhaps trivial but useful you know limit case is your private keys are not open source right so obviously not everything is going to be open source you're going to keep something private and then there's a continuum there between okay what is as valuable what are the crown jewels like your private keys um and you know what what can you put out in public and one of the awesome things about blockchains is they offer a new way to monetize open source things of all kinds um i think we're going to see blockchain versions of many other kinds of protocols we've got already blockchain competitors for dns we'll see blockchain competitors for smtp and you know other kinds of protocols coming out there i'm already seeing them and so i think a larger percentage of open source projects can be monetized so we'll see a larger percentage of things that will be open source with a blockchain component i mean i would say the general principle is that it's more it's relatively speaking more importance to open source things that are closer to the bottom layer and closer to the center and less importance to open source things that are kind of closer to the edges and periphery and particularly kind of not protocols but software that participates in protocols so one trivial example of something that where i think the interesting bits will be proprietary pretty much forever is software involved in like market making arbitrage and generally participating in financial markets but you know the financial market itself being a fully open source decentralized exchange is something that's absolute that i think is great right so like that that's just one example of you know the cool where the corporate free boundary is one you know is one good way of thinking about it one of the things that's interesting is uh in this space you know people will say oh you could just take a coin you could take a chain you could take a smart contract and you can just fork it endlessly and where's the scarcity come in and you know related to the concept of you know do we open source everything one thing i think is implicit is a lot of value derives from the backlink structure like the reason that with the bch btc split um that everything didn't just go to bch in the same way as to btc is a lot of things were pointing at you know the the longer chain right and so the backlink structure i think is something that is a form of scarcity that we don't normally think about that is distinct from whether the source code is out there in public is whether things are actually pointing to and trusting that particular database or that particular source code or instantiation okay i'm also going to start merging in questions that are coming in from the audience so we'll kind of just have a mix of both versus doing a separate segment on just audience questions another interesting question that came up is kind of what do you think are some of the cool things anything from technological to community uh that's happening in other blockchains that ethereum should adopt um on the uh uh on the community side i and one one of the things i love about c cash is this kind of separation between z cash foundation and uh zeke and z cash co and where you know zuko was part of one and not the other in the end you know they have and i think that they've actually done a kind of quite good job of just setting up a community in a way that you know in in a way where there is a kind of limited level of influence in kind of both one kind of person and one organization another one of the interesting ideas that i think zuko came up with is this idea that control like practical control over protocol development and control over trademark ownership should be maximally separate and that's um i think you know an interesting idea that probably in ethereum and probably other public blockchains should consider adopting because you know unfortunately there isn't really a good way to kind of have a trademark not be owned by anyone but this does seem like a kind of pragmatic a pragmatic approach that does kind of minimize the centralization harm that can come out of that issue particularly biology i guess to add on to that what are some of the technological advancements that you're tracking personally outside of what's going on at coinbase um well certainly we're looking at all the privacy coin related stuff you know zika snark starts bulletproofs um we are you know i guess i can't talk about everything we're looking at but you know we're obviously aware of um uh you know stable coins we're aware of uh you know what's going on with um like things like token curated registries you know we pay attention to a lot of the stuff but the thing is coinbase's role is sort of to mainstream blockchain which means that by necessity we're not on the cutting edge right like if something is truly on the cutting edge it's on the bleeding edge it's not really ready for tens of millions of users typically so we try to you know do what apple does which is take a technology that's in its spring and it's proven itself a bit and it's not going to have like a like a cve on day one and when it's ready for getting to tens of millions of users then we'll mainstream it so those are kinds of things that we're looking at this is a really good segue into our next part which is we're going to steal the underrated overrated segment from tyler cowan's podcast so i'll uh i'll leave a handful of topics uh and and the way you kind of play this is uh you have to say is it underrated or overrated and a quick answer on why so we'll start off with uh zk snarks i'd say about correctly rated at this point like they are power they are very powerful and uh a general pur i think general purpose private uh uh privacy a general purpose your knowledge proofs is like a really huge advancement in cryptography right because if you look i was barely following cryptography maybe 10 to 15 years ago back when zero knowledge proofs were this kind of application specific protocol and you had to come up with specific protocols for specific use cases and it was like super lame and now it's uh i mean the fact that we that we're fairly close to the point where you can make privacy preserving protocols for just very large classes of things involving just the abstract programming languages is huge and i do think that you know the community recognizes that underrated or overrated zka snarks or starks well i mean i think zika snarks are still underrated people in this audience know what they are but after sapling you know comes out in a few weeks uh you know i think it just gets mainstream to a much greater extent um and we we haven't even yet explored where it's going to get and then with starks and bulletproofs i think you know we're it's going to go to the next level because you know we eliminate the trusted setup and we have you know even faster um you know transactions and possibly smaller you know uh proof sizes so i think all those technologies are underrated relative to what the general population knows about them non-fungible tokens underrated or overrated i'd on the margin i'd say overrated it's um i don't know i'm like suspicious of things that get too buzzwordy so i throw token curated registries in the same bucket i guess we'll skip the next question then yeah i mean i i'm an investor in cryptokitties i i do think that in the long term nfts will be important i think like today if you go and look at dap radar there's not a lot of volume in you know buying and selling you know collectibles and nfts um but i do think that as they start getting hooked into video games and they're the back ends for things like their potions and swords within video games um i think that's going to be the thing that pulls them up in the medium term so overrated maybe today but underrated in the long term and eventually we'll get you know what people have always talked about blockchain real estate and so on they'll take a while what about stablecoins um globally speaking i'd say underrated um i still think people and a lot of people don't realize the extents to which stable coins solve one one of people's biggest concerns with uh the uh with the cryptocurrency space which is that in order to use apple these applications you have to expose themselves to volatility and with the stable coins a lot of that goes away and you can actually use applications that just look like regular applications involving dollars and i'm also you know very happy that very recently it seems like there was this big outburst of kind of new stable coin companies coming along like there's there's circles announcements there's i mean like true usd there's like t in crypto dt over and uh um there's i think i forget there's like a you know there there's a bunch of them now right and that means like first of all and it's nice to see that there's more it's nice to see if these new ones are kind of more you know more reputable and audited and so forth than the ones that came before and it's um and i'm also very happy to see that you know maker down dye is kind of doing well and continuing to prove itself and holding its value despite you know like overseeing each dropping in in price by more than 80 percent i think it's still a very imp uh an impressive accomplishment for a crypto back stable coin mistakes to stay stable through that period um so and in the long run you know this yeah i mean these kinds of tokens are a way a kind of way for traditional financial systems to kind of upload themselves to crypto land if they want to yeah i i also i would say stable coins are underrated today uh for a couple reasons but with that said i distinguish between two kinds of stable coins at least there's multiple kinds but i'd say there's one class of stable coins that i'm somewhat bearish on and those i'd consider the like rube goldberg machine smart contract things that try to manufacture a stable result out of a fundamentally unstable underlying digital currency i would argue and then by contrast they're the ones which i'd call let's say audit heavy tech light stable coins where really what they're selling is trust the trust that you can go and redeem it for good old-fashioned us dollars or or whatever fiat currency underneath um and those i'm more bullish on because i think those are actually what people really want with a stablecoin is they want the trust of redemption um which means stablecoins are more like an insurance business than like other kinds of crypto businesses because it's a question of what is the risk that i won't be able to redeem something if you can solve those problems and if you can have a stable coin that people really trust and that doesn't have redemption risk then i think in the medium term we'll think of you know like fintech before stablecoin is like mobile before iphone in the sense that every fintech company if you could just have a digital dollar a blockchain based dollar if you didn't need to do a banking partnership or something like that you just go and program right away with a digital dollar based on the blockchain um and i think that's a really important medium-term thing that could happen if we get a working and functional safer plan i think one important point in favor of crypto backed through back to ruby goldberg machine stable coins is that they're more likely to survive an unfriendly regulatory and banking environment yeah so so that's a good question and i think if you're trying to fundamentally represent a u.s dollar i think you can't you know avoid the question of interfacing with the u.s banking and regulatory system it's kind of like this if um if you had an app that got popular enough on facebook's platform eventually facebook will knock on your door right and if you have something which is representing hundreds of billions of dollars eventually you know there will be some nexus to the us government and so on it's just like it's kind of inevitable so that that's kind of a fundamental premise and we could disagree on that kind of on that note how do you how do you look at decentralized organizations overrated or underrated um i would probably say a somewhat overrated in the show especially in the short term um and part of the and i will this is definitely a changing opinion i was kind of more idealistic about this subset of the space maybe three or four years ago i think the problem is that like first of all if you try to create complete decentralized organization organizations there's just game theoretic issues and misalignments and pretty much every kind of governance that you can come up with but also i think a lot of the value it does that doesn't necessarily needs to come from kind of fully fledged you know like uh decentralized corpora uh corporations in the sky running on the blockchain it can come from incentive alignments run that come out of kind of smaller and more purpose-specific gadgets so like the cons the kind of da ico that i came up with a lot at the end of last year is probably one example of that i mean things like assurance contracts uh things like different kinds of like public good fund uh funding mechanisms uh different kinds of uh you know quadratic voting gadgets or whatever i think uh kind of more self-contained things like that are where i mean you can kind of see more kind of stable and realistic value in the short term yeah so i am uh i'm bullish on dos very bearish on daos like like i don't believe in the autonomous aspect for a while um and why bullish on dos well i think uh you know we have more and more teams that are remote work based uh in multiple jurisdictions and i think in the not too distant future quote incorporating or signing contracts on the ethereum blockchain or other blockchains like that smart contract-based blockchains um are going to is going to become pretty popular for remote teams and you can imagine like a blockchain based slack or a blockchain docusign or blocky sign that just allows these quote decentralized organizations to agree on something vote and then allocate funds you know with a proof of stake vote or some other kind of vote just even a multi-sig kind of vote and i think that's kind of cool where you don't necessarily need to take the entire dow concept you know you can take pieces of it and just be like oh here's how you know we get multi-sig you know for three people who live in three different countries under three different legal systems we don't have to have them incorporated in delaware we can have something on the blockchain that's pretty lightweight i think i'm bullish on that kind of thing we'll do like one last one on overrated underrated off-chain scaling what are your thoughts on that so i'm actually you know i really believe off-chain is very underrated um in the sense of for most applications unless you're unless you're vitalik unless you're zuko unless you're somebody who's a cryptographer or you know a very you know no systems programming and so on most people aren't going to be able to do that and instead they should keep most of their state in a normal postgres database and have blockchain functionality right so you know blockchain like the blockchain will provide balances it'll provide addresses your users can send and receive funds and you can keep your images and your normal user data or whatever and postgres like a normal kind of thing and so then your app has quote two data stores it's got postgres and it's got you know the blockchain you know over here and i think that kind of model is going to be like a pretty important one a hybrid model and moreover anything that you can do off-chain you should do off-chain because the you know blockchains are relatively low capacity right now you want to batch transactions you don't want to pay fees uh you want to try to do as much as you can off chain and then just write the absolute minimal digest on chain so i think that's going to be a bigger and bigger thing one thing i wrote about two years ago that i'd love to see maybe somebody here can hack it tonight is um something similar to post gis right so post gis is basically a set of add-ons for postgres that adds you know range queries xy you know latitude longitude support to postgres which is normally just a standard relational database i'd love to see a post chain that does the same kind of thing but adds blockchain functionality so it makes it easy to ingest a blockchain do relational queries uh you know to to search and sort blockchain based data structures um and an add-on like that and that's the kind of thing i think would help a lot where you're doing a lot of stuff off-chain and then you have a digest that is written to the blockchain and it costs you something i think that's going to be an important paradigm we'll move on to sort of the next couple of questions we've gotten in uh vitalik what role has a threshold relay or and other improvements from the dfinity ecosystem that played into the design of ethereum 2.0 so we're not using threshold relays uh specifically and both uh in both because we perf we prefer being a leaner on crypt on cryptographic assumptions and also uh because it's well because we okay just to kind of dial back a bit right what threshold really is is this the kind of inbox well it's two things one is it's a consensus algorithm and two it's a a um in blockchain uh random number generator and it relies pretty heavily on kind of bls signatures and distributed key generation and i personally dislike distributed key generation because of this like big extra load of craft that you have to add into the uh add into the protocol spec somewhere and we're taking a somewhat different approach where we where we use bls signature aggregation which also uses bls signatures and also gets kind of very high efficiencies from combining signatures together in the same way threshold really does um but we use um this in combination with a different kind of a proof of stake algorithm that uses a ghost based virtuous rule and i mean this is nice and the goal that we're targeting is actually we do not want the security of the blockchain to be fully dependent on the security of a random number generator algorithm right like we want to be able to prove that the blockchain is secure even if the attacker chooses what all the random numbers are and surprisingly enough you know with you and a blockchain algorithm where you have enough validators participating at the same time you can actually do that then for a random number generator i know we have justin's entire line into vdf research and while that's technically not necessary for the blockchain to work that does kind of increase the security margin of the system so it decreases the the minimum safe committee size for example by maybe a factor of two or three in practice and it increases the safety tolerances by a few percent and at the same time random numbers are something that's useful to a wide array of layer two applications and so that it like we are building in a random beacon in chain but we are using vr5 all delay functions instead of your five or random functions so it's somewhat different technology biology a question for you from the audience um what geographies will we first see a mass adoption in terms of a use case for for cryptocurrencies and sort of why is that the case or will that be the case that's a great question um you know there's there is a thesis that it's going to be like the venezuelans of the world and so on where cryptocurrency has mass adoption um i actually you know as sympathetic as i am to the you know to the venezuelan people and as much as i do believe that that does illustrate an important use case for bitcoin um i do think that cryptocurrency is probably going to have to prove itself in the developed world first and then it will filter out everywhere else and the reason for that is um any technology in the early stages has bugs and horrible ux and various shortcomings that only relatively wealthy people who have the time and the energy and don't have a chaotic situation around them and they have good internet and they can download a multi-gigabyte blockchain and they don't have a light wallet all the types of only folks who have all of that you know time and internet um i think are gonna get this thing off the ground and then eventually get it to hundreds of millions and then get to billions and i think it'll have a similar emergence mode to smartphones where the developed world subsidized them and got them to scale and then they were cheap enough for the developing world to buy into them so i'm a huge long-term bull on like banking to unbank with crypto and so on i do believe that eventually does happen i just don't think that's where it starts yeah and i'd probably generally agree i'd say while we're in the enthusiast phase it'll continue to be the case that the map of where the blockchain nodes are will roughly track the map of where the the brightest night lights are if you if you look at the earth uh the earth from space but in in the long term i definitely do and i also agree that you know like banking the unbanked kind of improving um financial systems in cases where kind of inter cross national kind of cooperation is currently weakest and where existing governance structures are weakest and most hostile is one of is one of the most interesting areas where they can be applied as well so the interest of time we'll just ask two more questions um one just to kind of come back to something that was said earlier coinbase was involved with greatcrypto.org and the ethereum foundation is involved with the grant program how can others get involved uh with these initiatives yeah so we have a charitable arm called give crypto dot org um so you know give crypto is just spell like that uh that you know brian set up and uh you know that does charitable work in the space um so for the ethereum foundation grand program i mean there's still ways to participate right one is to apply for a grant and the other is if you have a lot of money then you yourself can just become a grant giving body and you can either decide whom to give grants to yourself or you can kind of piggyback onto you know who the ethereum foundation gives money yourself because those of us are completely public so i mean either in either of those two is highly welcome and you know we're act on the project side we're actively looking for projects so doing uh work in scalability particularly usability including what i call usability of security uh for you know and that includes both the wallet and the out of smart contract programming side um including you know things are formally verification it includes kind of it includes a layer two systems of pretty much every kind so it's uh if you're wants to build a piece of the ethereum ecosystem the opportunity and kind of do that as a full-time thing the opportunity is there for you and lastly uh biology already answered what he would like to hack on potentially this weekend what would you uh make if you were a hacker at this event well fomo 3d was pretty awesome so you know something like that i think really is you know it just is something you could only do on the blockchain you know uh so i'd love to see stuff like that um which i think push the limits of what you can do with smart contracts uh and uh you know i'd love to see something like post chain would i just talk about i think that'd be very useful um and uh yeah i mean those two in particular i think would be cool uh reputation systems are probably still kind of under an interesting area that we probably haven't i mean there was a bit of a lot of enthusiasm back in 2014 but then it kind of petered off and i think and we might be at the point where the infrastructure is there to kind of make another go at that whole area um i would i also say kind of in privacy preserving applications or in general are an interesting category um anything kind of develop any kind of developer middleware um kind of and particularly kind of more these possibly decentralized alternatives to existing other more centralized forms of middleware um solution in wallets and kind of and securities um solutions and other important area like basically what like and also in general just look at kind of what what you think are pain points that are seen by developers in the ecosystem and try to have a go at solving any of them perfect well biology vitalik thank you so much for taking out the time to share your views with us tonight and all of them [Applause]
