up here so we all met this weekend on Friday the problem statement that was originally postulated was just really kind of like privacy in general and then Tom came up with a really cool idea he said that say P er is a nice way to stream money to people let's just say I wanted to earn a salary and I want to earn my salary overtime everybody would be able to see what my salary is and that's not really great it wouldn't be great to see what my colleagues salary is when we could see what my boss's salary is so the solution to this would possibly be to do it in a private manner and so we have integrated the Aztek protocol to create streaming private money so you could conceivably stream a salary over a period of time so we tried it and it's pretty close to working so here you can see that I have a balance of 600 died I've actually locked up 125 in 2zk died which is on the Aztek protocol and we can create a stream and so to create this stream we kind of really we say how much we want a stream so let's stream 100 die let's decide who will stream it to so let's just say this is my employee I'm going to stream him over the next seven days a stream of a hundred z.k died and so then we'll create this stream and we use the Aztek API to do it and I can maybe allow Tom to explain the proof that's about to get created its destination all the fun stuff that goes on okay at this point we have created a Aztek note and sent it to the smart contracts once this transaction goes through we then are going to send another transaction which defines the all the parameters of the stream so that's going to tell you who it's going to and how long this stream is going to go once that's done the recipient can kind of obviously find a event on chain which tells them that they have this stream pointed at them they can then choose to withdraw any fraction of that timeframe they just have me to give a timestamp to smart contract and it will do a dividend proof which proves that the amount of money they want to withdraw from the note on the smart contracts is equal to the time period claiming we then kind of check they're not claiming money into the future and with those two aspects along with like the standard joints proofs proving that they aren't creating money out of nowhere that throws another note over to the recipient and then the like the change note gets placed on to the contracts for the payment future [Applause]
