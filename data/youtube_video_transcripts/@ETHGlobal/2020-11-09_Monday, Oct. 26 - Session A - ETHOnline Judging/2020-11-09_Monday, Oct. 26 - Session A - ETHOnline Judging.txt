so uh welcome welcome to the monday the last day of judging for youth online um it's been an incredible month already um we've had 700 hackers from more than 65 countries and 19 time zones joined the event we had more than a thousand applications for this making it our largest online hack fund ever by a large margin uh we've had 175 projects so far submitted for the event uh and you know we're gonna see probably another 50 in total today from across all the different rooms um quick notes about the format we're using today so as all the hackers know you have a demo video that you've submitted and the match time for that video is four minutes and then after that you have four minutes for q a with the judging panel um so the way this will work is when we start your video i'll be running a timer and i will send messages to the chat as that time ticks down once you're into the q a and then we'll wrap at the end of eight minutes uh we will be taking a break part way through um so judges you can let me know if you want your break at a certain point otherwise i'll just pick an arbitrary point uh towards the middle of the of the session we'll take a little rest for uh coffee refills so criteria the judges have just finished a briefing and uh all of our deals are very experienced from a hackathon so they know this very well but the criteria that the judge will be looking at today cover uh five different domains one is the the kind of the technical strength of your hack another is the originality is this a new idea that we're seeing uh another is practicality uh ui ux and finally wow factor to kind of cover you know is this really impressive there's really a special hack that's you know there's a something about it that's not covered by these other categories so that's what the judges will be looking for today um i want to emphasize that this is not a competition of course we have prizes and there will be fine lists but at eight global events we really want to emphasize always that people are here to learn not everyone is here to you know launch a company and launch a product sometimes hacking is just for fun or just to experiment with an idea so you know at the end of the day we want you to get valuable feedback and support from the judges and have them help you understand what you can do next whether it's working on this project or something else in the ethereum space and our judges today who are joining us uh we have spencer noon from dtcc uh mintal from consensus and joyce from global coin research so thank you all three of you so much for being part of this today i really appreciate you giving up your time to talk to all of our hackers and hear about what they've been working on for last few weeks okay so let's jump into our first demo so the first hack we're going to see is um sorry i'm pulling up the window i believe it is squad chess and we've got jessie and ezra i'll let you take it away and play your demo hello and welcome to our ethon line hackathon presentation for squad games a network for user generated video game mods we think that games should be designed by their players and there are examples of this being powerful in the past we think support that our approach to to building this is to borrow the innovation engine of youtube and other internet products and apply it to games so we're letting users contribute things maps modes arts any kind of mod and letting them earn when their contributions do well and letting players choose between sets of contributions when they play that define their experience of the game there's three core pieces of this engine one is that anyone can add a contribution the second is that we're trying to align incentives so that creators and players are incentivized to create and use contributions they think are going to be popular and lastly effective curation so we want to use market data to help players find the the ways they'll most enjoy playing for this hackathon we we focused on a pattern we're calling a constant purchase price with dynamic backing this works by letting people buy a license for a constant price but backing that license using a dynamic amount of an asset on a bonding curve the reason that we did this was because having a constant price we think provides a good user experience people want to pay the same thing for the same results but it also provides a nice incentive licenses can be sold the value goes up with supply so there is an incentive to discover underused contributions and bring them to light there are a few flows that are important one is the user that can send the constant purchase price to a controller smart contract which will mint backing tokens lock those in an nft license which it gives back to the user they use that to play the game another one is the contributor that is adding a new contribution and setting the fee they're going to get every time a user buys a license for that contribution now we'll go into a demo of squad chess so in this demo i'm going to quickly on fast speed go through creating a new contribution for a format of chess just changing a few pieces and setting the purchase price and and and contributor fee and then we will see that created in the game and buy a license for it and then we'll do a quick demo of of a live game played against myself hopefully that went well what we're what we're looking at next for this project is a season zero experiment for squad chess which will be a competition and long term we do want to keep building this so trying to gather community and resources so please join us on discord if you're interested uh lastly thank you for listening to our presentation thanks listening jesse uh over to the judges for questions and comments that devil went a little fast for me can you just describe quickly what you did there through the demo yeah absolutely uh so i'm allowed to talk now yes yes yes video video off is that the rule sorry i don't know what the rules are oh yeah please open your videos that'd be great i think but of course up to your own yeah i'm happy i just wasn't sure whether it was maybe it was like a you know you don't want to judge people on how they look or something um yeah so what we did in the demo was um create a new contribution so in the case of chess that means basically like a new starting board and starting position with whatever pieces you choose um so we created that and that includes setting how much you want it to cost and how much of a fee the creator wants to charge so submitted that then i bought uh i bought that contribution which means buying a license to let you play basically um and then i played a game against myself using that using that new new format that i'd created so you bought the license from who uh from the system i mean it's it's a it's an automated got it and that's the constant price right so so in this case right i think i chose 10 of our token that we deployed just for this 10 10 tokens to buy a license um what that does is i pay 10 tokens to the controller contract the controller gonna take those 10 tokens which is always 10 for that contribution and by whatever amount that buys out of a bonding curve so that's going to change over time right it could be more it could be fewer it's then going to use whatever amount it buys from the bonding curve to lock into an nft and that nft is is going to be given back to me and and is is my license that's what the game is checking to give me permission to to play using that using that format sorry i'm probably a little slow so what is it what is the controller buying so yeah it is a bit i mean maybe i should i don't go back to the slide that you showed us yeah i don't have the users and then controller so i don't know if i want to waste the time uh maybe i could just get that part of the video yeah here okay so i'll i'll share this again and then we can we can look at it yeah i think while you're while you're doing that um there's a yeah there's a bonding curve factory um that means a new bonding curve for every contribution and that acts as an automated market maker for um those those tokens to get locked in the nft license yeah so cool let's use examples guys if you don't mind i think that'll go really quickly even in a chess example right like what's a mod yeah so so in the case of chess it's a new starting position for chess so whatever shape board and whatever pieces you want in whatever positions and that's the that's the position that people are going to start and it could be kind of anything else that's just what it is for chess it's pretty simple um so you create a new one of those and you say that you've basically created a new a new chess game right new any way of playing chess and now people can buy a license that gives them permission to use it and the way that works is they pay whatever the price is it's a constant price that goes into the controller the controller is going to use that amount that they paid in to buy out of the bonding curve that's specific to that contribution that's where it's not constant because the amount of that bonding curve token you're going to get for that constant price depends on the supply of of the bonding curve token and whatever amount it gets back of the money curve token it's going to lock into a license which it gives back to you and the effect that that has is let's say that my 10 die gets me a license that has five bony curve tokens locked into it and then a week from now the bonding curve token price has gone up a lot because the supply has gone up i can actually now sell like redeem and sell the tokens in my in my license so i i could basically burn the nft get back the bonding curve tokens then sell those back to the curve to get back my dot get back die and i would get back more basically if the contribution had become more popular even though everybody's buying it for the same constant constant price hopefully that's a decent explanation so basically let's it lets you have an effect where the purchaser is always paying the same price but you're still getting some of the incentives of it being treated like an investment so the way you thought about creating this game originally with chess was that uh instead of kind of starting off with the kind of the black versus white uh chess pieces in their original you know traditional places you want to start it off with the pieces actually being set anywhere we want and that's how you start the game with sure yeah i mean chess is a very arbitrary example like you could do this with any game any any kind of software um the reason we chose to do this kind of thing at all is because we have seen in games and i think we all have this experience like making up our own house rules to play basketball with our friends or something that people like coming up with their own rules and this is kind of how games get innovated and there's a lot of value created there and that value is kind of locked out um of the existing video game industry and and a lot of other a lot of other things too but we saw the opportunity to do something cool with with video games great thanks jose and thanks jesse um all right that's a little time we have for q a um so we'll have to move on to the next hack but thanks for your presentation yeah thank you thanks a lot you're wrong thank you okay uh our next presentation is from fund my musician i think we've got you on the call now so you can go ahead and share your demo okay hi everyone my name is song and i'm a four-star developer i built this decentral app called from my musicians where fans can donate tokens to their favorite positions so right now many musicians are struggling to make money because of the parent damage they do not have the budgets to promote their music or all the dark marking skills and fans do not know how to send money to their favorite position to support them so the solution i came up with is to build a dab app where fans can purchase erc20 called ffm which is nike token currency and fans can support their favorite musicians by donating token and administration can upload their music for fans to see and fans can sell this token for funds so in the future i will work i will create features where fans can earn this token by sharing the links to the musician's music or sign up for the newsletter and i will implement guest station network to cover the gas fees especially when their rain fans are donating tokens to the musicians and musicians can use these tokens to promote their music on newsletter and also create a feature where fans can buy this token with bitcoin dial order cryptocurrency cryptocurrency instead of using ethereum and the technology i use for this watcher is patek gateway where i deploy my public my contract to to the but the department blockchain and my tokens fire the erc20 standards and on the front end i use read and i store the musicians data on firebase and i use an idi to create a smart contract now it's time for the demo so here's the home page of the app and let's say if you're a user and you want to buy tokens you can click on this link and then there's your information and you could buy um say 1000 tokens and then it costs so 0.03 if and click on purchase and then you confirm and now you have 1000 fm and now you can click on musician to see a list of musician and let's say you want to support buying so you can click on this page and click on there will be the tag in the musician and click on the tokens let's say you want to give him um 100 tokens you click on sent and then confirm and now you gave him 500 tokens and let's say if you like his work then you can click on like button and then it costs like one token and you click on confirm now has some likes and then every time and then the more likes he has then we will put the music on the top page of this on the list of resist lists of musicians you see he got put in the top before it was steve bob though and that's it thank you for watching and i'll see you next time yeah that's all i got yeah this is this is uh this is cool i i wanted to ask you know why did you think of using tokens instead of um like i guess in the us you see a lot of platforms like patreon that funds musicians through you know without tokens right what what's the thought behind using tokens um yeah so they can like maybe they taking like musicians they can use tokens like to promote their music so we will have like a newsletter where we will put their music and then send email to all the fans that sign up on our newsletter yeah maybe um follow on joyce's question like this is super cool reminds me of a project that launched last week audios which you know you should definitely um but you know presumably also uh you know you had an fmm token as opposed to just using straight like you know bitcoin or ethereum or die because you have some additional functionality that you plan to utilize with the token so what features do what are the features such as like the newsletter do you think can be enabled by the fmm token um our features um how do you combine the token and the newsletter and how have the newsletter help promote the token i guess is that what you meant okay maybe like you know have any um you know obviously there's some um there's a time limit with the project but that you sort of look into maybe using nfts for collectibles or loyalty all right i was thinking about using the non-fundamental token but i did have time and i didn't have that much experience but that's something i would do in the future cool how long have you been building uh on solidity and just as an engineer i've been uh ordinary for like one month or about two months yeah that's cool welcome yeah oh thank you what was um the most fun part about building this project um just during like crane contracts and then deployed to the public blockchain that was pretty cool i i know that during my build dispatch uh i know how to deploy got it that's really cool why why me why music i guess why why did you feel like this was a need uh in this in the industry oh because um because um like during the premier dynamic night there was not it's not that much like did just like street performers usually they have like people around to donate and then ever since the paradigm hick now there's not much people outside so many musicians they don't have any any crowds or any fans to like give money or to perform so it made it hard for them to make money and how should i try to helping out my maybe make this platform where friends can donate like some finance so cryptocurrencies or money to them to support them yeah that makes sense are you thinking about continuing with the project and um yeah i'll try to yeah i'll try to make it better okay well thank you so much thanks for being part of uh youth online uh it's awesome to see people who are relatively new to solidity build something in only a few weeks thanks so much thanks song thanks for that nice job yeah thank you okay uh moving on to our next demo the next team up is rpc network um and i understand that um uh i think they're going to um respond to questions in mandarin and joyce you're going to translate where possible um i will men is here too min speaks chinese great that's awesome all right uh hello rpc my work please go ahead and play your demo for us am i supposed to translate that no right the the demo no no no just like if you want me to give them instructions or translate anything that you're saying oh um yeah maybe maybe go ahead um is it eric if you want to play your demo what's his name eric um i have uh eric ma looks like eric you shouldn't send out anymore what uh he said he thought you guys were the one demoing for him so he's pulling it up now i think okay well josh do you happen to have the demo too or you're expecting them to demonstrate i i can play it if he can't it will just okay jacob do you want to do it yeah why not okay okay eric tell me that you're born into actually yeah sorry i feel like i don't have the audio driver installed of course right let me know you can hear this it's uh the central line node service according to the pv p2p to find the node this will re reduce the network node and if you run the phone node with all the privacy you will get the rewards second we will brain post concern consultation needs to be introduced to detect whether the node is running it it will serve that and it's the room utterly big chin okay let's wrong notes post i will run this commander kangan plr data interval filter net network absolutely where your tv find the node then it is down this is my finder my net node know i will diagnose with diverter point power soon this is iphone door node url she let me write her well this time more than node is important okay it's it have no weather in this whether you eat thank you great thank you so we'll turn over to the judges for questions and comments um uh uh um [Music] here um so a quick translation and that um that i i think i got i asked them why you know what's the thought behind that project and the reason why he's building the project he says uh its consensus api is centralized and he wants to maintain a way to to kind of uh distribute distribute rewards um and and and kind of enhanced the distributive attributes i guess of the ecosystem and he said that the east 2.0 beacon chain requires that it needs to be connected to one point the east 1.0 node so then this is a way to enable that folks get rewarded by using the rpc network um george should i should i speak in mandarin or english you should speak man i mean definitely please make me mandarin so i don't uh um [Music] okay um um who their target clients are and um i think they said they were going after a similar market as a polka dot but you know with clients who preferred something more decentralized joyce did i get that largely right um [Music] so he's um i asked him whether he's wanting to see if there's a kind of need in the asian market or the kind of the global market but he's saying that generally a lot of centralized notes don't really get rewards so uh this is the way for for folks to participate notes and and make rewards okay so that is all the time we have for q a okay thank you so much uh for being part of online and for submitting your hack um thanks okay bye-bye okay so the next project uh is kotani pay uh so steve i think you're on the call already please go ahead and play your demo for us uh steve if there's supposed to be audio i don't believe it's coming through is there audio with the video um right is there audio in the video you might have to stop sharing and then make sure you click the button that says share screen audio can you play stop shopping so there's a button that says share computer sound you want to make sure that's checked and then we can hear the audio from your video okay hello and welcome to gotanibay a middleware technology connecting ussb applications to the blockchain of the 770 million africans registered in mobile network services 440 million are connected through each other while blockchain applications are built with smartphone users in mind ussp is the primary interface of feature phone users in the developing world it has the following advantages there's no need for application installation there's no need for internet access and it is simple to use so what is kotani basa technology stack utilizes usb technology enables blockchain protocols dubs and blockchain fintech companies to integrate seamlessly local payment channels providing a reliable on-ramp and from service to the wide customer base the current version of pratian ebay is integrated to the cellular blockchain it allows for seller to sell the transfers similar to local currency withdrawals local currency to seller deposits with sms notification with url's review and chain transactions and a quaternip defined the kotani defy network promotes financial inclusion by giving users access to a range of financial services it is a decentralized mobile money service owned by catanipe wallet users and agents it provides several advantages including one a low cost of transactions as users move value between crypto and field currency two efficiency defined lending pools and under collateralized learning companies in africa and benefit from a frictionless interruption on our plan three interoperability to various local payment gateways for example nasa andreas the defy network has the following features one an automated market mecha algorithm that controls swaps in the liquidity use any phase results are exchanged for liquidity based on smart synthetic representations of feared currencies on the blockchain three over-collateralization following four data funds transfer a user dials staff 483 star 354 hush to access the full ua system by selecting option one they then receive a prompt to enter the recipient's mobile number upon entering an amount and completing the transaction they then receive a message with the details of the transaction withdraw funds the user dials staff for it they select option 3 and enter the amount withdraw the transaction is completed within a matter of seconds the main participants on the define network are agents and users one becomes an agent by depositing a pair of assets and given ratios into a pool for example 10 000 kenya shillings and 10 000 cusd in the kenya shillings usd pool transaction fees charged and users utilizing this pool are distributed to liquidity providers based on their share of the pool each pool is a smart contract operated by users calling functions providing liquidity is called deposit in a full contract instance automated market maker function users can swap their tokens for other tokens in the liquidity pool swapping tokens is called swap on a pool contract the user is charged a transaction fee during this one for ussd users using the feature phone menu the experience is seamless a user can buy btc simply by choosing the buy btc option but in the background a swap is performed to exchange the asset provided by the user for example cusd or kenya shillings in exchange for btc kotani bay's automated market maker algorithm relies on mathematical formulas to set the price of the token there are no buy or sell orders and traders don't need to find someone else to sell their coins to instead a smart contract acts as a maker in an exchange transaction platform enables the creation of on-chain synthetic assets that track the value of assets in the real world current assets available are the synthetic fiat currencies synthetic assets allow you to receive the benefit of holding an asset without actually holding it while at the same time being able to transact from a blockchain with these assets users and agents of cotanibe who deposit the local currencies into tools automatically create synthetic versions of the same which are tradable on the blockchain across countries and jurisdictions agents on the kotani pay defined network in addition to commission on transaction amounts also earn governance tokens governance tokens and naval agents to approve any new markets in ibm for example usb c gold future the governance token will enable agents to perform more roles within the network such as protocol changes needed for growth hello and great thanks steve um over to the judges for questions and comments i love the background music the background music was definitely cool um and yeah i i like what you're trying to do here so i've got a question steve which is how does um custody work with your product so this study we looked to interface like with a bank account anyone can become an agent by interfacing and a bank api which allows you to provide a like some fear on their account it has to be carried through their escrow smart contracts on the inside of crypto got it can you explain that a little bit more on the crypto side yeah so on the basically uh we we have we working mostly with apis that allow you to like uh if you send some funds into a bank account these are an equivalent amount is credited on the crypto site which allows you to create like a code we've bothered really much from what uni swap has done or of having different tokens yeah as a pull and we are able to now stop and our focus is on the on the on the stable tokens instead of the whole crypto except for the like the main two which is ethereum and bitcoin because they have a bigger market range there are a lot of options for fear on ramp and off ramp right now in where you are you could tell me where you are actually that would be great so i'm from kenya uh not a lot of we actually pay premium for like almost close to six between six to ten percent depending on where you're buying of the like the current market of like bitcoin and ethereum so if you come here you you're paying like five percent more together to get the topics so there is uh so there are a few options but then for for fiat on ramp and off ramp but you still always have to pay a premium for the cryptocurrencies when you buy them yes you have to pay a premium and then it's not very easy to use cozy so like uh the biggest solution here is then i don't know if you're familiar with it which allows you to send a text and be able to like credit someone so we bothered five february from that idea then we wanted to take like the the strength of uh like defy or where anyone can provide that liquidity and become a part owner and then be able by providing that you earn a fee so borrowing from that we can able to create like any any merchant or a shop owner can become like an agent in that network and be able to provide like a way for our users to own online okay well thanks steve and thanks dan as well um oh thank you thank you thank you yeah that was great cheers okay moving on to the next demo the next project up is wrapped filecoin so please go ahead and play your demo for us hi this is uh nazareno and i will show you a quick demo of wrapped uh file coin to start we need to indicate um the amount of file coin we want to wrap then we need to specify an ethereum address where we want to receive the abrupt file coin and a file coin address that i've created before using the wallet so now we need to send 0.1 file coin to this address so we will use the filecoin wallet specifying the amount and the private key of our um wallet and we need to send 0.1 file coin to the custodial wallet and is succeed so now is wrapped so we can see now the amount being updated 0.0.6 uh now we can unwrap same amount 0.1 wrapped file coins so we have currently 0.6 on this account and we need to specify the wallet we would like to receive uh the 0.1 uh the 0.1 file coin so let's check again the balance yeah it's updated as you can see um we wrapped before so 0.1 file coin so we sent a file code to the custodial wallet and the balance now is updated now we can um unwrap 0.1 file coin and yeah we need to connect to the wallets and then we need to burn uh 0.1 wrapped file coin confirm transaction confirm on coven as you can see we uh uh i burn 0.1 wrapped file coin and uh if there is any uh an event that uh emit an event i'm wrapped with the uh with the address we want to receive um the file coin uh the unwrapping process start with burning uh the abrupt file coin and then the back end will send back from the custodial wallet 0.5 file coin uh to our wallet but we can see that we born successfully 0.1 abrupt file coin on the uh account this is important because uh wrapped file coin is an rc20 token a stable coin on deposits on a file coin custodial wallet so we keep the ratio one to one for uh of the amounts stored in the custodial wallet and the total supply of wrapped file coin in ethereum and this will keep the value uh of filecoin in ethereum as well as you can see now is updated and we successfully unwrapped uh 0.1 wrapped filecoin great thank you uh over to the judges for questions and comments very cool i mean i as a like a defy enthusiast i think this is definitely needed what was the biggest technical challenge that you guys had to overcome when you were building this actually since we are have been working for too many months with ethereum working now with a different protocol like filecoin was a very very challenging and hard for us also trying we had to set up our own node and and trying to communicate with the with the blockchain with the fico in blockchain through that node and setting all that working together asking to the to the network if the transaction is completed or not sending actual the the file coins that was our main biggest challenge trying to operate with different with different blockchain and different protocols got it makes sense where are you guys thinking about taking this next now that you have this this is this potentially very large interest you know that many people could be pursuing yeah we are currently on packing and next would be to fully audit the cost code base and include the informal verification and launch main net as soon as possible after that we plan to release a new custodial version by leveraging on file coin smart contract that currently are not available to developers so it will takes a while that's why we we went with a custodial pattern first hi guys nice to see you again great um you know question from me so i think before you move to something that's more non-custodial i think obviously like you know there's going to be some people who might be a little bit nervous about the custodial nature of the protocol so what like you know what are steps that maybe you're thinking of undertaking to you know sort of engender trust and a brand uh in the community and like you know any and presumably as spencer indicated i i assume like one of the primary applications of rap fall coin is d5 and you know trust is absolutely paramount there too so yeah sure in order to build trust uh all the code is open source including uh the back end uh we will definitely look for a custodial um and it's a third party to uh to keep uh track of uh the five coin so uh and also we will uh we'll have like an interface to show the history log of wrapping and unwrapping and keep the user updated about the custodial wallet balance and of course the code will be fully audited including the back end and the smart contract and we and we are using uh as a tex-tec ipfs also textile thread b to keep track of uh the transaction on falcon so we kind of keep track uh of ficon transaction locally so uh to add an extra layer of security and also i can if i can add something we have been researching in in some third parties that can prove that we actually held that deposit like a proof of deposit and that can be an intermediate solution when before we reach the non-custodial approach completed thank you guys thanks thanks you both great project good to see you back thanks thanks okay so the next hack we're going to see is extra peaching whenever you are ready to share your demo please go ahead thanks very much josh let me share with audio here we go hi and thanks for listening introducing demystify which is designed to help traders make better informed decisions so what are the three pillars for better security it's due diligence auditing and insurance and demystify covers the first two pillars well-known facts about the amount that's been lost in crypto crimes which has amounted to billions over the course of 2019 and 2020 so what are the current problems traders don't have better tools to make better decisions which results in the loss of funds smart contracts haven't been audited which results in the risk of security issues and there are unreliable resources on social media that are biased so the main ideas of demystify were built on top of metamask which is a reliable tool and is simple for integration for users we have a library that's based on demonstrated attack vectors and provides informative feedback to the user we use etherscan and crypto scan db to check the contract addresses against the library and we use other data sources for scraping data and monitoring price and fluctuation so why are we different well we're a plug-in tool which is easy to use for users we provide specific analysis of smart contracts and we provide the d5 community with education and safety so what is our business model we have feasibility because we have a team of experienced blockchain engineers and we have extensive experience we have viability because credible d5 firms are likely to invest because they have an interest in users using their credible platforms and we have desirability because users can use demystify at any time and it can be used repeatedly which is likely because end users would utilize the tools every time we interact with a new smart contract so we carried out a twitter poll to see if users would use our tool and 80 said yes and thank you very much for listening this is how the interface will look with this snap plug-in for metamask so when you go to send some funds to an address you will enter the address as per normal you will then choose the amount that you want to send to the to the address now once you click on the next button it will come up with some information that has been retrieved from the back end in this instance it's saying that there is a something wrong been indicated by the smart contract address we can now see it when sending to a contract address which is not malicious and not been flagged as harmful you can see here nice and clear it tells you that you're safe to send your funds to that particular smart contract address okay thanks how big is your team about four of us working on this sorry uh there were about four of us working oh okay awesome okay and was all of the work done uh during the hackathon period uh yeah yes it was got it yeah we there was quite a few things that we haven't finished that we would have liked to like the list of um wanted features is is pretty long but it's kind of building up starting from the start like trying to decentralize it all so we're using pocket network for that to try and uh get off of inferior um and obviously smart contracts being decentralized as well so there are a few hurdles along the way um yeah the idea the sound the concept is pretty sound i think um and it's just kind of making it into a nice package that you can use a metamask yeah for a newcomer coming to the space i would totally recommend this to them just so that in case they get scammed you know um that sounds like you could even make the i mean the warning sign needs to be bigger it should be like a pop-up glaring capital letters uh but i think it's super useful it's a cool idea cool thank you yeah something big red flashing would be nicer like some alarms going off in your speakers maybe yeah yeah exactly yeah i definitely think this is really useful um i'm i'm curious how you guys are uh like ensuring that the addresses that you have tagged are expansive like you know correct and all of those things because you know the mechanism is obviously really really helpful so how how do you guys ensure that yeah it's a very good question so we're concerned about someone flagging something perhaps that was a valid address and so the data sources are from various areas so um scraping videos from youtube is one so to take in data from twitter apis another uh also those two sources so ether scan and cryptoscandb and also feedback from the sort of people using it as well so rather than basing it just on one source or like it is then easy to be spoofed by someone if they want to annoy their friend who's got a contract running then you know it's sourced from a lot more places to kind of balance out the score oh and also i should mention um things like static analysis of the contracts themselves so ecoscan you can get the majority of contracts smart contracts there um either the byte code or the source code for the contract itself so performing static analysis on the code of the smart contract referring that back to scams which have happened uh over the past six nine months there's a good library of those um so you can even if it wasn't intentional by the developers and a lot of these clones as we've seen have been maybe unintentional uh weaknesses but if we can say you know this has been this has happened before there's evidence of it happening uh so rather than basing on kind of a whim or something actually using sort of historical data to build up knowledge about the area and um what data sets do you wish you had that would make this more robust what to make it more robust so i didn't catch the first couple of words what data sets or integration uh well so at the moment we have an idea of using data sets like crypto scan db uh which is quite a nice sort of resource also ether scan i think i mentioned those sources before um and generally just trying to get as many as possible so uh i think one of the key ones is just looking at historical data like sort of saying right this has happened you know people have lost their money there this is that section of code from that smart contract or this is kind of the function that has been um indicated by things such as the uh what's it called as the competition's in there where you're trying to do a sneaky solidity function um and so any of these sources like where we can actually demonstrably show where money has been lost and where people have lost their funds what are the next steps now um finish off the snap which is the plugin for metamask uh finish integrating it with pocket as well had a few hiccups of that and then yeah keep building it i guess make it more obvious when something isn't going right i guess as you suggested yeah i just keep going with it have you spoken metamask team about it have you also met him no no i think they'd love to learn more about this i think you're on the right track and that's exactly what snapchat is meant to do so uh thank you for checking it out cool thanks very much yeah thanks tom and team welcome thanks very much for your time thanks everybody yeah okay so we're going to move on to the next demo um and after this one we'll take our mid-session break in about 10 minutes but the next team is archie so as soon as you're on the call please go ahead and play your number for us foreign manipal institute of technology was recently undergraduated hi everyone this is archie and we've presented this for eat online 2020. what we are we are three students from manipal institute of technology who has recently undergraduated we have made a system in which we can directly give donations which will purchase products and go directly to the ngo cutting out the middlemen in between this ensures that there are secure automated and transparent uh transactions that go through which are using erc20 tokens we're cutting out the middlemen and we make sure that there's on-chain verification that's been done how it's built it's built using a registration is done for users in ngo only a document proof is required for the ngo the e-address is generated on signing up after that users can deposit fiat currency into their account feasible to nominations of donations are possible by the user to an ngo and a progress bar is maintained to ensure that there is transparency erc20 balance is maintained on the hood and the contracts are deployed using matrix mainnet api the main home page of our site wherein several different ngos have listed their services so it can either be a bird service or it can be for poverty evaluation or can be for education now you're going to proceed with signing in from an ngo's point of view so once we sign in uh it can be uh we have to provide the email address and a password this email address is mapped to a unique ethereum address which we will see in a minute as you can see the unique ethereum address has been generated for that email now you can see that this ngo has listed several products which you would like to or less product one product to product three with their cost and quantity the ngo has the option to edit or add further products for listing as you can see it has been changed now we're going ahead with the donors point of view we sign out we can click from the donor's point of view and they also have to provide a unique email as well as a password which generates another unique ethereum address link to that email now the user also has the option to view these products but can pay for them a user can go ahead and add money into their wallet which is a mental currency for now but we can integrate third party apps as well let's go ahead and add 200 2 000 you can monitor this transaction hash given we can go ahead and view the balance as it shows that it is two thousand now we are going ahead and paying for a particular ngo if you donate let's go ahead and donate fifty dollars and you can see that the goal has increased along with the transaction has generated okay the goal has increased by 25 now we're going ahead and donating for the entire amount that's there which is the remainder which is 150 dollars it says the transaction has been generated okay and now this product will get shipped to the ngo with the tracking details we can be found here after you integrate it with a vendor service 100 has been generated now if you go ahead and see our balance our balance has reduced too now we can see the transaction hashes that have been mined on mattek vigil as well giving the events that have been emitted if you see the balance the balance is 1800 200 has been deducted now going ahead to matic go to vetomatic and you can see that the events have been generated we can see the transactions have gone through and future work include the future work include adding three third-party apps like amazon google pay paytm paypal we can introduce app based platform as well and we can use image recognition techniques to see our products also using an ng approval can be added as well that's from our site thank you great thanks guys uh over to the judges for questions and comments uh thanks for this what kind of prompt you guys to decide on building a donor platform i guess what kind of middlemen are you guys trying to cut out so usually in india at least people are really apprehensive donating to several ngos because they feel that the middlemen the ngos will seep out the money for themselves and not actually benefit the target audience so this will clear all apprehensions that the users might have so that's what we thought of when we were building it have you talked to ngos about this project yet at all yeah i was a part of an ngo and they wouldn't tell it phrase first but once you get in touch with them some of them start to be as in it's a bit shady there what was the most challenging aspect that you guys worked through uh spencer said what was the most challenging aspect that you guys went through okay uh i would say the most challenging prospect would be uh looking into matic visuals documentation so we had to rough it up in the first one week two weeks and then we had to make the contracts for it so that took quite some time because the web-based model was more or less we were all familiar with it but writing the contracts took a good amount of time for us have you guys been working in or just kind of dabbling in the blockchains uh on the side uh it's been four months i would say for all three of us since we developed into this field that's very cool you must it must be a lot of stuff that you have to learn yeah it's interesting though if you guys had more time what would you build uh we are thinking of making this product forward like uh the future works that we included we would like to work on that otherwise we have some more ideas in the back of our head that we would like to give a shot um so that's our future work for now that you'd like to delve into yeah it sounds like you're targeting like a direct problem uh that you guys are very aware of so i'd be really interested in kind of seeing your kind of the the attraction there and just just just trying to explain to people the value of you know blockchain technology in that respect definitely look forward to that as well yeah awesome okay well no more questions um then we'll we'll wrap this q a there uh thank you so much uh team archie uh for being part of youth online thank you so much well we would like to give a shout out to saruba namit who helped us with build this project they were like a mentor so thank you cool thanks good job okay okay so we'll take our kind of a mid-session break here um we'll come back in in 10 minutes and the next team after the break will be athlete equity so we'll see you back here in about 10. okay thanks josh okay just about ready to get started uh judges let me know when you're back hello hey there hello okay all right robert um please go ahead and play your demo whenever you're ready god team robbie pledges juan par and me kevin kempto so so welcome to our presentation on athlete equity um three different people on the team robbie clages juan pa and me kevin kim too so quick overview who we are um what we want to do the challenges we faced and our next steps so we built a liquidity pool on ethereum that exposes liquidity providers to athlete performance so what that means is we want to give different interested parties the opportunity to invest in athlete performance meaning that meaning that here athlete tokens can be bought from the pool or minted and when a player performs well the weight of the tool the token in the pool increases um so the framework um we used ethereum contracts in the back end to build the liquidity pool um we have athlete api data that we can visualize on the front end um and there's a smart contract that is used to adjust the weight of the pool according to the stats um that's definitely the vision we had in mind and let's dive quickly into what it looks like so here you can see um all the different all the different game stats and the account and the liquidity pool um so these um stats show right here lebron james and the nba finals game data so the points day one um points per game for different for different teams here is the admin controls where you can start um the season deposit tokens um and if you start the season without if you try to deposit tokens without starting the season it won't allow you to um we'll first get started um here is the liquidity pool where this would be where all of the dye tokens can be seen um diving into some challenges we faced and what our next steps should be um programming side we struggled with the amount of developers that we had and so some of the features that we wanted to implement ended up having to be shelved or really put on the back burner um the next steps that we really see are continuing to build out this product um ideally we'd love to turn this into a fully fudged business where different players that want to invest in player tokens can do so and and that's really the end goal um thank you for your time and awesome uh a word of the judges for questioning comments spencer knowing your intersection of interest i suspect you might have interest in this one yeah this is this is cool i'm i'm still kind of trying to wrap my head around it but i love sports i love d5 so um how so what's the purpose of the pool exactly yeah so each player token is some portion of the pool um the pool is made up of 100 of the player tokens and then as an athlete performs well uh it's weighting that player token in the pool would increase and others would decrease and the same thing for poor athlete performance um you know when a player performs poorly or under uh his or her rolling average of the last 10 games or the whole season um that weight of that player would drop in the pool and the others would increase got it and and um so is it all the players in a league or whatever in that pool or just a you know a defined set or subset of players in the pool i'm trying to understand the composition why we haven't fleshed out our listing policy completely yet but that would be something that we would take into account is um ideally we'd like to have all the players that are a part of that league as part of the pool and does it need an opt-in from the player or can you just like basically mint it given their stats as long as we can bring the stats in then we have the ability to mint the token um we're not completely sure about the the legality or the regulation around offering some sort of token like that um so we we'd appreciate any advice or suggestions on that side but um as long as the stats are able to to communicate with the oracle um then yeah we're we're able to bring it in got it and so the as an end user it's more about kind of like investing in these tokens would you say yeah yeah as the end user you can think of it like gambling or a fantasy sports game like daily fantasy um but really it's an uncorrelated asset so we'd like to see it in some sort of investment uh portfolio yeah got it um so the price fluctuates with the performance of the athlete right exactly is that how it works okay yeah yeah i really like it i mean a lot of times right you have um the only way that you can kind of bet on an individual player's performance is over like a very short time frame right like dfs or something like that and then as you know you get longer you have to kind of use the the teams to that maybe that you know the lakers are going to win a championship so i think this is a pretty cool um hole in the market that you guys are going after what challenges would you see that you need to overcome here to launch it yeah so uh legal challenges and regulatory challenges are gonna depend on jurisdiction we've also had concerns about gas fees and when to enable withdrawals and allow people to sell their tokens into the pool because each time that we are going to update the weight in the pool it's gonna cost some gas so that's one concern we've had um other than that kevin you can add you know anything uh that you like but i i think most of the other challenges were just on the uh experience that you know we've only been working with solidity for a couple months and um that that was really you know just kind of the extent of our capabilities yeah um quickly adding on to that can everyone hear me okay okay yeah quickly adding on to that yeah my personal background was in iot so jumping into ethereum was really new for me um and um those great and fun to learn we definitely needed some more help on the programming end um where we had some hurdles that we just couldn't quite get around um and in terms of like validation for this market um we were able to find like a us-based company that isn't exactly in the niche we are in but they're definitely in a similar enough space that we can see them as a sort of road map as to what's to follow or the direction we can go in how long have you guys been this face um i i've been just looking at all coins and and holding some bitcoin since like 2016. i think the rest of the talent team was pretty much in the last few months yeah and like getting started with ethereum and then in the last you know a couple weeks been working on the hackathon very cool yeah very cool well thank thanks robert and kevin and juan from your team as well uh really cool project thanks for your demo thanks guys yeah good job thanks a lot okay next up is geofile and geofile i understand that you're going to play a video but you're going to talk over the video so please go ahead whenever you're ready uh and we'll get started yeah any chance you can enable my video you stopped me a couple of minutes ago you should be able to reach still nothing oh okay great hey everyone uh so yeah so basically i have two options so i think it's better if i just walk you through the slides so that i can coordinate anyways i'm gonna share my screen and let's take it from there you should be able to see my screen right yeah well good okay thanks so geofile is focused on localized storage uh but uh before i tell you more about local storage and why it's so exciting let me give you a fast introduction on how the current state of affairs are so basically most of the data that we are consuming today is coming from basically on any device either our phones or a desktop machine is going to these three companies and you wouldn't believe what percentage of uh actually requests are going to those data centers but this is not necessarily a problem right now because those companies are incentivized to act as good actors and basically there is no reason for us to worry but this is not something that we can actually uh plan for for the long term and possibly in the long term maybe in 50 years that's gonna change and we shouldn't really rely on this kind of storage now this was the entire premise behind the centralized storage uh and the way that the centralized storage uh differs from centralized storage is in the fact that basically all our files uh can be stored on multiple machines and we can also split the files and store them on however machines we want with whatever redundancy we want and we can also encrypt them there and we can do all sorts of things with that but now uh that's not just good it's also bad for a couple of reasons uh because then we need to ask ourselves a question uh first of all where is my data gonna be sore i mean on which computer is my day i'm gonna live because this is not something that we don't care about i mean uh we would rather have our day on azure rather than on some malicious uh guy computer how can we be sure that our data is not going to go offline how can we be sure that those miners are not going to go offline uh and uh lastly how can we actually be sure that we can retrieve that data maybe we have 10 terabytes of data stored on a miner but that miner has like a connection that is 15 megabytes and maybe has 10 megabytes of upload that's very bad because then it would take us like three days to actually retrieve that area now uh those are all problems that currently exist in the centralized storage ecosystem but on the other hand we have a very big need for the centralized storage uh actually you have so many initiatives in the european union that are pushing uh citizens and companies that are residing in the european union to store all the data in the european union something that probably you have heard about is the case with facebook which is basically unable to uh keep some data in the european union and not in the us because of the way they architected their systems on the other side they are also unable to do that from the governance standpoint because they are still headquartered in the u.s and the the u.s actually asked them to give some data to the government they need to actually do that uh this is something that blockchain storage sold very well and we have seen a lot of need coming from the pharmaceutical companies and in general the health vertical in the european union uh now how geofile works and what geofile does so basically what we do is we have a list of miners we verify those miners we make sure that those miners uh have good internet connections we make sure those miners uh went through our kyc that we know who they are we make sure that uh we know uh hum what gear those miners have that potentially in the future they can be retrieved in a successful way uh from the software side basically what we have is we are talking to powergate uh which is uh underneath managing uh what data goes to lotus which is basically filecoin and ipfs and basically uh depending on the use case of the final customer it's either gonna be hot storage or cold storage uh filecoin is called storage in this case and cloud storage is going to go to ipfs now uh just one i just want to interrupt to note that we're four minutes and 30 seconds in um so your video is supposed to be four minutes long so if you can't wrap it up in 30 seconds and then let's do cue yes okay yes so this is the view that the miner has basically it uh just sets what data you want to store uh and we focus on clients that have the need for localized data or miners that oh sorry all clients that need to give ownership of the data to the final users and these are uh the two companies that we have worked with drive faster bank in our case uh they wanted to unify the api with their customers into different branches for example in austria or in serbia or in romania they want to be sure that they can use the same api and intellis group which is a helped company in switzerland where uh yeah basically what they want is they want to store symptoms on uh the blockchain and make sure that their users have ownership over those symptoms and then they can go to the doctors and basically share the data yeah so i'm just going to keep this slide here and we can wrap up and go to questions so is this a running company now no actually it's actually geophile is not but uh uh before that we worked a lot on uh filecoin infrastructure piece we tried to actually make the infrastructure work and we have the pieces that are necessary for the mining setup to actually be run somewhere for example in our case for rifizan we need a miner in austria first it's going to be our harvard hardware then we are going to try to recruit miners that want to join the network but first we need to make sure that that infrastructure works and that we provide a good service to the final user in this case verify the mac uh in the future what we want is actually attract miners with tools for miners like monitoring tools analytics and stuff like that so that when they use their tools they can basically check that they want to be part of this network as well and we can send them storage deals thank you for the presentation i'm clearly i think you're like um you've stumbled on a market gap here um could you you know for my benefit could you would you mind recapping what you built for the hackathon and what you also looked like but that part wasn't super clear for me yeah definitely so what we built and i'm gonna just play the demo now uh what we built is a platform for miners where they can log in where we can verify them uh and where uh basically we can make sure that the connection is working and uh then we white list them once they have uh went through the verification basically when that happens then we go to the clients and then we see where those miners should be part of a particular deal or not in the case of refusing banks it needs to be in austria romania and serbia so most of the miners are not going to be part of that but in the future possibly those are going to be part of it and uh yeah we do normal things we check that the connection works and things like that some of those can be done with the reputation system of falcon but it's not really complete and the reputation is fine to some degree but you can't really be sure whether the connection is going to be good for a particular use case for example when you have large video files and things like that how are you guys thinking about signing up miners uh we do development tools so basically they have tools that allow them to mine more effectively for example uh what we are gonna work on is an orchestrator for uh setups that have multiple nodes for example uh yeah because filecoin mining is very hard you need to have different machines that are doing a particular operation for example one machine with a lot of ram one machine with a lot of storage and one machine with a very fast cpu uh and uh yeah the problematic part right now is actually how do you orchestrate those operations between those miners and how do you make sure that this is optimal and you seal as many sectors as you can now this is a very nice way to actually attracting them we give those tools for free and then we ask them whether they want to have more deals on their platform if they are minors that actually fills a particular criteria if they are great if they are not uh yeah they they just use the tools great okay well we're other times we'll have to end the q a there uh but thank you for your presentation thank you so much thank you this is cool yeah thanks bye okay uh so next up we have distributed town uh please play your demo whenever you're ready hello everyone thank you for having us one second right so hello everyone this is alex from italy and i'm the team lead of distributed town a self-organizing network based on a non-speculative financial model that lets anyone organize in autonomous self-sustainable communities where every member is rewarded based on the value of their contribution for the community itself now during these times we've seen the rise of the robot work distributed teams and many attempts to communicate and interact with others in innovative ways unfortunately though the dows that decentralized autonomous organization are still too complex and generalized for newcomers also they are too focused on financial rewards that don't incentivize people in long-term relationships and are not based mutual support in the common goal distributed town instead offers a solution based on a non-speculative mutual credit system based on a mathematical proof not only we are building a more meritocratic distributed financial infrastructure for the future but we let users join a community with just one step literally just adding their email address thanks to our magiclink integration after registering uh you new users can select the skills they are the best at and immediately receive credits for them hey there this is lorenzo the smart contracts guy of the distributed town team and i'm just going to take you to a quick walk through to the eat-online mbp version of the contracts that power distributed town the core of our protocol is the community contract which can be interacted with gaseously using gas station network every community has a 96 000 cap token called the ito which can only be transferred from and to members of that community when a user joins a community he gets a certain amount of the ido and when he leaves he has to return them i'm elena and i'm working on the back end of chain data management of distributed time project our technical staff is new js and textile straight the pmailbox we instructed for a database we have a trademark community and this way we store the community data privately and we also use mailbox um for intercommunication between the communities when needed um here on the left you can see the functionality that we already have implemented it's a simple postman collection we have uh we can list communities get community details get the skills tree so that the user can pick skills creating and joining user enjoying community create get and accept kids and listing some user data also we have the create community uh but wait we said it's a mutual credit system so where are the the money actually coming from well once a member a user could then deposit die or usd cb2 using the gasless erc 3009 transfer with authorization function and land dye to other to accrue interest on it so as a final step one of the main issues that we found is related to personal mobility so we created the universal login on the top of our distributed town network it is called skill wallet and you can easily access it directly from your user profile visualizing all your past activities and your current credit amount once you access your skill wallet you can immediately log in to any other community in the network plus in the future you will be able to participate to events or join a hackathon just like this one by simply scanning a unique qr code that lets you in the new community in a few seconds so thank you for having us distributed town is creating the foundation for the future of collaborative economics in a more opened and compassive world based on meritocracy and mutual support join us and help us build the local community of the citizens of the world thank you very much all right i'm back thank you uh over to the judges for questions and comments this is super interesting um guys uh can you talk about the motivations that you had for for building such a project i'm curious if there was um you know something in real life that you had maybe encountered that made you want to build for it well i mean the the simplest answer would be that um basically in 10 years of blockchain we've tried to build better money while i think what we're trying to do instead is to build a better system it is based on value so um basically what we are trying to do is to allow anyone to um manage their own tasks their own community their own accounts in a measurable way and you know focus on the actual goal on actual you know personal contribution innovation and so on rather than speculation so that's mostly like that and also i mean if you see the skill wallet in perspective would be a nice way to move from a place to the other or you know travel the world potentially and contribute to anywhere you go without the need for passports resumes bank accounts and this kind of stuff so mostly it's like a more open world and a more customizable life experience hey guys this is really cool and i like the presentation how you guys distributed the work and it was very thoroughly kind of and well explained anywhere each of you kind of spoke it's probably the most comprehensive presentation i've seen today um so um good job to you guys and my question is kind of what communities would you approach this product with to kind of test out or if you have tested out with anyone using it kind of building that computer needed like that yeah well first of all we started working on this and we completed most of the things they showed during this academy so it's very young and we had a lot of work um but anyway we discussed already with for example bitcoin because let's say since we build we built this protocol called proof of contribution we are able to eliminate any sort of civil attack or pull manipulation from the clr model of quadratic funding from git coin so we empower let's say this approach they have and we allow for example any hacker to join a new hackathon or a new bound and so on with immediate personal identification also we thought about other two use cases that already exist currently we have three categories so the first one is of course blockchain and dlt the second one is art and events so for example if you want to organize art event or if you want to organize a performance or a music event and so on you can immediately do it and the third one is local communities so for example um a couple of years ago i was discussing with one of the biggest waste and energy renewal companies in finland and it's very interesting for them like the possibility to do that in local condos or in a neighborhoods and so on so it is a good way for example for um condos to manage their building their resources and this kind of stuff cool thanks now this is super interesting um one quick question for me could you talk a little bit more about the mutual credit system that you're proposing and how you expect to develop it further um what do you mean develop it further like how do you think of sort of work exactly like you know as you add more members and you have more communities as well like how do you think this will scale okay so um basically as lorenzo showed in the in the demo every community has a cap of 96 000 credits in revolt and um every time a member joins they receive 2 000 base amount of data credits plus all the skills that they that they listed before being able to use their credits uh for example you know creating a gig for someone else or creating a new project or creating a new community and so on they need to validate their skills so we like basically our governance model saves one step and we use game theory basically to avoid you know auditing pools or validation pools and this kind of stuff it will delay a lot in the real world and every time there is a let's say um limited variety of skills within one community what we call the scarcity score activates and sends a signal to other communities that for example a specific skill is needed so if you receive the signal basically you have the possibility to move from your community a to community b and your tokens get locked in community a and unlocked in community b after they scan and validate your qr code your skill wallet so basically we have no problem in scaling and um every community has an account ledger that is fixed so our metro credit is based on an actual proof of contribution and uh we don't it doesn't really matter for us if uh uh whether this you know token has value or not because it has fixed value within our network and no interest in the you know exchange trading and this kind of stuff great okay thanks so much alex and the whole team uh great presentation thanks for being part of the hackathon thank you thank you thank you guys yeah and thank you to my team as well unfortunately i took all the stage but they've been great and i just wanted to thank them all right thank you all yeah good job team thanks okay the next project we're gonna see is called split so the split team please share your demo as soon as you're ready hi everyone i'm james simpson and today i'm going to help introduce split you can find us on split.finance tokens on ethereum represent several properties capital yield and or government's rights split takes erc20 tokens that bundle together several of these components and splits each component into its own token with the aim of enhancing capital efficiency in this hack we've built a way to split compounds lp token or c tokens i've been hacking on this with francesco agosti fabio berger richard galvin and david sun for those who may not be familiar compound is a lending protocol the c token is given to users who supply assets to the protocol and it represents both the holders rights to the capital supply and to the interest generated on those assets on a perpetual basis the core split smart contracts receive and custody the c token and in this example bat and then mint its capital component as well as its forward income or yielding component into separate fungible tokens that can be traded or used as collateral across d5 francesco will now demo how the split product works thanks james this is split.finance adapter lets you interact with the split smart contracts split currently supports splitting combining and managing compound c tokens and their split parts let's see what happens when i split 100 c bat into 2.06 cc that and 2 ycpat looking at the transaction you can see that i deposited 100 c bat into the split fault and in return i received two separate erc20 tokens ccbat and ycbat i can combine those split tokens together on a combined page i'm going to use my entire split token balance for this transaction meaning on my cc bet and on my yc bet and as you can see it means i will get back 100 see that as you can see i get a hundred see that back and i've returned my cc bet and my yc bet finally on the manage page i can see my split token balances and most importantly withdraw yield from my yield tokens it looks like i have some see-through withdrawal so let's do that as you can see i went through my ce denominated yield and i still have my yc tokens if i were to transfer my tokens to someone else for example this withdrawal would happen automatically that's it that's the demo passing it on to richard who will talk about the potential of a split split provides market neutral yield assets such as split seed osce where the holder is buying an ongoing and korean income stream unique income flow opportunities can be created like splitting amm tokens and providing access to low volatility high yielding fee income removing the yield component from lp tokens is likely to allow investors to buy the capital component a reduced cost providing enhanced price leverage split could be applied to any erc 20 token there's multiple multiple attributes like for example kyber networks or yuan these could be split into their three core components yield governance and capital allowing users to sell or purchase rights for governance for example split is a novel protocol and concept for d5 the protocol enhances the ability of users to choose risk award profiles tokens produced by split offer unique income and price appreciation opportunities these tokens can be used on splits platform but also across the port of dfi ecosystem hi everyone i'm james simpson hey guys hey everyone this is very cool and i think it's a very well presented oh there it is yes hey guys can you hear me okay yeah yeah yeah i can hear you okay so i guess what tokens would you start off with as my first question oh we start oh in the demo we started off with all compound tokens i'll see tokens uh so yeah maybe it wasn't explained that much in the demo but you split the compound tokens into only two parts capital and yield the capital portion is kind of uh like residue and then the yield the yield component token is a bit more interesting because you know you you saw that there were about there was about 20 yce that basically means the yield on 20 eth in compound uh and so you can constantly withdraw that yield and it's kind of this fungible token that gives you right to the continuous yield that comes from those two tokens and then we made some more examples at the end which is you could you could split you know governance tokens you could split wifey you could split a whole bunch of other things so i mean like i only on the i mean this was obviously a money market and compound but if you think about potentially uni swap lp tokens everyone complains about impermanent loss you could split um you could split an lp token to a capital yield component and then there's kind of a zero downside um yielding yielding component that people could either sell off if they just wanted the kind of more directional trading opportunity with the capital component um or people could buy if they just wanted that fee and fee for income without the capital exposure yeah guys this is really dope i i love it um i want to use it myself uh are there any trust kind of assumptions or you know additional things that users have to worry about in terms of getting their funds stolen or you know just making sure that everything works properly no tax um so notes no tax yeah maybe james you can take that one well i just so trust i think i think it it is obviously just a hack uh and it and it's just compound at the moment um but if you if you kind of take a broader picture and and think about this with integrating protocol tokens um there is a there is a world where this would be built in quite an integration-heavy way so if you if you're talking about kind of trust in that sense perhaps that that is something to consider from an architectural perspective francesco you you've might yeah i mean i guess i think we're we're struggling on the topic of trustless but it is trustless so it just uses the the c token price feed so there is like it's totally definitive so to speak uh if that's what you need there is no like yeah there is no trust yeah yeah i think that that answers it um like i guess another way of raising my question would be you know when someone splits their tokens are they trusting you guys or someone else that you know beyond what compound c tokens already already make them trust i think they just trust the split smart contracts that's right that's it right they are trusting so there are assumptions made that the biggest assumption is that the tokens in equal tokens out so you may have noticed that you cannot you have no choice in how many splits to make so you have to split equal amounts and you can only split the full set you can't be like i 100 capital and then forget the yield and so and there are a whole bunch of uh assumptions that build off of that um and so you need to trust the smart contracts and guys this is super cool how do you sort of see this trading i mean if you kind of have one unified token and one token like three split tokens like do you think they'll sort of trade bigger than the sum of the whole or yeah i mean that's that's a key assumption that this is kind of a pretty big capital inefficiency in traditional markets as well as crypto the fact that if i just want yield or i just want capital or i just want uh governance rights uh you can't do that you need to get the whole uh token or or share or nothing at all um so we think that that there will be opportunities for the sum of the parts to trade more than uh more than the whole for example if there's a particular activist opportunity people will pay a premium for that that portion it'll still be a discount to the whole um likewise with on the on the yields and capital capital side we think it'll also be a way like a new way for you to sell your token so you can either choose to sell it and sell the whole thing or split it and then sell the parts and i think in a future iteration we would make that seem like that experience very seamless such that it is like splitting and then selling is like using uniswap and so there are some really easy arbitrage loops um to implement great okay thanks so much guys presentation thank you thanks guys see ya okay so next up we have the esports results oracle team so please go ahead and oh actually i think jacob's going to play your video for you so let's jump right in so basically what we set out to build was a oracle connector using chain link to report the outcome of a esports match we ended up using the battlenet apis for starcraft 2. so our first challenge was to connect to the apis and pull data for that we thought was usable to feed to the smart contracts it took a little while but we got the api connected and authorized using the battlenet oauth app and we were able to feed match results back to a contract on the kovan test net this is really just the start of what could be built into a more robust reporting system for esports ideally we'd like to integrate this with other projects and or create a better front end for others to use this and self-report their match data we'd also like to develop this into a interest bearing pool like pool together where users could deposit funds and pool them to generate interest the interest could then be awarded as a prize based on the outcome of the match there are a few different prize strategies that we started to consider using pool together but we did not get that far so that's our hack can't seem to hear you chris still can't hurry like this no headphones um so yeah basically we had a we had a larger idea that we're we're hoping to build over time um which is basically an esports betting platform that's a no loss lottery so interest bearing pools um and with an oracle feeding out the the results of the match so what we focused on right now was just building that oracle connector with chain link i'm trying to get those the match results um through and onto the on chain um going from there basically we would like to create some pull together pools we're not quite sure um there are a few different ways that we've thought about um structuring the pool the strike the the prize strategy for pull together um whether that's just based on a single account and their uh wins and losses whether it's comparing different accounts in specific matches whether there's people that want to come in and contribute uh their their match data so basically we started and again we started also with just um starcraft 2 we explored also starcraft 1 apis as well as rocket league so some of some of the major like competitive uh esports games and ideally we would um yeah develop this into connecting into um some pools that would have payouts associated with them so esports esports gambling on chain um is the is the overall arching concept and this is just the uh first oracle bit uh for the project are there platforms that are already doing that kind of like esports gambling there there are a few that have started and also um also nfts um so giving out nfts for uh gaming and esports participation um which is another thing that we um toyed with the idea but hadn't uh hadn't gone down that rob rabbit hole yet but um there are a few um one that we noticed that's in traditional um using traditional finance like mastercard and visa is called g-loot so it's using nfts and um and i believe some uh payouts just uh usd and cad type payouts um using credit card or yeah traditional credit card providers uh i'm not aware of all that many although i did see a couple different hacks in this hackathon that we're doing um different esports um either results or pooling um for for this kind of um purpose uh but i haven't seen any production ready yet gotcha so so i just a quick question follow up on that um how far along are you with the oracle building so we we have been able to get um results and publish them on chain with the uh on the covant test net uh i wasn't uh our other team member in our does more of the smart contract coding so i don't have the full details of it but he his idea was that instead of running our own oracle we were going to use one of the oracle providers sorry the i'm trying to remember what they're called but basically one of the oracle nodes would host the uh the connector and uh push the results on chain as opposed so basically we're we're forwarding results to an oracle oracle node and they're pushing those results on chain gotcha cool thanks what was maybe the hardest technical challenge that you guys had to overcome with this one so the biggest thing that uh well took us the longest time uh was actually interacting and pulling that the data from the battlenet apis actually um the the interactions with the the oracles and feeding the data back was actually the easier part of this this hack um so yeah it was a little bit strange in that our our blockers weren't exactly ethereum or smart contract based they were more um traditional web uh and api based just trying to make those calls come uh yeah return values that we're expecting and can format into um basically data that we would feed on chain got it um it sounds like there'll be an interest go ahead sorry no worries is there a reason why you guys chose esports like you know is there a backstory there yeah i mean both in our and i uh have we're both gamers uh we've been involved in uh starcraft for a while neither of us are like professional gamers although we have seen um seen players take their play to higher levels and we also just think that um with the explosion of platforms like twitch and youtube gaming and um uh all those kinds of things there's there's we think there's an audience and um a road for onboarding more people to crypto um by using this one of the things that i i like pushing in the crypto space is um low low risk um uh basically gaming um experimentation where yeah people aren't putting in millions of dollars necessarily and we can kind of experiment with where the where the um pressure points and and issues for the systems as they're designed in their early forms and then iterating from there so cool we're really grateful to our knees especially so great job thank you great okay well thanks chris great presentation okay so uh we've got three teams left um and the next team up is symphony gluing together eth tooling so please start your presentation hi there and uh thank you for letting us introduce our project i'm here to present the the symphony project the problem today is that when doing an ethereum project the work doesn't just go into writing smart contracts and the front end to interact with that back end you have to facilitate setting up the development mode a staging node and connecting to a production node you have to handle the deployment of your smart contracts in each of these environments you have to let your front end code be aware of your continuous development of smart contracts in all of these different environments you have to handle advanced upgrade patterns of your smart contracts you have to support multiple wallets like metamask and voltage connect and so on and you should need to do testing of both your smart contracts and your front ends in all of these environments our goal is to make this experience easier for all developers especially new developers coming into ethereum you should be able to use your time on developing actual smart contracts and your front end instead of setting up tooling and connecting all the different stuff developers coming from java and c-sharp are used to create statically typed libraries and we wish to bring their expectation of this into the app development process so you get statically typed contracts right in your ide the web 3 space has already created great tools for this to solve these different challenges that's ethers web3 modal type chain builder and so on but we need some glue kind of to just fix it out of the box our plugins pushes these tools one step forward towards greatness by making all the smart contracts code instantly available in your ide as steve jobs would have said it it just works so first we need to open up the symphony tutorial that we made and we'll start off by creating a new builder project when that is done we'll install the symfony plugins and the dependencies now we generate the front end and when that is done i'll open up vs code and copy and paste a smart contract called the ballot example into this project create the file and paste it in and as you can see and i can now right away use that contract within react project and it's completely statically typed and this isn't in any way sped up so you can just say ballot.factory.deploy and i can see that i need a bytes list so i use ethers utils format bytes 32 to string and i'll create two proposals prop 1 and prop 2. just copy and paste this here and then i'll await my ballot dot deployed to see that it's deployed and then i'll console log out that it's completed and now we'll test this right away click confirm bam deployed pretty fast so now i'll add in a new function i'll copy and paste in there the writes give right to vote function into the solidicon contract so i've extended it and then i say await my ballot dot give right to vote it's there right away and it helps me to fill in the correct parameters i await the transaction and i can log out the receipts and i'll go over here and i'll try it again and i'll deploy the contracts and i will run the transaction and there's the receipt hello so robin thank you robin uh jun and henrik here two from norway one from germany um did you see what happened there um yeah i can just tell you what's on like basically or practically happen uh we created a video project which is uh a tool for creating uh smart contracts and compiling smart solid device uh we included our react plugin uh with the other builder with the prop plugins then we started our runtime and so it compiles and generates uh code and interfaces for our frontend we just then we just copy pasted a random solidity contract in and then this runtime takes uh processing it uh bidders will create a fastness so it's uh and the code generation is also very fast so it's immediate almost immediately available uh in your id and front end because it's statically code generated uh so yeah and if we set up deployment that was also taken care of and we have both have an instance and a factory so you have both possibilities to uh yeah deploy let users deploy it or deploy it yourself in the backend and you can also use providers in both parts so yeah changes are reflected immediately so if you change the contract it's immediately reflected and i'll do a host reload into the [Music] proton ready for a q a this looks great it looks really useful and i'm just curious are you guys smart contract developers this is why you realize this is such a big problem while building stuff all the time yeah yeah we are creating projects for now right now it's uh the norwegian business registry and um property like in norway it's the biggest property manager and the patent office in norway so yeah we're creating this smart contract project and it's not in production yet but yeah we are trying to like get it there so yeah we're definitely seeing the need for this and we use the hackathon for to create it yeah this is super cool if you guys had more time um how would you improve your submission um we we definitely want to [Music] put up more configuration for more providers or like just putting uh default configurations for more providers so we have both the web tree model which practically elects the front and connect to anything and then you and the back end can also connect to anything so uh use those uh and yeah yeah there's many things there but also uh we also wanted to actually reach out to the textile uh sponsor and uh because we now have uh this red in the front end and we also also see the need for uh for example uh saving some uh documents to a centralized storage or somewhere where someone keeps it so creating uh patterns for this uh so they both can like for example create a hash in uh in a smart contract and then upload it in some centralized storage or some decent storage so uh yeah many ways and a hard hat like biddler also came just the day after the deadline builder upgraded to a hard hat so we are we are writing the hard hat upgrade for this plugin already and yeah and just uh getting people to use it uh so we can because we probably have a lot of bugs and many age cases so yeah uh yeah we have many places we want to take it and we probably use it a lot this is fantastic and um could you share how you're thinking about distributing this to more developers getting more people use it uh yeah um so we we see that the when we when we are working on our projects uh those developers we are talking to don't have any experience uh with ethereum so and it's very much to set into and i have to like explain all this tooling that's connected and wired up and how it's all working and if we could just make that simpler so they can join the project and take responsibility for the code and for the solution uh that is uh that that's what we need actually so we hope that someone will use it after seeing this video because it's actually up and working so if anybody can just download it now and try it out and it's of course open source and free and everything amen to that great work guys yeah definitely tweet it and then we'll retweet you guys thanks thank you yeah very cool good job all right thanks guys thanks thank you okay uh so we got two teams left and the next one up is d-pay uh so sebastian please go ahead and play your demo hi everybody i'm sebastian from dpay i'm going to present to you a decentralized payment processing solution that allows developers to easily offer payments to the users but first let me take you on a quick journey imagine you are at a very remote location far away from home you want to pay for a bottle of water in a grocery store but the cashier asks you for 1.3 million laos kit you don't have any of the currency but the cashier tells you that there is a currency exchange right next door unfortunately nobody at the currency exchange speaks any english you leave without the bottle of water this little journey represents how most payments in the decentralized web feel like you want to pay for something you get sent to an exchange and then you might or might not return to pay for the initially offered service or product i'm glad we were able to raise this experience to a new level we've built an easy to implement easy to use payment solution and i'm going to explain to you in detail how that's working if you want to receive payments in the decentralized web you can now use the dpay payment widget you configure what payment you would like to receive for your service or product you then place the payment button and now when your users click that button they will see an easy to use and state of the art payment dialog in the moment the dialog opens dp scans the user's wallet for all assets of value detects liquidity pools that would allow exchanging the asset to what the seller wants rates the potential routes and selects the most efficient route for the user in this example it offers to pay in uni tokens the seller requested 10 compound tokens but because the user does not have any compound tokens nor enough ether dp suggests to use uni tokens as the means of payment swapping it via uniswap to compound and sending the requested compound to the seller all in one transaction if the seller asks for a token the user actually has in his wallet dp is going to suggest to transfer that token directly as it would be the most efficient route but the user doesn't have to stick to the pre-selected route maybe i want to hang on to my die and my ether so i can just select another token as a means of payment hey finally i can get rid of my kick token awesome okay now let's pay wait a little and done that was simple and there is so much more like the wallet connect process or the wallet installation process the token approval process a link to compare small prices gas estimates and network fee configuration and two more things token offerings and token swaps we would love to see you start using dp reach out and we're going to help you implement it thank you very much all right thanks sebastian over to the judges for comments and questions hi sebastian this is uh did you build this on your own yes oh wow it seems very useful so do we think um i guess how would you roll it out and kind of start getting folks that use it well getting in contact with people like if you get started in the scene you have connections to people that already have built the apps and they kind of require certain payments and i think the very first step is just like to contact them and ask them hey look this is something that is going to improve your payment system for your users so how about you just start using it and that way you're also going to improve the product on the zone like with the first 10 users or platforms using the payment uh you're going to just improve it and scale that way sebastian this is pretty cool um can users set rules like for example i don't want to touch these tokens actually during implementation it was like an idea to somehow store configuration of particular users so that the widget always gonna use certain pre-settings for payments just to make it even more convenient because convenience is kind of what we're going for here yes do you guys charge a key uh no for direct transfers there's no fee there isn't there's a discussion or there's the idea that because of the way swaps are calculated and the fact that you see a certain payment price in it once then you always have this up to one percent slippage which is also maximum the idea is to potentially keep the diff that comes with the swap and use that in order to to have to fund for the development of the protocol um sorry last question from me uh so so do you need to approve do you need to give like an infinite approval to use you know all any tokens in your account how does that work from a user experience perspective and also is there a trust assumption there that like you could spend someone's um funds um you need to approve every single token but we are we're we're going for only needing to approve uh every token once because we want to support multiple uh exchanges and during the hackathon uni swap and moon swap have been implemented and we're going for a single token approval so because there that's like a technical boundary that you can't uh break in ethereum one at least but we try to go for one single approval per token but it should be then we can use it to pipe it to any through any exchange yeah this is super cool sebastian um i mean do you see i think you mentioned it like you're kind of you're framing it as payments but like in terms of sort of like um i mean do you see any other applications for this like i see something along the lines of like say bitcoin grants where you're like almost like you know donating your spare change right to some extent the idea actually came up during implementation too i talked about the configuration part and uh an idea has been pitched in the discord which was configuring to send the difference as a contribution to ngos so that could easily be implemented too storing it as part of the user configuration and have the smart contract send those small amounts as a contribution interesting yeah loads more of that to come i'm sure thank you for this thank you very much thanks sebastian thanks fashion okay okay thanks very much um we're going to move on to the next presentation which is accept eth so dawson please go ahead and play your demo when you're ready hello my name is dawson and i'm the sole developer on accept eth accepted is a website for accepting crypto payments when you come to accept youth.com you can create a ui like this for any wallet address we support ethereum and several other cryptocurrencies and it's simple to set up and as quick as 60 seconds let me give you a demo here and tell you how it's inspired to build this givewell is a charity platform that aggregates and recommends the highest impact charities out there in the world they accept donations via cryptocurrency but unfortunately they've just pasted their wallet addresses here the issue with this is that it's ripe for mistake as you can see here i've tried to copy already have left off one letter i could do that as easily here and accidentally forget a letter at the beginning in addition to copy paste issues which of course you can work around if you're extremely careful this is very difficult to pay to from a mob there is no qr code for this accept eth fixes this issue let me show you how i'm going to go in as if i was givewell trying to replace this component on my website what you want to do is copy your addresses let's start from the top again acceptees.com let's try to build one whoops this was left over from a previous attempt so when you land here you're able to add cryptocurrencies paste them in already you can see we've created this url which will take users to the portal to pay this address we're going to continue here and add the rest of the addresses almost there and what we've done here is we've url encoded each and every one of these wallet addresses into an accepted url and what this accept ethe url does is it allows you to then get paid to any of those wallets as you can see here this text input is easily copyable so that there's no issues every part of it is copied in addition you can easily pay to this from a mobile wallet by just scanning this qr code up here in the url you'll see every wallet is url encoded which means it's stateless nowhere is there a database that saves your information your wallet addresses are not associated with one another and your wallet addresses are not associated with your ip address everything goes through the url the last feature i'd like to show off is the ability to then validate an address let's go see if this ethereum address is legit or not huh looks like it is with all these transactions i can assume i didn't leave off a letter or mess up at all here so i can copy it and go pay for my wallet that's exactly next steps are i'd like to be adopted by a platform like givewell to replace their ui component here in addition after this i'd like to be able to accept any erz to any token and auto convert it to eth or die depending upon what the nonprofit is interested in they're not they're not well aware of things like unit swap so be able to auto swap on their behalf before it ever reaches their wallet would really allow them to accept more funds and the more funds the more people get helped with charities like this thanks for listening if you're interested in seeing more about this go to accepted.com on accept.com there's a nice description tells you how you use it unless you go ahead and write out it for free thank you for your time hi folks hey dawson this is really cool i think it's super useful and helpful for folks like you mentioned the non-profits and just individuals who want to kind of welcome cryptocurrency payments on their website but makes it a lot more easy for them but through a qr code and through to do what you've built um i guess what have you built this all through the during the hackathon yep yeah i implemented it across um the two to three week period i got started a little bit late and that's why i wanted to mention for sure the things that i hoped to incorporate one day that i wasn't yet able to very cool yeah i totally use it thank you and um you know are there any other sort of um labs or like uh companies especially in web 2 that you think this might be useful for aside from non-profits like i think it's something that you know when you see this you're like why why isn't this built already i don't marry people doing this because you know we do it as a common um common issue for a lot of people very good question and i was i was surprised by the answer to this question as well which is that there are similar solutions for this on a centralized basis so coinbase for instance has a product that's to support wallets you have with them to accept commerce payments that's called coinbase commerce i do think that the product as you've seen here is especially useful for ngos or donations it would it would need to have some type of validation process in order to be useful for a corporation in that at the moment it is a way to display your addresses but it's not a way to query the blockchain for any updates to those addresses so i think with those additional features it would be very useful for what you just mentioned and yeah i actually had a pretty bad experience during the process after i started this project paying with crypto on a site that used something like this it was like on overstock.com it takes three days for the crypto to become usd on overstock which is crazy because the crypto payment took an hour or less yeah how long have you been uh hacking on blockchains for um i've kind of felt like a poser in the blockchain scene since 2014 so i've always been a web person and in 2014 i made a bunch of like really minimal like trading scripts with javascript and so the reason i always felt like a poser is because i never understood protocol stuff to this day i get imposter syndrome quite a bit when i start into hackathons like this for instance so i really focused on the areas that i know i have a skill set in which is dynamic web apps react projects and i think that there luckily is a gap there to be filled of folks who are really into protocol design or really into implementation of smart contracts but don't necessarily have the interest or drive to build out uis and good user experiences yeah that's well said and i totally agree i think we all kind of suffer from imposter syndrome in different ways right so if you want to get into the protocol stuff feel free to um you know but you did a great job thank you yeah it's very clean it's very easy to use i i think it's just really nice to see like more interfaces that could bridge you know the non-crypto folks with the crypto market and you know generally what we see in the space is that people who are too deep in the space and really aren't trying to bring in new people and that's what we need also so this is great thank you for the support yeah keep building i will awesome job awesome all right thanks austin let's go okay so i've actually got one more project um who needs to be moved into our room um and judges i've been asked to ask you to please uh save and then refresh your judging interface because this last team is going to appear in your list to record scores okay uh jacob maybe you can clarify no one really knows i would just refresh and see what happens oh no all right well that means we can blame you if it doesn't work um all right put it on me the guy who didn't write the code that's fine yeah that that's how this works uh speaking of writing code speaking of writing code uh wallet wizard sam please take it away and um i think oh we're gonna play your video jacob do you mind pulling that up oh all right sorry i didn't notice that everybody on the judge side did it show up for you guys all right i haven't refreshed yet has people refreshed who wants to refresh first oh no i'll refresh i'll refresh here we go no suspense project name yeah hold on wallet wizard gotcha my page isn't loading i don't know that's also normal oh i found it wallet wizard excellent and your scores are there okay all right when everybody's ready let me know yeah you go ahead we're just refreshing the background all right my partner ryan cordell um we spend a lot of our time contributing to ethereum.org and one of the things we think about most is just how can we improve user onboarding to ethereum you know it's a lot of new tech a lot of new tools to learn and it can be incredibly intimidating particularly with you know mainnet gas prices this year to be downloading a wallet to be receiving eth to be sending eve playing with dapps for the first time with real value um so with this project we're hoping to create kind of an interactive tutorial to demonstrate just what it's like interacting with the ethereum network so here the user can land on our home page immediately get started and get taken through this wizard-like tutorial experience where you know they can see a wallet getting created they can learn what exactly that is they can see you know the address we just generated for them they can even receive some eth here we're using the gourley test net and shout out to raul jordan of the prismatic team for helping us set up a faucet but we actually send the user right in our site some testnet eth and you can see we got a little captcha just to protect ourselves from spamming the test net but then the user can see their recent activity you know they can verify on a real live website that this was you know propagated to the network um that it's a confirmed transaction at some point and this is really where we're at in terms of the flow um but where we'd like to go with this is really just continuing to provide more tangible experiences for someone to interact with the network you know actually sending funds and transactions to other users uh potentially swapping tokens or interacting with dapps on a test net just so again they can get a feel of what it's going to be like in the real mainnet experience so a little way to get them familiar with the technology and then send them along their way to actually you know download a a real live secure wallet um and to get up and running so yeah we'd love to hear feedback you guys have and hopefully someday soon you'll see this type of experience right on ethereum.org all right thanks all right over to judges for questions and comments hey sam this is cool i wanted to ask kind of how are you thinking about bringing it to the folks that you're targeting how do we think about bringing it to them yeah you know it sounds like you know this is a great portal for folks who are interested in learning about cryptocurrency uh and you're walking them through with this kind of detail of a very nice ui uh guide uh interface um i guess how how are you thinking about getting traction if you thought that at all oh yeah no well i i am in the fortunate position of working uh at the ethereum foundation on ethereum.org so one of the few privileges of that is like if i build it they will come people will just kind of show up for the website already exactly marketing is like the one piece we don't really need to worry about this is the unfair advantage for you for the hackathon it is yeah yeah distribution is a key advantage for us yeah gotcha that's cool good to meet you yeah for sure but i mean i i think just to start yeah in terms of getting it to people um like we have a like find a wallet and compare wallets experience on the website so it's really i guess aiming to be like a lower barrier or a lower friction point to just test something out and for a lot of people who come to the site who don't even know what a wallet is yet right um to kind of give that yeah that tangible experience for them so we're adding it across the website and on those wallet-centric pages probably i think what this is saying is that she wants to start a tick tock account with this really oh okay cool that's not a bad idea at all that's another good option yeah yes cool and get on it yes and what other kind of user journeys would you sort of feature with this like which other applications like you know what do you think is important in ethereum to highlight today well with context of like how ethereum.org exists today and what we've seen is like a lot of user journeys that are focused around finding a wallet downloading that getting youth receiving youth buying heath and then dapps what are adapts what are example depths what can i play around with and test just to learn about i mean most people just don't come with contacts on the use cases that ethereum is good for so for us it's been a lot of thinking about just how can we make test nuts more accessible and how can we make them actually like useful particularly for onboarding as a place where people can risk free see some of the amazing things that are built and particularly the stuff that i think is like interactive to a degree so they can see hey this is like a bustling peer-to-peer network with all this activity um like we've done work elsewhere with ethereum studio for instance which is a developer ide to build dapps and it's pretty boring just to build an app that only interacts with the with itself so finding ways that we can have users even like interact and communicate with each other is something we'd be hopeful to do where you like i don't know send send some testnet eath to this other user and they can draw you some art or issue an nft um but yeah we're hoping to kind of eventually add some gamification elements for it to say okay maybe read this article around how to protect your private keys and then we can issue this like poe app to give you a badge of honor for learning about this stuff a way to kind of push them through the journey in that learning experience super cool look forward to seeing it more built out okay okay well if there's no more
