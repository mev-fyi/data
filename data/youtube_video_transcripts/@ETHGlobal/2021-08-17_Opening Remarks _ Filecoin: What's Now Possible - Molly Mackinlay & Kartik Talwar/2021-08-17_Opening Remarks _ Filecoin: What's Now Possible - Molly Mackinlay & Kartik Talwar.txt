good morning good evening good afternoon everybody my name is kartik i'm luke and we will be your mc's today for the ipfs and filecoin builders day summit so for those of you who don't know this event in the summit is part of hackifest and all of you are watching this on eve global.tv so for those of you who are going to be engaging with our speakers if you have any questions for any of our speakers from our talks be sure to sign in and ask those questions away and we'll be able to relate those questions uh to our speakers um and hack fest is a month-long event where we have a hackathon going on and we have a couple of summits uh for just what's happening on the hackathon side we have over 650 developers um from 61 different countries uh working on building amazing things in web3 that use anywhere from storage decentral storage to smart contracts um and we can't wait to show you what what everybody's building in the next couple weeks and also part of the hackathon we're doing two summits to highlight what is happening in the ipfs and alcorn ecosystem so today is our first summit uh of uh this month well this is our pillars day summit and then next friday we'll be doing our storage provider summit so let's just jump right into today's agenda we're going to kick the day off by uh doing a keynote from molly from protocol labs and then we have all these amazing talks lined up so just to give a quick overview we'll have alan talk about what 3.store is in nft.storage then we'll have jimmy talk about estuary.tech dan who's going to be introducing the palm side chain and ilya from near talk about how did you enable open web and consumer apps um with entities uh fast we'll talk about how do you actually make really large and updatable and extensible nfts uh using ibfs uh stefano then we'll be talking about the long hash what three accelerator program that they've been working on and then we'll have michelle cover uh how you can get more involved in getting more grants uh from the ibm investment cloudpoint ecosystem foundations and and just uh the projects that you're building to get support and then we'll close the day off by uh blake talking about the face camp program that they've been um working super hard on so a lot of amazing talks for the next few hours and uh without kind of further do you want to just kick us off with our very first talk of the day uh we have molly uh talk about who's going to talk about just what's now possible with valcoin um and just to kind of give a really brief intro uh molly leads the ipf our sort of way pdp pgpipfs at protocol labs and uh i'll uh stop cutting in our time for our talk and just let her kick it off with that today so welcome molly to the stage and uh it's all yours awesome thank you so much for having me um this is super exciting i cannot wait to see what everyone is going to build as part of heck of us um and so excited super excited to get to chat with you today and feel free to continue the conversation um as as we go forward as well as you guys are building things i have office hours i'm going to be in falcon slack so feel free to ping me um and and ask me questions or show me cool demos of what you're doing i'm excited uh maybe i'll share my screen and hopefully everyone can see that um everything's great perfect cool um so what i plan to chat with you about today is really quick overview of the stack which i think you guys are all familiar with um dive a little bit into where we were a year ago um it's crazy to think back into where we were in 2020 the year that is falling off of everyone's brains because it didn't exist because of pandemics but where we were your year ago how far we've come where we are now um what's possible to build now um some areas that are really exciting and some tools that are available to you to build on top of um and then a quick sneak peek into some of the stuff that's coming next um so i work at vertical labs our mission is to drive breakthroughs in computing technology to push humanity forward um we have built a number uh nucleated a number of new protocols and uh ecosystems trying to make the internet more robust um one of those is lapeda p the networking library of web3 which is used by ipfs falcoin polkadot ethereum 2 and many more folks there's ipfs which is the data and content platform of web3 which addresses content by what it is instead of where it's located and now has this really phenomenal amazing ecosystem that's grown around it an amazing community and it's even now enabled on a number of major browsers which is super cool um and then of course falcoin which i'm sure you've all heard about a lot today which is the storage network of web3 um its mission to build a decentralized storage network to store humanity's most important information um the network is made up of thousands of storage providers around the world um and it builds this marketplace between applications like all of those amazing groups building on top of ipfs who want storage in a decentralized network and a globally distributed network of storage providers who offer that uh storage uh to them and so to rewind a little bit the network you know today is still super new um and so where we were last year uh was a different place um a year ago i spent most of my time staring at this super fun snazzy gantt chart uh i don't know if anyone was familiar or part of the the falcon ecosystem back then but august 2020 was we were in the midst of this like space race calibration period we had not started space race which was the file coin incentivized test net competition um that ran for kind of a month before the the main net started um hackfest had just completed um and you know there were just a million things to land in order to actually make make file coin as a network live um so here are some old snapshots i pulled out of old old all hands decks that i had from back then it was like the the test net in august 2020 was like barely limping along calibration that had just gotten to 10 petabytes of data we were like psyched i was like oh my gosh 10 peppabytes that's super cool um you know fast forward to today and we blow 10 pep bites out of the water but but that was cool at the time um and space race was uh you know in active preparation we had this um kind of calibration space race foul point where we were um looking at the deals storage and success rates for storage and retrieval across all of the folks who are participating in the space race competition super excited after you know tons of time working with groups like we've gotten to 72 percent of storage providers were dialable which is like really exciting and you know crazy to think think that far back into where the network was back then um a couple other exciting things that had we're landing in the the month of august um balcony had just implemented uh eip 1559 so that we had the the gas model which i believe has just rolled out for ethereum so uh we've been playing around with it for the past year and it's been awesome it's been what was a big differentiator for us in terms of making sure that uh um like networks and messages and transactions flowed really smoothly within falcoin um message selection was a big part of that as well um slate had just shipped building on top of textiles powergate which was pretty much the builder's tool that was available to people at the time i think uh at that point textile powergate was maybe like a month old and available really just for haccifest developers and so amazing to see how far the textile team has come since then uh in kind of the the additional kind of solidity and and um tooling that they've built on top of this which is amazing um and then yeah hack of us had just wrapped up and a ton of amazing projects coming out of hackerfest uh went on to other accelerators to launch into the ecosystem and kind of evolve and continue offering um kind of new new solutions to people in the web through space which is super cool um then you know fast forward to two months uh into the future october 15th the falcon network went live with main net liftoff which was a really big milestone for a lot of groups um and super excited to kind of like start that new phase of the falcon journey um and now kind of looking where we are you know about 10 months later uh the network has already amassed eight exabytes of storage over 8x bytes which is just crazy to think about i think i would have this blows my expectations for like where we would have been by end of year 2021 like completely out of the water and that was even blowing the you know remember 10 petabytes was really exciting uh back during uh you know early days of the network so to reach this point is really cool um to amass all of this storage capacity that's available for web3 developers um you know anyone in the the wider internet ecosystem who make wants to have kind of decentralized storage for their tools and protocols and there's also now you know a huge and growing ecosystem a ton of open source contributors and a good storage provider community as well um and so to kind of look at that you can see here that you know the amount of available data in the network has been growing a ton and this is actually already doubled um the storage onboarding rate has doubled just in the past month since the hyperdrive network upgrade that went out in um end of end of june and so we're right now you know we're seeing this growth rate continue to ramp up i think it's likely that we're going to hit 15 exabytes or more by end of year so it's just a really crazy um kind of war chest of data capacity to to bring to bear on all of these applications um and it's part of that that's creating a lot of demand amongst the storage provider community for amazing data to store so um lots of lots of groups are really reaching out to folks who can act as really valuable clients who can bring kind of public data sets into um the falcon network and demonstrate how uh you know amazing this solution is for them and so um definitely if if you are someone who is you know tooling in those uh open dataset communities i think there's a lot of opportunity here um as you can see storage deals as well utilization of that capacity has been growing super fast um you know since like uh january of this year it's just like you know whatever forexed 5x um it's going really uh growing a lot uh which is super exciting but also we have so much more to do here and an area that you know a ton of folks in this space are investing in super hard um the ecosystem has grown massively in just the you know less than a year that um the falkland network's been live a ton of amazing partners have joined this uh awesome ecosystem to help build the network here um and there's now a ton of applications tools um you know developer sdks that are available for you as builders to build on top of and harness as part of your ipfs and falcoin web3 builders journey um and so that's actually the thing that i want to spend most of my time today chatting about which is what's now possible what can you be building um and i know a ton of folks who are participating here in acamas actually already had a long chat with juan about all of the exciting things that could be built here um i know there was a big brainstorm session earlier this week if you missed it go check out the video um it's on the global youtube page i watched it i thought it was amazing i'm super excited about all the stuff you guys are gonna be building um but i just wanted to highlight maybe three areas which i'm really excited about and i think there's new tools that have just become available for you to build on top of um and want to make sure that you're all aware of them so that you can you know blaze forward in your developer journey um and can kind of build on top of the shoulders of everyone who has come before and focus on really reaching um users in the web 3 space or building the thing that you know really sings for you and you don't have to go and kind of uh reinvent some of the underlying building blocks um and so those three areas are one web three native dapps on file coin building on top of all of the amazing dev tools from powergate to web3.story which just launched last week um building things around nfps nft marketplaces mentors galleries on hub of foulcoin using nft.storage um which has been around for a couple of months now is being used by folks like openc and others um and then building uh applications around photo video large data archives um pulling on some of the amazing kind of uh pioneering work that starling and internet archive have been doing around using falcoin as a verifiable storage layer so those are my three areas i'm going to chat with you about so first web3 apps notably things like satellite or audios are doing an awesome job here in this space um because it's a super exciting area and there's a ton of tools that groups who are excited about building new web 3d apps can use uh i mentioned slate already um they're an awesome uh they have like a whole developer aspect as well they've created both an application and a ton of building blocks that developers can utilize um to kind of leap frog forward and so definitely go check out slate and see if the they're a great place to build on top of i know that folks have probably already seen the the talk that carson gave earlier this week about the work that textile is doing to bridge fabcoin into various other ecosystems and so the they already have the near bridge set up i believe they're bringing it to ethereum and um i think it's polygon in kind of the next short short time period and so this is a really cool kind of leap frog forward if you're building things kind of in the smart contract space and you want to take advantage of decentralized off-chain storage because punching storage doesn't scale nicely um then definitely definitely go check out what the textile team has been building um their implementation of kind of auctions for this data is pioneering and awesome and we're all like you know cheerleading and learning from it and figuring out how we can bring it to more things and so um they're an awesome toolkit they also of course have powergate 2.0 um which you know uh is the iteration from the 1.0 that launched just over a year ago uh and so they've got a ton of tools here especially if you're building kind of like a dynamic application um on top of filecoin fleek is also an awesome to look at they have a files app demonstrating use of the space daemon which packages together ipfs textile um and aims to make a really easy developer sdk if you are doing something that has maybe a static front-end component to a smart contract back-end fleek is also going to be your best friend when it comes to deploying say like a d5 front end um you know really smoothly from github they are kind of your netflix netlify easy replacement um i can deploy a website on fleek within like three button clicks or something at this point which is just kudos to that team for doing an amazing amazing job on the developer experience side um highly recommend go checking it out um you should probably also check out ceramic especially if you're doing dynamic document updates um i think they they just recently launched their mainnet it's super super cool and if you're doing anything around private encrypted data um definitely look at the the kind of pioneering work they've been doing around um doug jose dab jose um and they've been like really pushing things forward there um also bring in a lot of the decentralized identity part that many application builders want to to utilize and so go go check that out and again there's i mean so many so many of these that i could just go on and on um definitely check out truffle if you're doing anything and you want to be kind of testing within their amazing developer tools um like ganache and of course metamask i i feel like their phil snap is like almost going from developer beta to like actual open access uh usage but um if you're if you're aiming for the the lightweight ease of use of a metamask integration there's a filecoin snap for you um and of course i'd be remiss if i didn't also mention web3.storage which you're gonna actually get a whole talk about um right after this from allen but um awesome easy new storage layer for all of your favorite web3 assets to store them really really easily this is a it's a data it's an aggregator and a broker in falcoin network terms which means that it helps take many many many small files or like app uh data objects and aggregate them into filecoin deals and it does deal management deal brokering for on behalf of all of these clients and then it gives you back um all of the information that you need about uh what deal all your data is stored in um and how long it's going to persist network and all of that sort of stuff and it's super easy um i think the the record is i'm sorry if i'm stealing allen thunder 56 seconds from sign up to having submitted their first stored their first file on filecoin so that's amazing uh talk about uh developer kind of throughput in terms of being able to have just like a drop in place solution to then move on to all of the exciting hard stuff when it comes to building applications on web3 so um i'll i'll not steal any more valence thunder but definitely go check this out okay next space nfts nfcs are like my favorite thing especially when they're cats but there's so much cool stuff happening here i'm sure there's a massive community here in the haccafest hackathon who are building cool new things in the nft space or cool new things in the nft gallery museum space super cool the metaphors is is meeting web3 and i'm so excited about it um but nft storage should be your best friend um it's really easy to use you can store nfps up to 32 gigabytes per nft which i haven't met anyone yet who needs to blow past that limit but uh maybe it'll happen uh in which case split it into multiple use web3.storage perfect um but definitely come come check out nft.storage it's a super um useful tool it helps you be protected from things like rug pulls lost nfts insecure links um size limits from other tools all of that sort of stuff and um i think i think we've yeah we just crossed actually sorry my slides saturday we just crossed two million nfts stored on nft storage um many of them are coming from ethereum but they're also coming from places like polygon and other places um and definitely go give it a try it is almost as easy as weapon.storage maybe it's easier i'm not sure but it's amazing so uh go give it a try um this has been used by folks like openc to do their freezing metadata feature that they launched a month and a half ago or so and there's a lot of great content here about how you can use ipfs and falcoin to uh kind of support the the really critical parts of addressing and persistence for nft so we can make sure that this you know collective cultural work that we are building in this nft collection across all of these amazing creators um you know we'll be here two five ten years from now and um all of those nfts kind of stick around and stay super accessible um and yeah just just a reminder to folks that drug pulls are a real thing and definitely use ipfs um use file coin to make sure that your your data stays around long term um my last and third area is around photo video and data archives and the amazing applications you can build around this actually audience is another great example of this where it's all of this amazing audio content that's being um kind of minted in a way on the ethereum blockchain and stored um on ipfs and i believe filecoin at this point um another great example of someone who's building around this is internet archive they're bringing a number of their um kind of like archives of of amazing you know talk about humanity's most important content uh most important data that we've amassed bringing this to falcon as part of the the falcon archives project um and i think that's really exciting here i feel like there's actually a lot of opportunity for builders there's fewer developer tools here so that means there's an opportunity for building tools both for developers and for these large storage clients um to make sure that um all of this data can can move smoothly around in the web3 ecosystem because we're talking big data here we're talking peppabyte data sets um and so it gets exciting um but that's also a huge opportunity um for liquidus to jim for for building this um visualization but there's a huge opportunity to apply uh the the marketplace example from nfts to large data sets as well as i mentioned there's eight exabytes of capacity there's a ton of storage providers who are really looking for how they can bring their storage content storage capacity to bear on humanity's most important content and making doing the matchmaking between large clients who have peppa bite data sets and large storage providers who really want to put their capacity to use it is a new opportunity just like the marketplace between a nft creator and an nfc collector and so um would be excited to chat with any group who's looking at this intersection and wants to build uh kind of a an auction house for data sets or tools for enabling the the kind of interaction between these two groups um i think there's a really exciting space i know a number of large storage clients who are like wow the the 10x multiplier for storing large data i would pay a hefty penny for that um and so if if you are um excited about this there may be a lot of opportunities for you as kind of a broker or clients to to build um an idea for people who are building on top of such data sets is the work that um that the starling foundation where starling has been doing with the usc showa foundation um for example with their photographic archive of trust which documents the uh 2020 primary election i believe um it's beautiful it's like this this great overview of kind of how they used um kind of on on-device capture of metadata um storing like chunking this data storing it to file coin and then visualizing it from a user perspective so that anyone who's browsing kind of content and i believe it was reuters in kind of like the reuters ui can see where images were taken and verify that kind of the the cust custody supply chain of that data so that they can increase their trust in in media i think this is a really cool example and it really builds on top of this kind of checkpointed use of a distributed storage network and the verif verification of the proofs of storage um really using falcoin there to to show you know yes this is the exact content content addressed um that's been stored here over time uh and can be persisted long term um in a way that everyone can can verify um and so i think this concept of verifiable storage is a really interesting idea that a lot of kind of large archives or um kind of large data set communities may find really exciting um so that you can kind of look at these continuing continuous audits that data has been publicly um stored verified and stays available um and i think there's a lot of a lot of opportunity around that i'm almost out of time so i'll just give you a quick preview into a couple of things that are really exciting that are coming next i already mentioned nft.storage and web3.storage but um it's still new that you can store up to 32 gigabytes per nft so go and take advantage of that would love to see some video nfts or metaverse nfts or other really cool things that are are being kind of built and stored here and definitely take make use of web3.storage which is brand brand new off the presses um new another new area that's coming up is this kind of cheap fast verifiable storage through things like the the bridge work that textile has been doing and also some of the work that's um kind of uh in the works around content indexing so you might have heard about car v2 if you pay really close attention to the filecoin ecosystem but there's a lot of work happening to make sure that all storage deals that that get stored on fellcoin are also indexable and accessible um through ipfs gateways and so a lot of work is happening there get excited about it should have some more information in the next couple of months um third there's a new fip that you should check out i know people here probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about fibs i spend a lot of my time thinking about falcon improvement proposals um and it's super exciting it can make um storing data and deal making like hundreds of ex faster um cheaper easier and it really unlocks all of the storage capacity that that um storage providers have amassed so far so that you can make deals for you know hundreds of peppabyte archives really really quickly um and that's super exciting and it just brings the accessibility of this technology so if you're gonna be building something for the next month think about how you can kind of um parallel that work um with some of the the new fips that are landing here as well and how you can take advantage of them and finally this is an area i'm super super excited about is really opening up falcoin actors in many ways to uh more developers as well bringing things like edm smart contracts into foulcoin um this is still in super early days from a design perspective go check out the fifth issue if you want to kind of contribute your two cents or if you have a lot of expertise uh with the ins and outs of solidity and have a a lesson or two to share but i'm really excited to make all of the storage in filecoin programmable and accessible through kind of a um you know a smart contract layer there as well so that we can script things like um the concept of repair miners that just automatically on the falcon blockchain make additional storage deals to globally um end up with many redundant copies of your data and and much more um so much is going to be interesting here from a defill perspective as well which is like a d5 but with fall point um anyways there's a lot of really cool stuff and i'm so excited to see what you all build because there's um you know an amazing amazing community here and um i know that folks are gonna just blow everyone away um so with no further ado get building and i'll hand it off to alan to talk to you more about web3.storage and how you can build on top of that um feel free to reach out to me at on twitter or on southwindslack um eight on twitter i'm going back to on on falcon slack and happy to chat more
