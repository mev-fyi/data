good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is uh kartik i'm one of the co-founders of youth global and it is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our eat online finale so i have a lot of things i want to chat about and what i'll do is kind of just jump right into it we've all been experiencing a lot of interesting things over the past few months and for each online what we decided to do was make this a bit more of an interactive experience for all of us so we're all on live.ethonline.org and the thing that kind of we wanted to do was create our own shared experience of a world computer so we decided to make this platform that makes it easy for all of us uh to kind of experience this whole event uh in parallel and we got some creative things around here where we get to experience different uh themes uh different ways to kind of see what's going on in the event so you can do anything from checking out the schedule to uh check out the the arguably low gas prices on the top right and also uh the chat that we have a few hundred people uh joining in on and uh and uh chatting and commenting on what's going on with uh all of us today so i encourage all of you to kind of sign to the chat so you can give us any questions or comments and uh with that i want to kick off with today's show so this is a very interesting and important day for us because this marks uh as the last event for eve global for 2020 and uh and of course it's been a very interesting year uh the goal for eve global is uh is our mission is simple it's to onboard as many developers as we can into the weaponry ecosystem and want this place in the space to survive and uh it has of course been a big year so what i wanted to do was sort of go into how we've kind of what we've done this year as you global and just uh and also share what we have plans for as a community and and eat global and really sum up what's happened uh in the world of developers for the ethereum ecosystem uh and then um as all of you waiting for the demos for our hackathon so ethereum is a global community and youth global taps into this community across the world and runs events in person and online for these ecosystems and we do best do this primarily by running hackathons and also summits so this year we kind of kicked off by doing east london we hosted our only in-person event this year earlier this earlier in q1 and we had 200 hackers from london and a lot of neighboring european countries and we had 50 submissions for this in-person weekend hackathon then the world changed and uh in in may we ran our first ever online hackathon hack money which was a d5 focused event and uh for hack money we had 354 hackers um who collectively worked on 116 d5 projects then we pivoted we didn't believe it we actually collaborated with protocol labs and ran our event hack fs where we had 466 hackers work on integrating uh decentralized storage with smart contracts and the heck of us was an amazing success and we kind of continued our partnership with oracle labs for our future events as well which kind of got us to eat online eat online was the month of october we took uh the entire sort of month from the second to today uh to focus on summits and the hackathon the hackathon piece was the first three weeks of october that included last thursday and we have our finale today along with our last summit and we had the pleasure of hosting 700 hackers and over 2 600 summit attendees who span from 65 different countries in 19 different time zones we were absolutely blown away by the interest and the the reach that these events have gotten especially as we transition to a bit more of an online setting and collectively the 710 hackers submitted and worked on 175 projects and this is just absolutely amazing because once we kind of put all the numbers together we had a hundred seventeen hundred and thirty hackers this year who collectively contributed 473 projects uh to the theater ecosystem and the part that makes me uh happy the most is a few of these projects uh became some well-funded companies a lot of them stayed really interesting and fun experiments but 100 of these projects were built because the team that built them really wanted that to exist and they did it for their own benefit and that's really the ethos we try to kind of continue at each global and in this space and today is going to be no different so on top of all that this kind of is really well tied into why we chose today for our impact as the topic for the last summit uh beyond just showcasing what we've seen in this space from the developer side ethereum has had an enormous impact in the web 3 but also just the global economy this year and we want to really highlight how that's touching a lot of other industries later today so let's come back to eat online uh for those of you who are watching in and we're not participants eat online was structured to be the hackathon in summits uh the hackathon which was the first three weeks uh kind of concluded last thursday then we had five summits uh our first summit was uh our kickoff summit where we did a lot of introduction sessions on various things that we were gonna hint about for the next few summits and that took place on the second of uh october then we moved into scaling and infrastructure where we talked all things layer two and that happened on the ninth uh friday the ninth of october then our summit on the 16th for about all things defy on what people are excited about what people are building we're gonna see in the space over the next few years and then last friday on october the 23rd we had our summit on the future of ethereum where we talked about all things eth2 and what all of you can look forward to very soon and today of course is our summit on impact and to kind of see what we have in in the works um you can open up the schedule module on your live page and check out all the talks we have planned for today and i i do want to say this thing a few more times your excitement has been absolutely phenomenal we've seen so many people get excited about the things they've been able to learn uh they've been able to build the help they've been able to get and just the support they've been able to get whether it's from our sponsors or or other developers and mentors so these 175 projects presented to our judges over the weekend a few days ago and from there we saw a massive spectrum of projects that everybody tackled on we saw people working on defy in nfts we saw people working on dev tools and decentralized storage people played around with governance and dials and people also tried to integrate scaling and layer 2 solutions into their hacks and we're really kind of seeing this audience push forward how we want the next few months to the next few years to look like and it's really kind of amazing to see and get a preview of what's going to be on everybody's list uh six months from now today and we want to kind of give you a peek at that as well not just the hackers we had 120 mentors that were available for this event and we had participation from 36 different companies these are just some of the faces that we were able to put up on the slide tech but these are people who are there as judges speakers mentors and we had an amazing set of companies that were here as sponsors and just overall um companies that agree to kind of give their time to a lot of our developers to help them not only just understand uh what they can do with their protocols but also we're there anywhere from daytime to 3 a.m at night so you can really help address any technical issues these projects were having a lot of them were beginners to really kind of understanding and giving them advice on best practices to how they can make their lives easier and unblock themselves as they were continuing to finish their hacks so i want to thank all of our sponsors for kind of just being with us for the last month as well and uh that kind of brings me to uh the the main event for today which is our demos so 175 of these projects uh went through uh judging and from there we got these 12 teams that are going to be presenting to us um on this call these were some of the the 12 most creative things that we found and uh we're super excited to have all of them kind of come on and showcase to you uh all what they've done uh so what i want to do is just in in a particular order kind of call out all these teams i want to thank all of them for uh kind of being with us today on this call to demo so we have uh liquid l2 but flashbang stop loss syndicate and unite and then mindful protect protocol croco finance space dx art stall and d pay these are some really really sweet hacks that we're going to see today and we're going to sort of talk about how we're going to structure the rest of these demos and as we were kind of thinking about how to bring the teams on this call for the demo we kind of noticed some really obvious themes that a lot of these projects tackled there's quite a few number of projects that are working on consumer adoption whether that's for payments or for for uh investors and kind of managing uh portfolios to people who are solving scaling heads on with really creative solutions that kind of are compatible with what we are doing today in in web3 and ethereum and then we have a super interesting theme about people really kind of getting to manage and uh increase and collaborate with their community so we have a lot of projects that are solving that problem heads on and then lastly um it should be no surprise that there are a lot of d5 projects and we're going to see some really creative protocols and primitives today as part of these 12 teams and kind of before we jump into demo i really want to kind of take a few seconds and point out that just because your project was not on this list of 12 it does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong uh this is meant to be a celebration uh and and not a competition so i really want to thank all the 163 teams here on this slide to uh kind of really continue building what you've been doing for the past few weeks this is a place for us to give you the support you need to get to that finish line and not just because that's kind of what the structure of the event is but also this is what we want to do after the event finishes a lot of you've already kind of reached out to us and talked about um how you can make what you help you need to bring this uh to reality and really finish what you originally wanted to do so we encourage all of you to kind of reach out to the global team or our sponsors our mentors with any help you need to kind of continue building and uh and as you kind of showcase what you've done i put those links and demos and websites for on the event discord there's thousand over a couple thousand people on our discord that are waiting to give you feedback and check out and try your projects and i really encourage all of you to to do that so on top of all that every hack that came out of this project is available to see on hack.ethglobal.com so if you ever want to catch up on what these themes are or which teams kind of worked on what problems you can always go to this domain and see the list of all projects so that said i want to sort of jump into our first few demos and we have four special guests who are going to be joining us today uh to help with uh kind of sharing that excitement with us and i want to welcome andre uh who's also known as rac and grammy award-winning artist i want to welcome camilla russo from the defiance uh stani from ave and ashley jab from uniswap they'll be with us for the next couple of hours uh looking at and commenting on and giving a lot of feedback on these 12 teams and with that we are ready to get started so what we're going to do is we're going to bring on our very first category of projects and that is going to be the consumer categories at this point like to kind of have all of our our special guests and judges kind of turn their cameras on and say hi to uh to all of our our audiences um and uh we'll have these four projects come in order so we have mindful but kroger finance and depay they'll come one by one and we'll present their projects for five minutes and then we'll invite all of them back for a group q a so without further ado let's get our first ever demo started and i want to welcome the mindful team and i'll let them sort of kick it off with their first demo cool just sharing my screen here we can see a crypto degenerate in his natural habitat he rejects crew and safe strategies in favor of being enabled buying tops and selling buttons time and time again demolishing his hard-earned gains through any chances of accumulating generational wealth training is a hard game to play but what if you didn't have to play it the daily normal one say discipline smart contract-based investment strategy to happiness and discipline degeneracy leads to suffering it is time to silence join a degenerate introducing mindful portfolio behind meant for degens thanks for that intro david so now we're going to dig into mindful what we built and how we managed to solve portfolio alignment for degens so a bit about the team we're all a bunch of dj's who all suffered a common problem and that was that we would trade these crypto assets farm pickles make money but normally we would end up losing more money than we thought we should have we always had this issue of buying assets and never really selling them and struggling with figuring out when we should enter an exit into the market so the solution we came up with was a product called mindful which we'll dig into now and just a bit about the team you can see from all our flags that we're from all around the world and i think that's a really important thing about the ethereum ecosystem to have diversity and variety so what we built is a tool that lets you create your own portfolio of assets uh you can define what assets go into this portfolio and then define some strategies such as dca into the strategy that will automatically market by the tokens within that strategy and then you can sell tokens from the strategy when certain thresholds are met what makes mindful unique is that these strategies are set and forget they're codified into smart contracts and that makes them completely trustless you own this strategy which we call a chakra and you can completely have like self-sovereign ownership over that um it's automatic profit taking uh is also an important part here in the sense that we have like a relay network which we'll dig into a bit later that will automatically execute these strategies on your behalf and the last cool feature is that these are balancer pools so you actually get fees from using these chakras as people trade against your assets so we're going to jump into a demo so we're going to start off by creating a chakra so so we can name it and then we can go and specify some assets so let's put some uni in this just put some cream and let's put some uma so this is a very mindful strategy we're going for here we can specify the ratios and we really put a lot of time and thought into the ufx so we can specify how much we want each of these assets and then we can see the breakdown next we can choose what the initial contribution asset we want to use so we could do something like other interest bearing dye or usdc and that means that we're going to actually like take tokens out of our wallets and buy in the proportions that we define in the in the table here so we're going to convert 100 usdc into this proportion then on the next screen we can define these strategies and this is really the key of what mindful is the first one is the dca strategy so we can specify the frequency that we want to perform actions that say weekly and then say like what token we want to actually trade at a weekly frequency so maybe an interest bearing token again is a good idea so we specify how many tokens we want to put in and that will then trade on a weekly basis this number of tokens into the chakra we can then also specify a profit taking strategy so this will be a percentage of the chakra or a percentage profit so we'll say for like every 10 increase we want to take five percent of the chakra in some other token so maybe you want to take your profit in with or you want to take your profit in another interest bearing token then finally we get like the confirmation screen and we can deploy the chakra for now mainnet deployments are disabled because we've got to be mindful and haven't had an audit yet which is kind of important so just to jump across to a sample checker to show you what the interface looks like so we can see this is an example chakra with some assets in it which look pretty good we can see like the historic values over time we can zoom in and on in and out of this kind of xerion type interface you can also see some information here we can fomo in which is effectively a deposit form out which is like a withdrawal we can edit the strategy edit the dca strategy edit the profit taking strategy we can view the asset breakdown of everything within the chakra and lastly view the history of all the actions that the chakra has done so how does how does mindful work so each of these chakras is a smart balancer pool which is deployed using the mindful proxy and basically the mindful proxy has special permissions over the chakras which lets another a network of relayers perform specific actions like doing the dca strategies uh and the profit taking strategies um when a dca strategy is executed what happens is that the the asset that you're trading gets transferred to the mindful proxy and then traded on uni swap for the underlying tokens within the balancer pool and then deposited it into the balanceable we use uni swap to avoid any kind of slippage and basically the inverse happens when withdrawing so what's next for mindful so any kind of prize money that we get at the hackathon and any fundraising we get afterwards first and foremost is going to go for an audit because you can't like launch something like this and call it mindful unless it's been automated and then the next thing is we want to build like a find a guru strategy uh functionality which basically does like copy trading where you can view other mindful portfolios and copy those chakras um there's a bunch of other stuff on this list that we want to get to but in the interest of time basically we want to make the product as good as possible and accessible to as many people as possible so this is mindful you can follow us on twitter if you want to stay up to date when we launch on mainnet and yeah thank you for your time awesome thanks chris so what we'll do is i know there's a lot of questions already we're going to have from all of us here so i'll just ask all of you to uh to stay on the call and now we'll move on to the next demo and we'll just bring all the questions back to the q a so uh next up we have uh chris who's going to be talking uh for batwa and chris whenever you're ready feel free to share your demo okay hi i'm chris and i will talk on behalf of batwa batwa is a new concept for cryptocurrency in india we are an international team of three women and two men with a nucleus in the himalayan mountains and a satellite in new delhi the word batwa is a phonetic spelling of the word wallet in the hindi language the aim was to paint a picture of what is technically possible today combining some well understood crypto primitives with an emerging layer two solution and some bespoke development to make a robust and usable wallet ready for adoption the project delivered a simple mobile first web wallet interface with mata meta transactions on layer 2 which allow users of the wallet to transact with rupacer an erc20 stablecoin pegged to the indian rupee india really is a diverse country but is united in using rupee digital payments are already common with users scanning qr codes and paying real money for meals out street food and accommodation paper money has obvious challenges in india and scenes like these happen on a weekly basis so with a population of nearly 1.4 billion and 700 million smartphones it's reasonable to expect better to find product market fit in india so let's dive deeper into the project we started with user research exploring a wide cross-section of the population one persona was ramish the chaiwala he does not have a bank account so he cannot accept digital payments but he does however have a smartphone and can use batwa for receiving money our research into language diversity showed 11 widely used internet languages in india which were all very much part of the culture this led us to design a minimal onboarding flow where a user can select their language ending up in a simple wallet with both light and dark modes we try to keep a beginner's mindset when designing the payment flow with clear calls to action we also have an early prototype design for an investor flow for minting rupesa this brings us nicely to the stablecoin architecture so we felt the culture around the indian rupee was significant to the concept and thus warranted its own stable claim and that it also ought to be decentrally governed and non-custodial so we dusted off maker down single collateral contracts deployed them on gurley as make a cow but with a few small changes users can deposit ether's collateral and mint rupacer the peg price is set by a chain link oracle which gets in our price data from crypto compare there's also a governance component with cow as the governance token and another oracle from uni swap governing rewards and fees when repaying the loan this architecture can hopefully inspire future projects launching other stable coins now let me tell you about the gases payment system we've got indian rupee on layer one but layer one is pretty expensive right now especially for small transactions so it's matic to the rescue with a layer two chain tokens from layer 1 can be zapped to layer 2 via the proof of state bridge where the battery worldwide web wallet could retrieve its balance for transferring rupay sir batu assigns and post transactions to bi economy's relayer which pays the gas and publishes on matic so now it's time to show this thing in action here is a link in case you're watching along and you want to use butter as well you can add slash invest for alpha features i will now switch to the live app so what you're seeing on the screen now is the live app for butterworth it's getting its rupacer balance from matix mumbai test net there's a these these repacer were minted on gurley and then deposited onto layer two there's a way for a user to see their address and also to show a qr code which makes it easy for receiving payments and then there's a simple backup phrase with your magic works so what we're going to do now is we're going to test sending using this so there's me here's a qr code is coming qr code scanner further out further out further out okay nice so scan the qr code we're going to send 10 rupees which is about 13 cents and about enough for one charge from rummage and that's going to get sent off the bicone me for transaction for processing and like that matic has processed it and it's been paid so that's the layer 2 app what we also have to quickly demonstrate is the layer 1 app which is like the investor flow which is an end-to-end process for someone to deposit gurley eath into a cdp on maker cow mint some rupacer and then third step send that rupacer to layer2 for spending so i can kick off the process here of locking some ethernet cdp that will take a few transactions on gurley so i've already lost some collateral earlier today and i'm going to borrow against that 10 thousand that's about 130 dollars and that's going to go off and get mined and then because i want to buy some more chai i'm going to zap 100 rupees at layer 2. that's going to take about three minutes using matic's proof-of-stake bridge and that will show up there later trust me i've been testing it all day it works so that's the live demo uh we're sharing a few ideas on next steps um but i think we're probably just about out of time now and i'd now like to open up the floor to questions thanks chris uh awesome demo i there's a a few questions that i have myself too but what we'll do is we'll just have the next two teams present and then we'll have all of you uh come on for free q and all for all of our kind of judges and guests if you have any questions just make sure you write them down so you can ask them one after another in 10 minutes so uh with that we are ready to move on to our third demo for the consumer category and that is going to be croco finance and i think robert is here ready to present to robert whenever you're ready go for it yes hi hi so i'm robert from kirk of islands and let me show you who we are and what we've built for ethel and hackathon so we're not seeing the slides yet but i'll i'll let you do that yeah okay let me fix that yes good can you see my screen ah yes loud and clear yeah good so i'm robert from grocer finance let me show you who we are and what we did what croco finance is so we are we are team of two people i've built this with my friend jan we are both based in czech republic and i was responsible for the front end and my friend was responsible for the backend and the goal of krakow finance is to help liquidity providers understand their money flow we realized that there was a big hype about your farming and all this stuff and i think a lot of people realize that it's not actually profitable it's a at some point so we wanted to make it absolutely clear for everybody what will happen with them with their money when they deposit to some liquidity pool so let me show you the demo this is our landing page where we ask the user for his ethereum address so i will place the ethereum address and go to the app this will take me to dashboard where we show the user his his his pools we have active pools and past positions and for each pool we can see how much fees he earned what were what were his yield farming gains how much he paid for transactions we don't have it yet for unison but it will be ready in a few days and we can see we can compute his impermanent loss so and here the user see his balance compared to buy and hold strategy and this pool can be we also have another feature called simulator so i will go there i will open this pool in simulator and here the user can simulate how will changes in press assets prices how will these changes affect this portfolio value so i say for example i want to see what happens when the price of wrapped bdc doubles i see on the right here that my impermanent loss compared to the current state will increase by one thousand five hundred dollars approximately and my total balance compared to buying the strategy will be like minus one thousand four hundred dollars so yes i don't want verbatis here to increase that much in price compared to eth and user can place with this one is however he wants i can place 13 here or whatever yeah and we can compute this and we can we can do this for unisop and balancer this is for unit swap you can choose balancer pool here for keep where the tokens have different weights keep us 80 percent has twenty percent i can do the same thing here i can play with the values and we will compute in permanent loss for the be for the user so um so this was the demo and let me show you tell you how we made it first we have to derive the equations for unit swap and balancer we because we know the equations for automatic automated market maker equation but we need to derive the formulas to to compute in permanent loss so we can separate the fee the gains from fees and the loss from a permanent loss and once we had the equations we could build it and on backend we use the graph and python to process the data and on front end we use react and typescript and our next steps the first step is to improve the stability and ui of the current state of the app we are already working we are already working on this we want to improve the stability by using a custom database because right now we fetch the historical data every time the user pastes his address but the history is always the same so we can store it in a database and just match the current state and compute the things we need yeah and we want to adjust the user interface for pools with multiple deposits and withdrawals for now the ui works best for pools with single deposit because like in permanent loss is quite it's not very well defined for for pools where you withdraw part of your money and then deposit another part so this is what we are working on now and then we want to support more platforms and analyze make more more sophisticated strategies advise the user what might be a good idea when to withdraw his money and of course keep up with the ever changing device by center to the situation yeah so that's that was it amazing uh thanks robert and uh this is uh something that uh i do want to talk about in the q a but uh this uh immediately plugs into mindful where uh if you are a d-gen you get to uh see how good or bad you are so with that we are ready for our last demo for this category and that is going to be project t pay so as fashion whenever you're ready we'll have you kick off with your demo and then we'll start the q a session for this group hi everyone i'm sebastian software engineer from zurich switzerland and i'm going to present dp a decentralized payment processing solution that allows developers to easily offer crypto payments to their users but first let me explain why i've built d-pay the payment experience in a decentralized web is still rudimentary at best a lot of websites and d apps out there that implement crypto payments they often require you to go to an exchange first to get either their utility token or any token the website accepts this is neither good for conversion nor for adaption the average user is overwhelmed by centralized exchange kycs or the risks and underlying mechanisms of decentralized exchanges when users perform payments the only thing they care about is how much he or she has to pay preferably presented in a way the user understands i'm glad i was able to raise the payment experience in the decentralized web to a new level during the hackathon i've built an easy to implement easy to use decentralized payment solution and i'm going to show you in detail how that's working if you want to receive payments in the decentralized web you can now use the dpay payment widget you configure what payment you would like to receive for your service or product and you then place this button on your website or the app and now when users click that button they will see an easy to use in state-of-the-art payment dialog the moment the dialog opens dp scans the user's wallet for all assets of value it detects liquidity poles that would allow to exchange the asset to what the seller wants rates the potential routes and selects the most efficient route for the user the dpay payment dialog also focuses on displaying local currency prices and values in this example us dollars this allows the user to grasp and comprehend the amount he or she is going to pay in this example dp suggests to pay in uni tokens the seller requested 9 ether but because the user doesn't have enough ether dp suggests to use uni as the means of payment swapping it via uni swap to ether and sending the requested 9 ether to the seller all in one transaction if a seller requests a token the user actually has in his wallet dpa is going to suggest to transfer that token directly as it would be the most efficient route but the user does not have to stick to the pre-selected route maybe i want to hang on to my die so i can just select any other token in my wallet that is exchangeable on a decentralized exchange as a means of payment but for this demo let's stick with die okay now let's actually perform this payment and let's be extra generous to miners this is some main end and we all know how long that sometime can take we could click this again and it will lead us straight to etherscan so we can stare at our transaction while it's processing or in the meantime i can quickly show two more ways of taking the dp components and reassemble them into two other very useful ways first token offerings which allow you to easily offer your tokens to your users on your website directly second token token swap widgets which allow you to make token swaps part of your website or the app okay let's see if the payment already succeeded in the background yes it did what happened here is that the payment dialogue handled over to the website again after the payment has been confirmed so that the website of the app can now display a payment confirmation if we have a look at the transaction we see that the dp payment processor smart contract sent the requested die from the buyer to the seller it also emitted a dedicated blockchain event that helps to identify that particular payment later on in another example we see how the dp payment processor smart contract takes a particular token from the buyer in this case the depay token swap severe uni swap to wrap eater and sends the requested wrapped ether to the seller again all in one transaction i would love to see you start using dpay reach out and i will gladly help you to implement it thank you for listening amazing uh thanks sebastian so uh that concludes our first group of four amazing demos and what i like to do is ask all of our hackers and judges to kind of turn their cameras on and we'll kind of go into a sort of a really massive q a and uh what i'll do is i'll just gonna kick it off uh by just simply highlighting that majority of these projects are ready for people to use right now and that is absolutely incredible um i think uh the fact that we're able to not only just do this in the last three weeks and uh and kind of show what people can do with the tools and technology we have right now we can make it easy for them to use this immediately almost everything is ready to be used by people right now and that to me just is absolutely amazing one other theme i noticed uh is that uh it is a pretty broad way to uh kind of categorize what consumer adoption looks like there's there's people who want to have bullets and money for the first time uh there's category of users who are active traders and they just need tools to be better at their own roles and uh and there's just in general payments that enables anywhere from e-commerce to a lot of other clever integrations that defy enables so these are really amazing interesting themes here and i want to kind of open this up for kind of all four of our our judges and see if they have any comments and questions or feedback and to make this a lot easier to unmute themselves so we're not good with that ping pong of who's made it i i could jump in here uh first of all i i love all these these these have been like super interesting and and like her dick said they they're super all like all over the place span a lot of things consumer category can be pretty broad um i have just like a couple like specific questions um i mean again this is all pretty broad but with uh with botswana specifically uh um i'm curious uh more on the back end actually i i thought the maker cow concept was really interesting um are you thinking uh in terms of i assume there will be sort of an interest rate for for uh borrowing or for creating the token right like how are you defining that by governance or by um like a automated interest rate you know kind of like uh you know so as is we just copy paste a lot of the maker dash stuff there would be a gov vote so we'd have these couch open governance tokens to vote uh but we had we were also plugging unit swap oracles into maker down here so you on chain unit swap or oracle we could get a real on-chain price and use that to auto set the fee by comparing it to the big price so then yeah it's too too cheap we can win more or a minute less without requiring a governance vote every time awesome great job guys very cool project um i have a question for uh d-pay so as far as actual payment rails is that all going through uniswap or is it uniswap and a combination of other things i had the chance to actually abstract the routing so during the hackathon i also plugged in a moony swap and while it tries to calculate the best routes it considers both uh exchanges to calculate the best routes gotcha okay very cool um and when you um when you're actually how how does it actually look on the the receiving end for someone that's actually accepting this payment are they just receiving it in the currency that they've um that they've requested or do they have some kind of portal to turn it into their local fiat currency they request whatever currency they want um there are a lot of stable coins out there for a lot of local currencies already so potentially off-ramp becomes less and less of an issue if you actually get the low the stable coin of your local currency already yeah this is a great project i really liked it it looks like a smooth interface so great work thank you um yeah i just yeah i want to first congratulate everyone everything looks amazing i can't believe you did all this in in three weeks um it's you know always incredible to be at these hackathons it's just really inspiring so um congrats everyone and um i i really uh love the the mindful um app i just thought the ux was super um like nice and and just um like simple and felt like something a lot of people would would want to use right away um my my question there especially you know when when that kind of chart sloping downwards came up um made me wonder if you're thinking of ways to maybe short a strategy as well interesting i mean you could put like short tokens into your chakra like you could use like synthetics as inverse tokens in your chakra to get short exposure to a particular underlying but the way it's designed is you can think of it as like your own balancer pool so whatever you can put in a balancer pool you can put in your chakra i think it sounds i mean you could have like a an inverse chakra that's just a collection of inverse tokens if you're if you're a bear and you just want to take profit on the way down that could be kind of an interesting strategy cool and then i i didn't really understand how the relayer network works like um will you have kind of incentives for for relayers to execute these transactions yeah sorry i rushed over that but but the way it's set up now is that basically like 0.3 of the trade size which is like the same as like a uni-top fee goes to the person who executes the relay call so they can like permission permissionlessly anyone can permissionlessly call this so it's it's incentivized to have like it basically ends up being like a gas a gas wall for who can call it first um and it's in the beginning like we would run a bot like this and that could potentially be an avenue for profitability until it becomes competitive and everyone else is trying to do the same thing yeah yeah congratulations everyone i mean this is this was a pretty very interesting hackathon and a lot of uh cool uh cool hacks um i could uh start with the croco finance i think the uh uh i've seen recently quite a lot of uh practically dashboards where you could monitor your positions uh usually uh in d5 various protocols um or aggregators they don't they don't offer maybe the best user experience or or overview of like your whole uh exposure in d5 so um dashboards are really really uh good tools and uh the simulator is amazing i think that is something uh really helps everyone you know and saves also um a headache in the sense that you can actually modify how much you get exposure how much you your impermanent loss might be and and also probably you can even uh further uh develop the product in a way that uh you have a service that actually could uh or like a bot that could actually trigger or be triggered by some sort of uh keeper network in the sense that uh it cuts the position if if the uh the impermanent loss becomes uh higher so that's that could be uh interesting and one of the things when i look at the the dashboards uh they're becoming uh very beautiful and and that's like a nice thing but also uh what's important is is this kind of like a helpfulness in in accounting and taxation so so practically i think many uh people who are in d5 today are actually thinking now or or um discussing with their accountants and and uh tax advisors like uh whether something is a taxable event or not uh and uh that it that's becomes probably more uh bigger thing uh in defined people need really a lot of tools uh i'm pretty sure that's the case and yeah for for the mindful uh are those chakras in that built in a way that anyone can join them or is it something that you you practically create and and it's only for visible for you or is there like is a pulled uh component because i remember you you folks were saying something about um the social trading aspect but uh the current ones uh can anyone can i basically create one and let's say um could uh ashley and camilla join the the same uh chakra no they can't so um balancer has different kinds of pools this is a controlled pool um and the reason it's controlled is because if you want to update the weightings retroactively after it's deployed it needs to still be controlled so the person who creates the pool can update the weightings um there is a way that you can create pools that can be updated after the fact and like pie dials uh like d5 plus and like these kinds of tokens where you can like change the weightings retroactively um governed by like a dow could work but there is like quite a lot of risk with that so if i was to create a pool and then add a token that i can control the supply and then shift the waiting to be 100 and then i could like rug pull everyone who's in the pool basically so at least in the beginning uh that's not what we're gonna do but the the copy strategy would basically just update your chakra to follow other chakras and then in the future we could have a more sophisticated system that there is just complexity around like who can control the pool because of this like you don't want to get rugged from your chakra and when when you are depositing uh is is that kind of like position tokenized for example uh is each each chakras are are they basically tokenized yeah so you would say you go from like one asset into your chakra that asset gets traded to all the underlying and then deposit it into the balancer pool and then exchange in exchange to the for depositing you get balance support tokens which are like liquidity provider tokens that rep like they're tokenized representation of your liquidity and then when you withdraw you basically return those to the to the chakra and then you get back the underlying awesome awesome thanks i um i just have a kind of question for uh the kroger finance team what is kind of the process like for supporting a new uh protocol um especially as some of them have their own new mechanics that may not just be compatible with something that already exists kind of how does how easy is that for you to add and kind of what else goes into um supporting that so basically all the critical finance relies on the impermanent plus formula so what do we need to do for the new protocols we need to basically fetch the reserves and match it to those equations so like adding new new platforms it's not as easy as putting a contract address to the app but it's not like a difficult from a software development point of view it seems like robert was going to say something yes like that for the simulator we need to derive the formulas like theoretical formulas to compute impermanent loss so you can we can recompute it in advance so there are like these two things look to derive the formulas and make the software to fetch the data and recompute it gotcha uh and then uh i also had a question for uh for the butler team um i guess uh and you tried to uh get some feedback from people using the app i'm just curious like what have some of the reactions been especially for an audience that may have not done crypto before yeah right so we did get the app like an early app in the hands of real users in real scenarios but with test money uh for me the most interesting thing was the reaction that someone could have money stored somewhere without needing a username and password and two-factor authentication and all these user experience hurdles and we were able to explain and like explain the wallets getting minted in the background and it's being uh it's stored in the browser session a lot of surprise but how quickly they got an account we're looking oh i already have an account i just loaded the page right we actually just wanted to really step into the user's shoes and as we did that we really realized that we need to keep the app super simple and minimal to create a frictionless flow for the users so i think that was the major aim there and i think if and as in when but moves forwards ux is something we're really going to dig deeper into so that's of course that awesome yeah i added just a question for a mindful um uh so it's obviously based on balancer pools um you know i think there's a limitation of eight assets per pool right um is is there a way around that or is that sort of like hard coded into just how balancer works that's a balancer restriction like we tried to keep as much code from from their side as possible without modifying it um and we also like borrowed a lot of code from pie dial uh explicitly in like how the chakras are created and like they have similar logic in their pools um and that the strategy is really to like write as little high-risk code as we can you know that's where the where the issues would come from if things were to break is that at those two points so yeah limited to eight and also you kind of less than two percent of one asset in a full right right um i think i maybe saw something on on the deck about uh like find a guru type of a thing is that um from the way you're describing it since you can't have people join your pool is that sort of like copying it is that is that the approach yeah it would be similar to like set protocols like copy strategies but where you would literally just set up your chakra to like mimic someone else's and like if they did any specific actions you would copy those actions um but in the long run i think like depositing into someone else's in someone else's chakra makes the most sense when we when we can figure out how to make it drug proof i had uh one more question for um croco finance um i saw that you guys in your description mentioned that um you created two of your own subgraphs which is which is pretty cool one of them which i guess was an official uniswell subgraph i'm curious um you know what was what were the things that you needed that you weren't able to get from through the official uniform subgraph and what was the experience of creating your own subgraph like so uh in order to get the yield rewards uh and to account for them there was not that information so we had to we had to create a sub graph for the unipool smart contract and basically we get all the withdrawals from those contracts how much the user already claimed and then we also needed to use the web3 library in order to get the unclaimed rewards yes cool very good i have a question for for the uh and there is practically if i understood you you you create the uh cdp in the layer one and and and then you you kind of port the tokens into layer two to the matic right uh correct me if i'm wrong of course uh what's that so what happens if if i want to close the cdp uh do you have to wait uh to withdraw the funds from matic and then going close to cdp on the later one yeah you have to exit the layer to get back on layer one and then close the cdp or by new rsi on layer one yeah or my new rsa and how how long it takes to actually close the the cdp if you you are in layer two and you need to go backwards so so if you're one the limitation of the manic ps bridge is i think like intestines right now is just few minutes three four minutes but like in terms of exit problem there will be like can be delays up to a week yeah yeah one interesting thing is you could create different kinds of solutions to make it faster let's say you could um you could use for example something like credit delegation uh you pull uh credit from defy to a a like a exit contract and and uh then practically you can have other people financing those exits or some sort of liquidity providers or tokenized exit positions to make it uh make it faster i guess it's not that uh critical to close the cdp unless you well actually it is if you have uh if if the value of the cdp is going down maybe that's the case but uh otherwise i think it's not that but something to something interesting actually yeah i did hear rumors about some innovative stuff using pending withdrawals as collateral for the loans yeah we're looking to do this next step nice write any uh final questions yeah i i have one for uh croco finance i'm i'm wondering whether the the idea is to become a dashboard that's um like complementary to something like syrians or or sappers like specifically geared towards a yield farming and i thought kind of the idea of like um like simply visualizing impermanent loss was was really good uh but it's the idea to have that plus like just like an overall wallet view and and this ability to condense all of your wallets in in one place um so are you kind of will you want to expand into this or just like drill down on different yield farming features so we definitely don't want to focus we definitely don't want to compete with zapper.finance and we we just wanted to we want to make a perfect tool for liquidity providers in texas and that's our sole focus because we don't think there is much much innovation there would be much innovation if we started competing with zephyr and such okay makes sense no harm in a little competition though awesome uh well with that i want to thank all four of our teams here today um especially uh to a handful of you who are in different time zones different parts of the world and uh in the middle different things uh the cocoa finance things especially is in the process of catching a flight so we were able to make this work out and that's the remaining context that you see on screen but uh thanks to uh to all of our teams uh so um with that we are ready to move on to our next section and uh for those of you who want to stick around for the rest of the demos uh we kind of definitely encourage you to kind of stay on the chat or just join directly on on live.edu online and we'll be following up with uh with a handful of other announcements for each of you uh at the end of this call in about an hour and a half so uh thanks again um and uh i want to congratulate all four of you for uh presenting and now working on your projects and not really kind of showing especially live uh what you were able to do in the past three weeks and uh i i'm glad that uh we did not see murphy's law in action today so uh that said uh i am uh gonna present the next category and we'll introduce our next set of uh projects uh the next category is scaling and uh it's super interesting because we've actually already foreshadowed a handful of themes here a lot of our projects uh we're trying to combine skilling as new novel approaches to get this in the hands of users right now and also being able to mix scaling and high throughput with d5 right now so we have two projects that are attacking scaling and that's liquid l2 and arcstall and we'll both come on one after another and then we'll have them kind of go through the same q and a process again and uh without further ado i'd like to welcome tom who's going to be talking about liquid l2 and i'll let tom kick off with his demo hi i'm tom french and from i'm from london in the uk and for ethan line i created uh liquid l2 so the problem that liquidal 2 is aiming to solve is that led solution is becoming essential for ethereum but there's a lot of there's very long withdrawal times normally so for example formatic this is normally around 30 minutes but we're getting optimistic roll ups uh coming along which are going to take up to about a week to actually confirm one on maintenance um as stanley mentioned like this is a real opportunity cost if i'm trying to close my battery cdp like i don't want to wait 30 minutes to do so um and that adds a lot of friction so the way that liquid l2 kind of solves this is through credit delegation so that people can get uh instant access to their funds um the way this works is that lenders can use uh rva's credit delegation to give loans to users who are withdrawing from iot solutions and these loans are going to be backed by their pending withdrawals um the lenders actually know these loans will be repaid given assuming that they will be confirmed onto mainnet um as they are the loans and mana the withdrawals are managed by smart contracts so i'm going to quickly show you a rough sketch of the architecture and then i'll do a demo from the user's perspective so um let's say that i'm a user on a led2 solution and i want to withdraw some money i can go to the withdrawal form withdrawal vault factory and initiate withdrawal that's going to deploy a vault just for me and then this vault will start with drawing those things funds onto the main net uh a lender can see that this has occurred by looking at the layer 2 chain or through one of the subgraphs that we created what i created and then it can they can delegate credit to the user's vault on mainnet um i can then pull those funds out of my vault and pay back my battery cdp uh immediately and then eventually uh this loan needs to be paid so once the withdrawal confirms onto mainnet either i or the lender can go back to my vault and say hey i want to repay this debt and the votes will claim those funds pay off whatever loan it has already and then forward any remaining funds onto me so here is a quick interface to interact with the girl 2. let's say that i have 90 usdc on the matic chain and i want to withdraw 10 of these so i can quickly uh sign a transaction allowing the good l2 to take my funds and send that off so this has deployed a vault for me and uh burned those fonts so if i now switch on to looking at this from the gurley test net you can see that uh i now have twenty dollars worth of pending withdrawals and i've been given a credit limit of ten dollars by a violander so i wanna get my ten dollars out to play back my cdp so i'm going to just borrow that use it my entire credit limit and that's gonna deploy the same another vault to the same address on mainnet so i can claim those funds and then once that transaction confirms you should see my balance update but uh well while that's waiting i'm just going to show what happened on the magic chain so you can see here token transfers where ten dollars went from my address to my bolt and then the vault uh started but to burn those funds so that to start a withdrawal um the fact that these funds starting the vault is what gives liquid r2 security and you can see my transaction is confirmed and i have my ten dollars i can now use that wherever i want if it was the uh rupees i could pay my cdp send that to unisport whatever uh i'm happy as a user i've got access to my funds um but at some point i need to repay this loan so uh just for this rest of time i've got withdrawal that i did earlier uh which has confirmed onto the main chain so i can quickly click that this is going to generate proof that these funds are um belong to me and that my vaults can claim them and uh okay unfortunately it seems like it's uh not repaying oh there we go so it takes a little bit of time to construct these proofs but uh so anyone can kind of perform this step um so the lender can know that they will get their funds back even if i as a user never interact with liquid l2 again um so cancel that so we don't need that now and uh yes okay so this this repayment transaction has confirmed now and you can see that uh my credit limit has dropped to zero my amount that i borrowed has gone to zero again and um you can see that i still have my ten dollars on maintenance so yes i've got 10 automatic in a matter of seconds rather than having to wait for 30 minutes um this sort of solution it can i've used the matic network for this demo but the actual architecture scales to any led2 solution that uses an edm compatible chain all it requires is that um we can deploy smart contracts onto that chain okay uh thank you very much and i hope to take any questions later on thanks tom um yeah this is uh something i think just immediately addresses what sonny just recommended so i'll wait for the q and a piece but uh with that we'll just uh let our stall kind of present and uh they have a really interesting novel approach to scaling and i'll let them share what they've done uh hi there yeah thanks a lot for the introduction and uh welcome to airtel a new scaling solution for ethereum using trusted execution environments so this is our team we are a research team paroon maybe some people know us from channel state channels from the technical university of darmstadt in germany and the five hackers are the brilliant guys here with the diamonds on top of the heads so to give you an overview airshell overcomes many plus method mutations with trusted execution environments like intel sgx so we have an amortized transaction gas of zero gas and this is because we do not even need on-chain checkpoints the computational demand is still pretty low because you basically only need a single um cpu and we observe a very high transaction throughput you can think channels because we only work with the signature verifications and signature generations and if you're wondering if this is all secure it's based on research from the chair of applied photography at the to darmstadt university and the paper is currently in submission so the architecture works as follows we have an operator who is basically an untrusted message relayer and we have the users if they want to enter the system like in any level 2 they send a deposit a transaction and later on they can also send exit and withdraw transactions and blocks are forwarded from the operator into the te so the te basically verifies all the state and that's happening on the blockchain and this is why how this even works and then once users are off chain they can send signed transactions to the operator who just forwards them into the te and then at the end of each so-called epoch the te generates balance proofs signed balance proofs and broadcast those back to the users so again there's a little bit of a of a similarity to channels where users send signed transactions and get confirmations back and this all progresses in so-called epochs so you have a deposit transaction exit epochs so those are distinct phases but all of those phases are actually working in parallel so everything is possible at all times now demo time so here we have um oh sorry is something wrong do you see my mouse cursor sorry okay um anyway so here's the ganache it's a blockchain get out of blockchain i will start it it's now completely fresh we have a couple of accounts with 100 eth i start the operator so when the operator starts he deploys the contract we can see that here contract deployment and now i'm going to start alice and bob so those are going to be two users in our network i will start by sending a deposit transaction of hundred each by the way this is all implemented using go so those are all go different go implementations and go clients this is the operator and here the two clients um here we see two transactions that arrived with a value of of 100 eve so that's here and now those are shortly in the system so now they still didn't receive a balance proof yet okay and now the next epoch starts here and now we have 100 eth in both systems okay now we are completely off chain and now we can send transactions so here i will send let's say 50 to bob um okay and since we just had like a nice balance face shift now we hold only 50 here and bob already sees the 150 here happening um but the real great thing about this everything is now off chain right so we can just send as many transactions as we want in a very short time so i'm going to show you a benchmark of a thousand off chain transactions um basically a micro transactions of 20 eth so the 20 will be divided into thousand little pieces sending and that's it so we now see over 1 000 transactions per second and what's happening in the background is that alice is sending all the transactions to the operator the operator forwards those to the enclave and then the secure end life processor everything and then at the end of the epoch which just happened here here you see the live face meter we got another 30 deducted 20 deducted so we're back at 30 and now we can also leave the system so i will do that now okay so leave so i will send an exit exit transaction and okay i don't know what happened here let's try that again um and also here so i will send an exit transaction and once there's a phase shift we can then withdraw the funds okay so exit got mined here and here it's also looking good okay nice and now we should have exited the system and you can see in the account suddenly the final balance is 170 and 31 so everything from offchain now applied back on chain yeah so the next steps the future is testnet and then finally mainnet deployment of course so within global operators so we all can have transactions together um we want to build like a really good secure enclave because this is more of a prototype obviously that we are running right now so we will probably use rust for this including like side channel resistance and now the great thing about this technology is that it can actually scale arbitrary smart contracts because you can quite easily leverage just some evm execution inside the enclave and then you can quite easily even extend this yeah thanks a lot i hope i convinced you about this uh new awesome scaling technology for ethereum visit us at parent.network or visit our github parent.minersnetworkslash. thanks amazing thank you so much sebastian um i'd like uh the parent team and uh tom to kind of come on on camera and we'll sort of kick off uh about a ten minute q a here and uh there's a lot of things going on here a lot of things that are also over my personally in my head but uh i'll kind of kick this off with it with a question for art style um what are sort of the is the system able to scale because you're assuming that the te is the uh kind of the best kind of way for us to fall back on on the security guarantees of of the system or sort of why this versus any other approaches we have to offer chain scaling and sort of the if we can compare and contrast that i think that'll just be a pretty good context for all of us yeah so the context is i mean well if you if you want to use intel sjx so if you're saying okay the security model for me fits then this just solves many problems right and i think in reality it actually does solve like in reality i think many people actually would be happy with using this as a scaling solution um and because you have this trusted enclave you can basically communicate the users with the enclave similar to channels right because you're only exchanging signatures and the operator is basically assumed to be untrusted the operator can be malicious and when the operator fails to forward messages because the operator really is only like a message broker back and forth and then you can always go on chain and then get your funds back but because as long as the operator behaves nicely and only forwards all the balance proofs you you don't even need to post checkpoints and this is where this is even an improvement over our other like rollups or ck solutions got it um quick follow-up on that is this a so with respect to kind of i think you already did mention this thing but just to clarify where is this solution with respect to kind of being tested right now live on on mainnet or just what are there any unsolved problems here in deploying this or kind of where does this rank um so it's it's based on research that we didn't even get published yet so it was very brand new um so it's definitely not a mainnet but we are quite happy with the protocol internally already so we will definitely move this forward to mainnet in the next like few months and yeah and i hope we will see more solutions based on this yeah i had a quick question um for you guys as well um so with regard to the trusted execution environments um you know use sgx as an example um but i guess you could i guess you can also use multi-party computation are there any other trusted execution environments you could see being utilized with this yeah awesome that you're saying this because actually i i usually i would like to have said this but we didn't say it for like time previously but mpc is actually another solution that you can use so basically we could replace the te by some kind of a mpc committee and then you we could kind of merge the operator with the te to like an mpc committee and then also achieve great scaling using this and you could probably just like you said you could probably transfer many of the concepts just to this like committee yeah it's also definitely something we're looking into would there be any like major security tradeoffs for doing that you mean with mpc or yeah i mean i guess with mpc well you still have this uh you still need to to trust that at least not everybody is getting malicious or something like this so this is just from the top of my head what i could think of that of course well if everybody's like polluting then you could crash the system i think it also depends on how you design it i think you could probably even increase the performance of such an mpc solution if you allow some threshold uh crypto happening here so saying okay it's enough to have like a two out of three or three out of three i don't know so i think there's also some parameters you could yeah you could have it be sort of like configurable in that way cool this is a this is this is a good effort here yeah i think i'm impressed that you guys did this so quickly i guess it sounds like you've been working on the research for a while but uh yeah github the first github commit is is not is pretty recent so yeah yeah it was it was it was two weeks a little bit of weekends and nights yeah but it was great fun looks great i uh we have a question uh from our chat actually which is for uh for install again and is uh the question is from uh somebody from the pocket network team and the question is uh will you be creating a dap node uh dnp for this and uh this will kind of make it easy for people to just run and know it and become an operator and not kind of how do you think about sort of getting this in the hands of people i guess is probably the general category of this question yeah i mean right now what we implemented of course it was tailored towards this um hackathon so we have like this what you saw on the terminal that was like a user client and then the user client to uh hold all the all the like logic and everything but i think to to have this i don't know if this answers the questions i'm just hoping i understood it right um but probably what would be best is like a yeah like like a operator reference implementation that just speaks the protocol forwards the messages and then you could have that standalone and then also for the client then sdk would be the best solution i think that you can have like wallets separate from the actual logic because as in many many of chain if not all of the institutions there's always some watching involved right i mean you i think you cannot really get around this in any solution so clients have to watch the operator to always when an epoch ends in a certain amount of time since those balance proofs so this is like one of the security requirements here and if the operator just goes offline i mean he doesn't need to be malicious could be a server crash but then it it's very important that on chain the contract just someone freezes it so that the whole system stops and not then epoch progresses and suddenly everybody's out of balance proof so this is just one of the security happening in the background um yeah not sure if that answered the question i'll wait for alberta to reply in the chat 30 seconds when he gets to hear the last half of the lag maybe i'll start off with a question for for tom uh i think this was clarified in in the demo but in case it wasn't is your approach specific to matic uh even with the demo kind of focus on that like how how does this work with respect to anywhere from other student solutions to just overall how the problems being set up i mean we really just we just did this whole thing from scratch oh i'm so sorry i'm so sorry sorry i i didn't hear the tom i'm so sorry um so yeah so current the contracts current are 100 based towards matic network um but in terms of the kind of uh requirements for an l2 solution all it needs is that it can deploy a all that requires is that a withdrawal is can only be claimed by the um by a specified address and that it takes a given action on mainnet to claim that actively if those two are satisfied then it's fine it can be like pretty easily extended to cover that lt got it um i was gonna say like uh not just gonna put stunning on the spot but kind of stunning for the the thing you just kind of recommend in the previous group with respect to uh the layer two uh settlement i guess or yeah you know the settlement operator issue do you do you think there are any other approaches to kind of helping address that or sort of compared to that in liquid l2 where does that sort of uh lie in your understanding of how credit markets can be used for this yeah i think it was uh the the liquid l2 solution is is pretty interesting because kind of like uh you you practically have the the the depository or or you know um the liquidity in layer one and and practically it seems that you could actually hop from let's say from one layer to back to layer one but also probably i don't know it was the plan also to you know kind of like hop from one layer to to another layer to and become kind of like a layer tree in some sense or and how does it work let's say because if you have the the liquidity let's say in in mainnet but let's say if you want to go to another layer you have to like kind of go first l1 and then l2 another l2 and do this kind of like a uh detour probably yeah going from one lap player two to another light two isn't as uh is nice uh because because you do need to kind of bounce through layer one so and it's so kind of either we would need to kind of give the lenders um or like some relay network a kind of a signed transaction that authorizes uh them to kind of take funds from a given vault and then kind of automatically draw those that that loan and then send it to another layer too um yeah so there there could be some scope for kind of uh some standardized format of uh the the user uh kind of announcing okay i am doing a withdrawal and this is what i want to do with the funds once once they arrive and then kind of that um action being performed like possibly uh through something like gelato finance um once the credit limit is high enough got it well one thing i was actually interested in a lot when i when i was uh kind of like also looking at this is that uh there you have to run a note right off of each of the layer two or you you don't you don't have to to the crowd-proofness of of the exit so currently we have sub-graph that runs on the matic chain so a lender can kind of um watch for any withdrawals on that and then they can kind of uh check against the ethereum may not see if they've been claimed already um if if it's in the sub graph and uh like you trust that that subgraph is going to be truthful and and you have a mainnet connection you should be kind of relatively safe as a uh as a lender um but you do you need to kind of there does need to be that kind of aspect of what watching both chains i you can't just sit on main net and kind of do this automatically um this is true formatting it like it would probably be relaxed for something like optimistic rollups because for formatic the first time that something arrives on mainnet is once you're actually claiming those funds um when there's something with like a challenge period where you could possibly kind of see whether a withdrawal um is in progress on mainnet uh for like optimistic roll-up you could kind of possibly build that into the process so that when you kind of create a loan you are going off and checking that this thing exists which would kind of reduce the kind of risks of being a lender and possibly allow some sort of pooled kind of lending kind of funds because currently the minutes a lender if they uh if if they aren't paying attention they could kind of make bad loans very easily yeah but i kind of see this this is interesting when there will be more liquidity in other layers let's say if you have a unisop swap or something like that that you could actually use this to pull liquidity into that swap for from let's say three different layers on let's say less liquid token and and so forth so it probably opens very interesting use cases in the future so um we are running a little bit behind schedule so i and we have to kind of cut this up now but uh for any other questions we'll just redirect you uh uh the question directed to the team so i want to thank uh tom and uh team uh for presenting and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next section um what i'm gonna do now is uh is sort of uh just gonna give her judges a small break uh and we'll do that by doing something else in parallel and that is uh there's a lot of sponsors that are also giving out prizes for the best use of their their protocols and uh we asked a handful of them to make a video for them to announce the price so you'll be kind of finding out who won what price from each of these companies and uh while these videos play for the next seven minutes i'll uh i'll give that time for our judges to get some coffee or relax or just take a quick break so um we'll have ave protocol labs usbc uma teller economy one engine vega come on and just announce their winners of the video and i'll have uh yeah we'll just kick off that video right now so let's jump in oh it's global we're really happy to announce the winners of the are they prize and before we announce the the actual winners uh we just like to say that uh some honorable mentions uh to to the following that didn't win prizes but we really loved the idea uh the first honourable mention was steak legends we really liked uh what that team was building and then also ethereum yield curve we really like what you're building as well okay so for the prices uh for third prize of 1500 uh a day is whirlpool so congratulations to whirlpool for the second prize which is 2500 a die it's uh osmosis and for the first price of 4000 a day it's a liquid l2 so thanks once again to everyone that hacked on the rv protocol and submitted entries we really loved them and we'd really recommend everyone including the the prize winners and the honorable mentions to apply for an rv grant because we would love to support uh just these sorts of projects uh that everyone was building in the hackathon so yeah thanks once again and we look forward to seeing how these projects evolve hello everyone i'm molly mckinley from protocol labs and i'm here to announce the winners of the three protocol lab surprises for eath online uh huge thank you to everyone who submitted projects there were some really really amazing ones um and big thanks to eva and mike for their help judging on this okay so uh first to our third place prize at a 500 die each we had four winners sign chain hey chasm astral dow and ipdb so congratulations to these four teams we're super excited about the work that you're building on top of filecoin um the work with groups like slate and spleek and ceramic working with drand and building cool ways to bring dram to each contract youth smart contracts awesome use of dids nfts and geodata and making um la p2p and textile threads useful in even more context through databases so we're psyched about the work you're doing and congratulations next for our runner-up prize at 2k die our winner is audit protocol which is a really streamlined accounting and audit cycle we really am we're impressed by the slick ui and retrieval ux flow the use of powergate and just how useful this looks to many many different groups in the ecosystem very approachable we're we're psyched about what you're doing and finally our first place prize at 4k die the winner is mayelle an enhanced retrieval payment experience on file coin we think this sets a really clear need in the falcon retrieval process and we're really excited for the improvement um for miners so that they can kind of leverage the the falcon that they have in um payment channel vouchers so that they can keep growing and onboarding new storage so thanks for the awesome enhancement to the ecosystem huge congrats to these winners thank you so much for all of the work you've done over the past month at in ethos online we're jazzed to be a part of this and helping sponsor so thanks hi this is pete from usdc we have three prizes 4 000 usdc for the best tech 2500 uscc for the runner-up and 1500 ufcc for the third place and the best tech prize goes to tonic refreshing money by tony and the second place is liquid l2 by tom and for the third place tides guest saver by flavio thanks everyone for participating there are lots of great projects and honestly we're really impressed by almost every project have a great halloween everyone and see you next time hi i'm clayton i'm the head of community at uma i'm excited to announce that yield scam has taken first prize for uma in the hackathon and will win three thousand dollars worth of uma tokens excited to see this product continue to be built it is an amm that specifically services expiring uh tokens on uma so congratulations guys thanks hi guys it's mike zem rose of teller i'm here to happily announce the winners of our hackathon prizes at eth online the categories we had were best implementation of teller most creative use of teller and best original project using teller so the winner for best implementation goes to x liquidity x liquidity is a liquidity protocol where users can deposit their assets and then they get to share in the profits from arbitrage it uses teller to check for accurate arbitrage opportunities the winner for most creative use goes to samaj samaj is a social networking app that demonstrates a cool ux feature which is to allow users to interact with the dap and pay gas fees using any erc20 token really convenient and it uses teller to fetch the price of those erc20 tokens and finally the best original project using teller goes to bloxsat bloxsat is creating oracle for satellite nasa satellite data and it's using teller to provide the price of financial assets at the time of of an event recorded via satellite things like wildfires and solar flares and maybe aliens so really cool stuff and that's it for our prizes on behalf of the teller team i'd like to say congratulations to you guys who won and thank you so much for all the other projects that that made submissions cheers hey everyone this is aniket here from team by economy over the last couple of weeks we have seen so many awesome hacks being built on by khan and honestly it was really hard to pick the best ones the the two hacks we picked met all the criteria that we listed for the hackathon and more importantly we do see these projects moving forward post hackathon uh the first hackathon that we picked in the awarding thousand dollar as patwa that is making a decent rise wallet for indian users another second hack that we are picking and again awarding thousand dollar as united community that is uh building a social distribution platform and using my economy to make this video experience frictionless uh yeah i mean we we wish all the projects best of luck and also want to thank eth global for organizing such an awesome moment thank you hi everyone i'm jess and i work on one inch and one inch had a really incredible time judging all you eath online hackers so much so that we ended up with a three-way tie for second place of a thousand die each as well as a very deserving first place hack of 2000 die so of the three-way tie first we have tenderize by nico adam hey hey hey marco and kevin they created a project that combines staking and protocols such as live pier keep the graph new cipher with automated market making to create a liquid staking solution next we have yeti roll by amadeo and luke who created a decentralized payrolling platform that integrates one inch to pay employees in whatever asset they so choose and last of the three-way tie we have d-pay by sebastian who created an all-in-one crypto payment processor that utilizes mooney swap liquidity pools and of course in first place of 2000 die we have erc graph by pablo erc graph is a real-time and historic very beautiful graph showing erc20 transfers across the ethereum network and of course one inch is a baby of an eth global hackathon just over a year ago so we're super stoked on what all you guys have to keep doing hi it's barney here from vega super excited to announce the winners of our heath online hackathon prizes just to recap we were looking for creative and interesting uses for the rich data feeds that come from the vega test net i'm happy to say this community really didn't disappoint we've had tons of engagement over on discord and already worked lots of the feedback we've received into our plans but now it's time to pick some winners we have three prizes for teams that built on vega a grand prize of three thousand dollars for the overall best submission 1500 for the runner-up and 500 for third place in third place is the blockhead team with their wallet trading front end and vega trading visualization the team loved the idea behind bringing all of these things together and are excited to see this project get developed further to support more of the vega protocol second place goes to the wonderfully creative and i have to be honest slightly ominous sounding darth vega this had hands down the best name of any submission and some of the ideas the team had to develop it further sound awesome i'll definitely be watching this one and last but definitely not least first price goes to the incredibly resourceful bitcoin bill who's managed to extract a wealth of interesting data from the vega blockchain and make it super accessible the whale view and winners and losers pages are great but what clinches it for me and really impressed the team was the graph showing the amount of liquidations that would happen at every price level something you just can't do on a centralized exchange and that's it i want to thank everyone for participating and making ethonline awesome and encourage everyone to keep hacking see you all on the vega discord server awesome uh well that was uh some of our amazing sponsors sharing uh who won some of their prizes we also have a whole list of other sponsors that are going to be disclosing their winners uh just after the demos end and i'll kind of be walking through who those projects are and as a quick note for all the teams if you heard your name as one of the uh the prize winners uh we'll just connect you directly with uh each of the companies after the event over email and discord so uh just stay a little bit more patient and we'll get to your prizes asap so with that we are ready to move on to our second half of the remaining six projects for the demos and the next category we have is our favorite defy we have three protocols here they'll be presenting their projects so first we have stop loss finance then we have flash bank and then we have protect protocol so all three projects will be coming on and showing their their demo and then we'll kind of do the same round of q a and feedback with our judges so without further ado i'd like to welcome stop loss and i'll have them kick off with their demo there we go yeah hi this is adrian from stop loss i'm so excited to present for the finale the team is nathan and myself i built the product and nathan helped me with design and project management so i've been involved in itland for quite a long time i've built a defined product that was called variable and then considered the reality exchange that's where i met nathan and after two years in infrared and devops i am back building on ethereum it has been so much fun the trolls are so great so uh we've seen this past year and even more seeing centralized services are starting to be replaced by protocols whether it's exchange vending insurance derives every primitive from the traditional finance is being implemented as protocols as decentralized protocols it's so exciting and we are trying to do that with stop loss we want to bring tech profit orders and stop-loss orders to decentralize finance for the hack for ethernet we build stop-loss orders on top of uni swap that acts as insurance against impermanent loss so impermanent loss really quickly the fact that when you provide liquidity to unit swap you're kind of trading against the market and you can suffer some loss so with stop-loss you set a maximum amount of impermanent loss you're ready to take when when provided liquidity and if your liquidity position is too close to this threshold you get liquidated by equators that are incentivized to do that so really quickly we have a factory that that create stop-loss pools that are linked to units of pairs and the pool stores the lp tokens of users as well as the stop-loss orders so now let's get to the demo and we we are on coven we have access to four liquidity pools the usdc usdt and wbtc with eth so i'm gonna i'm gonna connect as alice that is the user you can see that she has some usdc for instance we can go on to the uni swap pool here we see that it's live i could swap some i just could grab some usdc for fake ether for these tokens are deployed for uncover right so here she wants to make a swap she will provide liquidity to the usdc fake easter pool through stop loss and create a stopwater at the same time so here let's say she wants to provide 600 vdc as liquidity in the pool but not lost everything so let's say for instance set the 530 guarantee she see she does just that and so here what happens is that she sends the 600 usdc to the stop-loss contracts that transform that into lp and at the same time store the stop-loss orders so we'll we'll just wait for the transaction to be mined uh we'll see that she she has a guarantee of 5 30 5 30 usdc so of course the demod it won't work otherwise no fun okay that's really the case okay i'm really sorry it's a new user i did so one more transaction we need to approve the token i'm really sorry about that but let's do the exact same stuff so yeah again what we are doing here is that we are providing liquidity to the unit swap pair and at the same time we set as 530 grantee so now let's go to the managed section it will appear at some point but the fact is that at the beginning you provide here it was an old dollar you provide some tokens and you get lp tokens in exchange so here let's see that she provided 600 usdc it corresponds to lp tokens it's an uninsured pair she has a guarantee and for now the health ratio is greater than one because the current value is 600 usdc it doesn't need to be liquidated but now let's connect as as the as a whale on unit swap and we will try to change the price of fake ether so here let's make a swap of let's say a 10k fake ether to your sdc by doing that we'll change the price by nearly 10 and this will create impermanent loss for alice so we basically what which it will do we'll take again the the view of alice so let's connect again for alice what happened we'll see that yeah the value of her position she still has the same lp is now close to 530 the health ratio went under one so she can get liquidated by liquidators let's do that so now i'm connected as a liquid error i can check using the the graph api nfc position i see here the position of alice so i can liquidate it since the edge factor is under one so i'm gonna do that so the liquidator liquidates the nfc position what happens really is that the current value is 543 it's more than 530. so the liquidator will use this value to reimburse of the granted amount to alice and he will receive the rest as a as incentivization so here we see that he receives some fake ether the time not on time so now let's just quickly get back to ali's view to to summarize that now we see that okay she had now she has in her wallet the 530 as you see that she was promised to be guaranteed so that's it for the demo uh our goals for the next phase is to of course ship that on mainnet as the as a product we need to package this as a legal work on sdk and tokenization of orders and for the more long term we we are making a call for contributors we want to take time to build this and be smart thinking about layer 2 other books and stuff like that so that's it for for the demo thank you so much that's a super cool stop-loss using unit swap um sure there'll be a lot more questions so uh let's kind of move on to our next demo and that is a project flashbang so uh whenever you're ready feel free to share your demo hey everyone i'm vabov and here i'm presenting flashbang we are a team from india a bunch of guys everyone worked on front-end back-end and smart contracts and we basically built something on top of compound compound is one of the biggest d5 protocols it has around a billion dollar worth of assets locked but it does have a missing component and that is it does not have flashlight capabilities flash loan is is this amazing tool uh built first by rv that kind of ensures that d5 systems stay in place it allows easy access to funds for doing liquidations arbitraging between different exchanges hacking harvest dot finance passing proposals on make it out so we thought why not expose a billion dollar worth of these assets that are logged in compound to this extra yield that's uh available on compound so we just built a sort of uh really light uh wrapper contracts on top of compound that allow allow users of compound to open up their assets to flash loans uh it's so it's time for a field trip so i've basically deposited five die uh on compound this is on coven it's earning a good 19.25 i'm almost at region so as i deposited die i got 210 ci i'll just deposit maybe let's let's deposit 20 of these um we'll send our transaction uh so we so we have fixed the flashlight fees to 0.03 for now but that's that can be changed later obviously and this is the avpy at the moment depending on the amount of assets logged uh our transaction is confirmed as as soon as our assets are into the contracts you can see that i have some lp shares for this specific pool i can also directly deposit die and these set of contracts will internally deposit them to compound and make me the liquidity provider over here let me do a like quick example flash on so it just takes uh so it just borrows a bunch of money and gives us some fees at the moment the earnings are 0.0241 as soon as the transaction goes through we'll see this number increase uh now we just have to wait for the transaction to go through and yeah here we go sweet and now our users of flashbang have more money than before all the while being logged into compound what we plan on doing next is obviously launch on minute we are also getting up for a proposal on compound to add the stuff negatively so that it's less gas costs for the people we also want to explore explore flash mints there is one bullet missing here that we also intend to create a sort sort of generic flash lone live it will internally borrow flash uh assets from our way d by dax later compound and give it to the user so they they don't have to integrate specific protocols yeah that's about it thank you so much looking forward to the questions amazing thank you so much it's uh i mean it's just amazing to see that uh in three weeks people have extended existing protocols um let alone unlock a billion dollars in a creative way so i'll leave my comments for the q a part um and with that we have our last demo for the d5 category and that is corbin with protect protocol so uh whenever corbin you are ready uh feel free to share hi guys uh so i'm corbin uh calling in here from the us and i built protect protocol as part of the etho online hackathon so protect protocol is a new insurance protocol for d5 that focuses on being open and composable so just as on uniswap you can create a spot market for any token anybody can do this for any token with protect you can create a liability market on top of any d5 protocol or any smart contract so that could be the amount of dye and compound that could be a multi-sig wallet any type of smart contract that holds value you can create a liability market on top of it in my day job i work with a lot of institutional traders that are looking at deploying more capital into the d5 ecosystem but their biggest restraint right now is just the risk of underlying smart contract bugs or you know admin keys getting compromised right they hear about the harvest dot finance hack they hear about the bzx hack they hear about black thursday uh and they're nervous to deploy even more capital into the space and so i think protect solves that in the us we have the fdic that ensures all deposits on bank account and i think uh d5 needs a protocol peer-to-peer protocol to do something equivalent to that ensure deposits into these awesome new financial projects protects kind of designed as a generic version of the ave safety module or the maker backstop it differs from existing solutions in that it's completely open so anybody can create a liability market on top of any capital pool cover is never bought you basically wrap any kind of pooled asset and fees are extracted block by block from that wrapped asset the way d5 should work on the other side of the market you have shield miners or stakers that deposit capital and assume the liability of the underlying smart contract and then lastly protect has a configurable claims process so today most insurance products in d5 are governed by a dow but with protect it can be covered by a dow or it can be covered by automated smart contract rules that query the underlying uh capital pool and see if kind of any kind of hack or any type of exploit has taken place so it differs from anything that's on the market today so this is protect um you know quick note i forked the urine dot finance so you can probably uh recognize some of the design i have an example of three different protect contracts sitting on top of compound on top of uniswap on top of ave you can see how fees are extracted for each market you can see the stake asset that backs each one of these capital pools and when you drill into it we want to be very we want to explain exactly what you're getting coverage for how claims work this is you know a type of you know it's almost like a legal contract so there's there's more to this than just entering in one of the sides um we want to really explain what you're getting but you can get protection right here if you're an insurance seeker and then you can stake and start earning rewards if you're a shield miner the way this works is if you want to set it up you can create a protect contract here in the upper right hand corner so i'm going to show you a little bit of how this works on the back end and the smart contracts that i created i'm going to go ahead and start deploying them to to a local network so if you contact protect protocol and you want to set one up the way this works is we have kind of like a two-sided token model where anybody that's buying coverage mints what we call a p token in this case you would be wrapping c die from compound and minting pc die pc die has all the same properties as sea dye except it's now covered if the underlying capital pool and compound was hacked and by doing that you're giving up some of your comp rewards to the stakers for that protection on the other side of the market you have the shield token where folks can stake eth or they can stake a stable coin like dye or usdc and they're assuming the liability of this underlying market for anyone that has a p token one of the really interesting uh things about this protocol is the fee model so how you extract fees from those that are buying coverage is configurable and so is the claims process so uh like i mentioned before the claims process can be governed by a dow or can be governed just by smart contract uh smart contract rules all that's done through deploying uh script i have over here so you can see you can customize the claims manager the fees and then lastly the capital that's sitting in the staking pool can be invested in any kind of other defy strategy right so these folks are staking eth that can be reinvested in another lending protocol or put into a market maker and start earning fees so you can see i have this all running locally and we're starting to reach out to different d5 protocols and different uh other capital pools to see who wants to get coverage so thanks so much for your time and uh appreciate any feedback amazing uh thanks corbin um i'll uh at this point and ask all all three teams to sort of turn your cameras on and we'll kind of jump into a q a um flash loans stop loss orders insurance uh i think we're gonna have a lot of stuff to talk about so i will uh leave uh myself out of this whole equation and i'll let everybody else chime in and this is this is awesome i really loved all three of these projects i have a question for corbin um so these liquidity pools these sort of like the the collateral that is backing these uh these contracts like how do you how are you gonna bootstrap that like is there uh you know like what's the incentive for people to dive in to be like a first mover yeah that's a great question so um you know if you look at the way it works today ave just released their safety module if you look at what maker's had on the market forever built into some of these protocols you basically have have you know a pool of the protocol token that if there is some kind of hack or exploit you know that pool is on the hook for the capital right what i've done with protect is basically taking that model and spread it across you know any type of d5 protocol that wants to get covered so the way i'm bootstrapping both sides of those markets is partnering with uh like a d5 protocol like let's say it's you know the newest lending product that launched today going to them and be like hey you know can you commit you know stakers for some x amount of capital and then start marketing this to you your users to actually buy coverage maybe they add protocol rewards and you know yield farming type rewards on top of that but get them to kind of start these different uh markets and that's actually who i'm reaching out to now to see who actually wants to get covered but it comes from the protocols themselves oh sorry um also for protect do you have some sort of like minimum ratio between the the funds provided by uh kind of shielders and the p tokens that are issued to to make sure that you know you never run out of like protection yep uh so camilla that's a that's a great question and that's actually why the fee model contract so it has the same interface for every protect protocol or protect uh contract but the implementation can differ widely um one of my prior projects was something called defy score which is a risk appraisal and different d5 protocols and so you know not all capital pools on ethereum are created equally right like maker's been out there forever and so is you know might have a lower fee and might provide coverage for a lower amount of uh state capital whereas you know the newest food token you know you're going to have to have like a one-to-one ratio because you don't want to assume that extra liability so based on the d5 protocol that fee model is configurable and we have risks coming from d5 score from a couple other places that actually get the fee model for the underlying lending protocol or market market maker so it's configurable by protocol that is that's smart thanks um i had a question for flash bank um first question actually had two questions so the first question was um just around the front end did you guys build all of that out yourself or did you borrow something from other places yeah we did actually build all of that during uh i think 24 hours we actually first time for the first time ever we had a front-end guy in the team so he did all of that goodness for us well you guys absolutely crushed it it looks really really slick so nice job um and then i'm also curious i i saw you guys use pocket network um no specific question but just kind of curious like what was your experience using pocket network what do you like about it uh i think three lock would come in better yeah so we used pocket network uh tools to to get the stats from the smart contract and display it on the front end so it was like not that hard to integrate pocket network so it was an easy process so there was nothing much it was seem like improvement cool awesome work guys this looks really nice i'm excited to see a real compound proposal coming out of this that'd be great just what we all need is more more flash loans right yeah definitely we are on it thanks thanks i have a question for the uh well the stop-loss uh i mean it's really fascinating what you what you guys did with the uh uh the stop-loss polls and um especially the the managing of the the positions uh having the manager that that's pretty nice uh uh could you actually even even add some sort of like a uh uh marching functionality to those uh kind of like positions that you have as well what you've been marching i didn't really understand so basically can you add also like leverage on those uh positions as well so now you basically have uh spot orders uh spot stop orders but basically that you can wrap your position that is already like pre-leveraged because you already have the liquidation mechanism yeah so that exactly the vision for the product what we are focused on is stop stop loss and take profit and of course it comes in association with a risky bet and so like like for this elephant line the bet is liquidity providing on uni swap but it could be another strategy it could be margin trading it could be like yeah leverage position and stuff like that i think the the mechanism and if there are the protocols the goal is to yeah make liquidators and users coordinated by a protocol but we aim to be do that on amms but on other stuff like that's yeah but yeah no it's uniform pretty simple that's pretty cool because i could see that you could borrow that liquidity and create that those kind of margin positions and it's it's it's quite interesting and about the the uh actual like kind of like stop loss and you know i've been wondering for a while uh basically when you you know like order books and such like uh why could those positions could be tokenized in in the sense so you you still get a uh lp token right when you when you create the the stop loss so so kind of you could uh create limit orders and bunch of other type of orders you know like in tokenized form then you could actually create a place or actually even like a unispot pool where they could be you know traded again so people could uh trade different kinds of positions in different you know uh whatever they have took exposure and and whatever like order type and they could basically trade those uh in between exchange exposures and that's quite uh fascinating yeah that's actually exactly what we are thinking like first step is uh creating the protocol to replace what was done centralized but then like the default is great because you can do that and we are working on on the on what is the token we give to a user it's between an option it's a specific token that like we're working on to understand how it can be used but it would be fun to see like how what it would create for the space that's yeah exactly and i think you guys had like experience from from the past when i remember variable i one of the first projects i followed like the the very early uh d5 stuff so i i kind of see here like the options as well because when you have the lp token you can sell it kind of like you can get rid of the exposure and trade it so that's uh uh that's pretty uh fascinating one thing is like when you go to the main net i really recommend to have audits and and and do it kind of like properly especially if you have a good product so it it's uh it's always risky to go without any audits and and so forth definitely yeah especially the oracle and like flashlights and stuff like that like it's really risky i think yeah yeah and speaking of flash modes yeah speaking of platforms of the flashback i really i'm super happy that you guys uh did into the the compound because i think uh practically you know uh now we have more liquidity to flash borrow and do all kinds of interesting stuff uh so so that's kind of uh i think one one interesting decision you made is that you actually made the flash modes um practically uh that there is fee associated which is interesting because in avail so we have a fee but there is protocols where you you don't have fee in in in flash modes and this is kind of something that we have been had like a discussion in in in uh early year kind of like should there be a fear should not and uh what's your rationale on putting this kind of like economic uh uh decision uh here on the fee on having fees there so at the moment the thinking was since these these contracts are not a part of compounds native contracts and uh so the people using these set of contracts should have some incentive to put up money over here and if the fee is not there i doubt that people will put up money in these pools for flash loans i sort of feel um once once these funds uh once flash loans are natively into compound the fees should be uh very low or depending on compounds governance like uh what what we talked about in on the forum uh nothing at all like d by dx or something yeah we we we haven't decided how things will work when these uh when this functionality is incompound natively but yeah for now this is it so you're not using compound liquidity i thought like you have to have like separate liquidity pools for people using these flashlights specifically so um so compound users have to deposit the cdi to us or deposit to compound via us so that we can uh open up these assets for flash loans to other people once we yeah once we go through the governance protocol of compound then this functionality will be available natively and then we'll have full access to the liquidity and so the incentive for people to deposit their seat in in europe would be this this fee when people take out flashlights okay also yeah i don't think there are a lot of other places at the moment where people can use their c tokens so this is also one of those places awesome so uh we are i know it feels like it's not enough time but uh it it that went by really fast so if you're any other questions we'll connect you with everybody here and uh we'll have the opportunity to ask you more but uh congrats to all three of uh the d5 teams here and uh just as a note before we leave uh it is always best to not trust test and prod so make sure that if you're gonna go on mainnet you go through proper audits and uh we'll uh we hope you can use your protocols and ourselves hopefully very soon so congrats again and with that we are ready for the last category and the last three demos for today and this is a particular category i'm super excited about because we are clearly seeing this is an amazing pattern that our ecosystem is aiming to prioritize building and maintaining communities and that is the last theme that we saw for our 12 within our 12 teams so community is the next theme and this includes any category that helps developers projects creators really sort of hone in on being able to talk and chat with with their audiences and also uh in general make it more interactive for an existing protocol or an existing service that we already know uh to just make it more fun and invite a lot more people in uh through a different lateral angle so uh we have three projects syndicate unite and space dx and i'll have all three of them gonna come in so uh i believe uh syndicate is ready to uh showcase what they've uh we've done and i'll have uh bill kind of show us the syndicate demo so bill whenever you're ready hi this is bill and i'm from san francisco and this is my project syndicate so what is syndicate um the aim for syndicate is to become a platform for web3 communities and the opportunity here is that almost all crypto native communities currently live on web2chat platforms such as discord or telegram and it's been surprising since the users themselves are actually quite familiar with web3 tools so what did i build for this hackathon what i made is essentially a web3 enabled discord so let's jump into the demo note here that syndicate is actually live already and if you want to access it just simply go to this url so here i'm at the site and if i press enter here i'm going to be prompted to sign my wallet address and i'll sign here and then as soon as you join you should be faced with something fairly familiar if you ever use discord or slack the interface is somewhat boring from there so as you can see this is essentially a chat room and you can chat here your different servers or different channels rather and then you can directly message people as well cool so what makes this um a little bit different from discord for example uh for one the the user identities are actually their web3 wallet identities so i do actually i do not own or have really any control over their profiles other than keeping their metadata and their unique web3 features that are only possible um when you all have cool chats coming in a lot of features are only possible um when you build this platform natalie from web3 for example one such possibility is creating a permission chat so here i have a chat i created called the ave governance server um what the permission server is is that um every user that wish to join the server must hold at least one of it to join so currently i do not meet such requirements and when i click join server it's not going to allow me to do so so if i were to switch to a wallet where i do meet the requirements so let me go to my main wallet here it's going to automatically refresh the page i will have to assign my signature and voila i'm inside the server and once again this is a server where only people who hold outward can join and if i go back we'll receive the direct message that was sent to me earlier and one last thing i wanted to show off is anyone can right now create a server if they wish really quickly so and then you just set the token requirements if you want to have you don't need to and then just create server there you go sweet and that's kind of like a very basic demo of what i made so how did i build this um for the web app basically i use firebase for real-time messaging mongodb currently hosts the metastore data hopefully i plan to decentralize this data further either on the layer 1 or layer 2 blockchain front end i use react node and for web3 interactions i just use the web3.js and so what is next once again i want to iterate reiterate the opportunity here almost all communities and we're kind of used to this is we currently live on web 2 chat platforms and i think in the future it just makes a lot more sense for us to adopt a web 3 community platform and there's just a lot of possibilities that we don't really even think about when we're in the web 2 mind frame so for example snapchat something that recently became adopted and i think it's very cool so i hope to implement like pseudo lightweight off-chain governance features uh into syndicate in the future as well yeah there's just a lot of cool possibilities so i think there's been a lot of great feedback already but if you want to get in touch with me uh simply go to east underscore glitch on twitter and i'm definitely looking for people to kind of work together with namely marketing and this app people um thank you awesome uh thanks bill uh super cool project um especially t nice to hear that it's already live so i'll uh we'll wait a few more minutes for some q a but with that let's uh move on to our second demo for this category and that is the unite community so alex whenever you're ready feel free to show us your demo we are unite and we met at the start of the hackathon four weeks ago but rarely it feels like we've known each other forever social tokens have been blowing up lately and brian flynn who has his own social token recently posed a list of questions a big one being one of the best ways to do a social token distribution our team was thinking about the space so i jumped in with the idea of giving away tokens in exchange for social media engagement and alex mesmerge who tokenized himself replied saying that he thinks it's an amazing idea the next day he tried my suggestion with a tweet saying that he's giving away five dollars in alex tokens to the first hundred people who retweet he got the retweets and in 17 minutes grew the number of token holders by 25 percent he added that the twitter algo stopped him from sending dms to the winners and he had to manually do the distribution in phases which brings us to unite a tool to automatically distribute tokens to your community and essentially automate the slow and manual process that alex's measure had to go through to distribute his tokens it works like this first you connect your wallet and log in with metamask then you need to verify your account by signing a public tweet we complete verification and log in now we're on our homepage where alexmus mesh would create his first campaign we want to offer many campaign types including retrospective airdrops to all twitter followers and other combinations but now we're going to demo rewards for retweets so we click create campaign and begin filling in our campaign details because this is a live demo we're gonna call it test in prod and uh then we enter the erc20 token address that we want to distribute this can be any ert20 token as long as you have it in your wallet then we need to enter a tweet url so we're going to create a tweet to basically match the experiment that alex mismatch did so we tweet grab the tweet url paste that in decide how many people to reward we'll just go with 10. the number of tokens per reward will go with 100 then we begin two-step process to send these tokens to the reward pool first we need to allow uh permission to spend these tokens these thousand alex tokens for the campaign we wait for that transaction to be confirmed then we do another metamorph transaction and here's where we're actually creating the campaign and sending those thousand tokens to our unites reward pool smart contract so wait for that to confirm and boom the campaign's been created so a few moments later alice is on twitter and sees alex's tweet she decides to retweet and get some of those sweet sweet alex tokens she then clicks the visit unite community link to claim her tokens like alex she has to connect her wallet and log in with metamask she has to verify her twitter account by signing a public tweet she then completes verification and lands on our homepage in the background our twitter bot has seen that she's earned the tokens because she retweeted and boom she sees them on the home page those hundred alex tokens that she got for retweeting his tweet these are not on our smart contract in an array mapping her wallet to the number of tokens she's earned but she can withdraw these by clicking withdraw which opens up a metamask transaction to execute that withdrawal into her own ethereum wallet and we wait for that to confirm and boom the alex tokens are now in her wallet those hundred alex tokens that she just earned for spending her social capital and participating in his campaign she then visits his website and sees that he can that she can join a private telegram group because she holds alex tokens and so she goes through this process of interacting with a bot on telegram that opens up metamask and checks that she has alex tokens and she instantly gets access to a private telegram group for alex tokenholders meanwhile alex can see the campaign progress and see that alice has claimed her tokens and monitor the campaign as it develops so we were testing out our dap and something interesting happened uh people saw our verification tweets and started to try unite for themselves including coin artist who has her own social token and 37 000 twitter followers we've already had almost 200 people sign up many of whom have their own social tokens and are very excited to use unite to automatically distribute tokens to their community we're currently running on the coventestnet but we'll be launching on mainnet within the next week or so we'll focus on twitter distribution for now but plan on adding other platforms and also want to add functionality to let people issue and use campaign and use tokens on unite we already showed you what it looks like to access a private telegram group by holding a token but you could also access a token gated newsletter or maybe get early access to concert tickets or other content by holding tokens or even exchange tokens for video calls or shout outs but rarely the possibilities are endless thank you for your attention we look forward to your questions and hope that you will use unite to distribute tokens to your community awesome well that concludes our the unite demo and now we have one last demo for the day and that is our team number 12 and without further ado i'd like to welcome space dx so james take it away hi guys uh my name is james dawson i am from belfast northern ireland i've recently quit my job to pursue becoming a solidity developer and this is my fully my first fully complete dish solidity dap and i'd just like to say before start as yesterday rehearsals i found out about a project called a dark forest and i just like to say i checked out the project and it is so cool and totally awesome and that this is my own kind of interpretation and implementation of a space economy ian and hopefully you can see how they are similar and how they differ and without further ado this is spsdx spsdx is a high-res token economic warfare game it is built in slightly and utilize matic for a fast-paced gaming experience users must travel across the galaxy exploring star systems and earning awards or receiving punishments users will have to build a starfleet to protect themselves or to attack others the game itself is currently comprised of three separate tokens solar and erc20 is the main currency of the galaxy solar is used not only to buy goods in the economy but is used as fuel itself to travel throughout the galaxy a solar is mined from the cores of planets which leads us on to our next token planets planets are erc erc721s and represent the ownership of the planet each planet has randomly generated traits the most important being its yield the yield is essentially the interest that you'll be paid for staking solar against your planet our last token is an erc-1155 called ships and technology or sats for short sats essentially make up your space flight a space is a very dangerous place and you'll need to protect yourself and more importantly protect your planets users who stake solar against planets should also deposit sats to protect the planets from attackers as the planets mine them profit as any other attack sorry as any other user can attack the planet and if they are successful they will have access to the planet's profits taking your hard earned solar and that is essentially how the game's economy works in its current state the last thing i'd like to cover is exploration users can explore the galaxy to discover planet sets and whatever else they can find the user will have to spend solar to warp the new star locations burning supply the galaxy is currently made up of six hundred and forty thousand systems that can be explored with the hope in the future to make the expansion of the game uh decentralized and run by governance when a user arrives at a star system location they will trigger a random event which will be tokenized the token is then burned by the user to receive the reward or punishment and users will grow the cosmos as they explore it and that will take us onto the demo so i'll just quickly show you this is the front end and the current implementation that i've done so far um this is the star map you can choose your quadrant that you want to move to your sector district and then you pick a star so this is an undiscovered star location so we will explore this together and as you oh no user in the way uh and as you can see we're connected to the matic mumbai network here so we'll just do this together uh so this will move my address and all of my ships to the well it sets my ships and my address to this star location and i'll set that there has been a new planet discovered at this star location so if we go over to our dashboard here we'll go down and see our new planet and we'll have to deploy this planet so we'll do that together and so each planet has its own contract that can have solar and sets or ships and technology deposited to it and the owner of the erc 721 token can have access to withdraw the tokens themselves um hopefully that goes through and here we have the where you would deposit sats you can see that the planet's yield is 12 it has a minimum stake period of 14 days we'll just quickly uh invest some solar here into the planet and i'll finish with a that attacking is the last element of the game which unfortunately has not been developed within this month but i'll be working on the game in the future to incorporate a chess-like strategy game which uh which with each sat having a unique ability on this kind of grid board that's how i'm envisioning it right now and i think it is entirely possible using matic and that has just went through yeah so thank you very much incredible uh thanks for that amazing demo james i'd like to kind of just ask all three projects to kind of turn their cameras on and we'll kind of do a short q a here um one thing that kind of amazed me was uh when yesterday i found out that uh this was james's first time just working in web 3 and uh not only did he make an amazing game but uh he was able to sort of get this get all of us excited so uh congrats cheers i'm just gonna dive in because this is probably like selfishly the most relevant category to me and and it's it's kind of amazing um i like i i feel like i would i would just use all of these projects for for my for myself and and i would definitely push them on into my broader category of you know social tokens or community tokens um i just have a couple thoughts and maybe a couple questions um i mean i mean syndicate uh amazing it's like so easy like obviously like i love discord and collab land and all that but it's still kind of a clunky experience you know uh you have to you have to go to this website and connect you know it's like so much the the thing i love about web3 is just connect wallet and you're good to go you know so i i but with that said you know you're you're going up against a fairly large uh competitor that is pretty well developed and well funded and all that um i assume you have plans to uh add you know more rich media photos like et cetera like uh how do you plan to tackle that is it more kind of just open source come and join me kind of approach or are you building a company around this like what what's that like yeah a very good question um it's like you said i think going adopting web 3 into communities currently there's kind of like the two approaches which is one is you build your own platform one is you kind of use extensions onto existing platforms and i think they both have pros and cons um obviously yeah like the existing plan building on top of existing platforms you can leverage what they already have um and then however i kind of see the future um for for web free adoption moving towards something eventually having their own platforms so to me this is more of like a longer term um ambition and i think at the more as we the features kind of add on um it it can hopefully like kind of snowball into like uh features that build on top of each other onto like it's an independent platform um and yeah so but that that's a really good point i think the initial adoption will probably come from like extensions onto existing platforms um and then as people kind of certain certain certain things are just harder um doing it through extensions for example i think snapshot is one of the like the innovators in um creating their own platform where the community actually lives on that instead of web 2 platforms simply because something like that is really hard to build into as an extension and that could be so definitely something i also incorporate into um syndicate as kind of an early way to adopt users but yeah my ambition is definitely uh longer term thinking maybe build up like a team of people who want to work on this together and just like still very early on in my eyes now it's it's very cool i just have like another question um for for unite specifically uh it's funny because this is actually got uh somebody sent me this link yesterday and i i've been looking at it because we've been looking at different ways to basically uh get more users from my own token and um uh like i'm still unsure of the right model for it maybe retweets isn't the right model for me but it sounds like you you're thinking of of different uh different ways to sort of reward people for for social engagement um i see like four of those but i'm kind of wondering like i don't know if you've had time to think about this like a couple years in advance but like what what's sort of like the craziest idea of like how to reward users that you've had you know kind of just diving into this uh yeah that's a great question um so right now we've been focused on twitter and there's crypto twitter and and you know that makes sense for now but i think these sorts of tokens will go mainstream and you know one crazy idea that that plays into some of our longer term thinking is you know you could have like a sports team issue a token and do something like um when people go to a game um maybe the first game you go to you get 100 tokens a second you get 200 tokens and then you build a streak that you you lose that streak when you stop going to games or participating you get tokens when you participate in their social media but you could do something like reward tokens for people who post selfies uh wearing the jersey for example where there that would be difficult to verify using a bot like we are currently but you know you could potentially have a system where there are human validators who are validating these sorts of actions and um you know it becomes tricky to ver like validate subjective things like is a github pull request good but you can have consensus with humans you know it's difficult for bots to do that but yeah i think there's some interesting farah campaigns where you couldn't do them with bots but giving consensus among humans who are aligned economically to be honest is really interesting i mean for your particular use case it could be yeah people posting um remixes of your songs that people are voting on and then um you know get social tokens in exchange for them or wearing your t-shirt or post a selfie with the rack tape you know that kind of thing yeah absolutely and and to your point i totally see what you're saying about um you know if we're only giving tokens away to like the top 10 or something like that that's like pretty low lift for a human to tackle it's not like some i mean unless you get just like this crazy amount of engagement um yeah it seems a lot more manageable than than just you know some like yeah then try to like automate every single aspect of it that's that's very cool um i'll i'll leave some space for other people to thanks i have a question for uh for syndicate um you mentioned plans to further decentralize metadata storage can you talk a little bit more about what you're thinking on that yeah that's that's a good question as well so um stanley actually got me thinking about this more initially i did build this um the maiden metadata mainly on mongol db just because it was fast and easy for me um but moving forward for example metadata is around like the the servers and the requirements i can see those things being lightweight enough to be stored on the blockchain and things that like people who create servers can opt into whether they want to kind of have that information live um somewhere decentralized uh perhaps layer one layer two solutions there um that i will still have to dig into more um and yeah uh so i i definitely think there's like possibilities there but i will have to kind of learn more and see what makes sense the most cool and i had sorry one more question if i can just sneak in here with one more but how do you plan how do you plan to um manage identity across different servers so currently um your identity is your web 3 wallet basically um uh there's been a lot of good feedback and suggestion to incorporate like ens so that would be like a very quick way to kind of assign people names and such um right now you can add like profile images and names to your profile and that will carry over similar to discord where i'll just carry over to different servers um but as as the platform develop more i can imagine servers having their own people having their own kind of profile per server and definitely like there's just a lot of cool possibilities like for example um service can distribute like uh nfts as like membership like badges or like status for the community maps i think that already happens in like um through extensions but definitely would be a lot easier natively uh on the native web 3 platform this app is awesome i love it i'm gonna start using it i already signed up so this is great really good work thank you i'm also super excited about these uh projects and potentially using them myself so yeah great job um and i i mean first thing i i'm wondering for both syndicate and unite is how to bridge like the web 3 user with the non-web3 user um so like something like having your east address be your identity might feel pretty alienating for most people um same with you know people retweeting um and you know wanting to get tokens but not necessarily having a metamask wallet on unite so how do you make that connection so i mean my my view is that the internet itself used to be already awkward you know i remember using a dial-up modem and like needing to phone a number and listen to this like weird song that came out of the phone and it was really awkward and now my grandparents use the internet so i think people will get used to it it seems awkward because it's it's not normal for us um but i think it'll be a gradual process i mean i don't have any great ideas on how to abstract away a metamask wallet i mean i know other teams are working on those projects and we just build on top of whatever they build um but yeah my my view is that it'll it'll grow from early adopters who are excited about having to use something new to it becoming normal you know that that adoption cycle um and ultimately i i think it'll be as normal as uh using 2fa to log into your gmail and you know maybe not everyone does that but i think enough people will do it to justify us spending a lot of time trying to turn this into a thing yeah i think that's a really good point like i think as adoption grow people will kind of get familiar with the toolings but also i think there are several good um on-ramp um tools like i think formatic is one thing that comes to mind where you essentially you just put in your email and then it's kind of like semi custodial wallet that they generate for you but for people who are just like onboarding this not necessarily even for financial reasons but for community reasons they might imagine like that's the initial on-ramp i think that's totally okay um can i have one more thing quickly um so we almost got bi-economy working for frictionless withdrawals so one of the problems is you know someone sees this tweet they know nothing about crypto and they see oh i can earn free things that's cool but they don't have an ethereum wallet so we can solve that problem you're gonna get free stuff you'll go through a hoop to like install the chrome extension and create a wallet that's fine but then to withdraw the tokens you need eth right to execute that transaction to get them out of our smart contract but you know we can use bikonomy for example or gas station network to subsidize those withdrawals so then all you need to do is create an account and people create accounts all the time like that can look almost like creating a new slack account or creating a discord account like it's awkward the first time you do it but i think especially in our case the incentives are there to do it and we can remove the friction by by subsidizing the withdrawals and that would just be like a customer acquisition cost that the issuer would bear to create their campaign that's that's pretty cool uh i have one i need to ask one interesting thing because uh uh so james about the space dx i mean it's what i've seen it's it's pretty uh like pretty extensive game i mean uh you you prac this is practically your first experience with web3 yeah um just kind of teetering with little things i was a software engineer before but um it's i've just recently taken the transition into solidity and stuff so basically how did you find like what was it difficult to get uh on board it and understand everything i mean with the the couple of weeks um no well i was i've been tinkering with different projects i was thinking with like didex before this and different exchanges and stuff and i just wasn't really satisfying the kind of what i wanted to do i don't know so then i just decided i wasn't really very interested in the games on blockchain at the time i found them just just wasn't very interesting and i wanted to see and then i just started um messing with erc721s and then all of the stacking for nfts came about and i've got quite interested in that and then that kind of triggered this idea of that this economy based um game so it's just been tinkering with little things but this is like the first complete front end to smart contract kind of application that i've made awesome so we are we are running out of time so i want to keep keep the show going uh maybe maybe if there's any last questions i'll kind of open that up and we'll just make sure that the answers are hopefully short and quick i had one i just wanted to ask everybody um and first of all just thanks you all thank you guys all these have been fantastic but i just wanted to ask everybody kind of like what was your favorite thing about the hackathon sounds like some people made a lot of friends along the way maybe you learned something would just love to hear about what you guys liked about it yeah well uh i enjoyed having the kind of deadline and pushing myself to work and having like people to talk to and who are in the same boat as me uh i thought that was great i really motivated myself to get really get something you know finished and out the door yeah also just having having a schedule is super helpful um especially uh it can be challenging if people are not in the street full-time um having some sort of accountability is great and also just bringing the community together i think it can be sometimes hard to everyone's like kind of scattered everywhere and just like a great opportunity to to kind of have everyone together yeah i'd say we made a lot of friends i mean at least for myself i made a lot of friends i didn't know these guys three and a half weeks ago and now they feel like you know real real friends even though we've never met in real life and not just the guys on our team but you know a whole lot of really interesting people who we met through the discord and through people reaching out and it's been yeah it's been amazing amazing that's a wonderful note to sort of end today's 12 demos so i want to thank all three of you all three projects for kind of showing us everything especially live the best thing about all 12 of these things is that they are almost ready and most of them already are available on mainnet so this kind of just brings it and makes it a lot easier for us to sort of see that the bridge from ideation to uh using in production is very small and it keeps on improving and getting shorter so uh this is something that i personally get super excited about um so with that said uh not just uh the team i also want to thank our four judges um and uh kind of uh i want to be extremely respectful of their time and sort of all of their comments and feedback we've given uh they've sort of made it a lot more possible for all of us to uh to sort of enjoy and propagate the space to a lot more people outside of the developer ecosystem and uh this is uh something that i want to make sure that i think all of you um here directly so thank you so much to all fall teams thank you so much to uh to ashley staney camila and andre we really appreciate this and to all the hackers uh everybody who participated congrats on demoing and submitting and and showing what everybody else what you've done so i do want to wrap this up i need like two more minutes for for all of this thing and what i'll do is i'll kind of just run through everything i want to say um this was a massive event from our side we had 125 000 in prizes uh just giving up for the event and there were so many teams uh sort of eligible for these projects so we kind of showed you about seven and eight videos earlier today from some of our sponsors but we have a lot more of the sponsors who are announcing their prizes for the first time i will quickly just scroll through these slides but what we will be doing is uh we'll be tweeting this out and connecting you with all the companies directly and all your like all the team members you'll find out what prices you've won so uh with that uh here are the zero x and audience winners we have bouncer and bloom winners here this is a so you should be able to pause i would have moved on super quick quickly here uh ceramic and chain like winners are the teams here and uh compound and ens winners are listed here then we have gnosis and keep then matic and marlin then m stable and near open gsn and open pocket network and pull together winners there's a lot of projects on on this category then we have portis and raiden api winners we have reach and teller winners textile and the graph uma and urine finance and that's all of our sponsors so before we kind of wrap this up and and sort of uh go jump into our impact summit i want to just take a few minutes and just really thank everybody who made this possible this is uh been a massive production uh and it's not just the 700 hackers of the 2600 attendees that have watched the summits but it's also the judges the speakers all the sponsors the mentors and the volunteers that have made this possible and uh there's way too many people to thank here so i just want to like show that these are all the people that were behind the scenes helped out in making this event an amazing success so first of all our judges and then we had all these speakers who contributed to a lot of the talks over the past five summits and uh i want to just recognize all of them for giving us their time and being available to not just talk with anybody who had questions for them but also really help make this easy for others to sort of feel comfortable and get into this ecosystem then i want to thank all of our sponsors who not only just helped make this event success uh from being there as an api provider but also for lending out their teams to help all of our attendees and developers really sort of get unblocked in any problems that they may have had and lastly uh some more mentors who are officially there to help address any technical issues run some workshops and make everybody to understand what they can do and cannot do and give ideas to projects so i thank all of them and then lastly a handful of our volunteers that helped us out with our judging process and we're super thankful for their support because we did paralyze a lot of things and we did a lot of things that we hadn't done before as a team and this is kind of how uh all of that will pull down and uh last but not least i want to thank the global team there's eight of us that make uh the global team that kind of help uh with all these events so when i first of all thank trent for owning all of our marketing social media and sort of being the face on uh being the first point of contact and uh and really kind of uh making sure that everything we want to do a global reaches the audience we want we care about uh the next up is emily she has been i'm sure in touch with all of you as hackers and participants uh she manages all of the attendee and hacker experience for our online events and she's been extremely uh crucial to our team's success and uh and i want to give a big round of applause to emily and trent there andrew everything you've seen on on the zoom and the productions that we've pulled up in our speakers and our workshops andrew has been behind all of that and uh we would not get the quality that we have at these events and the production value that uh that we would without andrew's help and support next up a lot of you already know jacob from being the liaison for all of our partnerships and our companies and now jacob's really kind of the one ensuring that every hacker has a great experience and every sponsor and every mentor is plugged into all of our our attendees and uh i want to thank jacob for all of that next up we have josh josh really kind of keeps all of us in check um and uh whenever we kind of give him a special shout out for really making sure that all these events uh down to planning on all the summits he was a big key player in getting all that figured out for us and executing with that uh with that plan and uh josh uh we thank you for everything you've done there next up we have liam who has kind of helped ensure that all of our systems are up and running down to everything you've done on the charging pages to how we did applications how we manage all of our communications liam support in kind of making all this work super smoothly and helping out with automations and just really high level planning on what we need to do as a team has just been a big piece in getting all of this together put together and lastly heather um who sort of is in charge of all of the experience for our attendees and events everything you've kind of seen anywhere from the little touches to how we can keep everybody in in check and uh and the constant messages i get to make sure everything happens on time um kind of the work and the effort and the the attention detail that goes into all of this thing is all thanks to heather so i want to thank heather and everybody else on our team for making all that possible for you to experience a really smooth uh online experience and and hopefully offline very soon so we had 12 teams present to all of us um and we kind of called them finalists but if you've been to any global event before um one thing that we kind of like to highlight is that um these events are not structured as competitions we really want them to be a place for everybody to experiment and sort of not be in a in a competitive environment to be able to game things or not try out what they wanted to do and really focus on learning so when we kind of call somebody a finalist that actually is our way of saying that everybody is in that capacity a winner that is equivalent to the first place for us and uh what we're doing other than any teams that are eligible for any sponsor prizes is that everybody who presented today will be receiving one each per team member and and that is the reward for all of our finalists so this is a few thousand dollars for for every team um and uh this is kind of our way of helping you uh to sort of recognize all the work that you put in and and we really hope that you kind of continue building what you're starting and and what you were able to accomplish in three weeks and just extending that a lot more so all that said um i do want to wrap up and thank everybody for being here we are going to start uh rolling into our impact summit which i'll go over in a quick minute but uh this would not be any global event if we kind of don't tell you about what's next so a lot of things are still being worked out and we do have 2021 plans and a lot of them are in in works for us to kind of publicly announce them but we do feel comfortable really hinting that we are ready to kind of aim for it bogota which will be our in-person event for next year uh scheduled for august six to eight and uh we're super excited to do
