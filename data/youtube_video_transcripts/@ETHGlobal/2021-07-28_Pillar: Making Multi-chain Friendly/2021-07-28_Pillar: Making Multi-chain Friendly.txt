and with that the issue that we had was as the growing um education piece around decentralization and decentralized finance started to become more and more popular and people loved the idea of decentralization it was very natural um we started to test and hit the boundaries and constraints of where the network would start to have this pressure boundaries and this ultimately resulted in a bad user experience in several ways so for example just to name a few you know as the network became more and more congested and more and more people came up and came onto the network we had an issue with uh you know slow transactions gas prices ever ever elevating and this was a big issue because the applications that we were building on top of this single chain ethereum network was starting to suffer from the performance issues and the cost issues associated with making transaction on a decentralized platform so the boss level this is um this is a big issue that we still face today how do you convince the average human now let me tell you a story i'm going to tell you a story about me and my wife my wife knows what it does she is computer literate she understands how the internet works how do you know how to use apps etc she does all the mobile banking you know she's she's not she knows enough about uh the the internet and using apps to get by every day um but i spent about four years of my life trying to explain to her how this network works how decentralized uh decentralization works um you know i've spent a long time trying to explain about like network pressure rising falling gas prices so you know she she's got this far she understands that much now we had a very um interesting thing to happen to me anyway and her um a couple of weeks ago which was you know she was about to send me 0.1 eve and to me this is absolutely phenomenal you have no idea how long it took taking me to get here and i could not be happier here we was sat on the couch she was about to send me 0.1 eve to me this is a huge huge step because she bought into downloading the app topping it up with ethereum and now she was more excited than ever to send me 0.1e for me this is a massive massive step but there was a problem she became fixated on this and you know understandably she wanted to read the details that's fair no problem but then she saw this then she saw this then all she could think about was that and then she looked at me and in my mind all i could think about was this followed by this and then followed a little bit by this no no no i'm just joking i'm just showing you i mean it was it was close enough now we knew me as a developer it's a question of how do we how do we solve this problem because ultimately what my wife did was she got out her banking up and she said i can send you that amount of money for free and i had no comeback so how do we get over this how do we really on board everyone who which is why we're here today because we have this greater need we are trying to we are trying to achieve this greater goal combined goal of them on boarding as many people as we can to this new world for the benefit of them us and everyone and decentralized decentralization in general so we started thinking how do we do this and the how do we how do we put together all the benefits of the multi-chain world now just going back to what we talked about before in regards to the one chain that we had which became congested this is driven by the eva by by evie which is the ethereal ethereum virtual machine and it is open source so naturally what people did was they took that software they modified it and then they decided to deploy their own change and then more and more chains were starting to be deployed um and this started to present a problem especially for developers because we want to take advantage of these other chains and their low gas prices which again removes a big problem with the fees and boarding people so but there was no easy way to do this so we at pillar we embarked on a mission to make this easily accessible say hello to e for spot your one stop service to the ethereum multiverse so at the center of this world uh we've built a platform that supports uh ethereum ethereum and its test nets of course uh but it also supports polygon phantom finance smart chain and die now we're just going to talk quickly a little bit about the infrastructure map here because it's not uh it's not magic but it was a lot of hard work so just going from uh left to right we've got our we've got our chains which are emitting data we ingest this we ingest this uh this data we then organize it and store it into hot and cold storage from there we have a before of microservices that are managing accessing reading and writing this data from then onwards uh deploy smart contracts which by the way belong to the account owners and the applications it doesn't belong to everspot and but we deploy these contracts for you on your behalf and then we make all this data accessible via the e4sport sdk which is open source and available to use right now and then we also have a direct link back to our api which allows us to read certain operations quickly and in turn helping your applications so what can you do when we built this service you know we had in mind you the developers the users people that want to benefit from you know a multi-chain world without having to go through the pain of downloading several apps or downloading you know several services or even running the infrastructure yourself trying to run the infrastructure we all know how hard it is does it scale xyz so what can you do so here's just some of the things that will help you so we have multi-chain balance and transactions we've got multi-chain erc 20 assets multi-chain gas prices ens registration and utilities with unstoppable domain compatibility and straight out the box you can authenticate with metamask wallet connect chorus or your old private keys but what can you really do you know it might be quite trivial to build a service that does the things that i just previously mentioned but these are the so these are the features of e4spot that we think makes us stand out and makes us different so first of all we've got transaction batching for gas efficient transactions we have payment hubs which will go into more detail in a minute we've got peer-to-peer or off train or layer 2 payment channels you know however you want to call it but we've got that built into the service we have efficient contract management and we've got the e for spot playground which allows you to prototype your ideas right now at no overhead or cost to you so let's go into the first thing we've got transaction batching for more efficient gas efficient operations now when we send a transaction this is uh this is this is how briefly is it's encapsulated we have your transaction wrapper and inside you have your payload which is generally your instructions on what to do now when we estimate how much this transaction is going to cost we we estimate the transaction itself and then that gives us the gas price of how much it's going to cost with e4spot we batch all transactions by default so what this means is we start a batch you can add in there as many transactions instructions as you want up to the block size limit and then that would be executed as just one transaction for example with a lot of d5 products today we need both an approval and then a transfer to move assets around through a decentralized exchange for example but with either spot that is just one action it would just be an approval and you can batch together the transfer and we will execute it as one transaction one gas price so the next thing payment herbs this is our off chain or layer two liquidity mechanism and payment hubs in a nutshell allows you to lock your asset amounts into the payment hub payment hubs can transfer can transfer to other payment hubs so you can have as many payment hooks as you want however your application sees fit any erc 20 or even elc 21 tokens are accepted you can withdraw or settle your assets from the payment hub or on to the chain we use a light internal ledger just to uh just to just to be able to perform the uh action of moving assets between between um payment hubs and it's important to know that uh a payment hub is just another instance of the etherspot sdk so your application can take this and use it however once however it fits into your application so here's how it would work in practice you've got your uh your payment hubs they can transfer assets between between them off chain and of course gasless and then when you're ready you can send it back to your wallet to be settled or to hold there and then we've got peer-to-peer payment channels so every spot um sdk instance has two addresses right out of the box you've got your uh you've got your assets address and then you've got a dedicated p2p peer-to-peer payment channel address and this address is designed for you to separate your assets and your assets that you want to make available to provide liquidity um or to send to someone else off chain and simply that's how it works we have a dedicated peer-to-peer deposit address that you can send to other e-spot instances at no cost and no gas then we've got efficient contract management so how do we deploy smart contracts so when you first create your etherspot sdk instance we use the create to address opcode to calculate where your um where your ethereum address is going to live straight away and then we immediately made that address available to you from that point onwards you can start sending assets straight away to that address before you actually start using the system properly and that way you can start seeing funds coming in and you can start prototyping your ideas quickly when you're ready to start using the more advanced versions um and feature and functionality of of um you've got two options either we can deploy your smart contract on your behalf or you can deploy it yourself if you choose to deploy it yourself you can simply call a specific method on the sdk and then we will prepare that for you or if you allow the system to do it we will deploy your smart contract on your first transaction so it's a completely transparent process if you don't want to mess around with smart contracts you don't need to and finally we've got the e for spot playground so if you've got an idea you can build it right now and some of the benefits of the ecosport playground is there's no infrastructure or software needed on your part the whole system is based on the web it is multi-chain ready with test nets so you can start test driving the e4 support sdk against x-i phantom and any of the chains that we support it's important to remember that e4spot itself is evm compatible so if you have any other concerns or you want to talk about another chain that is evm compatible please you can speed us at any time we also ship the uh ship default for spot playground with test nets and you can open as many instances as you want of the ethersport playground that would simulate your application so there's no limit there when you finish with it you can just close it you don't need to worry about anything else you can also debug your etherspot based app so for example if you're having some issues or you need to understand how the system works you could for example load your private keys or your etherspot authentication keys um into the ethersport playground and it would load your instance of etherspot on your app for example into the playground where you could continue to make calls and debunk the responses you can connect with metamask wallet connect taurus or your private keys straight from the create sdk method instance and when you're done as mentioned before you can throw it away when you no longer need it now the interesting thing is about these platforms is people may ask or a lot of us have experienced generally incomplete platforms things that don't quite work a lot is promised but nothing ever you know that we might find that certain bits of functionality is missing and that's natural it's such a big system and a big undertaking this this is what happens but we want to show you a showcase of um of a system of an app that does use etherspot and that is our owner pillar which is a multi-chain crypto wallet and this app is built entirely off the back of everspot so if you haven't given it a try go and check it out and see e for spot in action and working so i'd just like to end this presentation and give you two links um to to try now we've got try.etherspot.dev which is our sdk play playground which you can go right now and start prototyping your ideas messing around with the sdk having a look at the methods see what you can do try out different chains chestnuts etc and it's also worth mentioning that our our sdk playground tri-dot esport.dev has its own poa test net called e4spot with a built-in faucet so it's minimal effort from your part and then also we've got docs.efaspot.dev which is a um which is our user guide and documentation and also includes examples of sending receiving also has four examples of how to build bridges and peer-to-peer payment um payment mechanisms and um that's all from me so thank you for attending i really appreciate it and we can't wait to see what you build thank you wow thank you so much that was a really terrific presentation um if you wouldn't mind we can start taking some questions from the chat uh seeing that we have a few minutes left before the very end of the of the session here um a question from michael from the disc uh for the from the uh uh zoom chat from uh does this wallet provide cross-chain swaps or is it just for storage of different chain assets i would say it's just story for different state uh um chain assets at this moment in time um in terms of swapping i mean you know you if you really want to go deep you know we can't we ultimately do provide like the sort of nuts and bolts to be able to do something like that um but you would have to build a swapping mechanism yourself but and for the but for holding the assets that is definitely what we we can do sounds great um and if anyone else has any other questions uh feel free to type them in the chat now or if you don't have any questions at the moment but you would like to ask some more the uh pillar sponsor channel is always open in the east global discord for you to ask any questions and um totally with that yep and uh kieran and his good friends and colleagues will be sure to tend to your questions there um and well once again i really want to thank you again kiran for that amazing presentation no problem yeah thank you thank you thanks to everyone for attending no problem thanks a lot goodbye everyone
