[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foundation so I I've seen many many hacks in the different places and then I was really really hoping that that happens in Tokyo I love Japan this is so cool this is my first time and I love it [Music] in Japan there's a whole movement of like with three taking over and not just like a I think Enterprises but also government is very keen I actually met some like you know a government representative in some of the meetups and stuff so like the attention you're getting from Japanese local tools web 3 is like you know it's insane so this is I think this was a great time in the East Global actually came all the way to Japan in Japan the YOLO Collectibles I don't have to explain what we do they they get it immediately and it's like yeah this is like and they have plenty of examples you go to a national park and depending like you see a waterfall and you get a sticker and then you see some other birds sanctuary and you get a little birthday thing so so for us pull up this is greatly validating so we love it [Music] thank you [Music] the word infinite Garden the word infinite is from this book called finer and infinite games and the final games are the one that you know like you're normally people play finer games and then when someone wins the game ends but infinite games are played for the purpose of continuing the game [Music] my very first hackathon like sitting in my hotel room in the middle of the night like [Music] building a pogs game with commit reveal Randomness like I still remember that and I am so fond of it and I love it so much I'll say you know don't be afraid to try out new ideas I've seen so many hackers that are like solo hacks and they're like oh I have this idea but I don't have a team and I don't know if I can go ahead of it and I'm like do it build it for us and you know try to inspire others also I think it's a really good testing ground that if you are able to get members it probably means the idea is a good one and if not you know pivot and see how you can shape it up web series like growing right a lot in Asia and a lot in places where the assumption that everyone speaks English very well is like a bad assumption to me um so where do we come in with like translating our documentation how do we support the local community um and I think that's been something that's been really cool at East Tokyo and definitely insights to take back to the team what actually kind of drove me in first was I like when I first learned about ethereum I I got the vision but I didn't understand how it worked like I saw the why but not the how but I was just like okay the people in volunteers would be super smart and one thing I've learned that people are like very smart and Earnest while making the world a better place generally over time everywhere figuring it out so look I'm gonna bet on the people and then [Music] oh [Music] City blockchain is playful it's gonna be curious [Music] foreign
