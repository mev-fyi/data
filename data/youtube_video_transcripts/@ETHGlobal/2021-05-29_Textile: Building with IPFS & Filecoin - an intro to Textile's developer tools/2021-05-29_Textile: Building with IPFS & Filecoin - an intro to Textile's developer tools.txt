in the file coin space and adjacent technologies and then talk a little bit about why i think it's really important in the much broader picture about what's happening on the internet and in society and i'll just leave a couple of nuggets there but hopefully it's enough to get you thinking and maybe digging into it in different uh ways um and hopefully it inspires some of your your hacks this weekend even so so yeah it's kind of grandiose title file going in the future of data on the internet but i hope we get there so i'm andrew uh if you visit my workshop on thursday you'll know already that i work at textile we build developer tools uh primarily for using ipfs and igfstack and for using filecoin now um and you can find me on twitter andrexhill you can find everything about textile at textile.io you can join our slack and i'll remind you this at the end but we're hiring as well and so in the on the website you'll find a link for our hiring page to learn about the roles that were that are open right now and we'd love to hear from you so let's just jump right in and kind of build up a little bit of the story for file coin and what's really interesting in this space for you to dig into i'm gonna break this up into more or less three parts which are ipfs to file coin and kind of thinking about those technologies and what's really interesting from from both um then i want to talk a little bit about the client side of the filecoin network because that's probably where you fall right now i don't i don't think there are many teams that are um standing up their own mining uh operations this weekend though maybe it's something that you are actually exploring but i'm going to talk about the client side demand because i think that there there's been a lot of work to document the uh the minor side of of this market but the client side actually is super interesting and has some really neat dynamics going on right now that are going to lead into uh how this network operates over the coming years and are interesting to take into account when you're thinking about how you're using this data storage and what kind of opportunities there are to build on this network and then the so what section why why this is interesting why potentially you want to care uh far beyond this weekend and uh at least keep an eye on it if not continue to build it build on it so uh ipfs the filecoin so if you're already building or if you made it to my workshop on on thursday hopefully you're starting to get a pretty good sense of what ipfs why ipfs is and what it does but i'm going to kind of pick out some of my favorite parts now and so it's helpful to think about ipfs as a stack of technologies and those technologies enable content addressing over a distributed network of peers and the way that you can use that network is through peer-to-peer so multiple peers running their own ipfs nodes and then a bunch of helpful tools that you can think of like exit nodes from that peer-to-peer network and so typically you interface with those uh through a gateway and so i'll kind of go into each of those but then the really important thing that i'll get to at the end here is that uh ipfs the network has a really bad memory it does it's not really meant to remember things um and we can talk about that so let's talk about some of the good bits or some of my favorite bits about ipfs and the first one is content addressable data this is a really radical shift from the way that we or the technologies we use uh leverage the internet by default and so the way this works is that data when you add it to ipfs is given a content address and what that content address is is actually a representation a cryptographic representation of all the data within that file and so uh here's a really sim simple example of uh this image of a cat being broken up into uh a tree of its bites and then those bites actually are given um are given a content address and so uh the way that actually works i won't get into in this talk but it basically everything is a graph and at the root of every graph there's a there's an address that represents all the children underneath that root and that address is is uh derived in a way that it's unique in the universe more or less and and so that address is actually used to represent the cat so here on the right of this of this graphic there's this uh uh rotated uh address and and so that that hash that address uh is unique to this cat image that was the input and so you can't take this hash and turn it back into the cat input you can only take this cat input and turn it into the address but what it means is that anybody that's holding on to this cat original input data can get that same address and that means if you ask for that address from anybody that's holding that cat image they'll know if they have it and they can return it to you and so ipfs uses this idea across the entire network so that when you're requesting things you're requesting them by that by that unique address and the prop the sort of the the result of doing it this way um is really powerful one one of the uh one of the sort of great outcomes of this is that this data is self-verifiable so that means if somebody if you ask for this cat image from somebody you're going to send them this address they're going to they're going to say yeah i have the data that creates that address and start sending it to you when they've sent it to you you can take what they've sent you and run this same method to generate the address and it should match what you asked for so what's great about that is you can now with 100 confidence know that the thing they gave you is exactly what you asked for and that's really powerful and so the whole the whole network like i keep mentioning uses this uh throughout and um and so if you're using ipfs now um you're running into it and if you want to know more about that about that graph and how the hash is calculated uh for every uh byte of data or every piece of data and how a file gets its own unique cache um definitely go check out proto school um you i'm sure people have shared it already this weekend but they're uh their lesson on the anatomy of a cid so cid is that content address uh identifier that hash um their their anatomy of a cid tutorial uh is really great and worth going through to figure out how that works if that's if that's what interests you um but then once you have that hash you have the cat i have the cat i have that hash how do we how do we communicate uh to other people that we have it how do they find it from us and so this is another really interesting thing about how the network works and so there's a few different ways to unpack this um some things that you should be aware of are uh are the way that to peers on the network interact and so the way that you can request data from me and then we'll actually uh go through a little uh a little back and forth in the protocols of inside of ipfs and then i'll start sending you that data in a way that you can verify actually as i send it that is the thing that you asked for that piece of networking is really powerful and it's actually used beyond ipfs as well also there's the gateways which i mentioned before and that's just so that anybody with a with an ipfs node hosting that cat can actually tell people how to get that cat without hosting their own ipf test node so if i need you to go get that cat now and i don't want to have you set up an ipfs peer that can speak all those protocols uh inside i can actually tell you a gateway which is just a server that runs uh on the internet and i can tell you how to i can give you that hash and you can go to that gateway and and make a request to that gateway for the hash and behind the scenes that gateway will go and and go across the network to find it and pull it back for you so it allows you to sort of skip the overhead of running your own ipfs node it has some drawbacks in that you're not able to participate with the full ipfs network but the benefits there in a lot of use a lot of use cases are worth it um and then the final piece that i'm not mentioning here is the dht and you're probably you're probably finding the dht and some of your reading but it's the way that you can i could find the cat if i knew the hash i could find the cat uh and somebody who's hosting it on the ipfs network um the dht is actually a piece of technology that's likely going to be in a lot of flux over the next couple years as those methods are improved and alternatives are actually put in place because persistent storage is now a thing throughout filecoin and other networks so so really i think that the peer-to-peer networking here and the gateway concept are both really powerful and will be for a long time limp p2p related to that um the peer-to-peer uh there's a whole other library that when you use ipfs it's very core to the way ibfs works but it's it has its own independent life and it's called lippy to pee and it actually uh it actually sort of uh is a as a uh sort of a broad net that they capture a lot of different protocols in to enable uh you and i to connect uh in as many different circumstances as possible so however you're running your node however i'm running my node uh whatever the network situation is between the two of us um we can find whatever possible protocol can get uh me to you and you to me and and that's actually used in ipfs it's also used um in ethereum two for example and these two uh libpedopedia is uh is being used so a really powerful uh library in itself and so worth checking out uh if you haven't already and so ipfs is gaining really broad and and deep adoption uh and it has been for years so like i mentioned uh eth2 now looking at uh or now uh using lit p2p and um uh also uh examples of it being used in uh more traditional industries so experiments at netflix for distributing containers the brave browser uses it uh natively really amazing applications like audios that use ipfs for moving data around their network um but the one of the challenges of ipfs is that it really has this memory of a goldfish ipfs i like to think of it like the content distribution layer of the of the decentralized web and so it's really good at saying i have this data how do i get it to that person or i need this data how do i find it uh from other people that might have it it's really good at solving those problems what it what it's not really intended for is for you to necessarily push data to the ipfs network and have that network just remember that data forever instead what happens a lot is that if you make data go through the network the network will have a really small memory uh it will be cached out there by other nodes on the network and that then over time it will actually just be naturally flushed out of the network's memory and you won't find it again and there's solutions to this so uh you can run your own ipfs peers we do that at textile quite a lot so you run your own ipfs peers that you do what's called pinning and that makes it persistently stored on your peers and then other places uh other peers on the network and other gateways can find that data on your peer that you're you're part of the network but what if you can't run a uh up here you're not gonna create long-running infrastructure so another option that people use are pinning services so it's the same thing somebody else is running uh long-running ipfs peers you're pushing data to them and asking them hey pin this for me and that's a that's a pretty uh sort of web to approach right you're going to kind of create an account and you're going to pay them some fee to pin data and so there's a lot of uh there's a lot of companies that actually do this so you you might have already hit inferior or pinata or if you're using textile you'll know that textile uh has its own concepts of pinning as well that do this at the end start at the end so if you're using buckets and you're pushing them to the textile hub that's essentially a pinning service um just not just not in the raw pin sort of way you're pinning entire buckets uh so but those are solutions but they're but they're they're uh they're sort of orthogonal to ipfs itself the network itself so um this is where filecoin really comes in and filecoin is enabling trustless data storage for the peer-to-peer web or for the decentralized web and so uh if you haven't had a chance to dig into filecoin or uh if you haven't made it to the other workshops or other presentations this weekend or or at the end of last week um i'll just give you a little bit of information about file coin but i think i'll probably also share some ideas that are slightly different than what you heard in those other talks but but filecoin's endgame is really to create a globally distributed storage layer um on the decentralized web and so this it's supposed to enable sort of self-assembling storage providers what they call miners um to uh to launch across the world and and store data according to the different sort of niches and and demands that different places have and so this is quite different than the way say storage works on a cloud provider where maybe they have a dozen or a hundred 100 server farms essentially where you can push your data to in this way it's supposed to be much more fragmented much more broken up many many minors all over the world where you could potentially in the future have a minor that just runs in your building and is storing all the data that's needed by the people that live in your building that so that it's it's really uh close proximity and quickly served to you um the way that miners operate on the network is that they commit sectors uh for storing data to the network and the way sectors are rewarded uh or the the reason that sort of miners are incentivized to commit these sectors to the network is because they're rewarded for doing that and so they're actually rewarded in a number of different ways but you can think of it like they're rewarded for empty sectors they're rewarded for how much of a sector is filled and then they're rewarded for how much of a sector is filled with um what's what's called verified data um and so each of those has has sort of a different reward factor with unfilled sectors being the least but still rewarded and then fully fully filled sectors with verified data being the most and so miners are incentivized to commit empty storage space to this network because they'll actually have uh they'll have a higher probability of winning block rewards so just like bitcoin miners uh can win rewards by mining blocks uh uh filecoin miners can win rewards and the probability of winning those rewards is increased by the number of sectors they have committed to the network then they're further increased to store data in those sectors because it would increase they'll increase the probability of their winning sectors even more um so that they'll have to do that but they're incentivized to do that and they're even further incentivized if you're going to pay them to put data in that sector but what's really interesting is early on in the network we're seeing that those rates are dropping really low so a miner is is happy to store data for nearly free because the the value they gain from filling their sectors um due to the probability of winning blocks is is great enough that it it's uh that offsets the cost of actually storing your data so that's a really interesting property of the early file coin network that you if you're building an application or or hacking on something can actually tap into and leverage in order to get an advantage over somebody who's using say a traditional storage system so when a miner wants to fill their sector they um they pack it with your data and this is back to verifiability and similar to the way ipfs addresses are verifiable there's a lot of different kind of proofs and verifications that have to happen with your data and so in file coin there's a method for breaking up your data so that it can then be used to prove that yes they received your data and yes it's filling this sector and then over time continuously prove that it still exists in a non-corrupt state and so there's a whole lot of work here but you'll if you start using filecoin you might see some some ideas here around car files or payloads or payload cids just understand that that's that's what happens the raw data gets transformed into this um kind of file coin compliant data structure um to be stored and proven against over the future and there's our chain and so um just uh so filecoin the blockchain is is sort of organizing this marketplace of of storage providers and those storage providers um are operating on the chain such that they prove that they have storage space and then they prove when you're storing data with them they prove that they um that they've replicated your data and then they prove that they've stored your stored your data and so that that all happens through interactions with the blockchain and when the miner does that um that's how they sort of remain you can essentially think of it like they remain compliant with the network um and so for example if you if you want to store data with a miner and you've agreed to pay them say say you're storing uh a lot of data and you you're paying them a tenth of a of a file coin um that file point is actually locked up and the miner won't get it until after they've um completed these sort of proofs with the blockchain and so that through sort of through these mechanisms is how this vision of the of the network uh kind of unfolds and what's really amazing to think about is that all of those things before you even enter the scene as a client wanting to use this data means that filecoin is actually operate the coin itself is operating as a supply side coordinator so the motivation to mine these blocks is organizing a huge number of miners to commit storage data to the network and so um and so what's what's really amazing to think about is that filecoin is a multi-sided market so if you've ever thought about starting a startup you'll quickly run into literature about two-sided markets and how challenging it is to bootstrap two-sided markets and so i quickly think of like an uber where it's a it's a it's a great case of a two-sided market where uber failed would have failed if they couldn't find riders but similarly it can't find riders unless it can find drivers to drive them right so it has to somehow bootstrap these two sides of the market simultaneously or none of it works and so usually that takes a lot of capital to do um is really one one sort of hack around it um but filecoin has actually done it by having these uh these crypto incentives for miners so the the early five point token being really the supply side organizer has actually created um a huge um a huge influx of storage capacity on the file coin network so it's actually over five and a half exabytes of storage data have now been committed to the network so since launch that's like four million five million gigabytes per day of new hard drives being committed to the network which is which is really uh just a a a huge number and something to be pretty pretty interested and excited about if you're a builder who need who wants to tap into data storage um and so back to the to the uber um analogy and and you look at sort of the valuations of of different ride shares and think about where this is in the in the growth of uber um the big difference here is like is actually if um uber had launched uh and the day that you know if you were in new york city say the day that uber launched and you had stepped outside and there were only black car ubers uh in the streets and you could have easily gotten you could have hailed a ride in in under two minutes to anyplace else in the city it just didn't unfold that way but here because of the way that this system is designed it's really unfolding in a in a very radically different way um which again is is really interesting and there's a lot of use cases for it that are starting to emerge that want to tap into this uh storage this storage space uh in interesting ways and a lot a lot more and and oh yeah and so i i kind of want to just make the point here that uh one reason this is interesting for people that want to build on other blockchains is that other blockchains just aren't uh designed to optimize around storage and so storing data in smart contracts in other blockchains just doesn't it just doesn't scale it's not really meant to work that way and so the convention on most other blockchains is actually to use ipfscids which map to data on the ipf's ibms network and now we can start thinking about mapping data to uh data stored on a on a on another storage network and so there's really cool projects like nft.storage that are doing just that working with say ethereum developers to map uh ipfs based cids to deals on filecoin and there's a lot of other really interesting client applications here that are that are being built and i encourage you to check out textiles documentation as well um because we have we have a number of different products that are building on filecoin and let you kind of tap into it and one of the ones that i think is really exciting is one that we're building as a we're like really we're not we haven't really spoken about this much but it's a an example here where we're building a bridge to other blockchains the first blockchain that we uh have running is actually near and so here allowing adapt developer to more or less embed file point storage directly in adapt so that there's no user accounts there's no api keys the dap user can actually just authenticate with their wallet and begin uploading data to the filecoin network and we think this is going to be a really interesting shift in the way that um application builders or nft creators or or dao daos themselves are organizing around data and using the benefits of one blockchain to tap into the benefits of a blockchain like filecoin okay so i think that's all super exciting and i'm happy to talk about more of it in our discord channel you can find the discord textile channel and if you start if you start building on this stuff this weekend i want to build longer i'd love to have you join join our slack channel for example and and share with share with us what you do and um i'm always interested in that but what's the bigger picture here and i wanted to just kind of step back for a second and and like uh reflect on why a decentralized storage network matters and why thinking about these new approaches to storing data in these permissionless ways are really interesting and so this is from an old blog post of ours where we were talking about the um the proliferation of data that you and i all emit and so if you think about the early days of the of sort of the internet event maybe you had a email address at a university and so the data that you were creating on the internet included encrypted messages in your mailbox maybe an email handle maybe some basic ip logging but but really small amounts of data and as we've gone through time the amount of data that you and i are emitting as human beings has just grown exponentially and and that's really interesting because i it's it's pretty clear that we're we are or we're crossing or we're about to cross a boundary where uh most of human interaction is happening in the digital space which means most of the output that you create is actually data about yourself about your interactions about society and that's really that's really interesting um and as uh yuval harari said um we're running on ideas of the 18th of the 18th century so if you if you think about a society that um is running on ideas of the 18th century but has just over the last 10 or 20 years transitioned into a society that is predominantly digital that leads to potentially big problems and so um one of those one of those problems is that there's actually seems to be an emerging literal war for data right now and the the war has many actors and you can see those actors both in uh private companies that are working very aggressively to capture as much data about us as society as possible and it isn't really the data that they care about it's actually the information layer that they can create on top of that data and so you can see sort of the arms race happening here around creating machine learning and ai workflows to turn information or turn data into information but they need to capture as much of that data as possible um but that war is also playing out in sovereign states and um and you can see that the way that states are sort of aligning around the way that they're censoring companies the way that they're banning uh access to applications for um for their for their um their their citizens and this sort of internet fragmentation is another real strong signal that this that this literal war is happening around data because data means information and information is is sort of control and many and power and many other things and so this is something to be really aware of why this is important that we're building uh what we're building and that we're like we sort of can take it to the future and um uh i think we can change this and we can help define the future and it's through these experiment experiments that you're doing this weekend and being conscious of how do we build things that are positive for the future how do we build things that reinvent the way humanity can interact with data and take us from that 18th century humanity into this sort of new society where we're going and and think about how you how you really make data uh in our relationship with it something new uh and i'm really excited about that and um and we can see this playing out in in the sort of crypto and decentralized spaces um and i i'll point to alex gladstein's work and um a lot of his writing in the bitcoin space and sometimes it can be controversial people because he's very very bitcoin pro but i think his points are all really interesting and important and definitely worth looking at um but but he's spelling it out from a very literal sense that decentralized payment um means freedom in a lot of places and if we can push it harder and get it into more of society's hands it actually has the ability to battle uh authoritarianism and so that's really powerful and i think just the sort of wavelength decentralization and decoupling sort of control and power from the data that we create is critically important and there's a really great blog po blog post from chris dixon that spells this out called why decentralization matters and this relationship between platforms and users um needs to be broken away from sort of the value capture that is um that is enabled by by companies capturing as much data from us as possible um so definitely worth a read as well and i'm saying all these things and they sound you know they sound uh uh maybe stark a little bit but i i really think that this could actually get a lot worse and the reason i think it could get a lot worse is because a lot of power both in in in countries and in uh corporations has built up and built up around this these silos of data specifically and and so i'm not going to touch the decentralized payment piece but if you think just around the power that's been built around data if we radically change that i think that the battle has only just begun and i'm actually really excited for where that's going and i and i really want to invite you all to explore that with me and figure out how we get there and how we how we can build the new technologies that circumvent that power and redistr just redistribute ownership of data back to users and change our relationship with the internet and with that i just wanted to point out one thing which is which is amazing which is i'm really excited about networks like filecoin and if you look at filecoin it's only 200 plus days since mainnet and already it's come so far and there's so many ideas you can imagine on it so if you're really just getting started in this space um you're barely behind everybody else that's here and so there's like there's so much we can all do together and so invite you to keep hacking um with us and with that uh you can find me on our discord on our slack and um like i said we're hiring so thank you very much awesome thank you so much andrew that was a great presentation and such an inspiring note to end on if anyone has any questions i think we're just about over time so perhaps we could take it to the textile discord channel perhaps that makes sense okay awesome thank you so much andrew thank you
