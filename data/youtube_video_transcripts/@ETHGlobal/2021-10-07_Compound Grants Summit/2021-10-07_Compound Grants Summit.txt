good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global i want to welcome all of you to the compound grant summit so you're watching all of this on eatglobal.tv just a quick reminder to everybody this is a live streaming platform so as our speakers come up and if you have any questions or comments for any of our speakers today you can sign in on the chat and ask those questions uh directly and we'll be able to release them to our speakers also for everybody who joins in and signs and engages with our speakers we'll be giving out a nftpo app for every participant and those will be emailed to you next week so uh this event is organized by its global and for those of you who don't know meet global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits and ethonline is our biggest event of the year so this event is a hackathon and a handful of summits so for the hackathon we were eleven hundred developers and designers from 77 different countries participating in a four-week event from 19 different time zones uh there's so much creativity there and we're also doing a lot of incredible summits just highlighting everything that's going on in the theater ecosystem so we started off the event uh in our first summit on september 24th where we talked about everything that's happening with nfts and creators then on september 30th we talked about the ave ecosystem then last friday on the first we had our governance endow summit and today is our compound grant summit where we're going to highlight all the incredible things happening with the compound ecosystem tomorrow we'll be doing our developer tool summit and next friday is our final summit and at closing of this event where we're going to talk about all the amazing projects that came out of uh the hackathon as well as what is happening with ethereum ii so let's get into today's agenda and the summit so we're going to start off the day with larry arrow and getty talking about what does it mean to work for the compound protocol and then cole and spencer are going to talk about the compound dashboard and they're going to show what they've been working on then we'll have patrick talk about the account alerts he has worked on and then we'll have nick going into the details about how the compound treasury works in lab money supply and john talking about how to manage risk for compound we'll tori talk about the compound open source interface um and then jared talking about the gateway project from the compound team and we're gonna end the date with an ama with robert lesner where we're gonna source and ask a lot of questions from the community and ask them live robert so let's get started so without further ado i'd like to welcome on our first speakers for today um and larry arrow and getty are going to talk about what does it mean to work for the compound protocol so without further ado let's welcome all three of them on stage and uh welcome thanks cardtech um the is the four hours now you're all good sweet i guess the first thing i'll say is thanks so much to the global crew i mean they made it so easy for us all we have to do is show up and talk about compound which we're happy to do um you know i'm i'm the compound grants lead my name is larry sipurnick and just to give you guys a little bit of background on compound grants uh before we dive right into the the summit but compound grants is a community funded and independent grants program that was really uh created by just a lot of compound a group of compound fans and so it's not related to the core team and it was funded actually by the treasury which was one of the we were one of the first grants programs to do that right after unit swap and really our focus is pretty simple it's to uh fund really cool development happening on top of compound we've funded so far you know over 30 different grants to many many individuals and we will continue funding many more for uh for months to come we're sort of on pause right now in terms of the grants program as we're um you know we ran it for six months and now we're in the process of thinking about how to scale it to make it bigger faster and uh and even stronger than it was before and so you know you could find more about compound grants at compoundgrants.org or you could go to compounds telegram or discord to learn more about what the community is up to but you know we'll dive right in and just give you guys a taste for what it means to to work for compound um this panel i'm really excited about because you know we all sort of are getting an eye we all sort of met on the internet so this is this is a very internet d5 native panel um getty r do you guys want to give a quick intro to yourselves sure yeah so i'm uh getty hill um joined the compound community a long time ago um back when i was working with grapefruit trading and did training for the last few years and uh now i'm with gfx labs in our project and we do all sorts of uh fun things uh with compound and i'm a huge compound advocate so um r r zero zero arrow whichever uh you choose um i've been working with compound for a long time now i found compound about mid 2019 to late 2019 and just was in awe of it like you know everyone who comes into d5 is like wow this is so cool so i just looked at compound i was like i want to know how this works right so i went down on get read all the code it's like incredible it was on the discord for months and like initially before governance not much to do but then you know mid-2020 came and that was my time and and since then i've been helping out on proposals through any way i can and you know making impact and compound i think one of the first things maybe we could we could chat about is like what does it mean to work for compound protocol i think a lot of people they have you know regular jobs working for companies very standard recruiting process and then they hear about working people working for protocols and it's kind of a weird thing to do and it's not clear how to even get started but can you kind of talk about like what you think it means to to work for a protocol and how you even got started in the first place i know are you just mentioned a little bit but like practically what do people have to do to start working for compounds i'll go and say that you know i sat in the community for a long time long before there was a compound token so there wasn't like a big reason back then to get like super involved um it was just like chatting with the team mostly onboarding users giving feedback on like the product and like how compound v1 worked right it wasn't really until like about a year and a little more than a year and a half ago now that like the comp token came out and that there was like this new incentive structure for community members to like participate and actually um help like grow the protocol in a more active way than just relying on the core labs team back when they were kind of building building their product um that everyone's familiar with and using today so i think in my mind just having been around the protocol enough you occasionally will ask yourself well why doesn't it have this feature or why does it have that feature why doesn't this thing work why isn't that thing there uh and at least for me the the biggest impetus for my participation was um wanting the uh my first one was wanting the rap bitcoin collateral factory to be higher um and so like the compound has these cool community autonomous proposals where instead of needing like the gigantic well today it's 65 000 but back then it was a hundred thousand comp to actually make a proposal you could get like a hundred cop instead so i went a bottling bag of 100 comp like prior to this own no comp um which was like a fair amount of money for me at the time bought my 100 bag of comp went online like learned how to make a cap posted the cap up there and then just started like pestering and messaging people being like hey like this is a good idea like wrote out the like the methodology on the forums and then just try to keep sharing that with people until we got enough people on board to be like oh okay this is a good idea this can work and then like made a lot of friends that way and it kind of just snowballed from there um so for me like if i'm going to start from the very beginning i actually started out writing just articles and basically every proposal i would go very deep into the diff changes and the reasoning behind yes and no and trying to give people right an unbiased opinion on how to vote which would be very useful nowadays it's kind of um don't have enough time to do that anymore um but the community was very right up applauded that definitely and as i was really really well positioned question from the okay um i was very well positioned to start right building things on my own and contributing things because i saw how everything was moving and then i just you know got myself in and positioned myself to start contributing independently i think that contributing to a dao is very different than a normal job because right a lot of self-guidance and you really can contribute in any way it's not like anyone's going to tell you like no you're not welcome here right really any doubt that exists nowadays just needs more people doing more things and almost anyone can do any something which is helpful to the dow in some way and right get paid for their work we looks like have a question from the audience um i'll read it out loud there are a lot of defined lending protocols that do similar things in your mind what makes compound different what sets it apart from other d5 protocols that make you enjoy working with it so much um well i can go first and then curious what you guys think um i think i think you know generally that's the right positioning which is a lot of the d5 projects functionally like product wise kind of do similar things i think culturally though is where they start to differ and and my sense is and certainly what appeal made compound appeal to me personally is um you know the community i would say is way more um conservative i think relative on the risk side in particular relative some of the other kind of cowboy d5 projects and you know i think you know you want to build a project over many many dozens of years and make it as successful as it you know can be over the long term you have to uh think about risk deeply and think about the long term as opposed to um you know some projects that may be optimized for short-term gains at the expense of long-term thinking and then second i would say i think the website just looked really good and the brand good will look really good relative to some of the other projects which are really really confusing to use are getty what do you guys think um yeah so i'm just right i was starting started working with compound really when it was only one um right like mid 2019 late 2019 it was compound and ave was there but very small and then other than that i don't think there was anyone else um and i really just enjoyed my time with compound so much i love the community the compound team and right like just i'm in a state position where i'm really well positioned to contribute to the compound protocol and that's where i my time is the most useful um again right being conservative and thinking in the long term is really nice you don't have a like a pop-up project which is just here and all of a sudden you know clones someone else's code or something um so that's that's nice right compound team and community is just really incredible yeah that's that's the big difference to me um i mean i'm a fan of like pretty much all the like the main protocols like compound ave um maker dao um but compounding me is the one that has the most embracing community um it's definitely like if you're new to the community even if you're just a regular user it's a great feeling to join the discord and ask questions and get like an immediate reply from a community member or even like robert like chills out into sport all the time like that's a great feeling to know that like the whole team is like there and everyone's just trying to help everyone out and build a better product um i used to like be very interested in like make her down that was kind of like my first like big foyer into like i don't know uh d5 and i think i chose make it out at awkward time because it was when the depending was happening and i was at like 95 cents forever and there was the purple paper and a lot of bureaucracy so it was like uh just back in the day there was only two options really and compound was the one that was most embracing and never left yeah and i think um you know for folks who are not exactly sure what we mean by all this sort of stuff like just go to the forums right and look at the sophistication of the discussions and i think you'll find a really fleshed out uh thoughtful community um and you know i look at some of the other forums and you know everyone's trying to make a quick buck this is you know not the case for compound and i think that is appealing to a lot of people you know i think one of the one of the challenges a lot of projects and certainly you know compound and compound grants have is knowing you know as a contributor you're sort of not sure what exactly you should work on and what's the highest priority thing for the protocol that you could be spending your time on in the next you know few months how do you guys think about okay here's here's what i'm going to work on over the next few months that is actually useful to the protocol into the community if you're new to the protocol i and and you have you know a decent understanding of d5 or at least just like familiar and used compound before um i say go go the selfish route and say what do i want in the protocol that's not currently there it's very likely that other people also want that thing that you would want and then just start there and make it a passion project um and learn from there if you join the protocol and you truly do not know what to do but you want to get involved then we have a list of requests for proposals on compound grants of ideas for people or of course if you just join the discord chat of the forum and say hi i have these skills and i want to help we'll throw a lot of things at you and you can choose from the long list um yeah so for me it's generally a lot of just i'd say temperature checking right like seeing what people have been talking about over the past few weeks in discord what people want what comes up often and there's a lot of things which are just things that people want that haven't been a priority so like if i have free time one of those few things would probably get on the agenda it's very subjective which is again something which is specific to working to for a day where you are essentially your own boss and you decide what you're going to work on um but based on community um like feel you can figure out what is going to be important we can uh talk about the the sexy stuff now which is getting paid from compound protocol um and i think we have the right folks to talk about that because you know both getty and r have been paid from that from the treasury and and and getty in particular i think you're the only sort of you know salaried employee uh team member contributor of the protocol which is kind of cool i think for a lot of people it's a little bit awkward right people know exactly how much you're getting paid and it's all transparent and can you kind of like walk us through what it means to get paid from compound protocol and how you personally feel about it maybe you don't like the transparency of it maybe you do but how should people think about uh you know working for a protocol and public compensation figures yeah so i'll i'll preface it by that um compound for me is like a passion and something that i like enjoy like i have the the comp i'm earning for the protocol for me is not in my mind a salary none of that will probably ever get sold it's just going towards my already my already position in the protocol um so and when i got started in the protocol uh and started working on project there was no grants program so it was even more ambiguous at the time as to how you actually got paid to do work um so i think for me for me personally um [Music] and from what i've learned over the last year about figuring out what the protocol does need um and what's valuable to the protocol it is a lot of there's there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that the protocol needs to be working on um and for me in particular at the time it was like this oracle problem so for some of you might be familiar if you've been in crypto for a while which is probably most people watching the east global stuff you'll remember like the november 2020 like um die price happening on compound where the protocol function as expected but because of how it was configured it wasn't what an ideal outcome and that was like my call to action to like okay no one was fixing this for a few months i'll figure this out how am i getting paid don't really know and it was an extremely awkward process come like all right we did a lot of work here a lot of value was provided how do i get paid i think even today it's like we're still in the very early days of like dao so it's like only a year and a half of the compound now so everyone's still figuring it out but at least today there are the grants program so if you are curious about trying to get paid talking to larry and myself or other community members there you can get a very good sense of like um what compensation might look like what milestones you can reach to get that compensation so that you're getting paid before the actual work's performed in my case like all the work was performed and then i asked to get paid which makes it even more awkward um and then i guess the other half of that question is like how is it to be to know that like everyone knows when i'm getting paid and that it's like a bit of like a political issue like no matter which way you cut it uh like the sense that everyone knows what president gets paid in the united states and so on and so forth and all like the public servants um for my particular grant i i think a lot of it right now is back pay for the lot of the work that was performed that was kind of the preference it was submitted under was like i did six months worth of work here that was a lot of work um let's run it out for six months and at that point we'll revisit the topic and say like hey am i still contributing commensurate value to what is being rewarded to me in the community's eyes because it is all totally built on the compound protocol if the community were saying like you know what this getty guy he's not doing a good job they could just throw up a proposal anyone could who had the votes and they could just stop paying me whenever they wanted so i'm very well incentivized right now to make sure i keep doing productive work for the protocol in the future if i want to keep earning that amount so it's um a really interesting set of incentives that is totally totally new um but if anyone ever has questions about this stuff do do reach out to me i know um or i should say i suspect a lot of people watching this have worked in big tech are currently working in big tech and are i mean you you've worked in big tech too how does it what's that for a bit right but what was that what was the experience like working in big tech and then sort of going to compound and working for the protocol what are the things you you like more about compound less potentially kind of walk people through that transition um so big tech right you obviously depending on your position but in general you're given a task right and it's quite limited scope you work on the same thing generally for a long period of time um i guess compound is about the polar opposite you can get where your skill set is similar but you're doing completely different things and right there's a lot more to what you should be doing right you're thinking what should i be doing rather than actually doing right a lot of lobbying a lot of right person-to-person skills which you need to have to work for a doubt at least at this current time right you have to be on the pro on the forums explaining your reasoning behind what you're doing um and then actually executing it right people aren't going to be holding your hands and it's something where it requires a lot more independence and drive than working for a big tech company um i think for most a lot of people this is really good right big tech is well right you get paid nicely and your impact is limited and it's quite easy to just get content at big tech um working for dows keeps you on your feet keeps you up to date on all the you know newest tech and you know you got to keep running and then uh i'm sure what everyone is thinking what about compensation if you're working for big tech presumably you're still there because of the money do you think it's possible to make similar amounts of money working for dao's compound or even more amounts of money um i think that all three of us know it is definitely definitely possible to make more money working for dows and big tech definitely it's angelic more um and and you know um i know we're running a little bit short on time so one one more question for you guys but you know you've been working for compound for for a while now right i think you guys are probably uh some of the the leading contributors for the protocol knowing what you know now after working for the protocol for probably years now what do you what sort of advice would you give to the newcomer or someone who's considering starting to work for compound um i can go first um i'd say for a newcomer just like don't be afraid to just you know come on to the discord and say who you are say you want to help out like compound right is such on paper such a large company but we are very welcoming for to new contributors and like if you want to get started there's always going to be someone who's there to help you at the beginning and you know tell you what tools we're using and be able to answer your questions even for me there were people who are willing to answer my questions at every point when i was starting out and there's always something to be done in the protocol you just have to you know not be afraid to get your feet wet come into the discord and you know get started yeah i think that that's well said don't there will be times that um you'll get discouraged because unlike a big tech company here there is um some extra like people skills that you need in order to succeed and that you are you have to you know occasionally explain your stuff but on the bright side there's substantially more people who want to see developers and other community members and whatnot join the protocol and be productive contributors and we're all willing to i think put a lot of resources into helping onboard those new community members who are going to help us build the protocol into being the best it could possibly be awesome um and i would i would mirror that i would say um you know if you're working for a large company you're sort of like very much a cog in the machine right and no one or very few people i think like that feeling working for a protocol you know it initially may seem like you could potentially be stuck doing some minor tasks that no one really notices but it really anyone has the option and the ability to work on the thing to getting's point that you want to see in the protocol and take it from hey i have this vision in my head i think it's a little crazy i'm not going to talk about it publicly to all of a sudden working on it on the forums and making it a thing i think that's a very powerful thing that many people who work for traditional companies um may not be used to um certainly i had to get comfortable with that sort of power uh yeti r thank you so much guys for the time i think we're we're running out i'll uh i'll hand it back to car tech now thank you so much larry gideon arrow um this was amazing discussion i think just uh maybe to summarize uh i think the best thing about this thing is that i know you kind of implicitly implied but like anybody can be part of this from any place in the world and that to me is so exciting uh that you sort of now actually have a level playing field that you wouldn't have to be sort of bound by a region or some certain prerequisites or a college degree or something to contribute you actually are normalizing it to be skill-based and interest-based so this is incredible and compound has been doing an amazing job with this so thanks for that awesome discussion and uh i think with that we're ready to move on to our next uh talk thank you kartik so next up we have cole and spencer who are going to talk about the compound that they built as part of being a grant recipient so i will welcome both of them here on stage and uh colin spencer whenever you're ready feel free to get started welcome thank you awesome thank you so thank you everyone for coming today and really appreciate the invite to the talk today we are going to be presenting some work that we did for the compound grants program called the compound dashboard which is an analytics dashboard for the compound protocol you can actually go visit it now at compoundfinance.info if you want to check it out yourself and what it is is a dashboard for a holistic view of the compound protocol itself and a deeper dive into analytics so talk a little bit about ourselves we are paperclip labs we are an agency focused on building web3 products so we design develop and focus on user research and strategy our backgrounds are in the traditional tech world and we kind of realized that there was an opportunity here for us to bring our skill set to the grants program so my name is cole and joining me today is spencer you may have noticed our last names are the same we are actually brothers and we started paperclip labs about six months ago um i want to give a massive shout out to larry actually for really kind of getting us started and kind of asking us every day when we were going to quit our jobs and come and do this full time so today we're going to talk a little bit about what we built and the learnings that we learned from what we actually built what else we've done and what we're hoping to do next as an agency focused in this space yeah so first what we built uh is an analytics website for the compound protocol before we kind of get into what it is or kind of uh how we built it we kind of want to say why we built it so initially we were looking to invest in a stablecoin marketing compound and we're interested in seeing the historical interest rates to see which market had performed the best over time there was there wasn't really any data on this i looked on the content website and a few other websites couldn't really find anything i messaged in the compound discord and said you know is there currently a way to see historical market interest rates the response was kind of not really i looked at the discord and also saw other people had mentioned this earlier in the weeks past so we saw this as an opportunity to kind of create a product here to help people get more information about the compound protocol so for our mvp we just built a really simple website which showed the apy over time taking data from the compound api now this is kind of where the project is going to stop we kind of answered our question about what stable client we wanted to invest in and you know we shared this with the community hoping it would help some other people as well at the time the compound grants was just forming so actually one of the community members who was helping out with the compound grants committee introduced us to larry we spoke with larry about this and he kind of convinced us to kind of pursue this further so we applied for a grant to provide a website that would provide a holistic view of the compound protocol data and provide users data that they wanted to see to make informed investment decisions so this kind of brought us to the first stage of building this app out which is the initial research so in the initial research phase we we had a list of ideas of what we could do for this dashboard we knew that we needed to compare interest rates over time but didn't really know what else the community might want so we reached out to the community via the discord and sent out a survey just asking people you know what do you actually want to see from an analytics dashboard what's missing right now and what can we build to hopefully fill that that void we've got some really great results from this and one of the one of the bits of feedback that we received initially we actually brought forward with us and this is kind of our north star that we used when designing and building out the first iteration of the product and any future sets moving forward and that quote was you know i think making sure that the community member sent to us was you know i think making sure that every number on the page is meaningful even to the most novice of users and this was really valuable and really kind of set the stage for the way that we built the product itself we also wanted to ask what already exists out there uh were there other tools that could do this what other tools are kind of the best-in-class solution one of the platforms that we kind of referenced often is the uniso swap info dashboard this is a really easy dashboard to use and gives you a great overall view of the protocol as well as individual markets within unispot so we kind of felt like this was a great opportunity for compound to have something similar when it came to how could we compare interest rates over time we looked at a lot of different financial applications and the one that we found that did a really great job from a user experience was google finance there's a really neat feature in google finance that allows you to compare stocks prices over time and we felt that we could bring that feature in to the dashboard itself so in this image here you can see that we are comparing at the bottom there's a line item of little pill pills that you can click on and you can compare different interest rates over time by selecting different time frames so this is compound info this is the protocol overview page on this page it has information and data about the compound protocol as a whole so you see things like supply and borrow as well as reserves over time a few key pieces of information like how many unique users and utilization and you'll notice throughout the application there's these headings like the utilization one has these small underlines underneath probably might be hard to see in this image but as the user hovers over this they get a tooltip that pops up and it explains what utilization is how it's calculated and why it's useful this is important that you know no matter what caliber of users using this interface they'll be able to learn about different things of the compound protocol if they aren't already aware down below there's a table of all the compound markets so here there's a few key statistics and if we go and click into the die market we can get into the individual markets page so the main piece of information here is that apy over time chart that college showed so you can compare the supply and borrow api with and without the comp distribution of different assets over time we also have some key statistics about the market again on all these headings or tooltips that the user can hover over to get more information if they're not sure what this piece of data is and below there's another chart which should supply borrowing reserves over time for the individual asset so kind of how it was built in the development stack behind this the company api provides really good data about like current um about the current market but we weren't able to pull the data in from there about historical interest rates and all the like time series data to populate our charts actually a community member from the compound discord reached out and introduced us to flip side crypto flip side is a data aggregator for the blockchain they aggregate on-chain data into these tables that allow users to query them off-chain so what we did is write sql queries and then a really um powerful tool that they have is exporting these queries as an api so we talked to the crypt the flip side crypto team asked them if it was okay to use their their application for data for hours so they're kind of our backend for all the times use data we use gas now for the gas information on the website and then the compound api for any of the current information like market statistics this all comes into our react application on the front end and gets displayed and re we use recharge for our plotting libraries so once we release this the community we kind of put it out in the community discord dm'd a few members that were really active and just kind of wanted to get some feedback initially everybody said you know this is really cool they find this really useful but they wanted to see more so this is one quote from a community member says this is awesome do the interest rates include com any way to get more information there is part of historical rates at the time our api chart didn't include the comp distribution so we actually had this kind of in the pipeline it was a feature that was coming but uh so we implemented this um we were able to implement this pretty easily to toggle on and off the comp distribution for your assets um so essentially uh there's a lot of requests similar to this one from community members and we kind of got thinking you know what other value can we bring to the table what other things can we do and what are our next steps here yes so with regards to next steps um as spencer mentioned we reached out to the community again this time with another survey asking community members what they wanted to see what additional things they wanted to see beyond the current version of the the analytics dashboard that we had built we received some really great feedback from the community members and we ended up taking that feedback and compiling some feature sets that we were actually able to come back to the grants committee and apply for a second grant to continue building the dashboard itself so we're currently actually working on the next version of the dashboard and that will be slowly releasing some new features for that in the coming weeks today we want to also talk about like what we learned actually working for the grant committee uh or the compound grants program um so the first thing is that we learned working here is that the timelines are self-driven as a as a grant recipient you set the timeline as as well as the milestones for your project so it's really important that if you are thinking about doing a grant you really set realist our recommendation would be setting you know realistic timelines and milestones for you to hit and achieve so you can build that product and get that out another thing we learned is there's many ways to gather feedback you don't have to just use the discord channel you can use things like twitter reddit dm community members and even like searching uh old the historic or the uh historical information in discord you can find some really great questions from community members about possible features that might be missing another thing we learned is that you prioritize the features at the beginning we mentioned this quote that we received from the user saying that the dashboard should be easy for as easy for a novice user to use when we got feedback from the community we did have to think about making sure that the information that we're going to be displaying and new features that we might input into the dashboard meet that criteria of being easy to use so we did have to kind of cut some some community feedback we felt in some cases there was some feedback that was maybe more of an advanced feature that you could probably find or build and do an analytics dashboard or some other dashboard we felt that our analytics dashboard was really just focused on that core community as our core novice user of the protocol and giving a a pretty good understanding of what's going on within the protocol itself and the last thing is that the community is amazing and awesome we found that people are so willing to give you feedback and help you as spencer mentioned you know a community member reaching out and introducing us to the flip side team so our biggest recommendation is if you are working on a grant or thinking about working for a grant reach up to the community you can get some really great feedback from them and learn a ton as well so that was one of the grants that we did we've actually worked on two and other compound grants along the way and we'll quickly just share you share with you some of the other grants we've worked on so we had the opportunity to do the help with the compound grants branding we partnered with the compound design team and massive shout out to jason on the design team for really supporting us throughout this experience you can check out the compound grants branding on the twitter pages or on their the compound grants website we also worked on a platform called stake signal which is almost like a margin call tool for the compound protocol uh we worked on the branding product design and user research phases for this product and actually patrick is going to be sharing in the next talk so we won't talk too much more about this but wanted to kind of share some of the other things we've been able to do so what's next for us um so from the compound grants program and the work that we've done here we've actually got some other projects which has been really amazing for us as an agency to keep building so most recently we did the branding logo and website for the d5 education fund we've had some opportunities to work on some really cool projects in the nft and gaming spaces which we hopefully will be able to share in the future as we worked in this industry as well we've kind of realized there is a bit of a gap for contractors and freelancers uh as with regards to kind of getting paid and getting set up so we're currently thinking about uh working on our own project at the moment about how that how we could kind of make that transition easier for a freelancer etc coming into the space and how getting paid can work and manage we're also always looking to to other to work with grants as well so if you do have any grants or are interested in working with us in the future please feel free to reach out you can send us a dm on twitter which is at paperclip labs or you can check out our website which will be posting some information about our some of our projects that we've worked on in in the near future so you can check that out as well again thanks so much for having us today and really hope that everyone has the opportunity and goes to think about things about applying for the grant we would highly recommend the compound grants program as a place to get started and build some cool products amazing gold spencer that was an incredible presentation and uh such amazing work we're getting a lot of great comments on the chat too about how impressive everybody is with the ui and all of your future feature plans um i was gonna ask you how people can get involved but you already ended with that so everybody check out paperclip.xyz and uh this is amazing let us know how anybody else can contribute to this this is great thank you so much thank you thank you cool so with that we are ready for our next demo and our next talk and for that i'd like to invite patrick who is going to be talking about account alert so uh patrick welcome feel free to get started whenever you're ready hey guys uh yeah it's it's great to be here uh let me let me share my presentation and then i'll get started okay uh so uh stake signal um so this is a project uh that i built with compound grants uh dao as well as with paperclip labs as they mentioned before um and uh the really cool thing about how it all started was that uh compound grants was and larry uh actually got me in touch with um paperclip labs uh and and because uh basically there was a a skill set a compliment that they could provide so part of uh i think what grants does and the community does is even if your skill set is very particular you can contribute a lot and you'll be sort of uh able to find people that complement your talents uh and that will help you uh contribute to the doubt even if you know you think i'm really good at doing x well then x will be super helpful and uh in a sort of decentralized way we can get get your skill set uh into interesting projects um so you can find my github at centuryape on twitter as well centuryape so i'm going to cover uh basically five topics today first is just working for a dow [Music] and then i'll demo stake signal and then i'll cover a couple of topics just in terms of the code mechanics of interacting with compound getting data building apps for adapts with compound and then a little bit of a road map for the future of stake signal so the first thing about working for a dao is it really you can choose your level of involvement quite a bit so i'm still working my day job and if you are working your day job you can still hang out on discord and you can get paid in crypto to do a real project and it truly is that easy um you just need to be able to take the leap and you you get in there um you say well for me like my strength is mainly in in back end uh uh with like some front end and like let's say you need to have uh someone help you with design or you need someone to help you with solidity or something like that uh you you can find someone to help you or if you're good at solidity then you need someone who can do the front end um or do integrations or something like that for you um that all exists and and that's this is sort of what compound grants exist to do is to enable you uh to to do cool projects so a compound is a protocol that's handling billions of dollars but for a protocol handling billions of dollars uh it's really uh you know you think how much work that that entails it requires a lot of work in a lot of fields so whether you're a solidity developer a front-end backend a designer ui ux a data scientist a hacker or test engineer or if you're just good at project management that's incredibly needed right now and then if you're good at integrating with third-party tools for example flip side crypto or for me um integrating with the sendgrid and twilio um for sending emails sending uh text alerts you know that that's that is all work that uh needs to be done and uh for me really focusing on what i was good at and being able to hook up with paperclip labs to provide a lot of help on the the design side was super helpful and i think if you have something that you want to build or if you want to look at the rfps that are there um then you're you're gonna find quite a lot of success uh working and i i highly encourage you to you know to make the leap and and to try uh so how did stake signal get started it was actually started with a tweet by robert um basically we need someone to build a margin call system and then how's it going well now stakesignal.app is live and you can go uh to the website right now and you can also check it out and set up alerts via email right now so uh compound as a as adapt you can uh save money you can uh borrow crypto but it doesn't contact you in any sort of way you know it's an entity sort of existing on the blockchain uh but there are events uh for example when i started uh basically the day i got my grant uh was was in may when uh the the market was crashing and there were like tons of liquidation so that was that was a day when stake signal was needed but not no project of that sort existed then uh and then the day i got my grand you know i started getting cracking on making it so that a website can react to events like price changes or health changes and then uh send send you a message so that that's sort of the need for for stake signal um so i'm gonna share the the app so i'm going to switch over for a second [Music] okay so here's stake signal um basically you can connect your wallet uh with metamask you log in uh it shows you alerts so here are all sorts of rules that you can set um i'm borrowing more than 70 when 65 percent uh email me when obvi is below a certain number a cop is above a certain number so she's above a certain number and uh the way that steak dingle is gonna message you is it's only gonna message you once per day uh it's not gonna spam you or anything like that um but you get in uh you can create an alert so you can set a price alert for example set a price target for each at you know 30 200 and then you can create the alert so then we've got a new alert for eth uh right down here at the bottom okay so i'm gonna that that's uh sort of what was built um let me let me go back to the presentation so basically uh right now for sake signal we've got email contact and i want to sort of talk about uh getting started uh basically because for me i i was a developer only working in web 2. i've never done an uh i don't i haven't written or deployed a smart contract i haven't done anything in web3 before but it was really helpful for me that entry-level ethereum is almost entirely in javascript and much of the development experience and tooling is in javascript and for building an app there's so much stuff that you can do just using javascript um or python or whatever you know uh and you don't have to touch solidity because there's tons of work that doesn't require actually getting into the guts of the smart contract and decentralized protocols like compound need a lot of talented developers and will pay for you to do interesting work in crypto um and one for example one super high priority right now is to maintain an open source and javascript front end and and do other types of uh apps for the protocol uh so just a quick note about sort of how a stake signal was built uh first of all log in with metamask so that's something that a lot of websites will be needing to use getting forward i've included a link here uh login with metamask demo this is how i learned how to implement login with metamask for stake signal so if you're looking to do something on your own uh if you're looking to do something on your own you know this is exactly what uh you can do to get started it's got an example front end app it's got an example back end app uh and you can take what exists there and uh just turn it into uh your app uh uh so the second part here uh is uh sorry about that um so for for sign login with metamask um the important part here is uh the web3 uh east personal sign and you just have that in there your users will sign the message uh it'll send the signature to the back end you're backing your back-end can check uh the message and then return a jwt to authenticate the user uh next um the uh working with data from compound on the back end so uh compound.js.api is super helpful um so how do i get uh health information back from compound uh well it's this request here so uh require compound finance compound.js and then you just await a compound api account and that will give you uh basically a list of addresses all of their health statuses things like that so you can just pull this and get account health from compound js.api and then uh use that data for your own uh your own app and then the next one is uh how do you get prices and query on chain data um so uh there's public code that i have at my github compound oracle util um basically uh it's the same as interacting with any uh east smart contract using web3.js uh you basically pass in the contract api you pass in the contract address and then you'll be able to grab read functions from the date uh the contract or if you're building a more advanced app then you can actually interact with various contracts so for example with compound you can supply or take out loans or do something like that um and then um here's just a laundry list of what i found was useful in building stake signal um like this as a developer this is something you want to learn in terms of building something that interacts with compound so uh compound js all the data from the protocol is there uh web3 so basically being able to interact with metamask and with uh inferior and other data sources and the blockchain for logging with metamask check out the github that i posted but also um these are this is how i implemented it with uh sig util ethereum js util and json web token uh for state signals api uh with node.js express and jwt decode uh for automation uh for like javascript automation i used bull um and then for securing things like uh secret environment variables i use dot end and then other useful tools to learn sort of as a blockchain developer building apps uh use infrared for on-chain data um use firebase to rapidly deploy and uh redeploy your app and then bull and redis for your worker processes so that's how i got the automation that drive stake signal in is uh by learning bull by using it managing the the automated polling the automated triggers all that stuff so it's super helpful in terms of building out an automated system and then sort of a roadmap for where state signal is going so don't have too much time left but i'd like to conclude here text alerts is the next major thing um so i have the text alerts uh i need to work out uh sort of all the things with um subscribing unsubscribing and things like that um i'd like to provide public data on protocol health uh so basically uh have a downloadable csv uh just consume the data from my website turn it into a csv provider for the users and then i think last and but most important is the way safety tools originally envisioned with email and text i think is not quite right i think for crypto uh lots of people value their privacy uh and you know having a service that is consuming your email and your phone even though for me i'm i'm encrypting everything there's no way for somebody reading the database to get it or link the unencrypted email or phone to your account i still think that a lot of people prefer to have a higher level of privacy so i'd love to get suggestions uh feedback things like that on what sort of api i can build that will let people get secure but also timely notifications on their account uh and i think that's sort of like for the next year um where i want to take uh state signal um so yeah thank you guys very much um and that is it i highly recommend people work for compound you know you whatever you know how to do um there there is a place for you a super open community and literally it's as easy as just log into discord and and say what's up i'm i'm here to help uh thank you amazing thank you so much patrick that was a such a good presentation and just a cool utility i mean this is clearly something that compound and so many other projects need to um i think you kind of brought up one interesting point which i want to highlight for everybody watching it's it you don't necessarily need to know how to write smart contracts to be part of this uh so much of what we're doing integrates and still works really well with the web 2 world so if you're a back-end developer front-end developer you just understand how to work with apis to do certain things those are still valid options and utilities and exactly what you're just building on is a perfect example of that you can still tie this into how emails work and people still need this um so that's that shouldn't be very true entry and you can improve in that with that excellent product um so that's amazing i was gonna say i think one obvious thing that you can think about is just having web workers in the background so instead of running and tying into different services you can just have what workers do a push notification um directly you know just be a cool one because then you can also offload the infrastructure on the client side uh but that's awesome but uh cool so great thank you yeah and uh we are ready to move on to our next uh presentation so next up we have nick and nick's gonna be talking about the compound treasury so nick without further ado welcome hey guys thank you for having me here let me go ahead and just share my [Music] screen okay awesome i hope this is showing up okay um cool so i'm nick i am the partnerships lead for compound treasury um which is a product from compound labs uh oh let me give you one second i might have shared the wrong one oh here we go yeah um so today i'll be giving an overview of compound treasury i want to start with just a little bit of compound protocol background which i'm sure most people here are familiar with but just kind of frame how we went from uh the compound protocol itself to the treasury offering um and then dive into a little bit of the risks and considerations that a number of more traditional financial firms are thinking about when they want to participate in d5 so to kick it off i'm sure most of you are familiar with the compound protocol obviously um it's an open source uh interest rate marketplace for various ethereum assets where anyone can come with their crypto um we've seen i think the most popular use case in uh compound's lifetime has been um these trading firms and hedge funds who are supplying uh volatile assets like bitcoin and ethereum and then borrowing stable assets like usdc dive or tether and what that produces is this uh pretty high interest rate on stable coins that's been integrated into a number of different applications projects exchanges custodians um uh and has been pretty successful um the compound protocol itself will always remain open and freely accessible um and we're sort of building treasury as a premium service on top so under the hood um as most probably familiar users are supplying assets into liquidity pools um unlike traditional lending where they're matching uh sort of various suppliers and borrowers based on shared terms and the over collateralization presents a new type of risk profile i think than most traditional investors are used to since all borrowing is over collateralized and the health of someone's principle essentially depends on the automatic liquidation mechanism um so that's sort of a key part and when we talk to folks who aren't familiar with d5 is getting them comfortable with the fact that if someone borrows close to more than what they've supplied there that this open ecosystem of liquidators will come in and keep the protocol solvent interest rates are simply determined by supply and demand for borrowing of each asset in the pool and this presents both uh benefits and drawbacks to different parties people like the floating interest rate because they don't need to be matched on a fixed rate with a borrower but there are other sort of financial firms who have a lot of interest in locking in a fixed rate so that they can more easily plan around future products or releases a little bit on what the protocol has done so far so there's been over 160 and probably at this point closer to 180 billion dollars worth of assets supplied um probably closer to 60 billion dollars worth of assets borrowed um over 300 000 active users um and a lot of crypto native uh institutions have integrated the protocol um exchanges like binance okx ok coin um projects like ledger or argent or fire blocks have all integrated the protocol to launch different types of earn or save features and so for the first three years or so of the protocol's existence this was a major focus of the community is how can we expand compounds interest rate markets natively into these various different avenues for liquidity just a little bit more on our team so we are compound labs obviously the team is distributed was originally based in san francisco we built the protocol back in september of 2018 pioneered a lot of the concepts of in d5 and we've now set up a new subsidiary which is offering this treasury product so when we think about the transition from the compound protocol to compound treasury uh the genesis from it came uh from these existing financial firms who are interested in accessing the high rates in d5 but didn't want to deal with the operational complexity of converting their fiat into crypto managing their private keys um uh paying for custody um and setting up all the kind of different service providers they would need in the back end to access these high rates that exist on stable coins so that was our impetus to build this treasury product which essentially seeks to create the lowest barrier to entry to accessing the benefits of the protocol so with treasury we abstract away all of those complexities that i mentioned we do all this in the back end and present users with a very simple experience for earning interest um and supplying dollars rather than coming with crypto um we think over time this will bring more institutions into d5 sort of starting with a limited offering and then as they get more comfortable with the protocol mechanics and maybe other types of protocols on ethereum and other chains um they'll want to dip their toes a little deeper but with treasury we simply offer four percent on cash balances we do all the conversions uh for our customers um using different service providers like fireblocks who's our partner in this offering and very simply we take the variable interest rate that the protocol produces on usdc and we guarantee this fixed rate of four percent back to the customer and you can see a little bit of what that interface looks like should feel somewhat similar to the compound app interface but a lot of the complexities are abstracted away this is a little more granularity on the terms of the offering um so we guarantee that four percent apr for one year um there's daily liquidity on positions uh with funding and withdrawals by wire transfer um we're currently only offering to us-based accredited institutions so that's institutions with at least five million dollars worth of net assets um but we expect to expand this offering over time to hopefully make it as easy as possible for anyone with traditional us dollars to get started with d5 so just walking through what it would look like to fund your treasury account and get started earning um people would simply pull up wire instructions send a wire from their bank um they can use an interface or the api to track their balance there's also reporting tools that are a little more familiar to people who uh use web2 products today um rather than querying stuff on the blockchain directly so they can simply export balance and activity history in a csv and then to withdraw they simply click an amount that they want to send back to their bank that they originally registered with us so it's a really simple flow for the customer um in the back end the interest rates are powered by d5 but it's sort of combining these two worlds of uh fintech and decentralized finance um and this is a little more granularity on the flow of funds itself so this is how we work with our partner fireblocks and some banking providers um as well as coinbase who's doing the conversion it's a pretty simple process of taking the dollars converting them into usdc supplying of the protoculture and interest um and then custodying them on the fireblocks platform and the flow in reverse works exactly the same way this is a little bit just on what we collect from potential customers um treasury is only offered to these institutions where we're doing kyc and a credit investor verification which is obviously very different than the compound protocol which is openly accessible to anyone with a web 3 wallet um a little bit on the risk considerations as you can imagine um you know a number of financial institutions like banks and fintechs see the benefits of these higher interest rates and liquidity that d5 provides but they're very interested in digging into what is the risk profile of these products look like and how would they fit amongst um you know the other sort of assets that we're holding or other yield strategies we have in traditional finance um so when we look at treasury what we try to point these people to um is to understand the risks in the flow of funds so how do you go from u.s dollars in a bank account into the actual yield bearing assets cusdc and fire blocks custody there obviously can be risks in the flow of funds to get there um there could potentially be custodial risks in how those cusdc are being stored and then there's counterparty risk and that you are now interacting with a business which is a compound prime or entity instead of a protocol directly um all these risks are very well mitigated with the secure flow of funds we've created fire blocks has best in class custody um so these uh risks i think are very well mitigated for these customers um and then on the protocol itself uh there's a big sort of educational piece we do for these firms there's sort of a difference between the actual risk on the protocol and the perceived risk but the things that these financial institutions need to be aware of is any potential default risk so would a borrower not be able to repay what they go to the protocol and suppliers um would become insolvent um which has never happened thanks to a really efficient liquidation engine um is there liquidity risk and that an entire market would be borrowed out and someone couldn't get their funds back in a timely manner um this also never really happens outside of when a market is less than a million dollars but in markets like usdc um with billions of dollars of supply capital um there's typically always 20 of its total volume and open liquidity um and then lastly is any code security risk so um is there a way for someone to maliciously take user funds out of the pool um and we've mitigated this through a number of security audits and um some great community members who consistently monitor the protocol um so that's pretty much it i hope it was helpful to kind of see the evolution from uh the compound protocol into this treasury offering um how it may be appealing to more traditional financial firms who aren't ready yet to fully dip their toes into d5 who want to get started and understand the risks and benefits awesome thank you so much nick that was a great overview of the treasury product um one quick question uh what has been the reaction for people who have tried this this is clearly a much much better offering than the alternative uh i'm just wondering how people have reacted to this yeah i mean uh we have a few customers on board today they all really enjoy the experience um they sort of see it as an educational tool right so they're earning you know more than they would usually um they're also just getting more involved in the compound ecosystem we've seen them you know it kind of serve as like a gateway drug in a d5 right it's it's very simple to get started but then you start learning more uh about the processes underneath and we think it'll really just open up the floodgates to institutional capital in the space that makes a lot of sense so hopefully i will have a lot more people switching over and we get to see more defy companies or descriptor companies use this as a treasury product so uh thanks for that and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk so next up we have john and lenny supply talking about managing risk for compound so i'd like to welcome them both um on screen and uh let them get started so welcome yeah thanks for having us yeah thanks don um so mona i think we start with quick intros you want to go first i can follow up there yeah um i uh have been in the uh the d5 space for maybe about a year and a half um previously i i worked in consumer lending and abs at kind of like a boring fintech company and then just fell in uh with maker dao and and got really excited about that i've been working kind of formally with the makered iris team for about a year um and trying to uh be helpful when i can with with compound and other lenders kind of playing to to my knowledge well so um i'm john i'm ceo at gauntlet um gauntlet is a financial modeling platform um that uses battle tested techniques from the algorithmic trading industry to form on-chain protocol management what this looks like is really sort of two things uh one we manage risk parameters for protocols like ave compound um and uh and others as well as we also manage incentives for verbals like uh sushi and a few others as well so um yeah we use off-chain financial models to drive on-chain capital efficiency uh and yeah we recently uh we've been working with compound since uh 2019 uh and i know nick on the last call uh mentioned our risk assessment that we published then and uh yeah and we actually just uh pushed a proposal through run compound to sort of cement our relationship with them uh and continue to manage risk uh for the protocol going forward we focus almost entirely on market risk um which uh is the risk opposed to basically the use of volatile um and uh occasionally liquid aspects is collateral on compound and um but you know i think one thing we'll talk about today um both uh monet and i is uh you know sort of the different types of risks and then so just uh yeah looking forward to getting into that so i think one thing is probably top of mind for everyone who's been following combat over the past week and i think is the uh bug that we saw last week um so you know i think one thing we'll probably do is really talk about that a little bit and then move on to um some other risks and other risks in the protocol uh you know because you know besides just smart contract issues hacks exploits whatever you want to call them um you know like lending and other protocols like compound that use collateral um do face other risks and we kind of get into that after so um i'm assuming that people are a little bit familiar um with the with the bug on compound but last week um for the people that weren't uh a change was pushed to update some logic in the comp token distribution logic uh and this actually created a mixed calculation and how many comp rewards should be distributed to to certain users and um in doing so put um close to 160 million dollars of confident risk um since then uh you know i think robert mentioned yesterday that um about 60 million comp has been unaccounted for um though much of the comp was actually returned to the protocol by um awesome users and members of the greater compound community um one interesting thing that actually happened this week was probably a kind of interesting thing to start talking about is there's actually been two proposals to fix the bug one of which was actually canceled this morning um and the other of which was going to be executed in two days um you know i think monet i'd love to know sort of your thoughts about um searching the trade offs that we saw with proposal 63 and maybe we kind of start there and and start talking about sort of the you know path forward to fixing this bug and the sort of tough decisions that protocol had to make with regards to trade-offs um on risk versus growth yeah yeah it's all uh all trade-offs um so yeah proposal 63 um was pushed out really quickly um like props to to the you know community members who got that out so quickly um it did face there's like a standard seven days worth of uh like delay periods and voting periods before any new changes can go through governance so the sooner they got that out the sooner we could kind of plug the hole so to speak but what it did is it basically just turned off the ability to claim comp just uniformly so anyone who tried to claim comp it would just that transaction would fail um which would prevent any of the people who had like too much rewards allocated to them from being able to drain anymore from compound um so it kind of stems the bleeding one issue with that though is that certain integrators um not all of them but i think some they kind of like worked the comp cleaning into their workflow where [Music] if compound turned off the ability to claim comp it would interfere with with their ability to kind of have their protocols work or have their projects work properly so compound faces like a faced a difficult kind of trade-off between um the risk of losing some more of those comp tokens that are still at risk in the comptroller which uh even as we speak there i think there's you know a few tens of millions that could be claimed um versus kind of burning some of our our key integrators who have you know taken upon themselves to to build on top of compound and that's something that we you know the community obviously wants that's that's a really important growth driver um so yeah proposal 63 was was meant to kind of like quickly stem the bleeding but um it was it was kind of like decided to cancel it um to not impact those integrators and the hope is that either no more or not much more comp is going to be incorrectly claimed in the next day or two um and then proposal 64 which which is passed and is um is going to be executed shortly in like another day or two um that has like a more targeted fix where it just prevents claiming from from just those users that would have potentially incorrect uh rewards issued to them um and it wouldn't end up kind of stepping on toes of the integrators so um yeah there's like it's kind of almost like a business risk um like what what could compound lose in the long run um of being like unreliable to build on top of and is that worth more than maybe the uh the comp tokens that we might lose right now if people incorrectly claim them i personally was was kind of surprised you know that that the the trade-off kind of fell that way it's it's i think it's easier to to see like you know a specific amount of money at risk and say okay we're gonna go for that um but i could also see that it makes sense to like be just relentlessly kind of user focused and be willing to take a little bit of an l um to make sure that we're doing right by our users yeah um you know i think it definitely is a tough decision for the protocol i think you know from the three integrators i talked to um which were uh yearn idle and ousd um it seemed like actually only idle was gonna be like uh truly negatively impacted in a way where they couldn't actually push a fix um that would actually mitigate any of the issues posed by proposal 63. uh you know i think it's a thing where i think in any normal organization you'd have someone who's managing these integrated relationships um and you know helping set expectations even maybe like doing technical reviews being like hey um these integrations are reliant on you know functionality like claiming comp rewards um and that makes them like very brittle to literally any functionality in the protocol um changing or being deprecated and so i think that um you know that's actually an interesting thing to sort of think about is like uh it would be normally really weird for a company to continue to put 40 million dollars at risk for um an integration that has driven much much less than that of value to the protocol um however like it's hard to to manage these relationships when you know all you're doing is reaching out and something goes wrong so i think it's an interesting thing to see how protocols in the future will kind of invest in um managing relationships so that in the case there were some issue or they need to make changes etc then be in a position to work with integrators um to sort of help figure out figure that out i think it's just incredibly unlikely that the impact on integrative proposal 63 uh is anywhere near close to 40 million dollars in value now it's also very unclear the chances of this account being claimed right anyone who could have claimed comp um in the window between 63 and 64 could have also done so for whatever the past week and so um i think that there is a some very tough calculus there um but you know i i think that a lot of the integra you know integrators were um understandably complaining about hey like well this is going to break us and like i think hey everyone empathizes i know we it gauntlet we depend on so many different api endpoints service providers etc we have to deal with this stuff all the time um but i do feel like there was times where i feel like people were maybe less than understanding for you know this is a solid event for the compound community and compound protocol and its users uh and it's the worst thing that's ever happened to compound unequivocally and after like the worst week of your life like i would kind of hope that integrators and partners that are driving tons of value from your protocol might be a little more understanding about some of these um issues and i think i think a lot of people you know tried to be but you know of course wanted to vocally um speak out trying to say like hey let's just try to figure out a way that we can not break these integrations et cetera but um but yeah you know i think it's a learning experience for for the community and hopefully something that other d5 protocols will be able to continue to um learn from yeah i think it's you could kind of say that it's like a really unexplored uh area of risk is like kind of like the business uh development and sort of more of like the integrations and like um yeah it's like a risk to your business even though it's not uh like strictly falling in like risk management uh frameworks or like something that gauntlet or or maybe you know myself we would have um kind of the most like focus on in a normal sense so i think it's yeah it's definitely been like a big eye-opening experience um yeah you know um i noticed actually if anyone has read uh roon from from maker's recent post i think he mentioned actually some statistics around the amount of uh i think cdps are not what they're called anymore um but the amount of collateral in maker that actually comes from either like kind of uh c5 on-ramps or other like large integrations right i think it's actually maybe like half of um the east uses collateral and makered out all comes from uh a couple large positions so uh money do you have any more context on that maybe we could like shed some lighter color there yeah um yeah there's a few c5 protocols that bring like really huge volume i think like nexo is one of them that's kind of publicly known and they they bring like well over half a billion of loan volume there's some sort of like they might be c5 platforms or there might just be like mega mega defy whales like there's a set of like a few like large cdps that account for a lot of the uh like expansion during when each price goes up and then they kind of like unlever when it goes back down so yeah it's extremely concentrated and at maker we're uh only just kind of beginning to sort of see if we can handle these relationships a little bit more hands-on um you know like i think there's there's people ideating of like can we um can we see if we can like reduce our risk and offer also kind of more attractive terms to certain um sort of like institutional grade users if they can prove that their their risk profile is lower than just like you know joe schmo off the street um so i think that's we're mainly approaching it from like the perspective of um like if we can kind of verify that their devops and and just like their general risk uh posture is is good enough that we can make a better offer um but i think there's another element where um you know if if we're not really meeting their needs or if we had a situation similar to this and um our response was causing them a lot of problems um yeah that'd be a that'd be a huge hit to die um you know a lot of a lot of our die for me is from a really small number of users yes i think like given that i guess market structure or their pareto s distribution of of users like these uh sort of um like business development risks or i think i'm not sure how you put it i think these things will be an interesting thing kind of going forward in a lot of d5 protocols where trying to figure out how to um be the best i don't for instance incompetence lending platform um to integrate with and things like that these are things that could you know really drive a ton of growth and i think it's that potential growth is what probably drove the compound community to you know really try uh you know to really risk a lot to avoid breaking some of these integrations and i think um you know i i don't envy um er you know everyone else here and who has to white knuckle this and really just hope no no more money is removed from the protocol next few days but you know i think right now uh everyone's been just scouring etherscan addresses trying to figure out um you know if people are going to claim et cetera and you know i'm i'm really hoping i got to replace a high confidence here that this is the right path forward and and uh you know i think it shows how important these um business relationships are maybe we can move on to other sorts of risks um but i think one thing um you know that any collateral based system has to to reconcile is basically loan to values or um in common's case they call them collateral factors um these are actually some of the parameters that gauntlet sets for compounding and as well as ave and a few others um you know i think monet you really thought about a lot of these risks in the um you know coming from the maker dow um i'd love to kind of know a little bit like how does uh you know maybe make or set some of these parameters and then what does that look like and then um maybe we can provide a perspective from how this works in in off and compound work work on manages for manages these parameters yeah um there's there's kind of a couple key factors that we look at um and you know primarily like we're we're trying to suss out like in a a reasonably worst case scenario how much the value could go down for some of these loans and and whether we can get them all liquidated without some of them going like under collateralized and basically like bankrupt positions it can be really tough to to do that accurately because um yeah you're really trying to like guesstimate um how much something could drop without necessarily a lot of like historical uh records to go by um so i think it's it's pretty typical like you look at um the depth in you know order books and liquidity pools to see okay if you know we needed to liquidate x value of position how much slippage would it cost um and you know if it's if it's causing like 50 slippage then um you know you you'd probably need to set a very low collateral factor just to make sure that you're still you know if you flip all that collateral and dump it on the market you still wouldn't be bankrupt um you you know you also look at volume which is kind of indicative of like people's willingness to buy [Music] a collateral asset um so that's another factor um volatility and then also kind of like historical like max drawdowns uh i think in a way like the day-to-day volatility of like if something's going up five or ten percent a day and then down like those aren't the sort of situations that are going to cause real problems um you really want to like think of okay what are the um the real kind of market break situations where a collateral asset falls like 30 in a day or 50 or like 65 percent intraday like it did on uh march 12th uh last year um so yeah basically taking a lot of different kind of data points into account a lot of them are are shifting pretty quickly you know like volumes and liquidity depth can expand a lot and then kind of draw that draw down a lot just depending on market sentiment [Music] what i would say for maker though is i think we have a we have a bit simpler or maybe easier of a job of risk management versus uh versus somebody like compounder ave because everyone who who's doing business with maker they're short usd um they're all borrowing or minting in our case die which is which is usd so we only need to consider each assets sort of like volatility with respect to that one other asset that they're shorting um somebody like uh you know protocol like compound you can i would say most people are you know borrowing dollars that's kind of the most popular trade but um you could uh go long east and short bitcoin or you could you know go long usd and then short any of the other collateral assets on compound um so it's it's um it's pretty daunting to be honest uh you have to kind of like consider any of these individual positions that people either do have or could have and make sure that the sort of inter-asset liquidity and volatility is is not going to break you um so yeah i think it's it kind of gets that like one one layer deeper of complexity with with uh the money market protocols yeah i mean i think one thing that like maybe like depending on you know at what time point you look at navi have like maybe 60 to 85 percent of their borrow also in usd um so it's it's at this point just because the borrower usage on the more volatile assets is just lower um you know the summer looks some of the risks do look pretty pretty similar from that perspective but i can talk a little bit about how how gauntlet models risk uh for for protocols like compound anabe i think one thing to shout out here is you know we have a risk dashboard for ave that we launched a couple weeks ago we're launching one for for compound soon that just gives users community members um token holders a way to kind of look into like statistics like the current value at risk of the protocol um current uh parameter settings et cetera if you go to gov dot gauntlet dot network slash ave you can see um the avengers dashboard but um you know behind the scenes uh beside behind all these numbers that we publish we actually focus on stochastic simulations that um help us predict uh protocol behavior in the case of these really large drawdowns um so what we do is kind of a multi-step process the first step is we use historical market data to train correlated price trajectories um so that um we can simulate different uh outcomes we actually try to tune our simulations to like the march 12th volatile levels of volatility and so we basically then from these price trajectories um use uh agents that do things like open up positions on compound take out uh borrows as well as uh liquidators um and so as these simulations progress we actually just spin up uh like thousands and thousands of geth nodes and just run the compound contracts with agents like you know using web3p guys to call the compound contracts and like simulate out these sort of like doomsday scenarios and we take consideration like the distribution of borrow um distribution of collateral distribution of line assets that currently currently exists on the protocol and basically configure a simulation that looks as much like the current state of compound as possible um and then by you know running thousands of thousands of these simulations we start to get estimates for basically hey in the case um of you know a march 12th type scenario what are the you know how many times out of 1000 does the protocol potentially um suffer an insolvency event and things like that and so um you know as i mentioned they recall like this actually these agent-based stochastic simulations these are things that you know come directly from a lot of the you know people gauntlets experience from high priestly trading where these agent-based simulations are also used to back test uh hfd strategies um and so um yeah one thing like is you know we i talk about var and i think var is something that you know i actually worked at goldman sachs in 2008 and i didn't really have the highest opinion of var considering what i worked there we got like bailed out by the government and warren buffett because of basically bar underestimating the actual value at risk and sort of more general sense in the protocol or sorry in the in the company um when you look at protocols by compound though what we do is we explicitly model these liquidation spirals as i mentioned we have liquidators and when those liquidators um sell collateral that has like fallen under the um liquidation threshold you know we're actually um you know simulating like price impact um off of uh slippage models that have been like trained against real world order book data and so this allows us to get like some pretty interesting um data around these sort of tail risk scenarios where we can kind of with a lot more confidence understand sort of these runaway risks that exist in these in these protocols and so um i think you know we're always trying to improve our models and things like that as well we're always shipping should be new updates but um that's just kind of a little bit how how we think about risk in in these protocols yeah i would definitely uh recommend for everyone to check out the ave uh gone savvy wrist dashboard it's i'm pretty hyped on it it's pretty awesome um uh i guess do you do you think of any like um one thing that i've felt you know from time to time is that um compound and ave as well they kind of have like sort of like limited tools at their disposal um i come from mainly working with maker now and they have a couple a couple features like most important is maybe um debt ceilings where we can say you know a maximum amount that we're willing to lend against a particular collateral um so you know for something like rap bitcoin we might say okay we're only willing to lend 300 million or 400 million which is like you know about five percent of our our portfolio um so then if you know bitco gets hacked or some sort of um like out of scope tail risk event happens uh and it all goes to zero we theoretically could still kind of dig ourselves out of it and compound and ave [Music] as they're as they're built right now they don't have like a direct correlation to that um so i think that's that's interesting i think there's there's um there's kind of like opportunity there for strengthening the protocol with with adding a couple more like levers for uh risk managers like gauntlet to be able to like pull on um to keep stuff in line yeah you know uh leverage an interesting are an interesting thing to bring up i think you know right now everything in compound takes seven days and i think over the past seven days um you know we've kind of realized that there are probably some things that we'd want to do quicker um and so i think like over time it's going to be important for protocols to figure out how to delegate responsibility and power to people that can use that to help drive value to the protocol i think you know one example is like maybe last week having some way for people to roll back recent changes um on a shorter timeframe than seven days would have been something really valuable i think another thing would be really valuable is giving someone control using off chain logic over things like the reserve factor and so because i actually think that if you're going to do something like set a limit to usage uh in a protocol like compound or ave you end up making it really difficult to set an interest rate curve um that you know guarantees kind of liquidity and also set rewards and comp um in a way that's going to uh you know just kind of work over the long run i think one example this is the comp market in compound um you know right now it's like completely maxed out and the comp awards in that market are actually like greater than the borrowing cost so it creates all sorts of weird issues there you know i think i would really like to do things like instead of actually just setting hard limits like i'd rather let market factors um determine the actual amount and so i think what that was what this would look like is the protocol vote on some amount of wbdtc that they were comfortable having in the protocol and basically as you approach this number the reserve factor goes up and up and up and on up so that you actually hit a market equal you manage the market to an equilibrium based off fees that would allow um the protocol to basically manage exposure without setting an artificial limit which i think is probably the best way to actually um capture value in these markets um without uh you know with without as opposed to your your options to manage risk here where you're just setting a hard limit i don't know monet you guys thought about that kind of stuff or anything like that before i think that's that's a really good point and yeah you i mean the market is your friend like you want to kind of let it set equilibriums as long as they're they're safe um i think limits can be useful because you know i think rap bitcoin is a great example where there's always that you know however small chance that uh like it just pulls them out gox or whatever and just completely rugs and then that would be a huge problem um and you know you can't say exactly how quickly you know oracles would be able to reflect the new value being lower and you might have some value that that ends up getting kind of like exfiltrated out of the protocol so i think there's some ways where like some hard limits you know maybe kind of like higher than you're likely to hit would still be useful but um but yeah i think there's probably a lot more that can be done just to like craft these marketed equilibriums into like kind of like safer safer zones well i think we're just about at time um you know i think you know some interesting uh points raised monet around you know different sort of risk protocols have to manage going forward i think smart contract risk is always one that's been top of mind since i'm like the dow hack um but uh but yeah i think like this sort of business development risk and these other market risks that we talked about um as well as you know the risk posed by centralized assets are all things that protocols like like compound and others will have to manage going forward um i think it's actually always kind of funny that uh people like i remember like people view the dao as some as some terrible failure but it's now crazy how many dows there are in the space it truly was a canary in the coal mine um but but yeah looking forward to see how these protocols continue to to deal with these risks and balance of trade-offs between between risk and growth um because i think any protocol that's too risk-averse is going to completely um uh you know limit their growth and so i think it's it's really interesting to see how particles take different approaches here and and what the market looks like on forward yep the risk of becoming irrelevant um john monet this was a great discussion thanks for uh kind of facilitating this and uh and talking about everything that's happening with risk obviously not a simple topic but uh for those of you those of uh who were interested um was kind of the best way to get involved in this discussion um for the compound ecosystem comp.xyz um anyone can post on the forums um and uh you know i think uh we're both pretty active there as well as lots of other people who've thought about this just as much as we have so uh looking forward to talking people there yep and the compound uh compound discord if you have like uh questions i think that's a that's a great place to to get them answered as well sounds perfect thank you so much and with that we are ready to move on to our next talk so next up we have tori who's going to talk about the open source interface for compound so whenever you're ready hopefully to get started and welcome uh thank you for having me um perfect so um my name is tori i'm gonna be giving a talk today um related to compounds open source interface um this is a repo that we recently uh made open source in the last let's say month um and we kind of refer to it as palestine um and so the purposes of this talk is to kind of just give a quick overview for the developers that are interested in actually you know making changes to the open source repo this is the app that's deployed at app.compound.finance so let me share my screen here cool and then to just give a little bit of a quick intro on myself so um i've been at compound since the very beginning i'm actually the first employee at the company um and right now my current focus within compound as we're leading the application development so this entails all the different compound web front-end properties including the dapp uh you know the gateway fun and the application that lives at compound.finance as well as some of the new interesting product we're building around compound treasury um so like i said the agenda uh for this one to just give a high level overview of palisades so palisade is the code name that we use for the application that's deployed at app.compound.com um it's been previously closed sourced and it's kind of one of the last remaining closed source uh you know code sources that we had for the applications we're really excited that we've actually been able to get into a state where we can open source it to the community and add you know have people in the community be able to make code changes on top of it um and also just you know watch some of the changes that are being made from our team specifically around you know new changes that are coming to the front end um and so with that i'm going to switch to my screen share and i switch to my repo here so the repo itself lives at palisade there's a link uh on my slide that kind of shows you um all the source code again uh for this project is actually was deployed to app.compound.finance and to just give you a little quick overview of the code base um you know some one of the things that developers need to figure out as they you know check out and clone the code base before they can run it is the code actually needs a little bit of configuration so out of the box you know trying to run the uh code uh won't actually work because we actually need to create a configuration file um that tells the application you know what are the different networks that are supported um what are the compound apis that provide it for things like gathering interest rate um in terms of data providers you know we need to actually query web3 uh to gather all the information to display in the dap as well as kind of displaying information related to what sort of networks are available and supported by the application now one interesting thing about the configuration file as you can see all these are each specific uh networking configs um there's no reason why we actually can't uh configure the web3 front-end uh to support other networks or ethernet networks like polygon in fact our you know we had compound ourselves i actually have a version of the application running that supports the mumbai test net so that's kind of an interesting little tidbit for developers that are interested and possibly trying to reuse parts of the uh compound palisade app to get something running on um polygon just for testing um so again the application's gonna require setup for some of the configuration um sorry quick description of uh all the different keys that are required and then i'm just going to jump into the get started to actually get the application running just do a little that live demo here so i have my terminal window here i'm not going to install the dependencies because that takes a while but we kind of have three main uh scripts that required for the application to function correctly and the way that i like to do this is open a terminal window go to my repo directory um open up three additional windows in the terminal and then just run each of these commands one at a time so yarn watch i18n this is the first one let's spell it correctly um the next one is yarn csf watch css and then the last one is yarn start right and so i'll go back and quickly explain what each of these scripts are doing here in just a second but we can see uh this is the application that we know and love is actually the application that's deployed at app.com.finance right now uh this is running locally at localhost port 3000 but it should give you the exact same application experience as if you were running it or accessing it from ipfs or app.compound.finance so that's basically how easy it is to get the application running um what i want to do now is do a quick explanation of the script calls so the first one uh watching i18 ends so the application web three front end supports different languages and um the different languages uh are specified in different strings files in the source code so if i bring the source code window up here i open the source directory there's a strings directory and you can see inside the strings directory all the different strings that are actually configured in all the different languages so this is how the compound manages uh different strings for the various pages on the app so for instance if i wanted to come into the application look up the borrow balance maybe change that for the purposes of the demo um i can do a search for borrow balance here and then maybe because i'm kind of cheeky add in a little demo you know text string here um so the watcher string actually continues watching all these files and automatically rebuilds the app so you can see uh on this borrow balance string usage hey we kind of got a demo update um the next uh command that has been run is the watch css so uh the palisade app uses css to define all the styles in the application um and there is a css directory scss directory here that has all the different styles that are being described so if i wanted to come into the application and let's say inspect this background um maybe i want to do a change of maybe this uh black background here i can go into the content i can find uh the html section tag that has class hero one of the ways that i can do this is search for the class dot hero on my sas files i found it here right now the color is dark a variable that's configured but there's no reason that i can come into the code base and kind of change it to uh maybe something that looks blue right and again because the watch css script is running or sorry this is green we can actually see that this updates on the code base directly so that's kind of cool um the next thing that i wanted to show you is uh this application is all built in a programming language called elm and we chose alan because our team at compound labs is a big fan of functional programming languages and elm is a functional pure programming language uh we found that you know the language being able to force our own developers to handle all the different edge cases for any features that we build is actually quite powerful you know typically we say internally that you know with a high confidence factor when elm compiles it kind of just works and that's kind of uh been really stellar for you know making sure a team can continue to move fast with just a couple of members on the team um so within elm you know i advise any developer that wants to uh you know for the repo and look at it go through the elm documentation to kind of see how things work under the hood um i don't have a lot of time on this one so what i want to show you next is uh sort of how we use the elm code to call into a web3 call which the web3 calls are written in javascript so in my main class i'm going to search for a method called new block um and within the you know context of the elm code base this new block command basically is invoked whenever a new block uh happens on the ethereum chain this is roughly every 13 seconds and there's a lot of information here to go through in the code base uh basically high level is for every page that exists and every different component things like transactions things like compound balances things like work prices this function basically passes off uh information to these sub modules and the sub modules themselves actually figure out what are the necessary data pieces that we need and this uh module needs customer balances it needs account limits as metadata um i can go to the definition of this account limits and there's a port uh here again on the alan system a port is a way to communicate from the elm layer onto the web3 layer um so uh if i do a search on my ports class here on the code base and do a search for this method you can see on my javascript ports class i have this function called subscribe with a data payload that exactly matches the one that i was showing you earlier in this elm class so they kind of match one to one um in this particular call we make a call to account limits and this kind of should look a little bit similar to some of the developers that are already familiar with doing web3 calls here is a specific call that calls in to a function on the compound lens contract called account limits it queries for uh account limits with the function parameters controller address and customer address and then if i pull in the compound protocol i can actually show you on the solidity layer the compound lens contract here's the function that's kind of being vote here's the struct that's been returned and i can come back to palisade and say okay as a result here is the struct for this particular call that's been made now if i want to make a change here i could come in and say you know the comptroller contract uh also has or the lens contract also has a function for something like um what let's see max assets here i'm going to do controller with max assets so this is a call like if i wanted to add in a additional um call to web3 to track information i can log this this uh new variable and i can track it here max assets and i should refresh my page again and i'm going to go into the console and then we can see oh there's 20 max assets right now that are supported on compound now the last thing that i want to show you um you know i have this app that i have you know console log a styling change um the adap palisade application also supports uh being able to deploy all of my changes to uh ipfs which is kind of the default environment that we use uh to deploy any changes from ourselves that we make as well as g clouds so the scripts in here if you follow the instructions allow you to send ipfs port a host you can add in the necessarily api keys that you need run the ipfs script and then get the version of this uh application that i have locally with the green background deploy onto ipfs and then see how that kind of works out for your specific customers either for demo purposes or uh you know if you actually want to make a change a fork and make a change to the compound protocol and actually push it live into production um that should work out just fine here i actually might be able to run this here i have a tiny bit of time remaining we'll build the css first i'll do the build of the application and the build basically is creating a directory of all these uh you know sas css files all the bills um all the javascript files all the html contained in a nice package with the idea that you would kind of push this uh directly to um you know any of your desired static page hosting website um so this is building and uh before i kind of finish out here i just wanted to make a little shout out that you know um you know my team at compound do a lot of you know watching the different uh questions that the community has and specifically for questions around the compound palisade repo i would hit up the compound discord chat that's kind of the best uh resource for developers if they want to um you know get questions talk to some of us directly uh you know ask any questions that you have about how the repo is structured and just generally get help for any ideas or projects and questions that you have that you want to work on so i'm going to deploy this it should be able to deploy here really quickly well so this actually deployed my local changes to ipfs i'm going to grab one of these links open it up in my browser and if everything so oh i missed a number if everything worked out good i should see a nice compound application with sort of a green background let's see if it looks the first time you deployed ipfs it's a little slow but there we go we have a version that exists on compound that contains the code changes that i just made green background and all um that's about all the time that i have to describe again went through a lot of information really fast so you play quite have questions please don't hesitate to reach out into the discord but um thank you all for letting me have this presentation with you this morning thank you so much tori i was gonna i was worried about murphy's law kicking in but then i realized you guys are zoned so there you go when it compiles it kind of just works awesome one one question before we move on to our next talk uh what is kind of the process from people wanting to contribute to this repo obviously this is the production compound app so can anybody contribute what are the big records is how do you think about that and how do you welcome community edits yeah actually yeah it's a great question so um in the compound repo there is a specific readme for the contributing for developers that want to contribute um you know the easiest answer is to just fork the repo get familiar with making changes to it after you forward the repo you can create a pull request back to the the main palisade repo and then um you know our team will go through it and review it and make sure the changes seem to be okay and safe and valid and then any pr request that is merging into the mainline repo that automatically gets deployed to ipfs and then um if that change kind of looks good on the ipf's ipfs slide you know our team at compound labs at least for right now can go ahead and make that accessible at app.compound.finance so again i would take a read into the contributing guide to go get all the steps to figure out how to create the pull requests you know how to create issues on the pr and how to kind of get help and feedback on any changes that you want to make awesome well hope that was helpful for everybody too this was an amazing demo and thanks for talking about how everything is architected thank you all right with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and our next speaker is jared and jerry's going to be talking about gateway so i'm super excited about this thing but i'll let him uh tell us everything about gateway welcome thank you uh thanks for having me um let me just share my screen here let me know you can see it hopefully you can see it um but yeah yeah hi everyone thank you thank you for having me um it's great to be here my name is jared um and uh just a little bit about myself so i've been at compound for um about two and a half years uh pretty much joined starting work uh designing and working on the v2 protocol um which is you know we now know as the compound protocol um and uh today i i want to talk about gateway um so gateway is is um compounds blockchain project that we started last year and yeah just um hoping to sort of explain what it is um why why we're building it um and give you a little bit um deeper understanding maybe how it works and sort of what like the current statuses and things like that so yeah jumping jumping right in um i guess the uh you know why are we building gateway what's what's the motivation for gateway um in my mind there's there's always been uh like two two kind of a confluence of two reasons that um which are building gateway um one is the is sort of like the v3 version of the compound protocol and um you know going back a little bit to sort of last um last summer um at the end of last summer so uh at the beginning last summer we started we began distributing our governance token on ethereum and um we experienced like the the summer of defy and and what that explosion was like and um there was you know a real feeling of uh product market fit um the protocol went from like growing um sort of 10x per year to growing 100x per year um so like basically from like moving from like 20 million in assets to 200 million assets in uh year one of its life the protocol and then like from like 200 to 20 billion um sort of beginning with last summer um and um i think what became uh pretty clear at least but you know if it wasn't already clear was that um ethereum was kind of like unusable for for the average person at that time like gas costs were getting extremely volatile um and mostly just expensive um and still are the network was congested um and we had started to think about like scaling how to scale compound beyond the boundaries of three minutes or um reach um uh like like you know a broader set of of users um and so that you know part of part of gateway is certainly thinking about how to how to scale uh compound and not like be constrained by the underlying network um at that time we sort of took a look around at the next generation of blockchains l1 zl2s um side chains roll ups all things and like what became clear and it you know was that it it was still going to take some time to see how how things would actually play out um but we knew that we wanted to build a v3 that sort of would work for for users no matter like which which um technologies that they were experimenting with um and we sort of concluded that having uh having a chain would uh would like ultimately let the compound governance have like more control over the economics of the protocol and also um would be a way to keep fees slow in in the long term and um the promise of there was this promise of um polka dot which was that uh with substrate you could build a chain uh which was targeted to either run as like a standalone chain or um or as a para chain um and the idea with this constrained power chain is that yeah it's more constrained but um you don't have to worry about the security of the validator you're sharing the securities with the other pair of chain you're sharing the security of the relay chain with the other pair of chain and um and the validators and the consensus layer are shared and so um you really need to only worry about the availability of being able to process transactions and not um and having you know servers available to process transactions and not whether um they're executing things faithfully or reliably um the problem is that like yeah i mean i guess polka dot was kind of has still yet to launch fair chains on on mainnet and like this whole time uh we've been working on gateway uh it is you know has been an active development itself um but uh you know we we also you know the idea was to sort of take the lessons from the past two and a half years um get rid of the constraint um coming from the underlying network and um builds build a protocol that was sort of streamlined and to focus on on like our specific uh application uh or what we consider it to be um and yeah i guess for continuing on that like the other part of of why we're building gateway is um you know in my mind is this cash token um which i think these these adjectives um they're pretty uh descriptive so just unpack them so portable um you know it's it's it's it exists on many different chains um and can be transferred between them um it's it's a little bit special as far as assets on on gateway is concerned i'll talk a little bit more about that later um but i know one one way which is special is it's interest bearing um and it's also a unit of account and so um you know they combine these things the v3 protocol um it's cash token um you know we so the hope was is really was really to just focus on um building out uh certain application uh layer and and leverage a blockchain framework um to help us deliver that um you know in reality i think we spend a lot of time dealing with um idiosyncrasies of the framework that we're using and um sort of re-are protecting things a bit but uh you know uh this is kind of the original thinking behind behind things um and yeah i guess moving ahead um get back into some of that discussion later but so the how so what does the architecture for gateway actually look like um you know starting with maybe like more of like an end user point of view like the the um so the vision for for gabe is you know actually pretty fairly simple um uh in this simple diagram you have you can see like the stars on these um representations of like connected chains to gateway so you have a chain for gateway and then they have like other chains which are connected through their star ports so in this example like ethereum and tezos um and the idea is that the star ports are the main point of contact between gateway and these other chains there's there's something like a smart contract um on on each chain and um whatever the analogous concept is of a smart contract on that chain and um and gateway has like a superset of all the addresses which exist on all the connected chains um and so you could like you could transfer between um an ethereum user and a tezos user by um maybe for example you could you could upload each on ethereum c lock ethereum that emits an event and becomes part of uh gateway and now that the user on ethereum can borrow um well they could they could send the e to the uh to the test address but then they wouldn't be able to extract eth um to a tesla's address because the eth asset itself wouldn't exist on on tezos and we don't have any kind of um wrapping of assets at this time so um you know the easiest thing to do is it's like you can borrow cash against um against the the east on um on tezo so the from the user point of view all they have to do is um like lock the eve and then they can they can transfer cash um which automatically borrows against uh their ease which i'll talk a little bit more about in a second too but um you know from the tezos point of view um you basically talk to uh gateway and say i want to extract this cache that that i've received and um you get a notice that you take to test that lets you actually um pull the cash out of the starboard on the test side um and you know there's i guess there's from like the architecture point of view there's maybe a few things um to note here uh so first of all there's like there's only a few there's a few protocol actions um it's pretty small surface area as far as the protocol is concerned um what's not shown here maybe is like there's also a mechanism to um synchronize the so because this cash token exists on on these different chains and because it's interest bearing there's um there's an interest rate and there is a mechanism to synchronize the the rates between the chains but um you know overall pretty pretty simple um mechanisms and then like once assets are inside gateway or upgraded to the start boards um you know it becomes a lot like a typical smart contract on another chain um where you're thinking a lot easier you're working with with assets that are all in one place um you know maybe the the harder part no not shown here is um like how we ingest this data and emit these notices get a little bit more into that as well um yeah so like talking a little bit about what the surface area of the protocol um looks like so i mentioned there's only a few functions there's uh the functions which exist are basically lock um so upload lock which is basically lock transfer um extract just basically download and uh and liquidate um you know if you're familiar with the v2 protocol these are very similar what you'll notice though is that there's no barring uh barring and repaying or supplying and withdrawing um barring is actually now a state and not an action and and this is because of um another improvement um we made which is to instead of having two signed balances there are two unsigned balances which are the supply and borrow for a user like in the vp protocol um we don't even have the ability to represent um sort of undesirable states anymore uh where you're you're borrowing the same asset and resupplying it um which is never really something that people do but doesn't necessarily make sense for the protocol so um basically make that that state those states now unrepresentable and borrowing becomes um a state where you have a negative balance instead of being a separate action with a separate balance associated with it and um yeah i mean it's kind of cool because you can you can do things just like upload each and then um and then transfer and you're and when you try to transfer your your balance so you can upload ether and then transfer cash like in the previous example and if your cash balance happens to go negative um that's fine as long as you have enough collateral to cover it it's just automatically borrowing cash from the protocol and uh by the way cash is created by varying from the protocol um i guess the the other things to note here are that um there's we also as compared to the v2 protocol um sort of upgraded the the risk engine um in the v2 protocol there's collateral factors which apply to like one side of a balanced equation on the collateral side we're currently using now factors on both sides so adjusting borrow balances by by these uh calling volatility factors now um and then using them on both sides but uh it's it's something to help with the the ideas to help with the capital efficiency of of the system uh and and um representing the risks more um in a little bit finer grained way um but yeah i mean i guess the larger idea is with the gateways also to be able to do things like upgrade the risk engine now completely um and do more sophisticated things that we weren't necessarily able to do inside the comptroller contract on ethereum um but yeah i guess the last thing to notice is that there's like a change to liquidation as compared to the v2 protocol um so in the v2 protocol liquidators always repay debt and then they basically repay borrow and then sees some collateral in in gateway liquidators can basically transfer debt so they can assume the debt of the borrower without having to necessarily repay it and um this is kind of an improvement and and we introduced it because um gateway is a separate chain now and having to repay or supply an asset before liquidating would be an extra step and um in general we've always tried to to keep the liquidation system in compound um you know with pretty like quick turnaround we think that um speed is sort of a big advantage when it comes to liquidations and so uh removing the requirement to upload collateral first in order to be able to to um to liquidate somebody sort of opens up the set of possible liquidators can that can that can form the liquidation um and doesn't really hurt the protocol so um it's kind of a nice feature i think of gateway that we change liquidations in this way um talking about cash a little bit more so um i mentioned that it was portable and interest bearing um portability as i said it comes from the fact that it it um it really exists on every on every chain that gateway is connected to um it is it is interest bearing so um all cash in gateway oh sorry all interest in in gateway is um is paid in cash or is earned in cash um and actually it's done uh getting a little into the weeds but unlike v2 it's cash is sort of accumulated linearly by the markets in in asset markets and then um for all compounding kind of happens in cash itself um also compounding now happens over time instead of uh over blocks which is a slight difference from from v2 but it kind of um it's uh you know just to think about what you what that means a little bit um uh it's kind of nice for something like an nft market or something where you can't necessarily pay interest in the underlying um because you can't uh you know maybe there's only one of you know one one token which constitutes the underlying um so you always have an asset which you can pay and earn uh interested it's just a little about cash and then um starting to get into more of uh zooming in on the architecture and and some of the different components in the system um and how how they start to fit together and we'll sort of zoom in on on how these fit together more as we go here but um from the from the high level 10 000 feet um there's like there's really just a few entities so maybe like three layers and like four entities um like the runtime layer which is uh sort of the state of gateway which is is basically the yeah the state of the uh of the chain and it's the um it's what gets executed on in substrate uh which is the the framework we're using um for building the blockchain um it's so it's really the authoritative state of the chain and then we have the um the oracle layer which um you can think is composed of these both these oracles and archivists which the archivists just make uh are it's like archivists as an untrusted role which um which the oracles are starting with the oracles the oracles are really the trusted role they have keys which um which in aggregate uh can be used to sign sign data going either to the runtime or to the star ports um so either events coming from the star ports to the runtime they can sign the block metadata and the events and those are persisted by the archivist and made available to the runtime and vice versa for assigning notices coming from the runtime which are then posted to the star ports um so like very high level um view of what the information flow in between between these high-level components and gateway looks like um zooming in a little bit you start to see like more exactly what the interfaces between um between some of these components are um i think uh you know this is actually a pretty fairly precise um diagram so you um you get a pretty good idea of really how how information moves moves in gateway looking at it but um you know so there are runtimes has all size things like prices and it can accept requests coming from end users um and the oracle's fetch notices from the runtime by a number um and uh yeah i mean there's there's a lot more details to get into here but um essentially this is this is the things that can be done in gateway um and then zooming in even more um to sort of like the the exact um or like the the implementation in substrate so um substrate is organized around these modules called pallets um pallets are sort of individual unit um modules within a within a substrate blockchain which can have associated state and events and and errors uh and extrinsics which they call them which are basically functions you can call and the first so the the what this is the first column is showing like which functions are in which palette um and so there's a go palette which has um like a pseudo function which which um people can propose and vote um to call other functions in the chain basically through the gov palette um then most most of the functionalities in the cache palette actually in the first version of gateway all functionality was in the cache palette and then um over the summer we um started to re-architect things um you know mainly to separate the to deal with some of the security concerns we had and separating the functionality of the oracles and really isolating them and um and also being able to to um more well defined these boundaries between pieces of the system um so we had you know i was just saying we had everything in the cash pellet and uh things were pretty tightly coupled and it was it was getting already pretty hard to make changes so um one of the another goal besides the security of separating oracles of the refactoring was to um just make the dependency graph clear and not have things depending back into substrate um and and um yeah have these defining boundaries between things um but i think what you also you can see from from this diagram is well what what you can do in cache um so it has the ability to ingest blocks and execute requests coming from the users the users can do things like extract liquidate and transfer um to get a sense of what the notices are uh the extract notices are what's brought to the star port in order to actually extract assets from from gateway um we have to support uh the ability to change supply caps on the starboard so um because gateway has supply caps um which are implemented both at the start port and in the gateway runtime um and then change future yield as part of the interest rate um sinking mechanism i was talking about also the ability to change oracles the set of oracles happened through the runtime um and and then finally the ability to will add and upgrade a star port so there's a function to add a star forward and then there's also uh a notice to support upgrading them once they're added and then finally i guess we have the uh there's another palette which is the the prices palette which supports uh posting prices uh using uh the open oracle format that um compound had previously defined which the v2 protocol was previously using but um not exactly using anymore um so yeah hopefully that gives you a better idea of um maybe the implementation of things there's obviously a lot more that can be said about that too um but it's moving moving ahead quickly um you know i think so like the road map and as far as the timeline are concerned so um you know obviously the gateway is an ambitious and challenging project um you know we knew that we knew that much coming into it um i think we we still believe it's uh like what we believe in the future of d5 for sure and like i think you know most of the innovation that um is going to happen in this space is still yet to come um and you know the goal is really to build a robust platform like a a long-term foundation um that's like economically reliable and which compound and governance the community can build upon um as like uh you know a real engine of like growth for um for innovation to happen on and so um what i can't say about the roadmap is is like we're basically you know safety first we're not rushing qa process we've already um you know as i'm saying over the summer when took a few steps back to re-architect um some things and you know get get more comfortable with with the security profile um and we'll continue doing that obviously i think the the products and the features are quite well defined but you know we're in this process now of um implementing things really carefully and um you know i'm not prepared to to put a date on when we'll be done with that process but um you know we'll continue making steady progress on it um i guess the other thing to mention is that uh you know gateway's not the only thing that we're working on at compound so we do have a lot of other exciting projects um you know i guess it's a good problem to have but um unfortunately you know many things some of those projects are growing more rapidly than we um anticipated and um you know we're still a small team so um if if gateway is interesting to you or other things that compound works on it are interesting to you um especially you know we're hiring um we're hiring engineers um we're also hiring in other parts of the company um so you know please please get in touch if you're interested in learning more about that um and yeah i guess the other the other thing to me mention and keep in mind about the roadmap is is uh you know hopsider's law has um certainly come into play and um probably continue to come into play and i guess if you're not familiar with with that it's um you know basically the recursive law that says that things always take longer than you think they're going to take especially when you take into account hofstadter's law um yeah i guess uh you know finally i'm sure i think a lot of information moved pretty quickly um if you have any questions about gateway or about anything else related to compound you can always um find me and others in the discord and also on the forum on compete.xyz um are also um i'm on twitter if um if you know anything that can be helpful for anything feel free to to reach out um but yeah happy to answer any any questions i think we're about out of time so i'll wrap up here thanks everyone thank you so much jared and that was a really good and uh deep overview of how everything is structured and is working on gateway um we are out of time but i lost one question just before we move on to our last talk um how does composability work in this world and um what does that look like and how should people think about that yeah great question um i think i mean a lot of it is still unknown like a lot of it is remains to be to be seen but um you know one of the ideas with cash token as well was to be um for that to be one of the composable pieces um and you know you can think about cache token is like maybe the um the tip of of v3 um and it's like cache token itself can be like embedded inside is a part of v3 but it can be embedded for instance inside inside of like v2 um as like a c token or you know there could be a market um so there's lots of interesting things you can do with the cache token there is the ability also to initiate trx that we call trx requests which are sort of the requests that users can initiate they can send them either directly to gateway or they can submit them through the star port um and have them you know bit through a contract or something and have them um executed on gateway chain um so we think there's there's a lot of interesting things to do there you know unlike the v2 protocol and everything happening on ethereum it is a little bit trickier right like some certain things are asynchronous um and yeah so it's not totally clear how how um how it might affect like certain design patterns uh for composability that exists um today but um you know we've tried to to create um opportunities for for composability absolutely i think uh it's a it's a very giant experiment and just to some sense because you have to sort of test it out and see how to evolve so it's very exciting um everybody who found this interesting obviously you can check out the links uh jared posted on how to see more about what's happening with gateway and thanks again for the presentation thanks carter great to be here um look forward to the rest of the conference sounds perfect so with that we are ready for our last uh talk of today and i'm super excited to welcome robert lesner co-founder founder and ceo of compound um we we're going to do an ama segment here and uh we sourced a lot of questions from the broader youth global and compound ecosystem so i'll just go rapid fire into this and hopefully we have enough to talk about for 30 to 40 minutes uh if not we'll talk about whatever ever wants to talk about so um let's start with something easy robert i've known you for a few years we've seen so much happen in d5 uh my first question is three years ago when you originally thought compound would be and what it is now is that exactly what you thought in a good way what is like the expectation versus reality because you do sort of a comparison and contrast how that world was then and now yeah so first off i'm excited to be here speaking with you all today um three years ago when we launched compound it was you know august 2018 i think is when the first version of compound was launched it was after a year of building um in solitude you know in the upstairs attic above an advertising agency and we didn't know what to expect um there was very few things that looked or worked like d5 applications at this time um the phrase defy would sort of like be invented like around the same time that compound launched you know not by compound but by other folks in the community it was a very early time and what we were telling ourselves at the time was that it would take potentially five to ten years before there would be any meaningful traction in d5 um you know at the time there were some very early experiments in dexes um you know from you know token trader to etherdelta to xerox you know later to uniswap um but at the time there was like these very primitive examples of people trying to use smart contracts to create you know financial tools that sort of just ran on their own right and so our our genuine expectation was it was gonna be five to ten years one because you know it would take five to ten years for assets from the real world to start to come into crypto besides just like crypto natively issued tokens we thought that you know the user experience was you know extremely clunky and version one of compound was so hilariously clunky and we just thought it would take forever um and i think things evolved a lot faster than we expected um the white paper for compound at the time was like you know here's this system and eventually you know and then eventually to us actually we thought it was five ten years eventually it will be run by a dow because even then you know the term for anything like you know smart contract managed was down right we said eventually this would be run by a dow you know we thought it was gonna be yours the pace at which things unfolded was actually much faster than i or anybody in the community or anybody outside of crypto or really anyone inside of crypto and that includes like the most passionate believers it all occurred faster than anyone would have anticipated um you know by the end of 2018 compound had like 20 million dollars of assets in it you know it was like number two behind maker dow which i think there was like 50 million dollars of assets maker now at the time i mean you know 2019 i think was actually a really big year for d5 because really of the growth and you know adoption of stable coins you know stable points really weren't that popular in 2018 there were some very early examples of them but 2019 saw you know tether on ethereum and sauce um usd coin and saw the growth of dye i mean it was so called psy at the time you know um and you know all of these stable points and this was like the sort of missing ingredient that turbocharged defy in my mind um suddenly you know applications like compounds start to make a lot of sense to people you know no one really wanted to borrow ether they really wanted to borrow stable cards you know people didn't necessarily want to trade an arbitrary token they wanted to trade you know a stable coin for crypto or trade a crypto for stable points it just enabled the whole ecosystem to grow rapidly and so everything started moving at a speed faster than we anticipated um and that actually encouraged us to take what we thought was going to be a five-year journey and condense its time frame and move the governance of compound to adao or the community um and decentralize the protocol and i actually think you know the thing that um eclipsed our thinking was you know how fast we would be able to hand over controls um a lot of the steps that went into this process compound created or designed um you know and are now becoming like the staples of you know d5 but like you know having a time lock contract you know we wrote a time lock that's now like you know used in hundreds of projects you know we wrote a governance system and you know voting token um which are used in hundreds of projects and you know all these things we have to discover for ourselves and just continuously try to you know um not just innovate on the core protocol but the tools by which you know the community could use to run the protocol and so you know i didn't think by this point we would have a decentralized protocol when we launched compound was running on admin keys and now it's pretty much anything but it's a community-run decentralized protocol and it happened a lot faster than i would have guessed oh this is incredible um unknowingly you've set the stage for all the other questions i had because you touched on every single topic i have a big question on so we'll go deeper into everything so uh now this is definitely this incredible i think uh it still blows my mind that i remember uh last february or actually uh yeah early february i was like wait d5 just crossed a billion in tvl and that feels like forever but it was not even 18 months ago and yeah the space moves so fast uh and uh just we couldn't imagine what maker crossed a hundred million in its deposits and uh it's still a lot two years ago i think but uh it's great uh you kind of already kind of set the stage here so uh i think one of the super interesting things here is that you essentially wore one of the super um cutting edge but also high profile projects to introduce things like liquidity mining and governance and just all these growth tactics um and uh in my opinion it's a little bit challenging because you are the first ones to do this thing and find out if it's working or not so you're just in a super interesting position which uh is good and bad at the same time but um kind of knowing everything now in hindsight um anywhere from the things we've invented to learnings from trying all those things out in iterations um if you were to launch compound um again now um what would you do something differently i would do a lot differently um and you know a lot of things that we did at the time were being done for the first time we had to make some educated guesses and even in the educated guesses um you know it was impossible to predict whether we were gonna be right wrong too conservative too aggressive or what um you know the idea of you know handing over the protocol to the community without like a gatekeeper was considered like an absolutely radical idea um at the time there was a few other examples of decentralized governance but they were very early so uh maker now was a good example um but people thought it was crazy that you know there wasn't gonna be a foundation you know directly managing a protocol um you know a lot of the investors in compound labs thought it was crazy that we would give away half the tokens um up until this point there was really no project that was right giving away tokens at all they were selling tokens right um and you know everyone thought that 50 of the tokens being given away was like an insane thing um and you know the mechanics by which we like you know decided to actually roll out governance was also extremely experimental people forget but compound governance and the voting contracts and the voting system was actually tested live for three months with like a limited token holder group before being rolled out to the entire community um which is something that i actually haven't seen since people go from zero to like you know full on chain governance you know sometimes oftentimes the intermediate steps are like their snapshots or there's you know a team that's vaguely in control and enforcing the community as well but you know we basically went from you know centralized to decentralized but the intermediate step was not like some intermediate governance solution it was just allowing a limited stakeholder group to use the full you know blockchain tools happy staging environment exactly um and you know if we could do it all differently you know there's a couple things that have emerged as like standards in the communities not just of compound but in crypto and d5 generally though i think we would have like adopted but they just didn't really exist yet so one is you know i would say um you know distributing tokens to um historical users you know when we started distributing tokens to users it was to all present and future users it wasn't historical looking i actually think the way uniswap handled it was phenomenal it's probably too late to go back and revise this but you know if i could go back to the beginning of 2020 we would have changed how we allocated tokens between you know future users and present users and historical users um that's the first thing i think would have changed the second is that i think there should you know if i could do it all over again i think there should have been you know generally more for developers um it's you know very easy to focus on users but i actually think the most important part of the protocol in a lot of ways are developers and i think that like you know coming up with some method of allocating tokens specifically for projects built on top of compound or developers building on top of a compound would have been really valuable um it's also you know hard to go back and change that but i actually think the community can potentially start to like recalibrate and focus more on you know the developer side of things as opposed to just raw users of the protocol itself once from like uh like are you sort of differentiating uh another category between uh like a grant program equivalent or kind of what do you mean by that yeah and it's a great question i think the way it gets developed and expresses itself you know now is something like a grants program right where you can allocate to developers um but i also think in terms of you know allocating you know tokens and governance rights to just applications um i think it'd be more interesting you know to look at not just how do you distribute governance to you know stakeholders that are building but also applications built on top of the protocol um you know at the end of the day you know what we wanted and didn't see play out as closely as you know i would have hoped would have been you know tokens going to like custodians and like things like that that are directly integrating the protocol um you know if i could revise it i think we would have changed you know the actual logic a little bit but you know building a system for the first time is incredibly difficult and it's hard to plan for all these outcomes um and i think what we also could have done is you know if i could go back in time it would have been you know setting up things like you know a grant committee sooner as opposed to letting it sort of like slowly develop over time um you know again when we created you know comp and when we distributed it to users these weren't really concepts yet um but now these are concepts you know so if i could go back in time you know to the day that comp was released i think we would have you know had in place you know some allocation of tokens overseen by the community not through the protocol and the user you know usage of it but like to be distributed by users to other builders to other participants to other stakeholders absolutely i think if i'm parsing this right like i think a lot of this is about tightening the feedback loops um the way i see it because you get to understand and iterate much faster um and i think that's an excellent sort of framing um as well on something you just mentioned obviously being the first one to try things out is is challenging but um what did you kind of think would happen for liquidity mining when you introduced it and and anyone from concerns to what you would change now specifically around that yeah it's funny because at the time you know it wasn't really called liquidity mining and internally like we didn't think of it like i was like liquidity mining we just thought of it as hey this is like the coolest thing we can do to like bring users into the fold right and we thought the product is great what if we make it even greater by like you know giving comp to all the users like people love compound today they'll extra love compound you know if we just give them the tokens um we didn't really know what was gonna happen there was a couple other you know similar approaches um that other you know ecosystem participants have done in the past i thought you know as we were designing it we'd been able to observe synthetics and some of the approaches they were taking so you know people say compound invented liquidity mining i don't really agree um but i do think you know we came up with a way of distributing liquid tokens to users for using the protocol directly as opposed to incentivizing some liquidity pool right or like some you know unison pool or whatever right um we also saw exchanges that have been doing there was a long time ago there was a concept called trans fee mining that was like popular for like three months before like the exchanges that like pioneered it like imploded horribly but like you know what they did is they would give tokens to users based on how much trading volume they had and this was actually bad because it led to a lot of like wash trading and like just like useless activity and what we wanted to avoid was people like you know entering into useless activity we tried to design a system that would just reward users not like arbitrary things and it was hard to get it exactly right i think you know if anyone on this call remembers the first couple weeks of the comp distribution the first couple weeks were chaotic because it was like first of its kind changes to it had to go through governance which was like a little bit slow and the incentives were crazy so like certain markets wound up being like hilariously used when like they didn't serve as much of like a legitimate underlying economic purpose as people expected like the bat market if anyone remembers it was like you number one market on compound and everybody like on the internet and twitter was like why is that so large and it's just because the algorithm that was used you know just led in this like unexpected consequence to like back being the number one market on compound people are scrambling to like find that take it off exchanges move it into compound it was like such a bizarre situation yeah i remember all those things yep it was chaotic um one last kind of question on this um you sort of mentioned that a lot of people started using a lot of things that you came up with as part of the launch and anywhere from contracts on how to manage governance to just liquidity mining stuff um was it sort of uh did you take that as like a super good thing when everybody started using it you have hundreds of projects or was that worrying how do you connect yeah i think it is a super good thing um you know like one of the best virtues of you know ethereum and d5 on ethereum and this applies to other blockchains as well but one of the strongest virtues i find is that you know every project increases the network effect of the entire ecosystem and you know if compound can build a contract that other people can use great right if projects don't have to reinvent the wheel and they can use like the compound time lock code or like the comp token code or the comp governance system code great it means there's more things happening on ethereum for everybody and everyone's going to benefit from it whether it's compound directly or compound indirectly like the more people that are able to ship things faster you know it just benefits the entire ecosystem um when we started there was almost no code that we could use off the shelf right um there was almost nothing that we could like refer to in terms of like how to like build out an application like compact we had to like truly discover and innovate a lot of the most basic you know concepts like compound pioneer appear to like pool liquidity like this didn't like really exist unchanged yeah and like how to like compute interest rates for an infinite quantity of users with one computation instead of iterating over a list of them like like very basic things we had to like discover for ourselves and now like if we wanted the right compound or we wanted to like make a new version like it wouldn't take the year that it took the first time right it's not that like we got smarter you know it's that there's more things available now like you don't have to like roll your own everything you can like focus on building a core application and like you know use certain contracts off the shelf or in lightly modified ways and so the fact that like people don't have to build out their own governance tools i think is unbelievably valuable for everyone because you get like a more decentralized ecosystem the fact that people don't have to like you know do the r d to like discover basic concepts and just copy pieces from compound is great right so i think in a lot of ways you know whether it's noticed or unnoticed the more people that are using you know pieces of the compound ecosystem you know it's like you know a silent victory um and i think the people that do notice you know it's even better would you then say that it's uh usually not a good thing to be a first mover in this space because you have to figure a lot of this out or uh it's definitely harder to be a first mover um and what's really funny is when we were designing the compound governance system like the way that token works the way you can delegate votes the way you actually vote on proposals like the way the system like mechanically operates when we were designing it we always say like we have a second mover advantage um because like discovering it for the first time would be like so hard we got to like look at maker now we got to look at like you know like other things that have been built we had you know we had an opportunity to look at like tezos the blockchain and how they were doing like governance of their blockchain like we had a second mover advantage and i think it allowed us to spend less time building a better system um if we had to discover all the stuff for the first time and we had nothing to compare it to it would have been really really really hard and so like i gave a lot of kudos to the teams that had to be the first mover on even designing governance absolutely um you let's see so i think a lot of projects right now are very focused on getting more people involved as they think about anywhere from increasing their users to their community how did you initially bootstrap the compound ecosystem in the community and what advice would you give right now to projects that are trying to spar a community yeah so i think there's things that we did well i think there's things we didn't do phenomenally well um you know i think the first thing that's actually important is the ability to delegate votes um was built natively into the comp token and the governance system i actually think this is really important because sometimes the most active participants and the loudest voices aren't the wealthiest users right and like what you want is a system where just anyone who's like active and wants to contribute has the opportunity to have like a loud say in the direction of the protocol even if they're like new or young or entering crypto for the first time right like it leads to more of a meritocracy so i think you know the way we built the comp token and the delegation system was actually like a really strong tool um to get like a couple of really active participants involved in the community um the things that we didn't do well is it's now been like over a year um a little more than a year since comp was released and like i feel like it's taken a long time for the community to start to organize around having a grants committee having a process to like directly reward contributors like we weren't able to foresee the importance of that and you know it led to there being like a delay before i think a lot of people could like start to get involved and compound governance is starting to like very rapidly evolve and flourish and i think we're starting to see more and more participants coming in and you know i think that you know one of the things that we could have done better originally and i think that other projects can learn from this just having like a solid you know foundation to be able to talk to contributors reward them make them a part of the process and it didn't start off with that gotcha yeah and i think the second falls into the first one to figure this out so others then can copy and be like oh we should change this thing um when we do it ourselves um changing gears a little bit last week uh an exploit was discovered on compound um could you tell us kind of what happened and sort of how do you kind of think about making sure that this doesn't happen again yeah so this goes to what i think is like truly the biggest opportunity of an open and decentralized protocol and also the biggest risk but like i'd like to start with the biggest opportunity so the biggest opportunity is that anyone can become a core contributor to the compound protocol um you know there's no obstacles there's no roadblocks anyone listening right now can become a core contributor um you don't have to be a member of compound labs and it's an open development process with you know a group of community members that's excited to welcome new developers into the process um and it means that people can work on code at the heart of compound um you know and so you know there was a bug that came from an amazing you know contribution from a great contributor who was looking to upgrade one of the features of compounds this upgrade was reviewed by lots of the community members it was reviewed by members of compound labs it was like what i actually think of as one of like the most virtuous benefits of decentralization is that you could have a community member being a core contributor um adding and improving like core functionality of the protocol making it better um the biggest risk is that there is a book right and in proposal 62 there was a book it happened right um luckily there was no user funds that were lost what was lost was comp that was reserved for future users so in a lot of ways it was like a bank error in the favor of in some cases like very randomly selected addresses and you know it was the first time that there was really like a smart contract bug that led to a loss of funds in compound history um and this is a massive disappointment now you know this one proposal proposal 62 shows the opportunity and it shows the risk of distributed governance and distributed development and it shows how distributed development is different than centralized development where there's like one core team that like writes all the code and then people can vote on it like compound goes all the way and it's decentralized development um and so there's nothing better than prop 62 to sort of like embody this i think it's going to be a catalyst for change within the community and within the decentralized development process because i think it's going to lead to a little bit more conservatism in a good way where there's going to be you know more participants more review you know more analysis and it's going to lead to a much stronger decentralized development process but compounds also one of the first projects that like really you know develops in this fashion um most projects even when they have decentralized voting control they have centralized development um you know there's obviously some incredible examples to learn from like bitcoin you know is you know an open like uh development process like anyone can become a contributor to it right and i think compound is headed in that way you're going to have an open source code developed by a community not you know a permission team right right and that's the direction it's heading and i actually think that 62 is an amazing wake-up call because it was a disaster i mean frankly like it's a disaster right it led to a loss so far of you know about 220 000 comp is missing right um but it didn't lose user funds and no one in the community is going to forget this it's going to change the way that development occurs it's going to i think clarify the minds of all of the contributors and i think long term it's going to lead to a lot of improvements in the protocol you know there were bugs in bitcoin right that's a fact right this was a bug and compound but you know if the community handles it correctly it'll be the last bug compound no that's a very optimistic and a good note um as a summary i think this is super interesting what um um i think it's on the same theme you are the ceo of compound labs but a minority token holder of the compound protocol um how do you kind of see your your role in this ecosystem and for the protocol and sort of what do you think that looks like compared to what the community expects of you as well yeah this is a really interesting question because you know i think there's more of a desire to have a figurehead than there is um then there should be right like i'm not actually special like pretty much anyone listening to this call could play almost as large of a role in the compound protocol that i play um you know what i have is years of you know experience and you know a history with the protocol and a passion for it but you know i think in order for a protocol like compound to succeed like it has to be taken up by the community they have to take it over like satoshi's not here to guide bitcoin right i think bitcoin is stronger because of it right if you had you know a single figurehead that was like in charge i think you get a worse outcome and so you know i think you know i'm trying to make my role more and more of like a cheerleader and somebody who knows how the system works but someone who like very genuinely wants the community to take over as much as possible yeah and uh i don't mean this in any negative or bad way but it's just interesting to see when um sometimes the crowd goes against what you're interested in if you're voting on something and like that in a way is a true way of uh showcasing that this is working as expected yeah i've lost a couple votes like in confident governance history and that's great you know it's a great sign moving on to sort of um looking at the growth of the ecosystem if if you were a developer and if somebody comes to you says i want to contribute to the compound protocol um i guess what do you think is important over the next couple of years for the way you think the community or the future should go it's a great question so there's really like four buckets of work that are needed uh in my mind so one is you know building out the core protocol itself adding features right adding like new code adding modifications we're starting to see a community you know set of developers really start to like gain this as a skill set um you know like a year ago there was one or two developers that were like contributing to the core code we're getting more and more contributors to the forklift um and that's really exciting and i think like we're starting to build a muscle as a community of like core contributors the second are applications built on top of the protocol right you know there's huge opportunities for better interfaces for taking the open source front end forking it improving it adding new features right that i think are like underrepresented um one of the things we did a couple weeks ago was open source and license the front end to the community and say like hey like take this like go run it like there's a one-click deploy process ipfs like you know if you want to make a better version of this like it should be what everyone uses right um and i think like you know the experimentation around the front end is like a little bit low but i think there's really cool opportunities there like someone could build a front end that integrates compound and uniswap and does even cooler things with both of them or like there's a lot of opportunity to make the core interface even better and i think it's a little bit underserved should that come from like uh people's own creativity or do you think there's like a handful of things that you would like to see and you want to kind of incentivize that or broadcast that and until people do it yeah i mean i think you know the creativity is the limit like i'm not able to think of all like things that you know a front end should be but like i could see someone building a system that like you know you can opt in to like sharing your email and like it sends you alerts when they're like you know borrowing capacity is getting too dangerous and like you know it could be more useful you can see a version that like doesn't have that but focuses more on like dex integrations as well like there's a lot there that i think is possible um and so you know i think front ends are like a really under developed corner of this because like there doesn't have to be one front end right someone could you know you know fix some bugs like treasure and ledger are always having issues that's hardware wallets you know using the interface like there's so much to do um that can be improved upon just the second the third is that i actually think there's a big opportunity in the community to spend more time um thinking about the sort of parameters of the protocol right not like what is the code and how does it work but like you know what should the liquidation variables be what should the collateral variables be right why right you know gauntlet has recently come in and started spending more time on this but like there's big opportunities to think through the interest rate models and like the economic efficiency of these markets things that are still run by humans but that are like always looking for active contributors and thinkers so if you're someone who's not technically inclined but you are you know economically or mathematically inclined i think there's huge opportunities to like focus on the parameters of the protocol and lastly it's new projects like new projects are you know there's a very vague and open-ended you know category but it's you know could there be a version of the compound protocol you know specifically meant for being deployed to like roll-ups right or that could work with like other things like can the compound community deploy the code elsewhere like you know the sky's the limit but i think like you know there's a huge opportunity for creative thinking and you know for people to volunteer and say like hey it would be fun to have a compound on you know optimism or compound on arbitrary compound on solana or you know whatever it is and you know basically like adapt the core code base and the open source front end to those networks um you know i think the grants you know organization you know should be able and excited to encourage this and to you know incentivize you know the success of this and i think there's huge opportunities here so you know if you're listening to this and you're seeing yourself like oh it can't be that hard to like you know deploy compound on you know arbitrary great let's do it right like as a community like you know anyone here can you know help expand compound and i think that's really exciting and really empowering now this is a great message i i mean um i do have a couple of things left but they're all on the same theme before we kind of wrap today up um i think uh one of the most interesting things today um for as we looked at all the talks has been how much variety and sort of diversity there is on the types of projects that have been funded by the ecosystem some of them are just services that help you manage what you what your compound positions are to better interfaces to more technical projects to help you improve uh the design and even parameter tweaking and managing risk um it is such a big um ecosystem that you can contribute in so many different ways and one common questions we've got we've a common theme and common set of questions we've gone for every of these talks has been how do i contribute if i'm a developer or do i have to be really specifically like i mean perfect on understanding solidity or one of the other skill sets um is it is it really kind of how you're thinking about the growth of the ecosystem do you want to prioritize developers right now before you move on to other um sort of types of skills or what does that look like as you think about it from your perspective yeah it's a great question so i would describe compound as you know very professional and boring anarchy um and you know there's an opportunity for anyone with any skill set to come in and just start participating right anyone would come in and just like sort of like you know there's no protocol job applications so to speak but if anyone's interested in like working like with a core d5 protocol there's a million opportunities for anyone with an idea on how they want to contribute it's like you know there's opportunities to help like come in as like a community like organizer and like you know organize like the development processes the community calls there's roles for people to come in and spend more time on the economics of the protocol there's opportunities for folks to focus on protocol business development or focus on marketing or focus on integrations like you know whatever your skill set is like if you just come into the community you're really excited you just raise your hand and you say you know here's what i'm going to do how do i do this i think there's going to be a lot of support for it and so there's very few people who tell you no or that want to tell you no um there's not a lot of structure in a good way i mean it's decentralized protocol but whatever your skill set like there's probably something for you that's perfect um so hopefully the couple questions we got today just right now um definitely address this um one sword related but a side conversation when i have is i think one interesting problem right now in this market is that the incentive to start something new is far greater than contributing to something existing um how do you think about balancing that or giving advice for people on when they have this choice what should they think about long-term versus short-term and anything around it yeah it that's a great question um you know in a you know environment like this you know systems like compound that have been around for years you know are incredibly exciting for certain reasons but they're not as new as something that you can create from scratch um you know i think long term you know simple you know protocols like compound are extremely important but i understand the sort of like goals of like starting something from scratch um the advantages to working in a protocol like compound are that you know it's operating today there's tens of billions of dollars in it it's already at scale there's a huge global user base um and you can have a huge impact in a way that you don't have to you know take a risk on something that doesn't exist yet i but i'm someone who started compound you know um from scratch and so i understand the idea of entrepreneurship as well but the skills that you build at compound are also you know the skills that are necessary to create a new protocol and oftentimes i think you know being a meaningful contributor to a protocol like compound helps you on whatever journey you want to go on next and so in a way you can have both yeah if anything this could also be a way to sort of get experience understanding how to manage things at scale and use that to learn and see what you can improve or change exactly no that's a that's a really good way of thinking about it um last question and i feel like you've answered this in certain ways but i want to be like i want to get a few more specific details here uh for everybody that's kind of interested in contributing to compound right now what is kind of uh your worst list of things that are super interesting to you that you think the compound ecosystem needs and what is the process of becoming a contributor to the protocol yeah so to get involved you know you can go to comp.xyz and join the discord that's where a lot of the conversations take place between those two um and you know you can ask what needs to be built um but like i think there's a lot of room to spend more time talking about things that haven't been looked at in years like the interest rate months right these are massively important move billions of dollars but like no one's really looked at like what the interest rate model should be in a really long time right so like taking a look at some of the parameters of the protocol with like a very like research driven approach i think is a good one um i think there's a large sort of like development um wish list that you can find on compoundgrants.org you know through rfps and like projects that are in the works um if there's things that are that look interesting and like haven't been worked on like great opportunity i think um you know focusing on the you know interface areas like we just open source the interface i'll double back to this you know there's a lot of opportunities to make the interface better when we launched it in 2019 it was like the greatest interface that web3 had ever seen but that was two years ago two and a half years ago and the interface really has been pretty much the exact same sense and a lot has changed i think you know forking the interface and improving it um is a huge opportunity and there's so many features that are available and lastly helping to expand you know compound um to new markets and in new ways i think is extremely exciting it's much harder and longer work especially i mean for like a specific interface prioritizing a user group or is that a product feature or protocol thing yeah in terms of like the protocol like you know working on you know gateway we're working on like you know deploying the code base to like a roll-up like there's a lot of opportunities to just expand you know um the access to the protocol so that's the fourth area that i would say to look at but it all starts with just like you know raising your hand there's a lot of people that are happy to talk to you and i would say like comp.xyz and discord are really great places to come amazing i think that's a perfect note to uh to end on and uh i think if there's two takeaways here is go to com.explosion get involved with the community and for those of you who are interested in building compoundgrants.org is the place to go to learn about how to get involved or and get grants robert thank you so much here i want to thank everybody from the compound team in the compound grants program i'll do this plug one more time for for all of you here compliment compoundgrants.org is the place to be you can see rfps and apply for grants directly and get more and more involved so with that i want to thank everybody who tuned in today and participated a lot of great questions a lot of amazing projects and a lot of links shared on how to get more pull requests on get up and get them to prod so uh with that i want to wish everybody a happy hacking for the rest of the hackathon we got a few more days to go before all projects are due and we can't wait to see what everybody builds next week so uh until then um enjoy your weekend everybody or actually not yet we're gonna see all of you tomorrow for our developer tools summit so uh thanks again for tuning in and uh we'll see you tomorrow at 12 pm eastern take care [Music] you
