but before that I want to quickly thank some of our amazing partners that without their support because if that would not be possible so of course Zora is an amazing partner we've been working with and one of the things the world for making this event come to life on top of that I want to thank Live Peter NFC storage polygon and lip protocol and then spin amp rtiva choose Fox refraction make fun African nft Community sound obsessed developer doubt and Noom I also want to thank sign spores heat pass mutual love felt about time um heat tech she said so friends with benefits and star union and mochi float Ulta anchor and arpeggy Labs so thank you so much to our amazing partners and uh we can't wait for all of you to see what comes out of this and have so many incredible projects use all of the work that you've been doing and building upon so uh I want to cover a lot about what this weekend and the next few days are going to be about the goal here is to talk about logistics I want to talk about anywhere from team formation how you can get help all the prizes all the talks and workshops judging and submission and that's going to work and of course we're going to then jump right into the summit which should be beginning right after this in 20 minutes so the first and the most important piece here is communication everything that we're going to be doing as part of this hackathon is going to be on Discord for all of you that have been confirmed as our hacker from your dashboard you will be able to connect your Discord and you will see you'll be seeing this Discord metabolism header on your sidebar so please make sure that you're able to see all these channels that are in the screenshot because that is controlled by our internal dashboard that gives you access based on what your role is at the event whether you're a sponsor or a hacker or a mentor or any of the partners so everything that we're doing is only open to the Hackman participants which means that only people who are in one of those three 80 to 400 group are going to be able to chat so you can talk to everybody there you can talk to all of our partners you can learn more about any of the prizes and ask questions if you're stuck on using specific apis and sdks and and that's also where you can get direct help so if you have any questions you can ask any of the mentors in the mentorship and help Channel on top of that we're also sharing and sending out calendar invites or talks and workshops so you can be informed of some key dates like submission deadline or when some of the Summits in the kickoff and the finale are starting we're going to be talking about everything that comes out of this event on top of all that everything that is going to happen over the course of this event is going to be published on the website which means that anytime you go to the website what you see there will be the source of Truth so all talks times workshops speakers everything that you are that's going to be happening will be relayed on the event website and really want this thing to be asynchronous there's 61 countries already participating at this event and we really understand that not everybody is available at the same time to do all these things so everything is designed to be Discord first and recorded and for a quick reminder the website is metabolism.ape global.com so let's get into how the hackathon itself works so officially the hackathon begins now which means you can start working on your projects now and you can work on your projects with up to five members in a team uh you have the next few days to hack so this gives you until Sunday and the submission deadline is 3 P.M Eastern on August 7th it's a quick note on how everything is structured on a team you can have up to five members but is not required for you to have a team which means that if you are interested in working on something on your own or you are just using this an opportunity to get better at something that is totally okay you are more than welcome to submit individually and participate at your own pace we also keep the rules and the criteria for the events simple everything that we're going to be doing from the submission standpoint and what you're going to be working on as a project is and should be done from scratch which means you cannot build on a pre-existing personal project and you cannot continue adding features to something you have done before or submit something that you did not start as of today um this is meant to be a place for us to keep everything fair and we want to really make sure that everybody that's participating in submitting something has been part of the exact same rules which is starting today and ending on Sunday on top of all of that every submission must use something in the Zora ecosystem or the apis or the sdks or the craft API to be eligible to compete and win in their projects or win any prizes so uh please make sure that you are meeting those two requirements and on top of all of those things only RSVP hackers are eligible to win the prizes which means that if you are working on a team and your team members are not listed under the team section on your dashboard and they are not confirmed and rsvp'd at submission time and you win a prize we will only be honoring the delivery of prizes to the members that were listed on the team and not anybody else that was officially not registered so if you still have a friend or team member that is outstanding or has an RSVP from their Dashboard please make sure that they are confirmed and ready to attend by end of today of course this means there's also going to be a couple of edge cases and we're more than welcome to help out and answer any of those questions or clarify certain things if you have any questions please reach out to us uh on Discord or email and ping anyone on the global team and we'll be happy to clarify anything that you have you'd like to know next up is judging so this is the most critical piece on how everything is structured so judging begins after submissions end submissions are going to be due on the Sunday at 3 pm Eastern so Sunday August 7th it gives you a few more days to kind of work on everything and the way everything is structured is that at submission time when you submit uh and finish the uh filling out all the fields that you need to specify whether While You're Building screenshots prizes and everything else those submissions will be locked in and everything that you submit at that deadline will be used to evaluate everything from our partners and for any of the presses then the next day is when judging officially begins starts on Monday the 8th and judging is going to be split into two streams one of them is the main judging if you are trying to be a finalist for this hackathon and then one of them is the sponsor prize judging which is going to be asynchronous and run also in parallel for the main judging it's going to be a live call where you as a team are going to come on and present your projects to our judges and they're going to come on and and ask questions and give feedback and do that directly uh synchronously on on a zoom call in parallel if you are trying to win a prize from any of our partners your project will be given to them to look at and evaluate and they'll be going through all of those uh all of your details for the prize and how whether it's your demo or your video or anything that you submit asynchronously and if and only if they have any questions they'll be reaching out to you directly to clarify or answer and go deeper into anything they'd like to know from there they'll be announcing and picking who the winners are and all of that comes together on Wednesday which is the finale where we're going to be talking about who won what prizes and in the middle of that is Tuesday which is going to be our creative Summit so while we kind of compute everything you get to enjoy some incredible speakers talking about everything that they're excited about so the main judging is structured as follows you will have four minutes to demo what you built uh this will be up to four minutes which is a Max limit but you can also obviously do something that's less than a four-minute demo and to simplify this process for everybody and make it really easy for us to review everything and make sure there are no technical difficulties every submission will be required to do a every team will be required to a video submission which means you're recording a up to four minute video of what you built which is a live demo introduction to who you are what you built and why and uh that's what you upload uh on Sunday uh having kind of gone through this thing a handful of times we'd really recommend that you do not leave this thing to last minute because you will run into situations where you can't fit everything that you want to show off in four minutes so please make sure you have at least two hours blocked to be able to work on the submission video as well as all the fields that you can fill out on describing what you did and how it works so please don't leave this till last minute and all that happens to your dashboard which means that right now you see the ability to create and update your project but you'll then see a proper submission flow that lets you specify all these things and upload that video and talk about all the prizes that you would like to qualify for and all the details that are needed accordingly and of course the next piece is what if I'm new to all of this this is the most kind of common question we've gotten and I want to make sure this event is beginner friendly and uh the way we have structured this is that we are making sure that we have content structured for every type of audience and skill set so there's going to be a lot of work uh being done and content being ready for beginners intermediate experts uh and obviously there's a lot of talks panels and workshops and also interactive sessions so you can meet other members for the hackathon and uh go anywhere from form teams to share ideas we're also obviously doing a summary right after this thing that goes deeper into how solar protocol works and all that information is also going to be listed on the metabolism info center but also if you can attend all these things don't worry everything is recorded as well so as soon as it ends it will be immediately available on YouTube and you can find out all these things on youtube.com Heath global foreign what's going on whether it's the submission deadlines or the speakers or the talks or any workshops you can head over to metabolism.heap global.com to find the latest and of course if you have any questions please feel free to ask them on the chat and I'd be more than happy to answer them here live but of course the second this live stream ends you can watch this video again or if you are on AP global.tv right now you can just hover over the video and drag it back and watch the replay on demand all right let's talk about prizes so as a lot of amazing prices were being that are being given out and uh I want to spend most of the time on talking about all the things that you can win in the Zora ecosystem so Zora is going to be giving away 580 in four of these categories so the first category is the best uses our protocol on API the second one is going to be on the best Integrations of projects that look into anching music ecosystems there's also a lot of prizes to be one or a lot of eighths to be one for Integrations and projects tackling down tooling and we also want to make sure this attracts developers as as equally as well as creatives and if you have interesting nft experiments you are also able to qualify for specifically winning a lot of in that category so these are the four places where you can qualify to win so our prices on top of all that we have of course a few ecosystem Partners so polygon will be giving ten thousand dollars in prizes for best Integrations that also interact with the polygon ecosystem and to make all of your lives simpler in terms of uploading and managing uh your nfts nft.storage is also giving 7.5 K and prizes to use the nfid.storage platform and we have lead protocol live here if you are interested in building things around permissioning and live streaming uh you can also win 5K each from them in prizes and I won't go into the details of all of these things um here but to find out specifics about what these prizes are the documentation uh to learn about links on what me what it means to use them get sample code all these things are available on metabolism.eakable.com prizes and of course as we end this and run into or get ready for our Summit I want to make sure that you are pacing yourself as part of this event I know uh four days is not a lot of time to kind of spend all the the time working and building your projects but we really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you we really want you to have fun this is very much about experientation learning and largely just being able to meet really incredible passionate people who also are interested in the same things as you so please take your time and make sure that you are using this as an opportunity to really understand what's happening learn more about what Zora is doing um and you are meeting people with different ideas and interesting backgrounds and interesting stories and finding a way to collaborate with them to work on something that all of you can be excited about so that concludes all of our Logistics I want to wish all of you happy hacking we'll see all of you on Discord and of course if you have any questions we can happily answer them here or on Discord so thanks again to the hackers and with this we are ready to start our incredible Summit so the next few hours are jam-packed with a lot of technical content so when I quickly jump into what is going on with the rest of the day so before we introduce our first Speaker I want to just quickly give an overview of the schedule so we're going to have six amazing talks uh we're gonna kick off today with bringing on Jacob from Zora uh talking about the Zara Playbook and learning a little bit more about hyperstructures I'm going to have Max who's going to be talking about how you
