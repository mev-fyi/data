foreign [Applause] [Music] good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of beat Global and I am super excited to welcome all of you to spaceworld Happy New Year to all of you who are joining us for the first time and from our community report let's get started so all of you are joining us on global.tv this is the platform that we have created and we'll be using for the rest of the hackathon this lets us make sure that everybody here is able to talk to us and our speaker especially as we do a lot of talks today and ask any questions in a way that is easy for everybody else to watch and communicate with and make it so uh by being live so sign into uh their chat if you haven't yet because uh for everybody who does we'll be giving out co-ops and nfts for being part of this event and for those of you who are joining this event and the whole hackathon for the first time this event is organized by Eve Global in partnership with protocol Labs if football is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to get thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by doing two primary things we run hackathons and summits and space War but is going to be no different we have an incredible Summit planned for you later today right after I talk about some of the hackathon logistics we're going to go into all the things that are happening in the fbm ecosystem and everything that you can do now and in the future and now we're going to kick that off uh just in about 15 minutes and then until then uh my goal is to kind of talk about a lot of things that were going to be uh needing to know for the hackathon so we're going to cover some of the hackathon logistics and then what the next few weeks look like and that's the plant so this is already the world's biggest fdm hackathon uh we piloted this by doing hack Diamond just about two months ago in November to see what people can do and what they're excited to build on the black conversion machine and the interest was absolutely incredible that I wanted to do it again now at a much much much bigger scale this is already over 900 people who are joining us to hack 77 different countries spanning 17 different time zones we kind of try to put where people are coming from on a map and we were so impressed by so much representation for so many different parts of the world so I personally can't wait to see what everybody builds and what problems they are excited about and are passionate about solving so with that uh not only do we have 900 plus hackers we also have five amazing partners and 29 ecosystem actors who are going to be here helping you out making sure that you are successful and able to get anything that you wanted to finish uh from the project standpoint and to top it all off we'll be giving 150 000 in prizes so uh stay tuned for a few more minutes and I'll be covering all the prices that you can win and how I'll give a big shout out to our incredible partner falcoin they've been working on this amazing runtime that lets you do so many cool things that are now native to stories and working on data so Falcon will be a big part of making sure that you have the best possible outcome on getting your ideas come to life they also quickly want to thank hudlow one light Pierre Lighthouse and Bush work home there are also some incredible companies that work really well in the web 3 ecosystem and will simplify a lot of your life as you think about making projects that deal with storage video just real-time communication and and messaging so you get to do all those cool things and also win prizes and we'll cover that in a second so let's talk about what the next three weeks look like the goal for me is to cover what you can do for this hackathon how you can get help all the summit content we're going to cover how judging is going to work for the projects and everything in between so let's kind of first start off by all things communication everything that we're doing for this hackathon is going to be on the Discord channels if you've applied and RSVP as a hacker you will see a link to join the Discord which will automatically give you the right permissions keep in mind these are private channels which means only people who are participating in this hackathon will be able to see them so if you do not see this left sidebar with the space morph category uh try connecting your Discord again from the global.com dashboard or message us if something is not working on the permissions but all of you should be there this is also where you can ping directly any of the mentors or our partners or get any help on all things related to your project and the rest of the ecosystem on top of all that we'll be signing out calendar invites to all of the attendees so you can know normalize to your time zone when different talks or workshops are when judging is deep when judging actually happens when all the other important things are like feedback sessions and everything else is also directly listed on the website which is the source of Truth so whatever the website says is what we and everybody else will be following and we'll be making sure that everything is up to date and the latest without any inconsistency on on the website we really want this event to be synchronous it is not easy to do a synchronous event with 900 people so everything is designed to make sure that you're able to catch up on at your own pace and also do that while be comfortable understanding what's happening in this ecosystem and prioritize learning and as a quick reminder the website is spacewarb.global.com for all of you to quickly go and see everything from the schedule to the prizes to the speakers to everything else so how does this hackathon work well this is an online event that spans two and a half weeks officially you can all start hacking on your projects now and you can work on projects with individually or with a team if you are working on a team you can have up to five members on your team and you have the next two and a half weeks to hack that means submissions are going to be due on Monday noon Eastern Time on February the 6th and the next few days after that are for judging for everybody to review what came out of it and then we talk about all the winners and highlights of the incredible projects that came out from all the submissions foreign question we've gotten is okay well this is a cloud coin specific VM event what can I build and and am I allowed to do X or am I allowed to do this or that um we want to make sure we address all those questions for you and uh the most obvious thing I'd like to talk about is that fbm is ebm compatible uh you get to do all the things that you're interested in with smart contracts and now have other Primitives to integrate with and really make that comprehensive interesting and unique you can do anything that you want to do in in solidity on a Quantum virtual machine and we're going to talk about some incredible stuff there too especially with febum and some talks are specifically going to cover this so so don't be afraid to uh try out interesting ways to represent smart contracts in terms of kind of ideas or things that you can think about there's so much space to make really really creative things so you can do so many cool things with decentralized compute there's a lot of things with storage derivatives cross-ring budget Bridges uh ethereum Integrations you can look at replication Works workers specifically kind of from the five-way ecosystem and the big asset theme being data dialysis there's a lot of ways we can programmatically make really cool projects that leverage different dials and data sets and so there's a lot you can do there and we also have a doc on the website and also on the infracenter and Discord that goes into a lot of details for all these six categories that lets you think about a lot more creative ideas if you're still stuck or looking for some inspiration and I also want to talk about that experimentation is okay and starting small was okay uh this is equally an opportunity for the Falcon ecosystem to learn what developers are excited to do or what they find interesting or difficult or easy and more often shape and make the fem ecosystem better and and improve it and and as part of that you get to work with the team that is directly in charge of improving this platform and helping them make it more easy and friendly for you to use and more interesting applications to come out so experimentation is okay it is totally fine if you don't have to finish everything that you wanted to start and starting small is okay you don't have to stall everything in two weeks uh you can pick a small feature you can pick a small Improvement and get feedback directly from people in our ecosystem and our goal exactly is uh is to make the fdm better and as part of that we also want to emphasize the early Builders program where you get to work directly more if you are interested in continuing your project to get direct feedback potential funding and grants and really want something as the universal machine ready is mainnet all right so quickly on the rules and criteria the rules for all of our events are fairly straightforward anytime you do a hackathon at a global uh anything that you are submitting must be done from scratch which means that you cannot work on a project until the hackathon begins in our case today and you cannot build on a pre-existing personal project and submit that as something that you did over the course of the hackathon even though you may have been working on it in the past given the uniqueness of this particular event we will be allowing people to Port any existing smart contract or solidity project onto fem and use that as a ballot submission so you are allowed to Port your existing code on anything that solidity and use that here and that piece will be allowed so this is the exception here for justice events and if you're still unsure whether something all fuzz or does not qualify you can message anybody here on the global team on Discord or email or directly reach out to me or replying to the equal TV chat all that is totally fine and we'll be able to quickly ask answer and clarify things for you and just two other nuances there which is if you are submitting a project and you are working with a team if your team is not listed at the point of submission and on your dashboard as a confirmed team member and you do end up winning any prizes we will only be giving prizes to somebody who is listed on the team so please make sure that you have officially marked your team members as part of your team on your dashboard in terms of judging so judging is going to be set up as follows the submission for all of your projects are going to be due on Monday the 6th of February at noon to 12 p.m Eastern and judging will happen the day after judging is set up to be a two parallel track project uh path there's going to be a main judging which covers all the other prizes that we're going for which I'll cover in a few minutes and then for any of the partner providers you're looking for that are listed on our website those prizes will be judged asynchronously by all of our amazing partners and they'll be able to reach out to you directly if they have any questions coming back to the main judging that happens as a synchronous call from 12 to 2 30 p.m Eastern on Tuesday the 7th this means that all the teams will be joining a zoom call and they'll be presenting what they build to our judges and they'll be getting feedback and they'll be getting questions they get to demo what they kind of build all together in a live call and the way that's going to be structured is that you will get four minutes to demo what you built this is going to be a live call which means that you will be asked questions and you should have something that you can present to all of our judges uh we will recommend and require in this scenario video submissions which means that when you are submitting your project you get to record a pre uh determined kind of video and when you come on you get to play that video so we can make sure there's no technical difficulties or something doesn't go wrong or if one of your teammates is having trouble with their devices or or time zones we're able to still continue and make sure that you get the chance to demo and showcase what we built we really recommend you don't do this thing last minute because uh this will take some time they are getting two weeks worth of work condensing to a four minute pitch is not simple or easy so it just takes a little bit more time so please uh block at least an hour if not more to making sure that you have sample time to submit a really really interesting and cooling video and all these details are going to be on your dashboard we'll just start up hearing as we get closer to the the deadline for submission and then for all the partner prize judging uh just make sure that you specify that you are trying to go for a price if you do not select the price you were looking to get uh there's no way for us to know or the partners to know that they should be looking at your project submission we're expecting a lot of projects here for this event so make sure that you get to specify that as part of the submission process and then all of our partners will review this on their own and reach out to you if they have any questions and of course the most common question that we get and the one that we want to help address but also are excited to address is what if you're new to all of this uh the goal for all our events I think Google is to really encourage people who are interested in learning what's happening in web3 so as part of that mission we plan for things to be suitable for all types of beginners and skill sets and and experts there's a lot of incredible talks and workshops everything that you are seeing uh down to me talking this uh in this video to All the workshops that have happened today and yesterday and everything's going to happen today and for the next few weeks uh be available immediately on YouTube where you can catch up based on whenever you have the time and the chance to to learn and also the community here is going to help out with any questions or clarifications or bugs that you were encountering and make this an opportunity for you to spend the next few weeks learning about what's possible so keep that in mind that you can catch up on anything that's happening at your own pace and if there's something that you're still stuck on we'd be happy to help and if you're still looking for an idea or a team you can find different team members who are still looking for uh other members who join their part to join their project on the financing channel on our Discord and uh we'd love to learn more about who you are where you're from and that way you're excited to build in the space warp chat channel so do say hi this with all our partners and mentors everybody else we're expecting a thousand plus people in total so uh there's a lot of people that you get to meet in and uh collaborate with and there's also going to be a few brainstorming and ideas session and the information session so if you want a synchronous call where you want to chat with people we're also looking for a team and think about different ideas we'll be facilitating a lot of those calls today and next week and of course it's not required that you must work on a team you can totally work on something on your own or use this as a opportunity for you to learn some things and challenge yourself in getting something done in a short amount of time and one quick thing is that there's also now a tool to help you find team members so anybody it is a double often tool which means that if you select it then I'm looking for a team member and I'd like to be contacted by other people who are also looking for a team you can press this button on your dashboard and find people who have different skill sets or are looking to join or add other members to the team and this is available to you directly on your dashboard all right a few more things I'm going to get to the prizes I'm going to kick off with the summons uh project check-ins this is a multi-week event which means that we're going to make sure that we are able to help you get unblocked on anything that you're stuck on and as part of that there's going to be a notion of a check-in a check-in is a quick form that will appear on your dashboard next week they'll just ask you how things are going if you're stopping anything if you're still waiting to hear back on something and with that we get to quickly address and unblock you and make sure that you are able to finish and work on your project and get any other help that you need so please make sure you finish the checkings this is also part of officially the step for being a uh confirmed hacker so you'll see about two of these trackings that will help you understand what's happening with this event and also help us and the rest of the protocol Labs team understand what they can do better and what we can do to make sure the experience really really good project feedback sessions all the sessions that we're going to do here will become an opportunity for you to get their live feedback from different members in this ecosystem and different Engineers are working on the file conversion machine and also the global team to really help make sure that you are able to get any instant feedback to ideas for how to make this better or grow and take this project to long term there'll be two of these sessions happening next Wednesday and the following week on on the first so both Wednesdays and there'll be two uh at these same times and based on the demand we may adjust after different time zones so they'll be joined by all of our mentors and you can get my feedback on your exact projects and be ready for submission and judging and of course I want to quickly talk about our code of conduct uh the goal for being part of any of the events is to make sure that we create a welcoming community and as part of that our code of conduct and rules are fairly straightforward uh in short please be respectful to everybody that's part of this event harassment and abusing any problem will not be tolerated and anything that comes out of this event is owned by you solely as an individual so no other entity or a global or anybody else has the rights to what you come up with and you get to retain full ownership of that more specifics of all that is
