here we go where everybody welcome to our second batch for mark and make sure today is uh day one and uh session number two for uh our acts and uh and judging them from market may so um like i wanted to give a summary to everybody uh for for our video recording gear uh this has been our first event for 2021 um and we're super excited to have 490 uh hackers compete and uh and uh work on interesting projects and we're gonna see a subset of them here today uh these 190 people are coming in from 58 different countries and spanning 17 different time zones with a lot of interesting and diverse ideas and people and problems being tackled and uh super excited to see what everybody's built so sometimes we do yesterday and we have 120 projects that have come out of this event and uh we'll see about 30 of them today um in 15 of them in this session so i'm going gonna quickly go over the format before we jump into our very first project uh each team will have eight minutes in total at which the first four minutes are uh for a video demo that has been pre-recorded and then we'll have a four-minute q a session where our judges will be able to ask them ask teams any questions or clarify that they have missed and we'll also do a two to three minute break every four projects so our judges can confer with each other and kind of get a good handle on how to think about all the teams here and then um based on uh how things are going from the timing standpoint we'll also do a quick break at halfway point so everybody can stretch or get some coffee or food uh and just get a quick break so in terms of how this is set up today and for this event uh each team will be rated on these five categories they'll be looked at on how technical original practical a project is and then on top of that from a ui ux and developer extreme experience standpoint where it stands and then we obviously recognize that not all of these categories are enough to quantify everything or account for all edge cases so we also have a catch-all that we like to call a factor that uh we get to use uh to handle any other case that we have missed and before we kind of move on to our very first demo i wanted to remind everybody that this is not a competition uh the events are specifically designed for people to learn and experiment and uh the projects here are not trying to become businesses nor is it incentivized and the goal for these sessions is to get feedback on the projects so we're here to understand what's what's been getting everybody excited and then how to take it to the next level and continue building and that's kind of the goal on the theme for this event so doing the hard job are our three judges we have patrick collins from chandling we have ken from the ethiopian foundation in heart language from uma uh they'll be with us for the next uh couple of hours uh talking to all the teams and presenting and with that we are ready for our demos so uh we have our first thing here already and that is long finance so without further ado i'd like to welcome lump finance to uh kick off with their screen chair and play their video so nick anytime you're ready for to kick us off hello my name is nick morris and i'm the developer of lump finance lump finance is a decentralized crowdsourcing platform that allows content creators to receive funding from their fans while significantly reducing the financial burden of actually spending or donating money content creators can create pools that their fans can deposit ethereum into the deposited ethereum is then swapped to die and then deposited into aves dial ending pool the deposited die will then accrue interest over time which will be paid out to the content creator at any point fans are able to withdraw their funds from the pool while only losing out on the gas fees required to make this all work so what does this actually look like as alice i would first go to lump dot finance where here i am greeted with a form to fill out i would fill out this first one with the name that my viewers know me best as next i would include a bio describing who i am and what i do for now i'm just going to put some sample text but you can put as much text as you want here next i would include social links and these are the links that my fans who visit my page this is to tell them where they can find my content so let's say that alice has two sites he has a youtube channel and a twitch channel uh twitch.tv alice live i can add as many links as i want but i'll leave it at two for now once i submit this i am greeted with a meta mask transaction confirmation where i can confirm this once the transaction is completed i'll be taken to my actual page here i can see how much money has been pulled in my contract i can see my name i can see a link that'll take me to the ether scan address of the pool i have the description that i put here and the amount of money that's available for withdrawal right now here i can see the links that i've included and these are again the links that my fans need to go to to see my content and there's a description for anyone new to the website here down at the bottom there is a area to deposit and withdraw ethereum into the contract so now i'm going to switch to what would be bob's view so the view is essentially the same here for bob um the only difference that he can't see the available amount for or the available amount for withdrawal what he can see is basically everything else so as bob i would like to deposit let's say 0.05 eth um i would deposit this confirm once then once this transaction is completed i can see how much i've deposited and how much is in the pool right so as a as a donator i am done now if i go back to alice's account i can see that there's already some interest accrued that i can withdraw so once i click this link another metamask prompt comes up i just have to pay for the gas right now the gas will cost more than what is available to withdraw but over time that will be different once that transaction has completed we can see that there's no more available for withdrawal and if i check my ether scan if i check etherscan i can see that die was sent to my account and i can already see that there is more interest available for withdrawal i don't have the time to explain each of these but there are a lot of changes that i want to make to the project the most important being improving the contract efficiency to reduce on gas fees next i want to dynamically deposit into the avec pool which has the highest apy instead of just doing it into die thank you for your time hello awesome well thank you so much for uh for being our first demo for the day um super interesting i hope i'm making an echo name and a hack so a lot of judges kick in and if yeah nick this is awesome um congrats man um so you kind of asked like what's next but are you gonna do you have any plans for this do you want to um like what are your what you have any plans to take this any further right uh so yeah this was an idea that i've had for um some time now i'm relatively new to like d5 and this is like one of the first ideas i have so um i would like to continue this even if it's not like a super popular application i want to use this for myself because it seems like a pretty unique or useful way to make passive income if that answers your question yeah it does it should also i have an echo too too but i want to encourage you guys exactly what you should do it's an awesome awesome application thank you yeah just to um dial in a little bit more on that yeah i think that's really cool um you know working with the liquidity pools and use putting down the um putting down the collateral there to start creating that interest i think this is great um how did you look at um what were kind of the different sources that you looked at to to get the interest was it was it ave was it multiple places or where were you kind of thinking so i was right now i'm just using ave like i'm just hard coding the dye lending pool but what i wanted to do was dynamically choose whichever landing pool gets or would receive the most apy um i was thinking about using ave's what's the sub graph to get that data because i think it's available on there but not entirely sure um but yeah hopefully that answered your question yeah yeah yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense and yeah i think yeah again you know obvi is obviously fantastic protocol um absolutely love ave um it sounds like you're almost kind of thinking um if you're familiar with your dot finance that's something that they kind of do they look to like route um the uh the the collateral to like whatever uh whatever protocol is going to give the most yield back so so that's that's that's a really uh that's an awesome concept so very cool thank you hey just to chime in as well um thank you uh so actually i guess like the more fun aspects of this are like have you have you spoken to any of the uh have you spoken any i guess like artists like any anybody on like twitch or youtube who would be interested in using this uh no not really no cool um matt i i think as like a premise for um staking and getting people interested or like even dipping their toes into d5 i feel like this is like a great sort of first step um do you have you thought about different ways in which you could sort of um you know leverage this a bit more i know you said this is this is one of your first things getting your feet wet um have you thought about maybe like like what if instead of just putting it in you could collateralize that or you could maybe uh you know tokenize your staked asset and could use that to do more like maybe the artists themselves could you know use that for trading or use that to stake some more right yeah i think um i i guess not that specifically but um when i was thinking about this i think this is like um in general this is a really good way just to pull money and um i guess like gain funds um this this was just like the main idea but i think there are a lot of branches we could like branch off into um some ideas i had where maybe i could um right now it just the the pooled money automatically goes into die but maybe the content creator can choose like which pool the money goes into so they can choose like what apy they want or maybe they could have like different kind of strategies sort of like the year in finance where you can have like different strategies where the money goes um stuff like that yeah yeah i mean i think i think that's really awesome thinking about like what's next because i mean i feel like you should absolutely continue with this uh but thinking about like how you know government bonds work to work instead of thinking about their bonds or uh you know company bonds we can do entertainer bonds right right i see that's a good idea thank you thank you thanks for it looks like so uh thanks for presenting and uh i hope you can keep working because there's a lot of other places this can be applied to so uh congrats on this and uh thanks again and uh i think uh what we'll do is we'll try to spend maybe 30 seconds fixing the echo issue here and maybe if i can ask ken and uh and batteries maybe just rejoin and hope that it fixes itself and then we'll move on to our next project when i'm talking is the echo still there no i think it's just ken now okay hello let me ken are you good now i think you're good now i feel like i am yeah you sound good to me i think it computers just in it for our judges the project they think is a bit delayed so we're gonna move on to uh the next one which is avi liquidation protection and uh i'll be playing the video for for johan and now and then we'll be here to answer the questions so just give me one second to set up and we'll be able to kick off the next demo hi my name is shahan yang welcome to the presentation of the ave liquidation protection bot this is a market make hackaban project the bot can help protect against liquidation penalties by automatically repaying loans when certain thresholds are met this project completes a challenge from one inch the diagram here shows a lot of details with the key steps being highlighted in green the first thing is we take out a flash load and we use that flash loan to repay the user debt with that user debt repaid we can now withdraw the collateral and what we would like to do is to use the collateral to repay the flash load since the collateral token doesn't match the debt token that can't be done directly so we use a one inch swap to swap the collateral for the debt token and then we that allows us to repay the flashlight so that all happens in one nice transaction now before the demo i'd like to call out a key point so you'll see that right after the flash loan is received we do this verify signature step this is important for security reasons and that will be explained after the demo on the right hand side we see the test fixture the test fixture forks main net using hard hat and deploys the contract then seeds an initial user by taking out a loan the service is now started which allows us to connect to it that brings up an initially unpopulated information display connecting to metamask fetches the address and sends it to the server allowing it to fetch information about the loan and to display it what we see here is a loan of dye collateralized using eth the current ratio is computed by the server using chain link lookups for demonstration purposes we will choose a custom threshold smaller than the current ratio to trigger immediate repayment clicking the registration button triggers a couple of metamask approvals the first is an erc20 approval for the contract to withdraw the a tokens this is needed so that the contract may repay the debt the approval is a web 3 ethereum transaction sent via meta mask the second approval is an eip 712 message attesting that the user trusts the bot we will talk more about this later once registration succeeds the bot starts pulling chain link price information and immediately notices that the threshold has been exceeded this triggers repayment using a number of complex operations including a flash loan and a multi-part swap this costs a hefty 1 million gas the test verifies that the user debt is reduced to 0 and reports success in the normal flow of events the bot initiates repayment by calling the execute function of the repayment executor contract this triggers the flashlight call and the lending pull api invokes the execute operation via callback the callback needs to be handled with care it is a public method and anyone may call it a malicious user could potentially trigger a premature repayment or even a swap to the wrong token to prevent this from happening we use signature verification based on solidity's ec recover the first signature establishes the trust between the user and the bot the second signature establishes the authenticity of the call data using the bot's signature we need to do two things before everyone can use this one we need to deploy the repayment executor contract to mainnet and two we need to create a docker container for the bot so everyone can use it thank you for your attention listen well thank you so much for that video and uh hey you're here with us and i'll uh let our judges kick off with any questions or comments can you still hear me yes i can i think we're good yeah so this is this is really cool um i had a couple of thoughts but i'll try to keep keep brief so uh so the the thought is to kind of have this centralized service off chain uh that's just constantly running checking and then once it once it sees like oh there's there might be a liquidation here then it activates right um there's two ways that centralization is one the other is like the user could have the bot running on their own computer uh i think in the long term it would make sense for a com for ave to just provide this as a free service to the world oh that'd be kind of cool so you're thinking like ave has like a group of of nodes doing something like this or are you thinking like there's a smart contract that's working with an oracle that's doing something like this you need you need that smart contract to make a transaction that does the whole flow but then you need a bot that has no choice but being a centralized service of some sort almost no choice um to to do the the price lookups and the ratio comparisons and and then is there is there a chance that um it sounds like there's like a little bit of a race going on right the bot has to find like the the liquidation event faster than it actually gets liquidated right yes the uh the threshold is selected you select the threshold in the ui or the user selects it so maybe you'd pick one that uh it is a little bit uh lower than the one that allows the world to liquidate very cool so so you worked with um it's kind of interesting because you worked with the chain price feeds off chain uh using it as the data feed that that's pretty cool i was i was looking at the stack um ready gonna go you know thumbs up for writing in a go that's great um so something to maybe check out actually is look at maybe like the chain link alarm clock or some type of uh timing event um because you can get a network of off-chain chain like oracle's all kind of talking to each other and say and they basically say okay at this time we're gonna run an event or you know once this threshold is hit we're gonna do it so you actually can have that service uh in a decentralized fashion um so maybe that's something to check out if you're looking to take this further thank you sounds interesting hey i'm really i'm really digging the little the the 8-bit characters that you have i think they're really cool sorry i paid my son 20 bucks for those um so i i have a couple questions uh the first one is more i guess technical um what do you do in the case of like gas price fluctuations or i guess like a lot of times for one inch no no yeah i'm very i'm sorry about that there's there's no gas model uh the user just makes sure there's enough gas in the bot and the gas has the the bot has to pay the gas of that transaction that's kind of a flock although if they had like a centralized service and they would just make sure that the body is funded and then recoup the gas prices when they uh get the collateral out yeah that makes sense and so how how long do you think it'll take uh i guess it's presumptuous for me to assume that you you want to push this the main net um but i guess uh you know do you want to take the take this domain i think it would make sense for something someone like ave to take it to maine that or for me to work with ave to take it to maine that rather than kind of doing it on my own yeah should hat stand standing on uh twitter yeah you should but um i i want to be supportive of just um to me doing this type of off-chain monitoring of your positions it's it's a very cool feature and even if you're running the bot yourself like you suggested it's a cool power user feature that i think is really useful for people to save money and so i actually just want to be nothing more than just say doing this type of monitoring off-chain um i think it's very it's where the direction's going it's like layer two-ish and i'm very supportive of you pushing um pushing this forward because this is something that like should exist so awesome thank you thank you i'll respond to that for sure that's awesome well john that was really awesome as a demo and uh thanks for kind of putting in a lot of work into making this work in a really cool intuitive and understandable video um i'd like to just say uh i think if your son wants another gig for our next hackathon would be happy to sign him and then get some more avatars up and uh i'm actually serious about that so do you pick me after this he'll be very happy to hear that i'm going to send you his you send your email to him that's great you can pick me on discord and uh we'll get that started so thanks again hope you continue working on this thing and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next demo so we have the next team which is uh number two from the list uh team pitfinka from uh for our judges uh jeff and jacqueline welcome again uh hello from japan uh and uh whenever you're ready we can kick it off great thank you yeah i'm jeff i'm based in japan jacqueline's base in singapore i'm gonna play the video now wait i need to share my screen don't it can you see my screen yes hi everyone we're bitfinka and our mission is to make defy accessible for everyone we're a team from curve grid a blockchain middleware company in tokyo japan i'm jacqueline a software engineer intern at kirkwood and i work mainly on frontend and smart contracts i'm jeff co-founder of curve grid and i worked on smart contracts and ava integration so why microfinance while capital markets are a crucial source of large volume financing they often fail smaller countries and companies we aim to make financial services accessible for everyone no matter their economic status or geographical location so let's dive into how bit think it works entrepreneur entrepreneurs can apply on our platform and wait for validators to approve their business they can accept a loan and then grow their business lenders can browse entrepreneurs and pick which ones to invest in there they can fund loans wait to get repaid and repeat validators conduct due diligence and entrepreneurs their ratings are used to calculate credit ratings and they can get rewarded for validation work here's a technical overview of our project smart contracts uh do all of the business logic and are connected to the front end we also uh support borrowing from ave we had some issues with ave integration so we wrote our own uh uh cut down version of ave called suave let's dive right into the demo so when an entrepreneur first onboards to our website they can apply to be an entrepreneur so now sophie is applying for her restaurant sophia can view her dashboard and look update her lenders and all the people watching her business and also set a target and the amount of money that she needs to raise currently sophia has already raised 320 from the lenders that have decided they'd like her business model when she has received enough of loans sophia can approve bitfinka or borrow from ave on the other hand lenders can also apply to join our platform after lenders apply they can browse businesses and decide which ones they want to invest in alexander wants to invest in this blogging business so they can decide to loan 10 tokens uh can also view his account and look at his token balance and adjust his um information and also deposit and withdraw from his account finally validators can also apply to join our platform and after being successfully accepted to our platform they can start validating businesses and earning tokens while they do it here arban can decide which companies to validate after conducting his due diligence and researching the company's business model after validating companies their company's credit scores should increase eventually with as more validators approve their company join us in making d5 accessible for everyone awesome well thanks so much for that demo i feel like this was like a full-on end-to-end product so this is great a letter judges that kick in with any questions or comments yeah guys this is uh beyond awesome very very cool just one i guess question on the mechanics of this so in this loan setup there is no like recourse if somebody defaults on their loan right the validator's job is just to determine who is going to who's likely to pay back is that right correct yeah validators are supposed to conduct due diligence and estimate the chance of defaults but um for the most part it's kind of built on trust and similar to how normal banks calculate risk for whether or not a borrower will default on their loan this is similar with the credit ratings i mean i'm a bit familiar with companies like tala that have done this same concept and other places that that there is no recourse where they make a loan at really high interest rates and they just hope that they make people think they're supposed to pay it back i see this as like this whole concept as the decentralized version of something like tala where these validators instead of like analyzing your smart phone data you've got these validators determining whether people are credit worthy or not i think it's fascinating and i think it totally could work so then i guess my next question is are you guys going to what's the next step with this jeff do you want to answer that haven't thought that yeah yeah i mean you know so so the idea obviously for the for this hackathon uh i think we'd be looking to take it to somebody who might want to uh you know really turn it into like a a business or an organization right i mean um um yeah you know we'd be happy to to to keep working on it from a technical perspective and you know i think we've got the idea and the passion but but maybe less experience with you know connecting uh with some of these these organizations on the ground in places that need this kind of service i think that the goal would be to find um you know a group an organization an npo like that that could help us and might be interested in it awesome yeah so the ui on this is gorgeous like it looks really really sick um really clean and like i love how i i'm assuming it was a little bit ave inspired is that is the color scheme like ave word yeah i looked at the ave color scheme and kind of made it similar especially the fading here yeah yeah when when you're like oh we changed to be suave i'm like oh okay okay i'm with that all right um yeah it looks looks super cool um so so my my question is actually follow up to the comment um you made previously so you're saying we've been turned into a business um yeah i definitely think kind of the uh the credit system on like kind of in the blockchain world is really interesting right because historically we've been like you know we don't wanna we wanna trust minimize we want to you know have everything have cryptographic proofs um so my question is you mentioned okay we might want to turn this into a real company would you be more interested in making this a company or more a decentralized protocol or what would the thoughts be around uh that being the next step yeah definitely decentralized protocol definitely decentralized protocol i think to to kind of launch it you know especially when we're connecting with real uh you know entrepreneurs on the ground partnering with an npo would be the right first approach but yeah i mean the goal one of the challenges in some of the existing uh projects in this space is there's a lot of fees right a lot of high fees just to administer it and the whole goal with you know this approach with bitfinka is we reduce those fees you know ultimately just to to whatever the gas layer is plus you know the validators get some incentive for doing good work and and can be rated themselves but yeah absolutely 100 percent decentralized and to set it free like that gotcha great yeah beautiful ui really cool really challenging problem uh to tackle so um so nice job yeah just it is beautiful i i wanted to say that too but um one one question though what is what is multi-fast is that it's yeah it's it's a middleware it's a blockchain middleware that just provides uh an api rest api over top of smart contracts so we just use it for faster development thank you uh jeff jacqueline thanks again for presenting and now this is a full-on product that you're doing again so uh hopefully you continue working on this and uh uh yeah congrats again and uh thank you online and now i've had the opportunity to take a look which is great um perfect so with that we are ready to move on to our our next demo and that is team uh coinfood.io uh one other note is uh for all the other teams that are up and coming next we are using the chat box to uh call out the team so just keep an eye out on on the chat for the zoom and you'll know when uh when you're up next so with that we have rj here and rj whenever you're ready feel free to present all right hi everyone let me share my screen now hold on hi everyone i'm rj and i'm building coinfu.io so yeah what is coinfo.io um to sum it up it's workflow automation for cryptocurrency investors another way to think of it is like zap here for cryptocurrency events so for the motivation um one of ethereum strength is that all transactions are available for people to see this allows users the freedom to view and understand exactly what happens to their assets whenever they interact with the protocol it goes without saying though that there is a huge amount of data to sift through if you want to understand what's happening searching for data is no easy task and users are often overwhelmed the goal of coinfood.io is to augment and enhance users workflows to allow them to make the most of their cryptocurrency experience so what is my hack so yeah just for context during the ico hype back in 2017 ethereum didn't really have a solid use case just yet at least from my opinion fast forward to now and the ecosystem is thriving my favorite use case is the ability for users to take out collateralized stats a necessary component however of these stats are liquidations due to how it works most liquidators are bots and scripts running 24 7 on a server but what if we can surface these liquidation opportunities to let retail investors take part and help make the ecosystem healthy so before i go proceed with the demo what protocols have i integrated in this project so one of them is uma as you all know liquidations and disputes are an integral part of this protocol for ave ave as well and yeah for the graph to get the necessary data so and now for the demo let's let's build an automated task so let's go ahead into the the main ui or the dashboard as you can see in order to create this task um you need to select like your main sort of like event there are several integrations built already here but for the purpose of this hackathon i'm going to focus on ave and uma so i'm going to click on ave i'm going to create the select the action new liquidation opportunity so this opportunity or sorry this task will run every time an opportunity is available on ave so i'm going to click that and over here down uh on the down on the input field you can see all the necessary data that you will be able to fetch with and use in the subsequent steps so now let's go to the next step um so this step um is pretty much like where we want to send the data to um we can create like a google sheet um entry or let's create like a tweet so i'm going to click on twitter i'm going to select send tweet and it has auto-populated my um my coin through twitter account and it has also pre-filled sort of like a standard message that users can just use and start with right away so obviously here we can also add more data um but yeah so now that's it i'm going to click on complete and then ave liquidation of opportunities i'm going to hit save and over here you can see that our task was created if i click on here we'll be able to modify and also turn on the automation just quickly let's also go through the sort of like the uma process it's pretty similar so if you click on uma you can click on new liquidation opportunity and then over here um let's also just select send a tweet do that uh the message and all the data is pretty pretty similar at this moment so i'm just going to hit on complete and then uma liquidation of opportunities hit save and yeah as you can see these two automated tasks can now be um yep so that was coinful i just immediately put a put a cut on there on a four minute mark to not be disqualified but yeah um if you guys have any questions just let me know i'll just comment before anybody else because i think this is incredibly useful and well thought through so congrats on this yeah kartik i'm just gonna say man like okay i'm biased because you also built within this stuff which is cool but ignoring that entirely kartik this is why i like judging the stuff this is a full application man this is like completely usable that you do useful things like i don't know that's that's just pretty awesome so like rj um what do you so can you please make sure this goes to mainnet and actually becomes usable to other people or what's your plan there so that's interesting so the main gripe i have with a with a application right now is it's completely centralized um the next path for me is either to proceed with like centralized route and just host everything on my own or go to the decentralized path and sort of like do everything else that uh there but i mean i feel that as a founder i have a lot of assumptions i want to be i wanted to become decentralized i wanted to be all the idealistic things um which is which is a flaw of all founders unfortunately so i would actually say that my next step would be to sort of like curate a community and sort of like see where they want the application to go from here yeah it's not going to be about like what i want uh this project to be but it's going to be like what would be like the best use case for all the uh sort of like the all the users out there entering in if you're entering the cryptocurrency space i i love your idealism man but i don't don't want to get in the way of building practical useful things here too there is this path here well so like you can't you can't do this over time but i think something like this there's still a need for centralized services supporting like the underlying infrastructure um behind this so i just yeah hats off congrats yeah and then i'm even gonna plus one that like uh i think this is really cool i mean like i use um i use zaps all the time uh i i you know i'm lazy i like to automate stuff uh i'm trying to automate stuff on the on the chain all the time too um so i i think you're saying like oh man i want to make it decentralize i think like i mean there's there's services like etherscan right etherscan is a bunch of centralized services we all like rely on it we all need it uh we all need these to make them work so something like this you know can can provide a ton of value for for the ecosystem so i think this is really cool i was curious to see um i was curious to see the code i couldn't find the code but um you know i'm not looking in the right places but yeah i mean i've nothing but positive things to say here i think this is really cool i guess the question would be how would you even you know turn this into a decentralized service i mean uh in my mind the first thought or actually i'll a positive how would you turn this into a decentralized service if you wanted to go that route so um yeah so i've been thinking about that actually sort of like similar to the path of like how the graph has like validators or something but then they would need to host the user uh user sensitive data uh on those servers so i would need to put in sort of like a like a slashing mechanic if they act maliciously um to be honest it's a bit over my head at this point um but yeah so hopefully hoping to grow this even more this year um yeah step by step i i would say i hear that so so yeah again you know don't trash it being centralized i think that that's great if you do want to go the decentralized route um your shameless self plug i i think that a chain-link keeper integration might be exactly what you're looking for so if that is a route you're like hey you know i wanted to be decentralized i would definitely recommend checking that out because you can send those post requests kind of in a decentralized manner but um that's some food for thought thank you i mean it'd be awesome to just like start up a telegram group or as a discord and just have a bunch of people building on it together open source and let it free into the world and see how see how it grows yeah but this is this is amazing i can't add anything more to what everyone else just said and the takeaway is that make sure it's it's launched and then and then we get to see how to actually improve that over time but let's get got to iterate from uh from kind of the beginning and just let's get this in the hands of people so congrats again on this test in production right that's what they say right some people uh but uh great well rj thank you so much for this demo i hope you continue building this and now with that we are ready to move on to our next one so what i'll do is uh brahma we'll have you go and go next but then we'll just take a quick break after this and i'll just have our judges confer on the other chat we have so let's take a five-minute break but uh we'll just move on with uh to the next project with your demo so uh refi alone that's the project name and whenever you're ready feel free to kick off your video can you see my screen or yes okay all right so i'll play it welcome to repentancing this is brahma sen what we're trying to do is solve the refinancing problem the uh taking a loan the fed rate is high or rather low and we like the students particularly take refinance their student loan which is much as a much higher rate we are using react front end we are using have a deposit borrower credit delegation and flashlight features and then we have three contracts 35 policy to track delegates and delegates and one credit delegation and flash loan contract the this is the home page of the application we have many options dashboard creditor delegatey and refinance there are basically three steps the user can deposit fund and delegate the credit and hopefully the delegate can refinance with a much lower rate so if you go to creditor you see that he has 3300 have a token stacked and there are some eighth and then some die so i can choose to let's say put to deposit some die so i like to confirm this and make sure this is paired up quickly from the speed up while that is going on we can also uh i can do the delegate and then so i can do the delegation credit delegation to this and actually before i do it let me verify the amount is the ic that's updated so now if i do the delegate so i got the credit delegation so this should be quick yeah so now i think if i go to dashboard then i can see who are the creditor i'm the creditor and then who has been credited to this the person who has been credited to so that means the delegatey if i log in as a delegate then obviously i'll be able to borrow and repay that amount or and obviously i need to see first how much i've delegated those things have not been developed pretty well but there are some issues and same same with the flash loan but that's basically yeah so now i can do credit delegation and borrow and land that's that's that's the scope of this application thank you that's great um thank you so much for that demo and uh maybe we'll just i'll just kick off by kind of asking was this your first time working with uh with ave and then kind of what made you uh try out this idea uh yes uh can you hear me yes yeah yes this is my first time and doing all my uh solo so it was a little tough trying to figure all these things out both front end and back end but uh yeah it was fun actually i learned a lot but baptism by fire actually what were the um what were the biggest sticking points i'm always curious to hear like as you learned this what what were the hardest parts to figure out or the biggest points of friction i i think this space just my background is id i mean i'm doing iet for all my life but i come to crypto i don't know anything yeah i mean i've been i'd doing it for 25 years but here you know everything is a splitting the hair type of thing you know just figure out all the things and so many different tools uh from front end to back in to understand how when i can get a json file and when you try that json file api file and it doesn't work or things like that nature uh everything is available in the google but it just takes time what is the most fun oh sorry heart no no ken i'm all done i was i was just commenting on like yeah it's all new it's all new to all of us too not just you man so i mean even the fun part uh ken is asked uh it's just making things to work i mean if if i send the transaction and my solidity contract can keep keep that information and put that back in the front end that itself just running simple creditor and delegate delegator and delegate is just flashing that back to the front end that's like uh magic because you know you kind of interact with the contract making call making call to the contract making sure you have the uh the network the id the accounts and all that setup and being passing from face to pace uh you know i think everything is a interesting everything you do one little small step you take is a big leap for me uh last question what what tools did you use i use uh uh solidity to write the uh the contract to reply policy contract and then the credit delegation and uh so solidity for that and then react to just uh so the front end uh and that's that's it i mean of course you know i have a protocol to deposit and die you know understand how how to send eye yeah a metamask so emitter must have a react solidity those are kind of four main things yeah awesome and of course of course of course set up with truffle even even trying to have three contracts compiled at one time starting ganache and all that there's so many other things little things here and there and and understand the addresses for coven to maintain so many other things there so uh so you got to give yourself a little bit more credit though i remember when we uh when we first met you were working on the genie project and you kind of said the same thing you're like oh yeah i'm new to this space i don't really know what i'm doing and now like six seven months later you're making projects all by yourself i feel like you gotta gotta give yourself a little bit more of a pat on the back absolutely absolutely that time i didn't know squat so now right well you just said the same thing right it seems like it seems like you've learned a little bit this time so yeah this time all by myself so yeah it was hard but i did it yeah nice nice work and and and that's like that right there i think is the beauty of the space you know you came in you knew squat and now you're building stuff on your own uh awesome job um i don't think we have time for question but yeah really really just fantastic to see you know you keep coming back to the space and you keep learning and keep building so um really great man awesome awesome awesome thank you thanks again and congrats for uh for demoing and doing this thing by yourself and also for uh coming back and working on more projects so thank you i'm loving the iteration and your continuous thrive to uh to get better at this so congrats um so thanks again and uh with that i want to uh what we'll do is we'll promote julie and james over to the panelists but we'll just take a quick three to five minute break for our judges to just talk amongst themselves for the few projects we've seen and then we'll be back and we'll kick it off with the poolside demo so i'll just have our judges uh mute and turn the video off for this one and we'll just join the other one and now we'll be back in a couple minutes really appreciate everybody's patience all right everybody we are good to go so thanks again for avoiding and then uh next up we have poolside with uh julia and james so whenever you're ready feel free to kick off with uh with your video should be fun awesome thanks so much karthik i'm going to share my screen hello and welcome to the poolside demo poolside is a one-stop shop for new and trending defy assets and this is our team we are both full stack engineers in the san francisco bay area who have been tinkering with ethereum for years james and myself have experiences ranging from y combinator to apple and we met during market make so every day brings a lot of change in defy and data is scattered across exchanges and leaderboards we wanted a better way to organize and quickly get updates on top movers and new listings also as more and more tokens are issued it's harder to distinguish between legitimate assets from the scams fakes and low quality listings poolside provides a place to discover the latest tokens listed on uniswap excluding the scams poolside is also where you can find the tokens with the largest volumes and market caps clicking on a token will take you to a detailed view where you can access the white paper contract address and get a direct quote from one inch poolside periodically pulls information from the graph we get data from the uniswap one inch and avogachi subgraphs enrich that with more info from coinmarketcap and store it into our database when users visit poolside the top movers and new listings are ranked and shown dynamically users can also easily search across various sources and without further ado let's head over to the demo i visit poolside.finance and i see today's top movers by price and volume wi-fi ample link and sushi are really moving today for each token i can see its name and symbol information about the token some categories volume and 24-hour volume change and the price and 24-hour price change you can look through some pages of the top movers you can also use the search bar up top to search for a specific token now let's look at the new listings over 80 percent of new token listings are scams or fakes and poolside uses a variety of techniques to filter out the scams and only show you the new listings that have good trading volume this includes a system for tagging helpful information for a new listing like if it has an identified team or if it's audited we can also flag the listing as a confirm scan here to hide it in this section we have an nft in collectibles gallery here are some avigachi's and you're seeing the svgs being pulled from the avagashi diamond contract on the coven ethereum network we can also look up quotes let's try looking up a price quote for the exchange price between wi-fi and eth and finally a glimpse into the future of poolside sign in with your ethereum wallet to have personalized token info shown to you based on your own d5 trading history so now that we have a solid foundation for fetching storing and retrieving data in our roadmap we also have personalization integration with news and scam filtering token lists detection of noteworthy events in the markets and of course we want to continue gathering data from even more sources so try out poolside today at poolside.finance and please let us know how we can make it even more useful for you awesome thank you so much for that that demo and uh i'll just kind of kick up by saying uh it's live that's all that's amazing so congrats on shipping and three week window too thank you live is amazing guys that is pretty crazy um i assume that since it's live and you guys have been playing with this you've been looking at the data and just i'm actually kind of curious what the most surprising thing or a couple takeaways you guys have around looking at d5 markets and default market data any any any like interesting takeaways from getting so close to all this mustangs are full of scams like it's it's really bad but also so it's been fun to try to filter it and and improve those results so that we actually have a pretty good list of new list things every day you know i'd almost encourage you guys to maybe uh write a blog post or something sharing some of your findings around how you identify these scams because i actually think it's almost a public service to like uh to the community because this is like it's it's sad that's true i'm not surprised here you say that but it'd be great to be great to get your insights as to like how you how you tag and understand what a scam is sure so they can reverse engineer us no um that's a great idea and this might be thinking ahead but also we're really interested in publishing token lists using that standard and basically making it easy for people to they don't necessarily have to visit our website in order to get some of the information that we're coming up with very cool well done yeah this is cool i'm kind of perusing um through the code here a little bit you guys uh you guys are big python fans i give that many thumbs up me as well is this is this uh django or is this flask or neither uh it's it's just python and app engine oh it's just oh hell yeah oh that's great um so yeah so my questions were kind of the same like you know how are you guys picking the tokens it sounds like you guys are doing a little bit of um analytics there i think that that's really cool something that um if you're looking to do some of the smart contract integration to check out is is brownie um for for python stuff it's uh it's it's like a python framework for deploying smart contracts it's really cool but yeah i i think this is really cool um yeah just as he said like i i think this is a service that people need people want people want to know what tokens are scams what tokens are not um even though you kind of made the joke like oh so they can reverse engineer it you know having kind of the metrics that says hey here's here's what a good token looks like um can help people you know figure out what a good token looks like because people always say oh do your own research do your own research but um you know it would be nice if like do your own research means this like here's what your own research should like look like um yeah so i think this is really cool um love to see where you guys are gonna go next here awesome appreciate it yeah and then one interesting thing that we noticed is that there are token lists out there like unit swaps token lists which we can leverage in our um scam detection but then um based on user interactions since we also have the we offer the ability for like admins or certain users to flag um certain tokens as scams we can then um return that data or help enrich the existing token lists out there or scandalous so hopefully it's a vicious uh like a positive cycle yeah i'd love for there to be like extra shame so like not even like this is a scam but like ringing bells of like this is the worst thing ever because i mean there there are so many tokens that pop up and like i think maybe this is like six months or maybe a year ago i don't know time isn't real but there was like this whole thing in like maybe china or like in the philippines where they were pitching hex maybe hex to some people isn't it but uh i mean there's there's like they're out there like in person talking about like all these scam coins but it would be amazing to have like you know i don't know one source or at least like a congregation of sources of like these are the scams like don't ever touch this i think that would be amazing it seems like it's uh it's all part of the plan so hopefully you're working on this and make it easy for us to skill the single page and do everything we want to do with d5 so congrats and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next demo so thanks julia thanks james and john thank you guys thanks guys great project pre-market protocol so uh for our judges we are skipping one um in uh mir is ready to uh to share the demo so whenever you're ready feel free to kick off the video right now you're muted there we go you hear me now yes okay sharing my screen uh looks like we're not getting your audio so would you mind uh oop did i not i forgot to okay i forgot to share my audio they told me specifically to do that sorry about that market protocol welcome to pre-market protocol my name is mayor bank i'm the developer of this project for the market make 2021 hackathon and pre-market protocol is a synthetic asset protocol built on top of uma protocol the purpose of pre-market protocol is to launch and trade synthetic assets representing pre-market pre-launch assets these assets can be pre-ico tokens pre-ipo equities or literally any asset you can think of that has not launched live on the marketplace what are some practical examples of this many tokens have had centralized ious launched uncollateralized on centralized exchanges before the actual token launches live you can see some current tokens with a lot of market interest currently have these ious trading on the market so the goal is to offer these in a decentralized manner using fully collateralized synthetic assets on pre-market protocol first step i'm going to connect my metamask to covan network and you can see we have three demo pre-launch tokens here we have free tornado cache which is a privacy token pre-icp which is dfinity which is a scalability solution pre-clx which is casper labs which is also a scalability solution and if i click on view on the synthetic asset you can see all the information about the asset here the first thing that shows up is the name of the acid the logo the price has not been finalized yet this is something that needs to be integrated with the uma protocol oracle and that hasn't been possible during the hackathon but that's going to be happening shortly after the hackathon here you can see the collateralization ratio is 120 percent you can see the dispute bond and the way that the uma oracle works is to dispute the price you have to put up a bond as collateral and if your dispute is correct and the majority of uma token holders vote that your dispute is accurate you'll actually get back more than you put in and if your dispute is incorrect you'll actually lose money from that claim so this is how the prices are determined uh via the optimistic oracle so you'll be able to manage your position you can see your collateral amount wrapped ethereum your token balance pre-icp you can see your position your collateral supplied your collateral backing debt your token debt your collateralization ratio cr which is very important uh liquidation price you'll be able to create mint new synthetic tokens you'll be able to deposit so you can increase your collateral on your position withdraw redeem you'll be able to view your positions again once the price identifier is completed and you'll be able to wrap and unwrap your ethereum in this case you'll be able to obtain your collateral tokens here so this is how the protocol works behind the scenes we've also been deploying these on the covent test net so these are all uh synthetic asset contracts they're live on covan and i want to thank the uma protocol team for helping me to brainstorm a lot of solutions here awesome thanks for that demo and i feel like there's a specific person in this room who can uh ask really specific questions so that our main person should probably go first i i'll take that as a queue um yeah man i mean i think this is a super interesting problem and it's a super interesting financial engineering problem too of like how do you put the price on something before it has a price which is not an easy thing to do um so i guess i guess maybe i'll ask to start with that just maybe to explain to people that are listening in how do you imagine these pre-market assets would get a price before they have a price how do you think how are you imagining that would actually work that's the that's a great question it's basically self-reference from trading on dexes um so these are fully collateralized and the synthetic assets will expire after the the real underlying asset goes live on the main net so you know that you get some collateral representing that price point so this is a this is something i'd love to see us try to do in a decentralized way to really see if it works um the idea of because it's really cool right of trying to have um uh this asset be self-referential in terms of its own collateralization and then settle the real thing i think that's really awesome um i guess my one other question to ask is like what were your sticking points like this is a hard financial engineering problem what was the what were the hardest things um that you got hung up on yeah i could talk a lot about that but um i mean honestly probably the majority of time i spent on this hackathon was just researching uma honestly um that was a big endeavor itself but after i got that wrapped around obviously there's like a there's an issue that these assets are very volatile and they're gonna have to be highly over collateralized probably like a thousand percent plus so the growth mechanism there is going to be very complicated it's gonna require a lot of uh incentivization mechanisms other than that we had to basically expire these assets without a fixed time in the future so i'm kind of working with the uma team to actually have a decentralized oracle vote to expire these assets which is really something that's being done currently but we're going to kind of experiment on that and see if that's going to work um and there was a few other things but that was mainly it kind of also just trying to figure out like should i do a perpetual asset or should i do a expiring asset and all this different stuff in the beginning but yeah after i after i went through the docs a lot i kind of kind of got it very cool congrats yeah so to jump on that too yeah um this is definitely like a hard i mean yeah he said this is a hard financial uh financial engineering problem so really ambitious that you kind of went after and to tackle this which is which is really cool i'm kind of perusing through your code too i'm curious so it looks like you built your own um kind of script to do like the chain um for the front end i'm i'm curious if you that would that was forked remember oh that was work for mubarak i don't want to take credit where it's not due so okay all right fair enough um but yeah you have to i can i mean i guess enough time but i would have shared my screen to show you some stuff but yeah that basically is just a script that deploys the contract so you can put the parameters there like the collateralization stuff like the ratio what is the collateral as a die is it rapt ethereum gotcha gotcha so yeah so my question is is more just purely engineering um so it sounds like i know the answer based off of what you just said there um is the reason why you kind of you wrote it all kind of in almost more raw than using like a framework like a truffle or like a hard hat um no i just used doomscode honestly well that's what i was saying i was like you pretty much answered it i'll ask it anyways yeah um really cool yeah definitely a really hard uh uh hard problem to tackle so so kudos to you for going after it thanks we will look through no more comments on doing this and hopefully you get to continue working on it and with that we are ready to move on to our next team and that is team open market so um they're being promoted right now and now as that happens we'll be able to kick off with the next demo so uh looks like we lost noel in the transition from attendee to panelists well um i think he may be best to move on to our next team and uh we'll debug oh there we go um we'll just promote well one more time and uh there we go so whenever you're ready feel free to kick off with uh with your video so glad this worked and you're muted just to fyi yeah so i'm doing a um live voiceover over my video perfect so yep whenever you're ready you can talk over your video yep so um my goal was to create a decentralized facebook marketplace so basically um you have to take a small amount of people to message the seller just to prevent uh spam messages so i followed on truffles pet shop tutorial to create my own sort of template but i wasn't able to get the core functionality to work i used kovind test network as you can see i also used a local blockchain but that didn't seem to work as well so in this video you can see me trying to run ganache to create my own blockchain and using truffle as well so um yeah this is my first time creating a decentralized application so i had a bit of so many errors error messages and just things that i didn't understand so running my own blockchain and getting the node server to work again um so now i'll be selecting the localhost and then trying again to uh buying the item on the web page um but unfortunately that didn't work as well so yeah this is a partial project i didn't get to finish it unfortunately yeah now where is uh so thanks for still doing the partial demo it takes a lot of courage to talk about uh what you've done here and also what you weren't able to and uh especially for your first time i'm glad they took on a really large challenge of making a decentralized facebook marketplace and and got almost there so uh hopefully you get to continue building this yeah this is awesome and um yeah i think the first time that i jumped into hackathon just like cold turkey it was not not even close to as good as this um what what i guess what's your favorite part about doing this or i guess like your least favorite part about doing this you don't have to answer either or just one sorry what was the question uh what was your favorite or least favorite part whichever one you prefer oh yeah yeah the least favorite part was looking up online tutorials and most of the tutorials were either outdated or they didn't work at all and i i just found myself just copy pasting uh just blocks of code and didn't understanding uh anything um so i wish there was more um hands-on tutorial where i can well i i could i did read the docs and everything but it was just hard to grasp and everything it just took a lot of time to understand some cool concepts um like i spent the first week just learning blockchain in general um spend the second week understanding how to build apps on solidity and just spend the last week making this application but um yeah i just couldn't get the functionality to work unfortunately yeah no all all echo can and just and kartik right it's like it's it's pretty cool just getting you involved and getting into the space and i guess like you know now that you're you've got your hands dirty with crypto like would you do it again will you sign up for the next hackathon uh yeah definitely sign up for uh second crypto hackathon but there's not many going on at the moment this is uh my friend told me about market make and i just signed up but yeah i wish there were more crypto hackathons or i might not know any other hackathons just tell that to kartik he just needs to do this again like tomorrow please for us to announce the next one so i am i'm so proud of you yeah it's i mean just we also pretty much said the same thing it takes a lot of guts to be like hey i didn't finish it but that's like exactly the type of stuff that you know we want to see because right this also says a lot about the community hey tutorials were a little rough like i was having a hard time like i'm new to the new to the i'm new to the ecosystem so you're basically saying hey you know we as a community need to step it up um and i definitely want to say you know there's there's there's discords there are communities there are lots of resources to kind of jump in and join and yeah it might not be obvious the first time you get in so you know thank you for for stepping up and being like hey i had a hard time i was a little bit confused and you know now when you come to the next hackathon uh you know when kartik puts it on um you'll be like hey you know i had a hard time the first time but now you know i'm better i'm learned i'm smarter but i will say too uh two hackathons are going on right now uh eat denver and eat india if you want to check them out if you wanna you wanna keep the ball rolling um and then i'm sure the the next global is right around the corner because they keep putting on you know fantastic event after fantastic event so you know thanks so much for for putting this on for stepping up and being like hey i had a hard time uh and getting a chance to just like give your feedback and and yeah just you know kudos all around um kudos all around yeah i also realized it was a steep learning curve um just getting started was the hardest part and making like a full full stack application um yeah this one could add that don't don't let this don't let this like stifle you though right like if even though this was a little hard uh if you there's there's tons of discord communities where if you i'm sure if you jump in or jump on stack overflow you say hey here's what i ran into here was my issue what my experience is the community is more than apt to to help you out and wants to see you be successful here so awesome and and looking forward to to the next hackathon here sweet thanks guys also um email me i would love to chat more about your experience and talk about like what this first time is and sort of like audit actually i'd love to know what sucks and so we can sort of like you know put that away and then try to bring up more like optimize seo on some things that are good like maybe like an austin griffith uh video would be better but uh my email is ken at ethereum.org i will just put that in here in the chat um but yes please please uh so happy that you did this and this is awesome man yeah thanks man appreciate it i think patrick already mentioned this but if global discord exists after this event as well and there are hundreds of developers hanging out and uh there to help and comment on it so just if you're ever stuck or any technical help just post away your question and it will be answered so uh thanks again and now with that we are ready to move on to our next team and that is aztec interactive nft so uh looks like you're all here whenever you're ready feel free to kick up with your video it looks like we're not getting the audio would you mind uh oh um so you stop this straight a screen share and then check the sound off box again cook vera and i work on the nfts on the landing page mario bryson work on the dab and alan vega design the game mechanics for this project we built a dab for an experimental game working with interactive cryptocollectibles or nfds so every collectible has a custom function inside the dap depending on the nfts we hold on the wallet the user can move like rooms attack enemies or solve puzzles it works with a dub built with react metamask and ipfs we mint seven nfts with 3d collectible cards and we fetch their data from the eipfs and also we detect the nfts on the wallets on the user's wallet to enable point-and-click interactions you can check the demo for this hack on same bit.mx slash aztec where you will find a landing page to access the dap by clicking the button like jab and once you get to the screen you can connect your metamask once it gets connected it will reveal the nfts on your wallet only and the actions that you can do with these nfts since we have the only the basic nfts we can only move through the temple and solve some puzzles but now we get to this point and we get an obstacle we get a dark room uh where you need the torch to light it and as we don't have it in this address we will switch to another one that has all the nfts for the for this game and you can see the difference once we get to the same room that here you now can light the room as you have the nft with the torch so now we can like the room and continue our quest to the net to the next stage and in this stage we will use another nft we will use the machete and t in order to attack the enemies so by using the machete we can complete this stage so the point for this hack is to show that every nft has a different function so what we learned on this market make hack 2021 well we learned to meet 3d cryptocollectibles on erc11 contracts we learned to give in nfds a custom web 3 interaction we learned to fetch nft's data from user's wallet and we learned to use ipfs to a store and fetch web assets in the future we want to get a full game with 3d assets get an ar implementation for public parks or open places uh develop uh puzzles to learn interim interactions and prevent financial abuse on newcomers and finally someday introduce defy enable rewards so if you are interested in aztec interact nfts you can support the project by getting the nfds on shop.aztec.mx or visit us at 7bx on a twitter and all our social media channels thank you for your attention awesome thank you so much for your time it was great there's a lot of creativity in there and uh and uh i'll let our judges kick it off but uh i'm super impressed by how nice and cool and critical it looks those nfts are wicked those are crazy cool who made those thank you you made those those are so that like the that was sick that was like 3d holographic like that was so cool um yeah so it's a really cool really cool project uh i was i was just kind of perusing through your code a little bit it looks like um most of it was kind of done on the front end so you're taking these nfts you're putting into this front-end game and you're just going um and so anybody can kind of spin it up i i think i think the whole concept is really cool it's really fun you clearly have a fantastic knack for for the art style here because those stuff that those entities are super sick um what was what was the inspiration for you guys i wanted to to get into this was it a learning uh was it a learning thing for you guys because it looks like most of the code is front end um yeah what was what was the inspiration to do this well we have been some time explaining with all the protocols and the good stuff on and we get to this point uh in the past where we try to digitize uh the digital skills for users since uh here in mexico we have a lack of income skills so we want to create some experience that facilitate the newcomers to understand what crypto collectibles are called a crypto asset i work with with the blockchain so this is an attempt to create a simple game to to familiarize newcomers with the usage from the to the wallet uh understanding and what interactions are in there when interacting with other protocols or tokens and differentiate the between the pointable tokens so that's that's the main the main objective of this project nice yeah really cool and what did you actually deploy the uh the is on what platform do you guys use uh well we are deployed on variable we use uh we created on blender and we try to get uh something uh familiar with uh or our culture we are from mexico so uh we tried to to get on the car something that could get like uh something i i i get on like i was like a child when i collected different cards and from new generations i think it probably could be some uh good point to start um let's start to know how the very cool nice work guys we believe it's a little bit easier to relate because it's it's kind of a twist here because we try to not only enable this for newcomers but also give it a twist to to the gaming a little bit in this case in the game you're actually you own the assets that you buy in regular gaming obviously you just buy it it's the game you just can use using in the game in this case you own the assets you can trade them in the market if you want you can put them for sale on routable or open c you can exchange them with our clients and the idea here is try to develop a bit more try to bring people from outside to uh designers so they can design their own weapons their own things inside the game and maybe the same community start working to develop more the story of the game we're just putting like the very basic but that's the idea and make it in a way which is relatable you don't really have to be into crypto already so you can get into the game it'll be more like a ramp for for new people and in a kind of a relatable way at the end of the aware generation that that grew with this collectible parts so we kind of put it in a digital digital way so they can collect them if they just want to have the cards or they can actually use them in a game inside of the game our idea also was to enable like rewards inside the game we obviously are not that advanced yet but inside the game the idea is that if you explore you are able to complete some some things then you will get a reward in a form of maybe another nft or maybe even a token that you can change to to buy more nfps or you can just sell them like play with this all this tokenomics so we can apply it in the game and and and bring new commerce to the ecosystem as well only all in one package let's say are you going to keep working on this well yeah the idea is to keep working on the game the the truth is that we are a very small team and there's only like one real developer who's like good on on smart contracts and everything we're not really that advanced on developing but yeah we would love to we already have like a discord we're trying to to make a little community and start growing it and and from there see if the people get interested maybe start developing more about the story add more nfts and see how the market responds to to this type of new game on the theory yeah that'd be awesome i went to the website and i can't it won't load uh so maybe i just go directly to wearable i'm i want to play this game i'm going to be [Music] the website is not charging we can double check that um but it should be working we checked it before but if not again convertible the nfcs are available on openc as well um the thing is that in writable we were on the craze last year like when everything was booming with dryable and all the nfcs and we got kind of lost on the whole boom but we're trying to we saw a lot of nfgs that they're just creating art and it's really cool but we wanted to to give it a function to the art that something you can do with it absolutely and and maybe that way you can actually be incentivized to do it a little bit more but it's it's in the process and yes we're planning to to keep working on awesome well congrats on online and i hope that you get to finish this and make this available for everybody else to try out too be sure to put this in the feedback and showcase channel so all of our attendees can also play with this so perfect we'll appreciate that thank you very much we are ready to move on to our next team so uh that is project tbtc deposit redemption service i'm a little bit sad to tells the judges that the big mac index was not able to make this work from a technical side so they've been moved on to tomorrow's session but we'll be sure to send you their video so you can enjoy it on your own pace so uh uh daniella whenever you're ready we'll promote you and uh we'll get you to kick off with your video all right now i seem to have the ability to share screen um right sure sound hi everyone at the east global team and market made hackathon before starting i would like to thank you all for organizing this event which has been a great opportunity to learn engage with the community other members and put some code together i'm part of a community called keep network which runs the tbtc protocol so we bring btc to ethereum and when you are an operator in the network and someone enters or leaves the system you get a fee and at some point due to the collateralization you also want some deposits to be redeemed that would work as a bounty so that the user that redeems the tbtc for the real btc to get a reward say about my project i relied heavily on the scaffold eve video by austin it was a really great help and i use this i use this framework as well to build this tiny ui for my test so i try to focus more on the functional parts of it so if i give a brief summary of what did i use to build this it would be i used scaffold ease and i tried to use chain link so let's go through the contracts that i've built one is a trustless asset which uh this would represent the tbtc since i was gonna assume i was running this locally and i have actually deployed this to coven um i didn't want to replicate the full uh tbtc system that would be a new rc20 and it would be burnable i'll later mention why is capturing the event important the second contract will be the broker system where operator in the kit network posts the reward and where the redeemer will come and claim his reward part of claiming would be validation from the oracle that this address was the one who performed the iridium action or in our sample scenario the burn of these assets my third contract would be the one that i built using the the chain link workshop video tutorial about using adapters and consuming an api and restoring the result in on chain basically we go to e3 scan and get the logs for for a certain event on a certain contract and when it finds the address oracle will reply on the fulfill function with the response so yep those are my three contracts just want to show here where i deployed my contracts to coven so if i go to broker system and i go to the ether scan there is my contract is deployed three hours ago i built a small function in the heart conf on the oracle so i would just click geron oracle fund oracle and it would send a link to this address um from the deployer account which i had previously um requested link link to my caa which is my deployer so yeah as you can see it's all deployed on kovan not functional but i think it's something that it would be good to have in the network actually one of the main issues that i found was that bytes32 which um just i had to like find out how okay how can i get an address out of that maybe exchanging job that will return an address i'll summarize this this project you will read other contracts logs event blocks via an article so that you can give awards uh trustlessly this is my short proof of concept i know this is not complete and not really looking to earn any prizes just i did it mainly for learning so thank you so much again all right guys yeah thanks for showcasing watching so i'll let our judges kick in and uh we'll go from there yeah um awesome like i i saw i eat scaffold pull up and i'm like oh austin griff that has the biggest smile on right now he is loving this he's got his bow tie on um so i i think it's great you jumped in you're like hey i'm going to try this i'm going to uh i'm going to work with chain link and i'm going to work with e scaffold to get a front end up i think that that's great um a couple a couple tips so there is a there is a chain link scaffold branch that you can actually flip to and kind of paste some of the code from there um but yeah i think um i think this is really cool and i'm gonna post into the into the channel here uh the chain link developers discord anytime you have a question with with chain link um feel free to pop in there and be like hey what's going on and in fact maybe we could have a quick chat um after this because i'd love to hear more about your experience kind of where you struggled kind of like the same as uh ken was talking about before um you know where you struggled where you where it made sense it sounds like you had all the pieces um you had all the pieces there you even you know you were on market.link grabbing a bytes 32 job um from an oracle so um it sounds like you had all the pieces and then maybe we can just figure out you know where the lines weren't quite connecting but um yeah i i think this is really cool you kind of you jumped into something new um you worked with uh scaffolding and austin griffith is is super happy and uh yeah i i think this is really cool and uh and awesome for jumping in and learning and presenting here so nice work yeah thanks bud uh i actually didn't know that were going to be here in a judgement so it's great that i can also ask you questions yeah so like first one i was a bit confused about should i use adapter or external adapter and then since the price bits actually work differently they asked too many different uh notes the answer i was just thinking how can i get mine to also ask different notes just not just only one uh so yeah this is the main things but i'm happy to tell you more about my experience but i definitely enjoyed working with changing and as you mentioned it's scaffolding it's great awesome yeah yeah let's sync up on the discord and we can chat a little bit more and uh and hear about your feedback because yeah it sounds like you got all the pieces um for for for most projects that are just kind of testing normally they'll use just like one node just to just to test and then once they're looking to ramp up then they'll add more nodes then they'll make it more decentralized because if you're trying to coordinate with a ton of nodes it can be it'd be a little a little overwhelming at the beginning so uh but yeah we can chat more so really really ambitious nice work thanks for your feedback great well if uh if there aren't any other questions or comments we are ready to move on to our next demo and uh we just have a equipment for our judges so we have one team from the other group that got moved over to this one so what we'll do is we'll have them go last and for that you just have to refresh your page later um so not not right now but after this but uh in in the meantime we have uh buy now payleader crypto so uh i think uh team if you can raise your hand uh we'll promote you that's uh kane and boris kareem and uh if we have you here we'll kind of get you set up if not we'll just kind of see what's uh what's happening on the zoom side but we may be ready for the other team which is raj uh kind of coming so while we're looking for the other one we'll just have abhitrage go and for our judges this this will not be on on your sheets yet so i'll just recommend you just write down your scores and we can refresh and see the other one later so avatars will promote you in a second and whenever you're ready feel free to kick off with your demo sorry i lost the unmoved button all right i think we're good now hey everyone my name is andrew schmitz and today i'm excited to present to you my hackathon project built with my partner william called avitraj so simply put arbitrage is a dashboard focused on interest rate arbitrage so within ave you have a variety of different stable coins in a variety of different markets that you can deposit and borrow for different rates and having all these options opens up the ability to borrow assets at one rate and deposit them for a higher rate effectively utilizing your borrowing power to earn passive yield uh and so the key feature that we wanted to build around this is allowing users to enter a leveraged arbitrage position in a single transaction using a debt and current flash loan um so why is this useful uh really boils down to capital efficiency on behalf of the user and the protocol uh so for the user leveraging their own using power unused borrowing power to earn additional yield is obviously an advantage and for the protocol increasing the borrowing utilization i would thus increase the deposit rates and hopefully encourage more deposits so now let's take a look at the interface uh so the first thing that you'll see on our website is the best overall arbitrage the first one is across all different markets and then the second one is just v2 exclusive we separate these because v2 has the ability to leverage flash loans for up to a 5x boost and then we also give a table view of all the different stable coin rates and then in the portfolio we give people a breakdown of what their borrowing power looks like by market and then also show them the collateral and the deposits that they have ideally in the future we'd like to implement all of these different actions but for now avitrage is the currently implemented one so here what you can do is select an asset to borrow select an asset to deposit in any one of the markets i'm going to select true usd because this asset can be used as collateral in version 2 thus is eligible for leverage and so the leverage happens automatically on this left hand side uh so what's actually happening here is that the user would take out a flash loan um swap it into the true true usd uh deposit this as collateral and then they can just incur this flash loan is dead and this all happens without the user even having to know what's going on i'm actually not going to execute this because we used the graph to source this information uh it wouldn't actually even show up if we did execute it but i can show you what the the smart contract output looks like so we were able to enter a leveraged position with 228 of debt and 288 of collateral after we executed this flash loan uh swapping usdc for die so back to the presentation uh future things that we want to do obviously refine and test the smart contracts i'll finish up this interface for the leverage arbitrage uh and then add all of the other actions so that users can really take control of their position and effectively have like an alternate interface to avi they really wanted to use it and then the third thing is insurance integration so because all of the risk of this is contained within jave i think it would be really easy to integrate insurance against your positions for this so that being said i encourage everyone to check it out thanks for listening that was awesome um i'm so excited to jump in uh so question i i think you said that it's not on maintenance right not yet that is correct so actually will can speak a little bit more to exactly where we are on the smart contract side uh but on the front end so we have sort of the interface built currently it's not really plugged into our smart contracts we're still trying to optimize those make sure we're not going to fail or swap with super high slippage before we deploy anything cool that was actually my next question about uh gas and slippage um but i would love to hear about i guess here from will is he here all right he's just being promoted to uh panelists so i should be here hey guys well what's going on can i before i i want to jump in and also say i love the name guys it's like the best name ever it's so good i love the name and i love the design and i think it looks great um and then after you answer ken's question i got a question of like what's the current what's currently the best um uh arbitrage and why do you think it's going to persist with this tool the name goes completely to andrew yeah i actually got cut out when the question was being asked so can you ask that again please um so my i used my first question was it was mainnet and then uh kind of what andrew was saying was he'll you'll give a status on where uh the current the project is currently um so i assume when you guys are ready to go to mainnet and then have you thought about gas prices and slippage that's yeah okay um so gas prices and mainnet are gas prices and slippage are the main blockers from mainnet um plus since this was a hackathon thing we haven't assessed the um the attack service at all so that has been dealt with before we even think about deploying to mainnet um so for our demo we basically just do a blind swap on unismock in order to do the uh leveraged deposit so that will incur basically as much leverage as there as the user's position size and as the source of liquidity so that's um we'll need to put more thought into like whether or not we would do some sort of routing on unit swap or just use another liquidity platform in general and then in terms of gas um so using average actually gives you a pretty pretty big gas um savings compared to just trying to manually borrow and deposit and borrow and deposit as many times as you would do without using arbitrage and so there's gas savings just from doing that i feel like everything ave touches is like secretly gold uh the name is fantastic um and i couldn't help but notice were you in the demo did you also do um use like heath scaffold as like a as like a v1 of the front end of this yes i did so i've actually this is the second sort of web 3 project i worked on uh and the first one that i integrated was with truffle and just getting the interface of connecting a wallet uh took me like three different pages and a ton of different configurations uh scaffold east was super easy work straight out of the box uh and once we do get the time to like really polish these smart contracts it'll be so easy to integrate them into the front end oh i love it yeah so i don't have your code in front of me but i saw like the little um the little gas box the bottom left and i was like oh i know that um which is great so this is your second one yeah i know doing front end um there's a couple of different tools there's like create react excuse me create youth app um is a really good one if you're looking for like a great way to build like a front end on top of a one three project but yeah i think what you did you're like hey like i was did you did you try like drizzle or something out before yes exactly tried drizzle before you yeah you were like oh this is a little bit tough so you move to east scaffold um i think that's great you know you're being tenacious in the web through world kind of bouncing around and and this is what you'll see with uh with different protocols too hey maybe one protocol doesn't work so you move to another one so i i think that that's great but um yeah if you haven't checked out create youth app i would say you know maybe that's the next step uh for for looking to build a a solid front end but yeah this is really cool and nice work thanks amazing well if there aren't any more questions this is uh this is a wrap this was our last project or uh for today and i want to congratulate all the teams for kind of going and showcasing what they've done the past three weeks and uh i just get more and more happy when i hear that people are going to continue working on him after this so that's that's the part that excites me and uh so congrats to all the teams i presented and uh thanks again for uh to our judges who uh spent the last couple of hours giving feedback and comments and sharing the excitement with with the teams in us and uh last but not least i want to thank hank and andy from uh our volunteers who actually are the people responsible for making this run super smoothly they've been doing the work behind the scenes so a lot of you on the video are not going to see this because they don't have their videos on but uh if you want to turn your videos on just quickly wave hello um we want to just make sure that you uh people know why and how this was super smooth so thanks again and uh with that i'd like to wrap up today's judging session and we'll resume with the remaining 100 projects tomorrow so thanks again everybody and i will see you see you tomorrow and not tomorrow we'll just have you join the other chat uh for a couple minutes awesome thanks so much everybody thanks everyone
