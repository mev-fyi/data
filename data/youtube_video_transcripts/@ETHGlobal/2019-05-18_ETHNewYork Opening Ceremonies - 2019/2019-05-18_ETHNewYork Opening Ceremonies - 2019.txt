so if you see me around feel free to come up you can ask me any questions I'll see if I can help you if not I can direct you to who can so this is eath New York after a long boxing week I'm sure you guys have been to so many of the other events we had some incredible things going on in the ecosystem we need a serial consensus token summit fluidity rare AF Dao if I meet ups cocktails Dappy hours so much stuff right and to round it all out the most important thing we're gonna be doing this weekend is what really matters bid ling right come on come on this is exciting this is this big stuff I want to do quit thank you to new lab that's the space were in right now this is practically the most beautiful co-working space I have ever seen in my life I would be impressed if any of you have seen nicer so please give a round of applause for them for hosting us this weekend cuz space is absolutely absolutely gorgeous it is perfect for this kind of event so let's talk a little bit about East New York put this down here eath New York is a event for bi eath global youth global is an organization that runs events like this worldwide with the goal of onboarding new users to the etherium ecosystem to the web 3 ecosystem and the things that makes this special we have some core values that really guide us in that and that is build what you want right so we're not telling you this weekend what to build how to build where to build this is all about you your inspiration your ideas your motivations right so you get to build whatever you want here this weekend we value showing over telling that means while presentations are great show us the code show us your app show us it not working if it doesn't work right it doesn't have to but we want to see what you've done what you've been building right that's what's really important learn mentor and grow alright so this goes out to the fact that not all of us are in the same place in our developer journey some of us are more advanced than others some of us are newcomers so what we're really looking for this weekend is for those of us who are more advanced to help the newer people in the ecosystem to learn hopefully we can all grow mentor one another also as a hackathon this is not a conference we will be having talks of course but the core thing that we're doing here this weekend is we're building so please enjoy but build build build additionally something that really guides us in the end is these events are for the ecosystem at large you know there's a saying a rising tide raises all ships actually they say boats I think but you know rising tide raises all boats and the whole idea here is is that what we do here helps the entire ecosystem so we're not just building for ourselves here we're building to try and improve the entire ecosystem that we all work in something that makes this really special this year is that this is one of our most experienced field of developers ever right so what that means is we have 500 plus total attendees 32% self-identifies as advanced developers nearly 50% are intermediate developers and we have 15% beginner and 6% who are new to aetherium so we're really going to be looking forward to those of use out here who already have extensive experience in the space to really help out those who are new to the space right give a lending hand help mentor give advice take on new comers we hope at the end of this weekend everyone gets a chance to build adapt ship some product show us something new something else that is also really special about this is that we have attendees here in New York from all corners of the world so this may be Eve New York but we have 60% 66% USA 11% Europe we have Canada Latin America Africa Asia Australia all the continents listed USA and Canada continents but everybody's here anyway and of course please give a big big props to New York City 26% of us from right here Big Apple New York City so we're really really really excited about that so I want to give you a thank thank you right now to our sponsors to our attendees to our hackers to our to our judges our mentors to everyone here that's making it as possible to new lab again you know this is going to be a fantastic experience for everyone and it's really critical that everyone here has been putting in so much of their work and the hard work so we are expecting amazing things this weekend from everyone so give us one more round of applause for all the people here in the room everyone here participating this is really going to be exciting [Applause] coming up just a few things we're gonna have a talk by Vitalik deuteron co-founder of aetherium on a recent post he talked about on a collusion then we'll have our sponsors give a few words and after that I'll be a backup here to give you some more information about the logistics for this weekend so with that please give a round of applause and welcome to the stage Vitalik [Applause] thank you cool it's my face yeah so um today I'll be talking about collusion so c1 get right into things there's been a lot of interest Auriemma recently in things like decentralized governance daos your CMO locked out here get coin grants the eath trader donut thing some Chinese platforms doing doing experiments and tokens for content curation and rewarding content and there's like a lot of these different projects that are just appearing everywhere in the ecosystem right and on the one hand this makes me really happy to see this kind of experimentation happening because the use of this mechanism design and experimenting with incentives and new kinds of institutions as one of the big things that I've been excited about people using etherium for since day one and it's great that things are finally happening you know yay Moloch da get Quinn grants yay all of these things so good now on the other hand there's a lot of challenges uh involved in doing these kinds of things and recently over the last year we've seen some of the pitfalls and have come in to come into action right so on the Left we have a situation that happens on the EOS blockchain about a year ago so basically there was this scandal where they had discovered that a bunch of the EO seblak producers were basically agreeing to vote for each other and paying each other to vote to vote for each other and there was this kind of cartel of these fairly well-connected block producers that were like basically supporting each other and kind of cementing their they are control over the ecosystem and on the right side we have one of the recent Aragon votes and I believe this was the votes where they were voting whether or not to basically forbid themselves from supporting polka dot and the understand basically what happened here is that well no one but the great majority of know was just one guy so bribes and plutocracy you know are probably two of the big issue is that how that you can see with the centralized governance systems and with online content incentivization systems you get you see a lot of the same effects and i'll talk a bit about why it's a kind of unfortunately quite challenging to create systems that avoid both of these fairly nasty consequences so here is a simplified summary of something that a lot of people try to do right so a lot of people try to say oh i am going to create a decentralized platform for incentivizing content creation right so i'm going to come up with some kind of source of income and this source of income could be just advertising could be just pumping an ICO token could be whatever and coming up with a reasonable and actually sustainable source of revenue as a separate problem and then they wants to take that revenue and basically come up with a mechanism to distribute it to people who create good content right so this could be articles it could be code it could be documentation like pretty much anything now what kind of mechanism are you going to use to actually and a figure out which content creators should be rewarded how much right so this is a common scheme that often gets implemented so basically you have users and users have coins and every user during every period and we'll think about the concept of a period abstractly like it could be a one second it could be a block could be a week it's could be anything right so during each period every user has the ability to make one upload or it could be the that they have the ability to make many up votes the math works the same way if a user has any coins during some period then whoever they give the upvote to gets a reward of n times k right so basically you have the ability to tip people but there's a limit to how many you tip or possibly if you make many tips then your your hand of allocation gets put between all of them and if you tip someone then it doesn't cost anything to you but it gives them some money right so it's just voting on how much money the recipient should get and it's simple for every for every vote if you vote with n points they get n times K for some constant K so here is a challenge with many of these systems well basically any system that works in this way has written the optimal thing for a user to do is to just make a post and send the money to yourself and that's it right so every it's optimal to send the reward to yourself and if you are willing to send the reward to someone else instead of sending it to yourself then you're basically giving that other person the reward that you would have gotten so if you're willing to do that then why wouldn't you have been willing to just donate the money to the guy and even in the absence of the mechanism so if it's optimal to send money to yourself everyone sends money to themselves the system just collapses into this equilibrium where everyone has an interest rate if K K per period and that's basically it right and the system just becomes useless so everyone following so far who's not following okay yay Congrats on raising your hand so thank you like it's it's good people should raise their hands don't be so lucky so here's one way to patch this problem right so we have this mechanism where you can vote on on just pieces of contents that other people create and if if they get votes then they get a reward so instead of making the reward just a linear function just be proportional to the number of coins held by people that vote for you we're gonna make it be a super linear function right so what that means is that let's say for example if $100 of token holders vote for you you might get one cent if $200 of token token holders vote for you instead of getting two cents you might get three cents if $1,000 worth of token holders vote for you you might get 50 cents right so the number goes up but then but the amount that you get per dollar goes up some more dollars you have now you might want to ask well why do people do this right so the idea basically is that this subsidizes voting for posts that are popular more than it subsidizes voting for yourself right so if you have a thousand dollars of tokens and you have a choice one choice is that you just make a post and vote for yourself you're the only person voting for your post and let's say you would get 10 cents but then the other pod option that you have is you vote for some other posts that you think is actually good if you think it's actually good then many other people probably also think it's actually good so there's probably many other people donating to it and so if the function is super linear then that means that the amount if more people already donated the extra amounts that you would add to the poet's and the amount the poster gets with every dollar that you vote vote is gonna be higher right so if you vote for yourself you might go up from 0 cents to 10 cents if you vote for some other posts that's actually good it might go up from 80 cents to 95 cents or two dollars two dollars 20 right so there's a benefit to voting for things that other people vote for so this is interesting and you can kind of see how it improves on the status quo right basically your choice are your choices are give 10 cents to yourself or give 20 or 30 cents to some other post and so instead of it just being donating you're sort of donating at a three-to-one ratio right at three to one leverage so we can see how this tries to improve things here's the problem with this approach first of all it subsidizes plutocracy right so what this means is that wealthy cartels so people that have lots and lots of money raise your hand if you're part of a wealthy cartel okay as a proud member from wealthy cartel you can gang up with your other friendly wealthy cartel members and you can just throw a bunch of money on just a fake post that doesn't do anything and but you'll have so much money that you have basically as much money and that you throw on the post as tens of thousands of people legitimately voting for a post ordinarily would and so basically you give yourselves money at the the same three to one ratio right so if for a normal person if they vote for themselves they would get more money back at a ratio of say what 0.01% per period you might get 0.03 percent per period so you as a proud member of the plutocratic class get a higher interest rate than everyone else yay now so this is one problem right so wealthy cartels get the full benefits of voting for themselves everyone else does it the second problem is it can still get circumvented by bribes right so basically if you make a post then what you can't then what you can do is you can bribe other people and you can tell them if you vote with a thousand dollars of coins for my post then I am going to give you 15 cents now if they had just voted for themselves they would have just given themselves $0.10 so your bribe is a better deal for them right they vote for themselves they get 10 cents they vote for whatever you tell them to they get 15 cents so they'll do that and then you get a lot of people voting for you and so for every one of these thousand dollars that vote for you you might get get a total of 30 cents so you get 36 times whatever number of people you bribe pay 15 cents back to them and you get 15 cents pure profit yay bribing our bribing attacks realistic right actually let's take a poll let's say there was a there was a some carbon vote happening on some hard fork and someone offered you a bribe and they would basically say if you stake ether on supporting this hard fork I don't know let's say it's like issuance reduction or something then if they for everything for every 1000 eat that you vote they would give you a bribe of 1/8 how many people will take the offer some people would see what if it's an issuance increase how many people would okay see still a few right so it seems but you can kind of see why some people think that bribing attacks are not especially realistic because people think that they're kind of good citizens that are not going to be susceptible to them right now the problem is that well it doesn't have to be advertised as a bribing attack what you say is oh here is a staking pool and if you stake for in my staking pool with your 1000 then I will give you one either so who here will join us take involve never go see yeah so yeah this is basically what people did right so this is something this is the thing that happened in lists a couple of years ago every member of the whiskey weed accepts the China delegate for some reason must share 25% of his or her foraging whisk so the voters every week so every member of elite must vote for other members you see where this is going right so these things definitely exist and they definitely like systems can very easily collapse into these kinds of equilibria and it's often pretty difficult to prevent it now can we try to mitigate plutocracy with identity systems right so one question you might ask is well if we go back to the mechanism where you if you donate or if you stay vote on some post then that post guest gets more money the more for your vote the more other people already vote for it so we go back to that mechanism right and we try to get this benefit that that if you vote for something that's actually good then lots of other people vote on it so you get this fan of higher leverage and we try to make it actually work and we try to make it work in a way that's not plutocratic by having an identity system right by attempting to kind of detect who unique humans are and instead of the formula being based on the total number of coins we make it be based on the total number of humans now if you take this mathematically to the logical conclusion then you basically get quadratic funding aka Oboro radicalism aka CLR which is what get coin is doing already all right so it's a very reasonable path identity systems are difficult so on the left here we have am a guy who has basically has a whole bunch of phones on a rack and all of the phones are constantly getting charged and all of the phones just have software running that just keeps on pretending to click in parens kind of automatically participating in various applications so you can do this stuff right you can try to this kind of gather up a whole bunch of like of identity is in some way and you can just run the software on a bunch of machines and you can just kind of pretends to be a community yourself right so you can show off try to find some way to gather up a few thousand identities then you start voting for the same posts and if you have enough people voting for them then you get access to the same kind of plutocratic benefits that you that you were able to get before when we were talking about systems that were just based on money now on the right we have this wonderful whoops I'd come by acts calm that's BG yacc yes we are you can just go and buy Google accounts and you could go and buy Twitter accounts so you can go by reddit account so that's great so now I checked and github accounts do not seem to be available on buy XCOM so far so did Qin grants is safe for now there's definitely people selling dick would get Quinn grants on the dark markets Raiden sorry selling a github accounts on the dark markets like they're basically there are very specialized and highly professionalized channels for these things to happen and people are doing it right there's just people that bought up thousands of accounts and there's people that just pretty much make it their job to sell fake crowd engagement but how else do you think the you know the ship when people have more Twitter followers than we do um weirder approaches right so let's say we're not happy with github accounts or reddit accounts because they can get easily attacked well there's been a bunch of like really interesting and crazy work that's happened over fairly recently about trying to verify identity is anyway that's more kind of local and decentralized right so on the left there is this concept of pseudonym parties which is basically this standardized way for people to get together in person and attest to each other status as a real human being TM and you know they would just go to go go meet up together in one place how these parties exciting each other's keys and you can broadcast these messages to a blockchain and you can through any of this real world community that would be seeded from some kind of set of trusted identities figure out a list of people that corresponds Rutte kind of real people in a way that seems to be fairly difficult to exploit so now this is one interesting approach that people have been thinking about another interesting approach that I've been seeing people doing recently is making a token curated registry so you can just apply to be classified as a real human and token holders vote on how human you are and either you're human or you're in the list or you're not or they don't vote for you and then you're you're declared to be a bot so there's experimentation happening around this if you haven't come up with ideas for hackathon projects then trying to come up with some kind of medium secure way of just coming up with lists of kind of probably unique human accounts is definitely an interesting a project that I would recommend thinking about because if you create a list that is even has medium security where the cost of getting of an individual getting multiple accounts is like at least significantly harder than the cost of going to this website and getting a bunch of Twitter accounts then that's something that would be really valuable for things like get coin cor things like these some content and sensitization tools and all and all of these other things that people are trying to do so that's one thing that you can do and like you can combine together decentralized approaches you can try to do centralized approaches things like you know a government ID verification phone number verification or whatever the goal is to basically like we're never going to get anything that's perfect but we wants to try to kind of push your way up the security level to the point where these identities are strong enough that you can do some interesting things without your application just completely being taken over by bought by attacker as the moment they decide they want to attack it so this is one thing that we could work on right so that's I about identity issues now why is avoiding bribe and photography attacks and really bribe attacks specifically so difficult right so it seems like for a lot of these applications like especially things that have to do with public goods things like governance things like incentivizing on internet like all of these things it just seems so hard to create mechanisms that can avoid bribe attacks when it seems relatively not that difficult to create mechanisms even for things like blockchain consensus right like in creating mekin safe and secure mechanisms for incentivizing public good seems to be an order of magnitude harder than creating proof of stake mechanisms now why right like what's so weird and and difficult that's happening over here so cooperative game theory is hard right so now people talk a lot about economics and making unrealistic assumptions and often like people talk about things like perfect information and perfect rationality and how certain kinds of mechanisms break down if those things aren't perfectly met but there is one way in which one big assumption that economics and game theory often make about the world which is actually like even more horribly broken and false that people just seem to still continue to take seriously and that assumption is basically non coordination it's that the world is split up into discrete agents each of which are exclusively thinking about their own incentives now you might think right that well that's just a worst-case scenario if people can cooperate then is it that good what that will give you even better outcomes than you get if people were selfish it turns out though that even though I know everyone in the world perfectly coordinating with each other would be great partial coordination situations where some groups of people can coordinate better than others and you have these mechanisms that people can coordinate to exploit mechanisms actually gives you worse results than if we sometimes then if communication between people was completely impossible and this is definitely this weird counterintuitive thing but the math basically says it right so there's this branch of cooperative game theory that has to do with taking seriously the possibility that subgroups like groups within the group of participants are allowed to communicate and coordinate and advance their own interests together so in standard game theory where we have a bunch of agents and every agent makes decision separately every game has an equilibrium and it's possible to engineer games that have equilibria the target a very wide variety of outcomes right so there's things like second price auctions generalized vehicle or gross auctions there's many mechanisms for incentivizing contribution to public goods all of these things bubble apply and the like if you look at the math and if you take all of the assumptions then they work well in cooperative game theory so in this version of game theory where groups of people are allowed to collude and advance their interests together it turns out that much more instability as the norm right so on the bottom right I might have this example which is this majority game that basically says if you could get together a majority then you can grab the entire reward and you can distribute it among yourselves like as you want right so you can think of it this as being a kind of very crude representation of say many kinds of political processes so at the beginning we'll start with a fair division we have three players and each one of them gets a division of one-third one so we have one-third one-third one-third in the next round a and B get together and they're gonna say hey how about we exclude C and then we're gonna go up from 1/3 to 1/2 so they do that and then in round two they have they both have 1/2 this outcome is better for a and B so a and B cooperate to make it happen and see us oft of nothing now in round three a gets even more greedy and a goes to C and says hey have you been feeling oppressed lately well how about if you enjoyed and even you were cartel with me I'm gonna get 2/3 and you are gonna get 1/3 which is still better than zero and we'll cooperate to make this happen a and C are two people and they get together they make this happen a has 2/3 he has 1/3 B as well with nothing in round four um B comes along and says hey see how about you know how is cooperating with you well I can I can also help you feel not feel not oppressed and unlike that nasty evil a I'm not gonna take two-thirds only want one-third so your word goes up so how about you cooperate with me instead so now B gets 1/3 C gets 2/3 and is often nothing does anyone here want to guess what round five is going to look like hint it involves a feeling oppressed hmm so basic so basically like kibou in these game theoretic environments we are corrupt cooperation and kind of partial coordination are possible like you do get more instability right and this fact kind of manifests itself in many ways so collusion in public goods funding right so let's suppose that there's some public good so this public good could be even just writing technical documentation and writing some piece of software it could be cleaning up the environments could be anything now suppose that there is a community of 10,000 people and suppose that will kind of make a mathematical model where for every $1 that gets spent on the public good each one of these thousand don't 10 thousand people would get a benefit that they value at one over a thousand dollars so ten dollars of total benefit right now who here thinks that it's better for everyone so if this public or gets funded okay so still need to explain better right so who here is ideologically opposed to public goods okay so they're basically right you have these like let's suppose that each of these 10,000 people puts in $1 right so each of these 10,000 people is gonna put in $1 so there's a total of 10,000 dollars that gets spent right so each of these 10,000 people would benefit 0.001 per $1 so we're gonna multiply 0 0:01 by 10,000 and so each of these 10,000 people get $10 of total benefit for where they each spend $1 right so who here thinks that this is a good deal okay yeah so here's the problem right in reality like we don't have a list of public goods that get handed that get handed down to us from the gods of Satoshi that we had that we know we have to we have to find right we don't even know what the public goods are often so let's say there's something that's X and we don't know is it a real public good or is it a fake thing pretending to be about to be a public good so suppose that we have a game an economic mechanism and you could think of this as being like markets voting like anything in this category where each individual can influence how much money gets put toward X and individuals have the ability to make two signals one of their signals causes X to get one more dollar and the other signal causes X to not get one more dollar right so we can say that the let's say the cost of making a signal that that causes the spending to go up by one it needs the acquiring if there is a cost right there it could be it could be cost less so it could just be a voting mechanism but if there is a cost the cost can't be more than 0.001 because 0.001 is the amount that each individual gets from one more dollar being spent on the public good right so if for example the game that we're talking about is just giving individuals the ability to donate money then the cost of giving of giving X $1 to an individual is $1 so nobody's going to do it but if we have one of these games that we talked that we talked about things like for things like incentivizing content then maybe we can set one up so that the expected cost is 0.0001 and then people would do it but then here's the problem right if we have this kind of game then a fake public good producer someone who's producing something that's not a real public good could just bribe people 0.002 dollars to for them right so basically in order for these mechanisms that determine whether or not a public good gets funded it gets funded or how much to work there needs to be and people need to have the ability to kind of contribute at really high leverage but if you give people the ability to contribute at really high leverage then someone can bribe them people following so far great so plutocracy is also really hard to build or it's a beat right so let's say you do not have identities so all you care about is money and how much money people have then a wealthy individual with 10,000 accounts or with just a lot of money that so I think of him as a lot of money split up between 10,000 accounts could submit a fake public good and this fake public good would just give money to themselves they would pay whatever the fee is the kind of signal that this thing is a public good and if it's less than 0.001 per unit so less than ten dollars in total they could just give themselves ten thousand dollars right so in any situation where a legitimate public good would get funded in any situation where the leverage is kind of high enough to overcome people selfish this if they're if the thing is actually legitimately a public good that's that serves the distributed community then a single wealthy individual can just pretends to be an entire community and exploit the thing to hell people following so far okay so basically if a system is secure against either bribing or plutocracy then it seems like the system just can't funds genuine public goods and if it can find genuine public goods then the same kind of leverage that allows it to actually fund public goods also allows it to be horribly exploited so this is hard right so two ways to resolve this one of them is collision resistant games and there is that even though making games that are collision resistant is harder than making games that are not collision resistant it is still possible right even if the areum's proof of stake is a fairly corrosion resistant game like there is no way for people to kind of collude together to just give themselves more money right it's and it's also a game that's I that just listens to how many coins you have it doesn't try to kind of measure identities so prediction markets or coercion resistance security deposits or collision resistant shelling games so things like auger things things like these some decentralized Oracle's are fairly corrosion resistant up to the 50% level so there definitely are some mechanisms where they do not require any notion of identities they can be purely coin based and where they don't run into the same collusion issue is because they don't can operate in the same way right so here's an example governance mechanism so this is like a sort of future keylight way of building a tower that I haven't seen I haven't seen tried yet but the idea is basically they take a voting system and just augment it with a little bit of a prediction market so that you try to make it more secure against bribes so here's how it works so if so if you have decisions for every decision you can vote in favor of the decision you can vote against the decision if you vote with n coins in favor of a decision that vote also has to come with an offer backed by collateral if blah blah blah to buy n more coins at a price equal to 99 percent of this over the price of the of the tau token at the start of the vote if the coin wins right so basically if you vote for a decision and that decision wins your and the price falls you're responsible for bailing everyone else out and if a terrible vote wins and if someone tries really hard to bribe to make a terrible vote win then the winners are basically required to buy everyone else out right so the idea here basically is that the reason why this is not vulnerable to bribe attacks is that if you try to bribe someone to vote for something that's really bad for the Tau then they're not just responsible for any of the tiny impacts that they have that they have on the decision themselves they're responsible for basically their Shi their share of this big drop this big drop in price of the doubt so kin that the decision would cause and whatever that price is the people that whatever that price decreases the people that voted for it have to cover it so you can do things like this right I mean you can also do security deposit mechanisms so for example if you want to have a doubt for verifying humans then one mechanism you could have is one that says so first of all for a new human to be added to a list of known verified humans some number of any of existing members and this who have been verified have to vote for them and there exists a challenge mechanism right so there exists some game where you can claim this account actually isn't a human or that these two accounts are actually the same human and you can resolve them with an augur Oracle you can resolve them with Queiroz which i think though doesn't get enough love decentralized Court mechanism with a kind of multiple layers of voting just like probably plug into Quiros for this and the voting isn't it kind of just dumb vote and forget about it right if you voted for a human that gets rejected you personally get penalized and so if someone tries to bribe you to vote for them instead of just having to bribe you a really tiny amount they have to bribe you pretty much pretty much to cover the entire penalty that you would pay so much more secure in this way right so basic so that's one way to one path to try to solve these issues right basically you rely on prediction markets you rely on security deposits and you try to make it so that voting for bad things actually is costly for you personally so this is one strategy sometimes though you can't do this right if we're talking about rewarding online content creation then there's no way in which like if you vote for a post and it turns out that post is bad like there's no feedback mechanism in with with which the facts that that post is bad like really can get detected by the system and used to penalize you so here's another approach add coercion resistance so basically we can try to prevent bribing by coming up with infrastructure that allows these mechanisms to be run in such a way that you cannot prove how you participated even if you wants to right so be it's not just making it anonymous it's not just making it hidden by default it's that even if you wanted to prove how you participated you can't so this is actually even harder than me than doing Ziggy snarks right and I actually made a post and feel free to kind of photo this to remember the link on kind of minimal anti-corrosion infrastructure if people want ideas for a hackathon project also highly recommends trying it just go and implement this basically the core idea here is that there is some operator and the operator could be centralized it could be a decentralized multi-party computation thing and the operator is trusted for the corrosion resistance property but not for any of the other properties right so if the operator is compromised then you can bribe people but you still have the guarantee that the vote has to proceed correctly nobody can cheat in any other way basically the idea is that users broadcast their actions to the blockchain and they broadcast their actions encrypted with the operators public key and signed with their team now users also have the ability to send messages that change dirty and this is really important because if you have the ability to change the key that your future votes get verified against then if you look at any single vote you can't actually prove whether or not that vote is valid right because you could have changed the key before so it was this mechanism like basically users who lose the ability to prove how they participated but then the operator publish does the C case nor can publishes the outcome at the end was a proof and so the operator still proves that the operator gate gave the answer that actually is the correct answer of applying all of these votes right so it's secured against operator maliciousness and the operator proves that the calculation is correct but individual participants don't have the ability to prove how they participated and so if you try to bribe them while they could your money and then just vote the way they were going to vote anyway so this is the other way to Ajay to solve these kinds of problems right so use cases for this regular voting quadratic voting get coin CL R's content curation content incentivization all of these things that people wants to make decentralized things for so thank you and enjoy [Applause] awesome thank you so if anyone wants to go out there and build a dhow get a puto cracy going crazy some money for public funds something I didn't do before I wanted to just do really quickly at East New York hashtag East New York if you guys see anything cool happening going on please post social media is the lifeblood of everything now so that's really important our sponsors play an important part in the role of making these kinds of events happen without their support the quality of the events would not be the way it is all their help mentorship and excitement just adds to the experience so I would like to give a big shout out to new lab and we have a special guest hey guys I'm Sean I'm the CEO here at new lab I actually just wanted to say hi welcome you to our house thanks for being here and given this is your home for the weekend I thought you give a little bit of insight into where you are and how the hell it got here so you're on 300 acres of Navy land it was open in 1803 and at the peak of World War two seventy thousand people worked here in the Navy Yard they actually had trams throughout Brooklyn that brought people directly here and directly home after they worked it dropped down obviously to about 10,000 people that work here today but at the height of World War 2 we were building some of the most important ships to the Navy here and actually in this building itself and so the building you're in 85,000 square feet four floors ninety five foot ceilings it built the USS Missouri the USS Arizona came out of here which is at the bottom of Pearl Harbor now I think but was actually the prototyping facility in the machine house for the Navy and so a lot of the steel work you see here is original from back then and a lot of the equipment they used so thank you for being here thank you to these global team for making this happen thank you to the wine team for kind of facilitating and translating from time to time and foam is a member here and they're part of the programming here over the weekend as well but we just wanted to welcome you to our house thank you for being here and we're just thrilled that we're part of this all weekend I'll be around with a small dog you'll see me from time to time if you got any questions grab me or grab anyone with a new lab hoodie and we can help make sure the weekend goes well thank you thank you you also have a number of other sponsors we're gonna come up first I'd like to call up Sean from new RAF Sean so instead I'm gonna call it tux from new cipher hey everybody yeah so some of you may have heard of this already new cipher some of you may have may not but to give you a quick rundown of some things that are happening I think I only have this one slide yeah okay great cool so we have $5,000 in a bounty pool for hackers so in case you don't know what new cipher is new cipher is we were a cryptography company we build cryptography tools and protocols for decentralized applications and various other applications you may want to build our main product offering is what we call our proxy re-encrypted Network just give you a quick overview that proxy encryption allows us to transform ciphertext encrypted under one public key to be decrypted under another private key so Alice can transform cipher text from her key to Bob's key without ever having somebody decrypt it in the middle we have a decentralized network for that one of our other product offerings is called new fhe it is currently the fastest and most efficient implementation of fully homomorphic encryption in the world that you can go find out more information on the link there also we have our discord so if you're hacking on our application please join our discord please ask us questions please and please break our stuff so we can help you figure out how to build it please you know build on our stuff we'd love to see it also I just want to touch on some stuff that new cipher that the new cipher team really cares about and this is you know privacy and security and things like that and and so for privacy we believe that everybody has the right to be to have private communications and that privacy is a human right it's unconditional so if these kinds of beliefs and ideology interests you we are having a demo right across the hall and right after this at nine I don't know if you've seen our demos by that flute guy from our team but we will be playing some music it'll be quite intimate we're gonna be having fun together demoing our stuff showing you how to keep your own D AB stuff secret and keep our sorry how to manage secrets in your own D app so we can help you guys stay more secure and build more even more decentralize privacy based applications so yeah right across the hall 9 p.m. see you there bye great now we'll have jack from scale come up [Applause] all right so hey quick round of applause for Dennison ok I'm with scale we are extremely committed to helping etherium scale so we do that with elastic side chains the skill network is comprised of elastic side chains so scale plus etherium allows you to take your DAP and run at over 2,000 transactions per second in each side chain run full state smart contracts run storage at sub second blocked I'm so excited for you to use it this weekend come check it out don't have too much time to go into this now but please come by later if you want to learn about how the elasticity and the network works but a mixture of smart contracts and containerization allows you to essentially run either small or large chains at at high speeds so a thousand nodes and the skill network can run over 8,000 independent block chains that can act as side chants all right so we think there are a lot of important qualities and running layer to network speed cost security one of the things two things not so often talked about though our user experience right we don't want to have a drag on the end user because of the speed we're getting on the back on the back end with the layer 2 solution and also decentralization like let's not throw decentralisation away for the you know the value of having some greater performance so okay two quick announcements first one we're excited that we've set up our foundation and we are decentralizing ourselves so and we've open source of code so go check it out on our github we're excited about that and also we're launching storage today so you can run storage in a sidechain with e vm on scale so launched today you can use it at the hackathon come by and we'd love to show you how it works so now let's talk about bounties okay we've got 5 500 daya Ward's 1 1000 I win er we are just looking for amazing creative use cases where you're using smart contracts so we're not too concerned about super high throughput about doing you know crazy stuff with scaling but do something cool let us know we can help you we've got a team that's here late and early and we're just excited to help you hack so and come join our discord we'll set you up with a scale chain so and come by the booth as well we're doing a workshop at 9:30 Christine Perry who's somewhere here and San Cloud Co with scale will be leading that so thank you let's have fun thank you next we have Pete from Thunder core [Applause] hey everybody I'm Peter Bella with thunder core let me tell you a little bit about us we are an EVM compliant blockchain EVM compatible blockchain we've got 1,200 throughput transactions per second we are provably mathematically proven secure and all of that stuff but here's the really cool thing that I want to share with you guys our co-founder was is was the founder of play dome which at one point had about 700 thousand users per daily active users before he sold it to Disney and so thunder core is like almost purpose-built for games and so we want to see a bunch of games built on thunder court today so here's a couple of bounties that we have best stack combo so create useful applications using thunder core with other protocols that are sponsors today and so best cooling and the best game or DAP and then privacy solution and so please join our discord go to the eath new york website and then our discord is there and we've got a couple of developers here they can answer all of your questions and so looking forward to seeing what you guys can build thanks great next we have Moe from cellar Thank You denistoun hi everyone I'm Moe from Center we are here to help you to build interactive extremely low-cost and secure applications on top of the theorem we are a layer to scaling platform currently ming-lee focusing on using the technology of generalized stage channel we have a tech talk later today but you know the stuff we can build looks like this oh this this use this should be like an interactive game so that you can actually build very interactive game and instant zero fee payment on top of seller if you have any use cases for that it's probably better a very good fit for you and the interesting thing I want to share is that if you use setter you probably can if you achieve this kind of a user growth trajectory this is like one application building on top of cellar running on a paper money test now but we you can achieve like 56 times grossing five months s so and you know in 67 different countries so for the bounty side we are having to kind of a bounties one is called C gamer we're gonna reward one son a $500 to the best game build using our SDK and also C builder award which is gonna be $1,000 for whoever actually uses that it's gonna be splitted at most to two teams who uses Center SDK to build any kind of application and if you're like tired of building and I want to try to find some fun we have some great activities happening our boost this is the king of coma Co you can actually try to use some applications that build already on top of the seller try some interactive games and try to like win some great award and also you know the the t-shirt like I'm wearing now you can get them by downloading our app and just get them by paying 30 GT which is like literally a double fake token so yeah and in terms of the event we have two events tonight we have a workshop that is talking and teaching about our SDK in terms of the interactive gaming aspect and also you know the instant payment aspect when - tomorrow at the afternoon I'm gonna talk about the lessons we learned when building and pushing out this extremely large-scale state channel networks so thank you guys and happy building thank you now we have Lucas from wireline big round of applause everyone's good to be here I'm recognizing a lot of faces from the crypto circuit and it's kind of unusual to have my house keys in my pocket speaking on a crypto stage so welcome to New York everyone and happy blockchain week so wireline we've been working on this for a couple years we've been in stealth and that's about to change and coming coming weeks we're building the protocols and infrastructure for privacy preserving censorship resistant internet we've been working on compute identity messaging and payments infrastructure and we'll be sharing some SDKs soon with everyone but I guess the message that I'd like to share with everyone here the builders is that this year we're gonna be part of a fairly important historical moment we're actually gonna be able to build applications without any central processing or data silos and that's the first time we're gonna be able to have done that in history but you know the trouble is that there was this privacy paradox out there people say that they want privacy but they're not really willing to pay for it people price it at about 1/100 of what they say it's worth so we have an uphill battle I think everyone here in this room and we need to we need to think about how we're actually going to get privacy-preserving applications in the hands of the mainstream and I think we've got sort of two ways to think about attacking this problem and I don't think they're necessarily going to be sufficient so on one side of it we can we need to do advocacy so I think that's necessary but not sufficient you need explain to my to to your mom and if any of you can explain to my mom what's going on in Facebook and the amount of surveillance that we have that's that's going to be quite important but the trouble with with that approach is that we're gonna end up with something like gdpr in Europe where we have this legislation that's very hard to enforce and it's actually gonna benefit the hyperscale providers like Facebook and Google because they're gonna be able to comply with it or or rather play a cat-and-mouse game around it and the startups and the small companies are gonna have a hard time enforcing it on the other side of the spectrum the other strategy we have is to create more choices for example we need to create privacy preserving Google Docs and and privacy preserving social networks but the trouble with that is that these markets aren't really rational markets you think about if you think about anything that's priced zero and this is a lot of good research done by Dan Ariely a behavioural economists when things are priced at zero we make very irrational decisions we don't optimize for our welfare so it's going to be it's necessary but not sufficient to build alternatives to the platforms that are out there and but so the message I want to leave you with was what I think is sufficient is that we need to design products and applications that actually leverage privacy to create some kind of utility some kind of a profit that haven't been done before and we have some ideas around that but the so my message to you guys is this is an open invitation come talk to me with your idea of how we couple privacy with commerce somehow privacy with some utility wire lines a well-funded organization we're investing in projects and we'd like to invest in your idea around that thank you do you need from the graph Thanks so I just want to provide some motivation for today and this weekend um so we all have talents and potential but not everyone can monetize their talents fully because the world is full of closed opportunities at senseless barriers that prevent us from contributing our best selves for many people the world is closed and we are going to make it open this it imagine if anyone in the world could be recognized for the skills that they have and have access to global open markets or they could get paid with their worth on their own terms this is the new economy and this is what we need to build the trick is we need to be focused on solving the right problems and we have to have patience all right this stuff is gonna take time this you know voting governance identity reputation the types of game theoretic problems that Vitalik was talking about those are the building blocks and with them we will be able to rebuild the entire economy to be fair and open so that's why we're doing what we're doing at the graph that's why we're building infrastructure for web 3 and we've got $5,000 in bounties for this weekend I'm giving a workshop tonight at 11 p.m. and really excited to see what you all build so that's not all we have a number of other sponsors that we want to give a shout out to so we have 90,000 plus dollars and prizes from our sponsors so we are extremely thankful to have them here and you are too you can check out the prizes there even new york.com slash prizes so without our 33 sponsors none of this would be possible so I want to hear a big round of applause for new cipher and scale for thunder core cellar in the graph for wire 0 X air swap the consensus dapper off chain labs and wireline chain-link Matic mysterium network finance labs Kotaku uma you in the back see those claps loop ring fort Matic in Fura foam are weave Qyburn network well this is impressive we have this many sponsors how many hackathons have as many sponsors right ENS Taurus quick node Aztec 1kx kickback I knew it I knew Aztec hell of a stack Aztec everyone round of applause nervous reciprocal ventures UNICEF pull up the Bounty's network whoo come on what's the Wi-Fi this was really one right eath global Wi-Fi password just Biddle it you have to clap for that one that's fine joining the discord for announcements and mentors I think there's a mentoring station over here probably so they're gonna be round you can pester them in New York calm slash chat there's so much happening we have 45 Plus talks all night long not all night but like pretty late food there's an after-party not right now cuz you have to be hacking schedule is on East New York comm you can check that out if you're brand new to the theorem tomorrow you can learn from scratch with surge round of applause for sir someone's good right tomorrow from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. if you're worried about pitching if you're you're worried about getting up here and talking all of you sign up tomorrow for a one-to-one pitching help message to follow in discord so get on that discord if you want to know that again respect the space this is an amazing space please we need to leave it in the same condition we we found it in if you are seeing an odd hackerspace the non hacker spaces are clearly marked some of these are people's private death
