foreign [Applause] [Music] can you put on the headphones now sorry for the delay yep please give me a clap if you can hear me thank you [Applause] all right so hello everyone my name is Alexandra and I'm from the even spot team uh thanks for attending our Workshop today and we are going to tell you how to improve and simplify the user experience of your Dev and also how to go cross chain let's start all right so um why did we decide to create ether spot well obviously we faced some issues that we would like to be able to solve for example the complex web 3 user experience for average users let's imagine that you are an average crypto user and you want to take part in some stake in program let's say of climateau and it requires to take claim tokens which are based on polygon but you currently have only talking synopsis chain so what options do you have first of all you can go to The Exchange right and just purchase some tokens but at the same time you you already have some crypto tokens in your wallet and why do you need to purchase more so another step you can for example find some bridging Solutions and try to bridge your tokens but again it requires additional steps at the same time when you are interacted with different blockchains you have to switch RPC Network in your wallet or even edit so it's also quite annoying and at the same time um when you perform many transactions you have to sign it every time after each transaction well um I can say that like for not Advanced users it can be a short stopper because you have to perform a lot of actions another example let's say that you would like to perform the cross chain swap and you need to have a gas token from the destination chain otherwise yes you can complete the cross chain swap but then you will be stuck because without gas tokens you are not able to operate on any blockchain another thing is that on board into self-custody is hard at the moment so recently I reinstalled my Chrome browser and I realized that I need to submit seed phrases to be able to get access to my wallet but then I totally forgot to save them and like I lost 12 phrases I lost access to my wallet and so there is an option to recovery I lost my fonts but fortunately it was just you know one of my testing wallets and I didn't have a lot of tokens there but in any case it's quite an unpleasant situation and I think that any user can can be in the same situation and also it's generally accept that hard wallets are more secure than any other wallets but you know that they are not quite user friendly and at the same time not all of the users can effort to get these wallets so obviously these are not all of the issues that we faced with but I believe that they have uh the most relevant moment according to the market situation next one so when we have a solution for you it's easy spot it's a spot it's an account obstruction it's Decay that can deliver a frictionless web3 user experience so it means that users don't need to switch or add RPC networks in the wallet at the same time it enables Asset Management on multiplying chains and also you can see here the screenshot of the tweet from an instancer and here he shows how a typical defy app works today and at the same time how he thinks it should work and actually the second picture is what if the spot can provide you with with our batch transactions if the spot can batch several transactions into one and for users it will be just one click action and um let's look back to my example with cross chain swaps well I mentioned that users have to get some gut tokens on the destination chain but with easy spot it's not needed because users can pay for transactions with any token it can be stable point or any other token all right and also if the spot can deliver an easier on board into self-custody for your users so they can get access to the smart wallets where the social media accounts or for example email address and it means that they don't need to set up this seed phrases keep them somewhere and there is a recovery option as well because they can just get access via their social media accounts as well uh and the smart wallets are more secured and hard wallets because you can simply lose the USB stick itself so and you will load your fonts next one well it is what has a lot of outstanding features like transaction batching sponsored transactions meta transactions multi-chain nft support vieton and off-ramp support and it's without kusd for users up to 1000 Euros per day and we have quite a friendly environment for developers we have updated documentation you can find it in our website and in case you have any questions you can just simply reach out to our Dev team for example on Discord or Telegram and they will be able to help you but I will share the links later at the same time if the spot supports um more than 15 FM compatible blockchains and it means that your dap will be able to capture cross-chain liquidity and you don't need to deploy your dab on any chain separately uh and the star of our presentation is the Builder react component uh this is this is a component for Plug and Play integration so and I'm passing it over to weakness yeah to present it so many thanks Alexandra for explaining the it is for SDK but then now we are going into the Builder so SDK Builder is a react component that we have built on top of the SDK to Showcase you what the SDK can do so uh so SDK Builder is is uh actually a two step two lines of code which is required for the the SDK to I mean for the Builder to uh integrate it to your front end so as you can see you can just import our npm package and then just say ether spot that's all so all the things that we have said like smart wallet all the uh interactions will be done inside the ethersburg itself so what you need to do is just write ether's word tagline that's all so so it's very easy for the Developers for yourself so that's that's how to integrate Builder but I'm I'm going to talk about the features that they're there in the Builder itself so first is multi-call transactions multi-call transactions as you can see by the name itself it's like you know calling multiple transactions into one so uh it's a smart way to actually submit the transactions so what I did on on the uh this one screenshot is from USD I'm I'm actually swapping to highway and it's for two usdc and uh again I'm actually starting the multi-call and the away is actually pre-selected because you are actually receiving the away and how much you're receiving is is actually on the uh this one offer that you get over here so if it is 0.03 away then 0.03 is the remaining one which is which is already there then you can actually use that point zero three on the next step itself without even executing the transaction on the blockchain so so so this one can be done via multi-call transactions so uh one of our uh testers actually did it and uh you can you can see the uh uh transaction details where he actually sent two usdc but at the end he received 2.7 usdc on the same chain itself so he got like 0.7 usdc more than what he sent so it's it's actually kind of you know uh if if you know uh persons in share marketing and all you it's it's actually uh a trading that you gave and you can get profit out of it also but this is this is just and is this one um exist an example but then uh it's it depends on the luck and the the share markets like that time the offers was like this so he got it but then uh it it depends on the luck guys so so this is Justin this one illustration but then you can do a lot more way into this itself like an innovation um so next one is chat sessions in this uh the rear component uh when you actually sign one transaction I mean when you sign from Key base to your contract call to for deploying the smart contract you are just signing it once and you are actually accessing it for 15 different chains if if you actually kind of switch Network also it's going to access that the other chain without even asking you next sign so it's just about that um so we have actually built a climate of example for you to illustrate Custom Contract interaction so stake into a schlima from any any of the assets which are there in x-time or BNB or or whatever the thing is so first what happens is you you have to select the from asset and then eskima is automatic selected because it's it's cream of contract so um the minimum amount is 0.04.4 USD because the uh you need to pay the gas fees from the usdc that you are going to send you you don't have to actually have the native token on the polygon itself you can actually kind of this one execute the transaction on polygon itself without the native gas token so so it's it's on the polygon you are actually submitting meta transaction meta transaction is nothing but paying cash fees via the usdc itself so the next one is um I'm going to tell you the steps that are involved so from usdc on Genesis 6 die I'm actually kind of uh this one building a cross chain to usdc on polygon first that is the first step and then from polygon it's actually uh staked into clima to get eskima so so all these steps are actually one single click away so that's that's what is the clay model example but then I I would say this is the custom contact interaction that you have to give so for example you you would have the contact API yourself which is which is there in the blockchain itself and you would have the contract address which is also there in the blockchain itself what you need to do is just register the contract in the SDK itself so that you can actually uh call the method on under that contact execution for example uh for let's say staking or yield protocol or something like that so you can call the contract function using this this these steps alone so what you give what you get at the end would be the transaction request which is like 2 and data which needs to be sent that's all that's all is is the steps for the custom contact interaction so next one is um so we are we are open for Innovation so if if you feel like you can you can do something else also you you are you are open to actually uh submit a PR under this website I mean uh this GitHub a repo itself this GitHub repo is actually open source every every thing that I've talked about before is actually available inside this git repo itself so you can just scan the QR code so get the URL and then you can actually see the source code of of the package itself which I have said before so that's that's really helpful for you for the developers and I think that you can you can actually do it pretty well so this is ether sport playground ether support playground is is something that you know I I we have built so that we will demonstrate the SDK examples um in the website itself right so you can you can just go into the website and what it does is um every functionality that that it is there on the SDK has been Illustrated with the code examples itself so so you just need to create an SDK inside it and and you can test it and so it is also available on test Nets so please uh test it once and then you can do whatever you want so we are we are also running Bounties in this hackathon so the first is best full-fledged SDK implementation which is like um it should actually contain most of the uh important SDK methods that are there so that that will be um uh that will be served as an example for full-fledged SDK implementation the next one would be best protocol interaction best protocol interaction into Builder is something that custom contact interactions is just as I said uh claim out of example it's it's already there on the Ripper but you need to actually build some other thing so for example uh so we actually have 15 different chains I mean 15 plus chains that we support So any of those chains Dao can can also be included in this itself so that's it so that price money is 2500 USD uh the first one would be 4000 USD and the last one which is best integration of the Builder which is which is all frontend guys so so if if you feel like it needs something else rather than you know cross chain uh simple Swap and uh send uh this one same functionality which is included on the Builder component then you can actually build some something else and then show it to us so that's that's included and that price money is 1500 USD uh next is we are actually combining with le5 with uh the bounty to to select the best project for that collaboration so that ideas would be so Leaf 5 is actually integrated with cross chain swaps and the single chain swaps single chain swaps is like you will have the provider inside uh just see if it is leave five then that is that is actually kind of valid in this boundaries for crosstain everything is valid because Crossing we we have it leave five integrated so so that's that's all available the first place is 750 USD the second place is 450 and the third place is 300. so the next one yeah so you're here you can obtain the place uh also I wanted to mention quite important point I guess that we are not new best in sphere and um we have quite a solid background and blockchain development and we've been working on uh ether Sports since 2017. so and uh is a spot is audited by consensus diligence and we have battled battle tested trusted and reliable smart contracts so here please feel free to scan this QR code you will get all the links that we used in this presentation also uh you will get all the links to our social media networks please feel free to join us there and also we have a booth there uh if you would like to have a chat with us or you have any questions that you'd like to discuss please feel free to come to our booth and um let's build together thank you yeah so any question guys uh just one minute uh questions yeah I think so yep go on guys yeah we just wanted to understand how configurable is just one minute one minute sorry yep yeah just wanted to understand like how configurable is that um volume volume excuse me can you just increase the volume that's fine yeah right now yep yeah I just wanted to understand how configurable is the entire SDK uh how comfortable is the entire house sorry configurable configurable okay so uh so the thing is we are all open source so whatever the parameters that are there as default is is is is actually changeable right because we are open source in the first place and uh the SDK configurations are all available on the docs that if you need uh for example for crosstain you will have like from stain from asset ID and all that will be there on the docs itself so please please please just look at the uh playground and the documentation for all the details or if not please come to the booth I'll I'll settle all the doubts that are there I mean on the this one config regulations and all sure so any other questions yeah all good please first answer if it's all good it's just the internet guys thank you thank you very much [Applause]
