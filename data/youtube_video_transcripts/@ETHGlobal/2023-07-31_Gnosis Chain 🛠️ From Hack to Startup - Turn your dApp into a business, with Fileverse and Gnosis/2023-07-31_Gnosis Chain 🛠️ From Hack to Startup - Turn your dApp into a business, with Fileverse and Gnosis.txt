foreign [Music] what's the difference and benefits compared with other evm chains and the second part more focused on the business and convert results of your hackathon an MVP we should have on the end to convert to real world business and as uni in in unicorn I hope so let's start from the technical side oh sorry it's not not updated okay so my name is arseni I develop a relations in the Moses chain it's a list of my useless achievement I previously was a founder of use startups uh alumni of ultimate accelerator and part of developer dog equipment collapse so and I tell you why noises make makes sense to work first of all it's not just evm chain it's a it's a layer it's established sister chain to ethereum with Rich history we work in already approximately eight more than eight years um one was the most closest UVM chain to ethereum we have the same we say we have the same distance we have the same structure we have back and chain with our native token for voting it's a gno and but in additional but in execution layer uh we have X die as a token which you can which in which you pay for transaction fee uh die is a X die is just Bridget original stable coin dive from ethereum so uh it's one of the reasons why transaction costs are now chain very very very cheap oh and in consensus layer we have a genome as I said um we also have SDK Bridge we call it Hashi if you check our Bounty platforms they have a few ideas what will you can build on hasher to be eligible for this bounty and it's give us opportunity to use agnosis chain as a data data availability layer or as Layer Two to other chains and based on this technology also work in the agnosis pay if you so as I said uh the main idea of uh interact of Hashi and other interability chain interability protocols this allows you to convert the UVM ecosystem with separate Channel layer 2 to something like Cosmos if you're familiar with this system uh it's a we because of real pretty old chain we have a lot of uh projects which we can partner participate to can integrate to dot implement the same functionality as we already existing and it's already shows that we have users and tvl on our chain so uh and some useful dogs uh because we have M chain we don't you don't need to learn something new you can just use a ordinary ethereum tutorials to work and some Focus not specific we have in separate documentation uh so useful links by the way could you lift your arm if you're a developer with previous experience with ethereum okay sorry I not expect that you're not experiences sorry for this app in any case so for using cow for using our chain for rapidly developing we provide you a file set and file set we can have a tokens not for not only on for test net also for my net the the price of transactions so extremely cheap so one dollar will be enough on my net to deploy maybe 10 contracts uh we also of course if you have Explorer of course free RPC in chain list we have already button which you at uh our testnet and my net to metamask and my contact if you need any technical support or advices so if we go if you want to talk about how to work with no diagnosis if you already have experience if with the other evm chain so you can you you just add this configuration to your heart config and this starts working nothing special the same with interaction from Smart contracts you can just work with our chain like with order ethereum or polygon and other Chains It's not as important about the criteria which we expect from the project is first of all it's uh deploy smart contractors chain it could be test net it could be my net with a choice only uh for you uh provide provide some interaction with front end if you have front-end to interact with smart contact which deployed on noises chain and have a few confirmed transactions as approved as a smart contract is working not just deploy it and be ideal if you have working demo Point bonuses we are not limiting you to make a public goods or tooling so but if you can show you that your project allows you to earn money it will be really cool if you can show you how how you're going to make it uh also will be cool if you make a competitor analysis will be shows that you are ready to continue work on your project uh in in future we and we will support you in any case and uh perfect if you also can make a customer research during the hackathon uh as a few technical ideas which you can realize um first of all is falset monitoring service because a lot of chains have problems as a file set is empty and not and nobody can look after this RPC note monitoring service and load balances like cloudflare but for nodes uh tool for migrate the app from one evm chain to gnosis chain here and of course you can make it from noises chain to other chain or any one event chain towards eventually and some node Improvement as example you can extensive get balance RPC code and add support of returning balances or receipt 20 tokens as a bus if you're talking about our native breach uh which we call Hashi you can spreading you and we have lack of tooling so you can take the tooling of the bridges and connect it to hasha so it could be of chain actor or just explore or proof of block header or SDK and or message or query message as a bonus I can provide I share with you my hackathon guide which I use during the works it's a pretty short it provides you three heated tricks how to effectively use a hackathon and key points as a start from the problem not from the court to make less features but that will be work use the sponsor as participant as the first users it will be give you a correct feedback and advantages compare with your competitor and hackathon and biggest value it's not a price it's a connection and letter of intensity is potential your customers and of of course have a fun because it's you spend your time you need to get something from this video type so that's all what I want to say from The Tackle site and I want to hello hello everyone uh so now that we got a bit of a technical overview I'm gonna go a bit into what kind of dabs you can build on gnosis chain specifically one that I developed with my co-founders we're called filevers um it's basically a non-financial Dap we really wanted to show that okay it's time for the new generation of crypto projects that are not necessarily Financial that are not based on speculations or other so ideally this is a dam that you'll show your grandmother and tell her hey blockchain can be useful so this is the QR code just Twitter because you're all Builders I thought that I would just start with a bit of a journey just tell you a little bit first about myself and then why we started this and how so for myself I'm a second time uh founder in crypto in 2018 I created a AI crypto app called alithia it was quite successful and now I'm fully focused on fireworks and on the side I'm doing my PhD on AI and cyber security uh at Oxford don't hold it against me um now when we started fireworks it was a year and a half ago and what we really wanted to do is just start with a problem there was one clear problem in our minds and it was one of the remaining points of centralization in our space you go today to talk to any project any doubt any company individual in crypto even hardcore decentralization fans and you'll find that even get going down or the ethereum foundation Foundation itself are using notion are using Google workspace are using Microsoft Office which you know amazing ux but there are a lot of problems with those apps now what problem I don't see a problem a lot of people would say that immediately so let me tell you a little bit about those problems so online collaboration today is extremely predatory and centralized you have no privacy you have no right to exit which is one of the requirements of the gdpr and you have no modularity so our specifically for web3 natives you can see that everyday online activities so no not like swapping on decks which is you know you do that maybe three four five times depending on how DJ and you are um there needs to be an experience in crypto where every day you log in or you go on a app and you do stuff that are useful so today most people are locked in in those centralized Services um there is very little widespread utility for people that are just exploring for the first time web 3 and one of the worst things is that when three content is stored in centralized Services somewhere in California and on top of that your first experience with the crypto world is high-risk transactions by the ux and high barriers to entry for most people so uh because you're all Builders let me tell you a little bit about our journey we had this problem we wanted to solve it we went on git coin presented our idea and people loved it so within the first round we we became one of the most successful grants on git coin and so for the next three Bitcoin rounds uh and the purpose of going on bitcoin was one bootstrap get donations and the second was get validation we don't want to just uh have an idea start raising and try to convince people that our scam is worth it you want to get validation you want to see that people are interested in this and you want to have users so this is how we started and probably my best advice is ship ship ship ship ship so we started on git coin people were like okay here's our money and at the end of Bitcoin around we shipped a basic version that looks like we transfer you upload the file ipfs end-to-end encrypter and share the file with anyone you want um eight months later this year actually in February we launched fiveros portal which I'm gonna demo in a second and it was a resounding success so we took what our users and our beta users were kind of giving us as feedback and the comments that they were giving us with the first version of the app we integrated all that in a new version which we call Porto and it was quite successful just in three days of launching the general access uh almost every blog produce on gnosis Shane had an average of five five hours transactions in them over 3600 portals smart contracts were deployed within two days for those that did use our website instead of the ipfs Gateway we logged over 110 countries using the DAP which is significant or a simple reason which is financial dabs in crypto are really hard to access for 90 of the world uh you don't want to go on coinbase have to buy assets in order to interact with the web 3 world we want to give people a clear access without needing tokens and getting the benefits of our values meaning privacy decentralization and zero Central points of failure so after that we were pretty happy we went into whitelisting mode and we're concentrating on 4000 user accounts and getting their feedback testing stuff with them Etc so just a bit of a overview and then I'm gonna demo and finish uh the DAP is modular we call it a trustless collaboration dab and you can basically think of it as a safe multi-sig so trustlessly manage assets as a group or a loan uh uh but instead of just assets add files add data add data rooms at contracts at branding which is essential for any Dao project Etc so it's modular you can also think of it as a browser you can customize your browser with extensions now you can do that also with your workspace or collaboration space you have a plugin I'm a Reddit meme Lord this guy might be a lawyer we want different we have different visions of what our ideal workspace will look like so you can customize it with plugins ecosystem we've been doing uh organizing hackathons since 2016. this is something we're good at we organize she builds a tech a few months ago it's the biggest gender-focused hackathon in India over 60 percent of non-male contribution which is significant in crypto and it's unchain so this is the link to the portal if you want to try it it's Unique it's a white listing at the moment so you won't get another chance or you come see me after and you can get a cool floppy disk that is for Aesthetics and also with an access to uh the private link although I don't have that many so do scan that stuff I'm gonna wait one more second two more seconds go so uh before I conclude let me show you follows portal this is the setup phase um it's a super straightforward process like a safe multi-sig I hope the Wi-Fi is gonna be uh friendly like you like you can see already from the start on the URL here you have ipfs you don't have to hit our servers if you don't want to we're not here to log where your uh your IP or anything like that you can go directly from any ipfs Gateway access our static website and use our dap like you would as you went through our our servers so yeah we have this mental model in the in the in our team which is if we all die tomorrow can our users continue using that app and the answer is basically yes no so I pick my chain I'll pick gnosis because it's highly decentralized and throughput is amazing agnosis I click on create the portal it gives me a transaction I sign it and now you're deploying smart contracts uh on gnosis you can do it on ethereum as well and it will take a few seconds usually if you have a really good Wi-Fi it will take literally two to three seconds uh in the meantime we are entertaining you with uh some blah blah uh okay I was ah perfect so and the next step is it's sinus it's gasless it's Timeless you don't need to sign uh stuff whenever you want to interact with a smart contract or update it and it's at the setups phase is pretty clear I'm not gonna do the whole thing here I opened another portal just next to it okay yeah thank you um and this is what it looks like once you set up the signless process which literally takes a few seconds um so this is your portal it's doing better but here you can drag and drop files whatever you want let's take this you can make it private or public private anyone with a link anyone that follows me a new one that has my token or nft or a crypto Punk or whatever you want or my collaborators meaning people I've manually added to my smart contract or you make it public if I click on public no signature you're uploading right now by default on ipfs but you can do it with local storage you can do it with our weave you can do it with whatever you want soon also uh for those who prefer even centralized services but I don't recommend it um now you copy the link you can share it with anyone you want you have the QR code and you have an ipfs hash if you want here I can upload another or I can go into my productivity tools so Google workspace doesn't have this but let's say I want to do something cool like that I want to put that here here I'm gonna write demo demo I can zoom out peace I can zoom out and I can literally do anything I want on this on this page on this whiteboard and the coolest part is that you can invite 10 15 100 people on here they'll all remain anonymous they'll be represented by the ens or their address and they'll be interacting with you through peer-to-peer Tech so here I'm putting a title I don't even need to publish it on ipfs or whatever storage option you decided I can just leave and if I go in my files I'll find it in my draft the way that the draft works is with a piece of tech peer-to-peer storage Network called gun gun DB is something used by a lot of political activists so it's quite resistant resilient and quite effective your files are here your folders are here you can add manually or with the CVS as many addresses you want on your vitalik vitalik dot EDH you can add them manually or with a CVS onto your smart contract which will give them access to create also files on that same portal or other you have some analytics as well you have settings to customize your your portal and I'll finish just with that you also have a public view of portal so this is me with a private access to my portal and this is a public one I want to share that link with someone because I'm a writer I'm a Dao that wants a community Wiki anything like that you can have your files here you can put any types of documents you can token gate them you can make them super private you can make them public here's your profile you can fill in stuff about yourself and I'll show you one last cool thing which is any of the files here are public I'm going to click on this one it was probably one of the biggest requests from our early uh community members on Dropbox on Google Drive on Microsoft Office you cannot load the render 3D files and we have a lot of 3D artists and graphic designers that were complaining a lot about that and they said hey can you fix that so we did again peer-to-peer Tech you can navigate any 3D file that an artist or whoever or your nfts without needing to go on open C and you can navigate and you can even chat with whoever shared that file with you hello I'm represented by my address it's end-to-end encrypted there's some analytics about the file I can upload a new version I can edit it a little bit Etc and I can download of course uh the file so I'll stop here I hope you liked it I hope you'll shill it please talk about us on Twitter um because yeah I think that next Bull Run it will be very important to have non-financial dapps dabs that show that the space is not only about speculation and it's about Reinventing the web 2 world with better values privacy no Central points of failures Etc thank you sorry uh we put bad side in here progress shoes hardcore okay so like I said you uh you start on git coin best place to start building the in open we were open source we were free we still are uh and I play two Grands and the most important advice I can give you as Builders is get validation get traction and validation show people that you know users come to your adapt they're seeing the same problem you're seeing and the same solution you're proposing so that's the best way to bootstrap and make sure your idea is not just a great idea in your head but a great idea for everyone else and once you've done that so we've been doing that for a year and a half then you can start testing stuff you can start monetizing with some users dowels who might have communities of a thousand people and might want to customize the smart contracts um Etc or you fundraise and if if you fundraise you know maybe go more towards angels and protocols not necessarily yeah so that's words will you challenge in crypto I would say yes get coin uh get coin Twitter be good meme Lords uh spam Twitter with uh anime stuff like that you know and try to be uh try to feel the vibe of crypto and respond to it and if you want to expand the Beyond there's product hunt there's Reddit there is places where you can also go and try to fetch a non-wheel 3 users and introduce them to the web 3 world you I'm putting the link here one last time in case anyone has missed it cool and also yeah floppy disks uh the DAP is on the back QR code and URL a bit of a description and inside some of them have some Easter eggs you might have Doom compressed on it you might have a private tea you might have a vulnerability no I'm kidding but yeah that's it if there are no more questions I'll I'll stop here
