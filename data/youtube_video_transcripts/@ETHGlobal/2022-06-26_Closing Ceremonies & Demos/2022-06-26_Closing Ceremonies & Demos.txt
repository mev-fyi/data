testing one two three hey everybody we're gonna get started please uh please take your seats we'll give everybody two minutes and in the meantime let's get ready for the closing ceremonies that's a wonderful is everybody ready oh that wasn't loud enough is everybody ready all right let's get this going welcome to eat new york closing ceremonies i'm gonna kick this off with a blast welcome all of you to eat new york the vibe is electric it's alive highly caffeinated i don't imagine myself being anywhere else [Music] [Music] [Music] all right now that i messed up full screen let's start all over i am kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i am super excited to welcome to the welcome all of you to the final day of new york we spent the last few hours going through hundreds of projects and talking to amazing people and we're gonna showcase what came out of all of this so first of all welcome to all of you joining us from the live stream i already see a couple hundred people on youtube so you're gonna also get to see all the project demos uh on eatglobal.tv and also you'll be one of the people receiving poeps so please sign in if you end up watching this in the next hour so this event has been the biggest we've ever done 1500 attendees from 56 different countries and 37 percent of them were new to what three i am so happy to see that no matter what the market's doing no matter what else is going on here the development excitement is not stopping and after that we saw 251 submissions this morning it is absolutely incredible and this makes it our biggest event ever so congratulations to 251 teams here that really pulled through and submitted a project and i can't wait to show you some of our favorites today and a big thank you to all the judges to spend all of this morning talking to all these teams giving amazing feedback talking about what they can do next and i want to give a big shout out to all of them julia david wundra linda rahul riya simona sam alejo austin maggie cheyenne kaido james ramani evan kevin shannon shannon twice yeah well joyce chad chris kade chris w justin alicia elaine treyas and nema you are amazing and thank you for talking

threshold nomad elastic swap and coin tracker all right this brings us to why we are here for the next hour this is not a conference this whole weekend was about building interesting and amazing things and the goal was to make sure we focus on showcasing and not telling so after these 251 submissions we calculated all the scores and we found 10 finalists this is a typo off to a great start and without further ado i'd like to welcome these 10 well there's also nine teams because i did not full screen before these 10 teams and uh please congratulate big a big round of applause to gilbert my wallet suzuki nft safe launch pearls team tokenizer weaver mesh link and safe node and nf-dos there will be 10 teams coming on stage these are some of our 10 amazing projects that are going to live demo what they built over this weekend and you'll get to see all of them on stage and after the 10th demo we will talk about all the prizes everybody has won from all of our amazing sponsors and before we go into our very first time i want to give a big shout out to the 241 teams that are listed here uh just because you were not on that 10 list does not mean you were not good enough there was amazing work that we saw from so many one of so many of you and i really hope that you continue building and taking this project from here on to the next stage so thank you so much to everybody that shipped something and this is something to be absolutely proud of congratulations and to those of you who want to find out what all the projects are you can head over to eatglobal.com showcase to see all 250 plus projects you can see all of them right now and uh learn more about what everybody else is excited about so without further ado let's welcome our very first finalist demo for the day and that is project biddle girl sorry hello we are proud to present gitel a tool that unlocks the potential of asset sharing among guilds so essentially what we are is a guild manager management platform that allows members to share gaming accounts to increase fellowship and collaboration within their guild so how come we worked on this so we worked on this because right now gaming development has had a lot of development so far and there's more to come with the rise of blockchain technologies there's new use cases and new possibilities when it comes like and this includes formation of gaming asset formation of like gaming assets and um guilds sorry i'm a little nervous [Applause] oh sorry yes and to meet the need we created git all so how do we do this so the github protocol allows for users to create guilds to aid each other and to share each other's gaming accounts and we do this via using the soul bound token mechanism and this allows for community interaction and uh and maintains trust so here we will present uh one of the major use cases for getall which is for you as a guild member you want you'll be able to use another member's account and then play as their as that member and then accelerate the skill levels of that member and then vice versa so they can do that for your accounts as well and then overall level up the entire guild thanks let's go to the demo right now so i'm adding to the guild interface it's already connected either way with metamask so this is basically your landing page this is a guild that you are already in so you can see the number of games the number of nft inside and also some other other things for example uh the number of people so if you want to create a new guild it's like pretty easily you can you can do many things you can upload picture add a new name etc uh this is on epfs um but the most important thing is that um you want to be invited to a game that's how it works usually so let's check uh this is an invite that you received um so you got all the info you can either way accept it or not but usually you accept it because you know the person that is inviting you so i will simply accept and by accepting this invitation i will meet on polygon a salbon token that basically said that i'm a member of the team and that i'm able to share either way my assets or that i can use other guild members assets so yeah we should we should be able to see it live uh if if it's going through um yeah exactly so this is the sulban targets so anyway so let's go back to the team and let's say in this case i want to help my friends it's new in the game and uh we want to speed the thing up so i will use this account because i'm an experienced uh user of this game and that way we will we can level up he is a set pretty fast so i will simply add him to um to the to the team and that way we should be able to see his nft so it isn't ft arrived this is one that you can share with uh with the team and if i want to use it i will simply click on play and yes so from a technical standpoint what is actually happening is that joseph as a fellow guild members he can request access to magnosisafe and my nozi safe is actually my player account incisor's new game so by scanning the qr code and using the nozzysafe web application he will be then able to log in to this new game actually just if he was me inside the game yeah so let's try real quick so this is a game this is on polygon i will simply connect with my my wallet account so remember this is not my talk my nft but i'm still able to to use it and because nicolas gave me uh the right to use it so i'm not able to do things that he doesn't want me to do but i'm still able to to play the game so this is the demo amazing congrats please pick them up give them a big round of applause it's uh even i get nervous on stage that's okay we want to thank you uh all the juries and the team thank you very much all right next up we have burn my wallet and on deck tsukiji please give a big round of applause to burn my wallet hello new york tickets hello new york we'll burn my wallet so whoa sorry so we're trying to solve the problem of your stolen passphrase your wallet is done it's been hacked and we're solving it with soul-bound tokens so your stolen wallet with soul bound tokens your soul is burning in hell you get it okay so you can actually see this live on burn my wallet dot com and who are we i'm erin i worked on the front end and nikita worked on the back end yeah so once your wallet uh is stolen the hacker can't actually lock you out so this gives you an opportunity to pull a kill switch on your wallet we do this by minting a sole bound or non-transferable token that you can only mix to your own wallet so you're not somebody else can't burn your account and once it's in your account the hacker can't do anything to remove it so this is a signal to other apps that your wallet has been burned or has been hacked so other wallet apps can prevent transactions from growing into your account dows can disable voting rights by looking checking if you have this token in your account and preventing you from voting and social protocols can say that show that you've been hacked and make sure that uh you like you know the hacker isn't phishing any of your friends so how it works um you basically go to burn my wallet.com you can mint it on mumbai or or rinkby and yeah it's basically a modified erc721 with some improvements made into it and we the goal really is to integrate with all these apps as easily as possible so we give you an api where all you do is you need to put the chain and the address and we tell you if this wallet has been hacked so to actually um basically burn your wallet you go to our site you you can switch to ethereum or wrinkby and basically burn it this puts the token into your address so once you've actually got the token your address there's you can easily check any account if any account has been burned so if we go over here we can check that this wallet address has been burned and basically you've been hacked uh you can actually check this on different networks as well on polygon and you can see that on the on this chain it hasn't been hacked right now and you can see a list of all the hacked wallets so this is just a front end to kind of easily use yourself but this connects to a public api that any app can integrate into and so that's where we integrated with uh did an example integration with xmtp so in this case uh we took the existing xmtp client where you're just messaging other people on chain and you can basically now see that it checks if you have this wallet um sorry if you have this token in your account it puts a big red hat next to your name so now you're not getting phished anymore uh when you're receiving messages thinking that it's from one of your friends uh we also have you know a public subgraph so anybody can you know query additional data like when wallets have been hacked and other information and really the goal is to make this super easy to integrate with a couple of lines of code you can add security against hacked accounts into any of your dapps um and yeah so try it out it's already you can try it out right now burma.com and you know talk to us if you're making a dap because we'd love to integrate with you congratulations congratulations congratulations to burn my wallet next up we have tsukiji and on deck will get nft safe launch please welcome tsukiji on stage all right good afternoon today today we're here to introduce tsukiji a next generation nft exchange proudly built on top open seas newly released seaport protocol to rethink the way that we trade non-fungible tokens now why the name tsukiji built on seaport we wanted to imagine a bustling seaside port where people are there trading commercing and specifically we wanted to recreate our platform and experience of thinking about a local fish market where locals are there bartering their goods so as an homage to what was once the world's largest fish market the tsukiji fish market in tokyo japan we named our project after them built on the seaport protocol so what is it that we actually built we built a platform for people to have a platform people to mince and wait to exchange entities in a batched way and barter part of the nfts we also created on top of a ui also a dedicated api to enable a new ecosystem of fulfillers so this is extensible to a lot of different use cases like in addition to having the ui for consumers to buy and sell their nfts we also have an api that exposes all of the open orders and considerations so that people are able to use this data to create even more use cases like um use arbitrage opportunities or potentially even built an entire platform of matching algorithms and different use cases with the exposed data we spent a lot of time building a sleek and user-focused experience this weekend and jm is going to share more about that right now in our live demo i receive your tokens you receive mine enough talking let's go to a live demo all right imagine i'm bob the bill door and i own some crypto punks if i go over to the tsukiji platform i will see recommendations based on my own tokens so let's say bob the builder also owns a ton of azuki's then we'll be able to see a bunch of listings regarding azuki's on the flip side of the story we have alice the ape who owns a bunch of maycs and baycs one day alice really wants to purchase a crypto punk so they go on to do kiji and create an offer let's say what's a competitive offer five mutant apes maybe two board apes and let's whip in like an eth there and create an offer on the flip side we go out to the real market and look for what we want and alice wanted an alien book specifically so we're going to update our order like that when we confirm the listing we're going to see a pop-up to sign a message just to verify that we are indeed the true holders of these tokens once that's created we're going to look at a console to quickly realize our data has been successfully saved on our file storage so flipside we go back to bob now bob is fishing out on the market refreshes his screen and realizes that there is a new offer on the market for an alien punk and he's indeed down to explore the market and give out his punk so he goes through the listing and looks through what does the exchange i'm about to go through well i'm going to trade all these bayc maycs and give out my punk i'm down for that so we fulfill the purchase and that's sort of how tsukiji works we're going to allow people to batch exchange various groups of tokens all right thanks jm all right there's one thing that i'm really really excited about here and that's specifically the fulfillment api so as you can imagine you know we have transactions on a blockchain this analogy that you guys might be familiar with transactions initiated it's broadcasted its mind it's added to the blockchain the transaction's complete there's a very appropriate analogy here where with tsukiji and orders initiated that order is broadcast to fulfillers fulfillers do their job they get they do their thing they get a reward through tips on these orders that order is settled through seaport and what we have here is a self-driven economy of users and fulfillers creating this flywheel effect ultimately that's tsukiji we can't wait to see what you guys do with tsukiji and seaport thank you for your time that was incredible being able to see that immediately on a weekend is is mind-blowing so with that please give them a big round of applause and next up we have nfc safe launch hi guys quick show of hands who minted an st who got rack pulled so we aim to solve this by uh adding um an extension to the erc 721 contract where projects can can create more trust before the minting process begins so right now we've seen a plenty of projects who executed on roadmap flawlessly and holders received a lot of value but yeah there is this one a lot of rock pools our solution is basically bringing the roadmap on chain where where where when you create a contract you can add different steps that needs to be completed before the funds are accessed because right now when a project means out the creators get access to the funds immediately and sometimes they just run away with it and because of this new mentors don't have that much trust and they don't want to start a new they don't want to ape into new projects so yeah you can see our nft project we were also like four people but they have to leave to the airport so we have a demo here with four predefined conditions the conditions should return a boolean and these are just some examples that we came up with in our roadmap we've included sending to a charity sending over a board ape and tossing a governance vote when the condition is met the nfd contract owner can mark that step as completed so here you can see half of the supply is minted the board ape has been sent and we've donated to a charity so if the team is unable to complete the road map they can abandon the nft project they're still allowed part of their treasury but the nft holders will be able to withdraw the remaining balance as the last step we've included a governance proposal for the project and all the holders to vote if the product should move on utilizing uma's optimistic oracle we can get the answer to any question in this case specifically a snapshot vote since we are untested we need to validate this ourselves we posted the question and now we're receiving the answer with the passing vote we can now finalize the last step a nice way of integrating off-chain data for on-chain validation now the nft product has a committed community that has been part of the governance and an executed roadmap on shane so now of course they can access the full treasury to move ahead we see projects being innovative with creating conditions with the possibility of on-chain and off-chain data making the minting process safer and trustless and also you don't have to do this complicated process all over you can also just add one step like mint incomplete and whenever the meeting is complete you can get access to funds and if not you can abandon the projects and the mentors can receive parts of their money back that's our solution hopefully a lot of projects are starting to use it congratulations next up we have pearl and on deck steam tokenizer please give pearl a big round of applause this audio is good they just wait till they put it yeah um who of you guys has been bombarded with telegram and discord announcements this week yes exactly um most of us in web 3 are completely overwhelmed with the task of staying up to date with the information that our communities put out there we mute the servers and as a result we miss out on important updates but don't you worry anymore that's why we've built perl to solve this i'm going to hand it over to the team to show you how this works exactly all right everyone i'm carlos i am the founder of the bullish bears nft yeah we host we host the sickest stealth parties in new york city all right time to leak some alpha okay alpha is sent all right actually you can see the notification from uh bullish bears arriving on my phone uh we can go to the app here's all the nfts i'm associated with connected to my wallet i can go to bullish bears and actually we'll keep the events but i'm going to turn off allow list for now i'll go back i can continue and there it is i can see the notification right there so what's powering this wallet to wallet communication it's a new protocol we designed called yamp yet another message protocol we believe it's important for any web3 communication to be open and private open meaning that any server or client may join the network and also private meaning that messages are not in public view and that you specify what server is responsible for processing your messages looking at both web 2 and web3 communication systems we found that email which has been around for more than 30 years has both of these properties so we decided to modify smtp smtp looks up recipient addresses using dns mx records and instead we're using smart contracts to look up recipient wallet addresses nasa will talk more about how we're how are smart contracts are implemented yeah and basically the smart contract kept just a mapping between the public key of the owner of that nft collection like burst with the smtp ip address and also we have all the functions in order to verify to sign and verify the the messages that are going to be sent between the client and the server this is our team and now relax [Music] guys well this was a hackathon project for now we're actually building this in real life as well so if you thought this was interesting if you're an nft project trying to use you reach your users if you're a user who's currently overwhelmed or if you want to give us some money come and talk to us congratulations to pearl that was amazing all right next up we have steam tokenizer please welcome steam tokenizer on stage all right hello everyone um this is a steam token answer it's basically a tool to bridge gaming from web 2 to web3 so let's do a quick show hands raise your hand if you have ever used steam marketplace or you own any steam game any in-game asset any skin cs go skins or dota games raise your hand that's pretty good that's pretty good so yeah the seat token answer basically creates an unfunctional token backed by the corresponding asset the corresponding steam asset is stored in an escrow how it works is basically a user directly sends any asset to the body using the team's marketplace interface and then the bot creates metadata in a dynamic way and then uses the ipfs network to store all the data um in a decentralized way um now the user has the equivalent as an nft and can use it to explore the defined landscape and other features and whenever the user wants to get back the steam asset they only have to use a burn function with a smart contract so what are the applications first first of all obviously buy sell and trade the backed nft through any decentralized marketplace for example openc also um you can use the backtens nfcs as collateral for loans using any permissionless lending protocol and web3 developers can also combine features and games for web 2 to bring the best to bring the best of both worlds so the applications are endless and now we're going to head to the to do a quick demo um i have the ball running and i'm using only one account so i'm just gonna send it i'm gonna send this mp7 skin to the board and now the bot will just wait for the ball to receive it's accepting the trade now and now it's going to start building the metadata using the steam api and upload it to the ipfs network right i'm using only one account so i'm going to run the interface and grab this link so basically the bot creates this unique link to mndnft using a very simple interface as we can see in the url we parsed all the different parameters of the asset for example the name the hash the signature as well as the cooldown period of the eye of the item and now we can mint it and now we're going to wait a bit for the ring to be um networked but yeah and the main goal of this is allowing obviously the sd marketplace to be part of the web 3 ecosystem it should be confirmed and now we're going to head to openc and to see if the metadata is loaded so here here are the other assets i'm using now as snft so we can see the new one and the metadata is going to take a bit to load but as we can see this number is id number six which is the one we minted another example of other assets while the the the new one is loading for example this dota item we can see all the properties fetched from the steam api the game the hero the slot the rarity as well and we have the cooldown period that is basically um is when the user can can get back the nft and yeah that's about it wow [Applause] web 2 to web 3 with an actual massive platform this is incredible congratulations next up we have reverb please welcome reverb on stage let's put it on the mirror mirror settings okay should we try this one uh nope never seen this before this of course wouldn't be a hackathon if murphy's law doesn't kick in so uh we'll give this another minute oh how do you change it to uh whew okay thank you um so we are reverb and what we built was uh we built a music platform to connect music artists and listeners together in communities and we really wanted to allow listeners of music to show who they really are passionate about and support the artists that they care about and so here's the platform we built it's called reverb so here it's built on top of lens protocol so all of these are nfts so any artist post any artist profile any user profile or any song there are nfts and for example if you go to bonnie b you can mint a token so this will follow the user on lens protocol which is on top of polygon and if you pay 500 matic you can own one of their nfts and once you own nft for the artist you can start earning rewards tokens so our platform when a user assigns when an artist signs up we we deploy a new erc20 contract for them and that's a reward token and now if you go uh listen to some of a song on our platform you'll start earning erc20 reward tokens so this is built off of superfluid so every time you listen to a song every time you increase its view count you'll earn erc20 tokens through superfluid and that's streaming all the videos are hosted by live pier and we upload these videos onto lens protocol and then this is like my profile so you can see the different tokens i've collected and the artists that i've minted their membership nfts so down here are the membership nfts and here's how many tokens i've collected by listening to their songs and so some of the things that we really want to build out after this are enabling artists to provide merch or early access passes or meet and greet passes to their fans so you can spend your reward tokens on those types of things and yeah that's pretty much our platform [Applause] well congratulations next up we have meshlink please welcome meshlink on stage and then two more demos to go is perfect all right hello hello how you guys doing cool i'm going to share this slideshow and get going oh let's go there all right cool so in the past 10 months over 4 million smart contracts were deployed that's a great amount of activity that a lot of things are happening a lot of things are going but you know the funny thing is there's no easy way to understand what's going on right so if you've ever deployed a smart contract you've understood that either you have to go to ether scan you have to go through custom scripts basically understand what's going on right this kind of lay the landscape there's a lot of technical solutions there's the graph there's bitquery there's doing analytics all these things are pretty technical if you want to go on a completely non-technical side you can look at ether scan right but the thing is that there's a big opportunity for to creating a management platform that's non-technical for basically someone who's product manager or a marketing manager so i hacked on this because i felt the pain so for context earlier this year i launched the game it's kind of like farmville meets blockchain whereby it's actually all these smart contracts there's about 50 smart contracts there's thousands of transactions there's millions of tokens flowing through the system but at the end of the day what happened was i had no clue what was going on so what i did is i basically built a bunch of different custom scripts on the graph i used etherscan crawled that i create a bunch of different google docs at the end of the day if this was all in the unified platform it'd make my life a lot easier and i could assume that since we're all here building things it'll make a lot of people's lives easier so if you look at the traditional data market there's a multi-billion dollar business there's amplitude there's segment there's datadog there's all these companies that make a lot of money right so let's bring that world into blockchain so i could walk you through all the crazy things that i developed over this past weekend uh between the data aggregation the virtual the knobs at the top um but what i really want to point out here is this concept of virtual mongodb right so at the base layer of the system there's this network of crawlers that crawl the block chain aggregate a lot of information and actually push that up to ipfs so actually what's happening is that all these separate systems are able to pull and aggregate information so that now a friend can easily just query that and have everything one place so without further ado let's run a demo so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go over here this is a quick dashboard i spun up it's basically we'll be into filling up filling out this dashboard with a bunch of different information but for now it's blank right let's go over here so let's take a look at this so right now the far left side is what's going to be populating from the query and from the crawlers the middle is the kind of api cli that i created and the top right is a way i can initiate the crawlers and this bottom right here is like actually i'm looking at live ipfs data using storage because a lot of the data is pushed onto ipfs um and i kind of created a virtual mongodb on top of that so let's run through the cli real quick to create an app so to give you context right so if you can think about blockchain application it's just a collection of smart contracts talking to each other right so what i did is i basically made a way for you to create an easy way to create an app kind of think of it as a bucket for all your smart contract operations so i'm gonna go ahead and create a sample one hopefully the wi-fi works perfect so we're gonna what it does is basically logs that i as sheldon want to actually create an address create an application called live stage demo and it gives me back an api key and this is actually pretty simply created it's stored actually on ipfs right now dynamically done and so what i'm actually going to do is as well as creating that app i'm going to now tie a smart contract address to my app right so what i'm doing is basically i'm saying i want to track this zero six um smart contract so this is a smart contract that i'm tracking so i'm gonna go ahead and add in my api key to that oop and nice so what it did now is basically log on to it logs on ipfs that there's now this new app that has this smart contract address that wants to be crawled right so now if i go back over to here and actually take my api key that i just created and i paste into here this is like a quick way to just kick off my crawler that i made you're seeing real time as these crawlers are going through all the different transactions that are occurring on that particular smart contract it's pulling all the data dynamically it's pulling all the rp rpc codes it's actually checking what you're looking at right now is checking on if the addresses are talking to me are they smart contracts are they users um it's pulling actually the method signatures of the transactions to actually understand for the actual actions that people are taking how often they're coming back what are they doing what are they also doing like what kind of the correlation between the actions that you're taking because if you ever use like segment or google analytics you can actually get a good understanding of what the journey of a person takes as they're going through your web application so we just saw that this uh crawler finished it's actually completely decentralized it's all like running by itself and actually refresh here so we can see now a thousand so a thousand new objects are pushed into ipfs right and now let's take a look back at our dashboard and perfect so now you're able to actually pull dynamically the information that occurred for this particular app it tracked all the transaction it aggregates all the users of those transactions and actually gives me a nice log of saying for this particular user for example they are a returning user and they've done five transactions in the past 24 hours right and if i scroll down i can see actually this level of new user like logging so you actually understand what users are new and what users are coming back right and the beautiful is that like now that we have this one concept of an app id we can actually take this app id and compare it to another app id so now you can actually get almost like a comparative analysis of for one user base let's say there's user base of sushi swap and user base of of unit swap how correlated are they how often do they go from one to another how often how how joined are they right so all these level analytics makes it very easy for people to understand what's going on so that's all that's happening this is uh mexican.ai again my name is sheldon trotman and uh i go by king draco kingdracodev on twitter so thank you amazing thank you so much that was incredible can't wait to have others use it too all right our second last demo for today safe note please welcome safe note on stage hi there i'm stan lane presenting safe node an etherpc for end users hey mom and dad imagine this a new announcement in your favorite nft discord a free claim for your nft utility as you click submit transaction an irreversible spiral begins as a transaction is sent to an rpc it's too late your ape is gone fished blockchain is scary once your transaction is mined there is no taking about blockchain is forever even for those who work full-time in crypto transactions are too much of a black box i took a screenshot of a contract interaction on metamask yesterday does anyone know what this does it's actually said approval for all if someone signed this they would have been fished out of all of their nfts of a particular collection if we truly wanted to onboard a billion users we need to take the guesswork out of security our pcs should be smarter and detect fraud in phishing rpcs should make users think twice about submitting dangerous transactions showing data to help inform this decision welcome to safe node a layer of trust it's simple users added as their rpc and block explorer in their wallet when you first use rpc the address that you've interacted with in the past are added as a personal whitelist so any of your old transactions it just works just like a normal rpc but then when a transaction is queued it means safenode has firewalled it and hasn't sent it to the mapful it's waiting our approval one more time when this happens we provide data to the user to make the decision for whether this transaction is safe or not we think that metamask's hexdump just isn't super intuitive so we do this differently these are the same transaction in metamask and safe node we simulate the transaction before it's submitted and log all events in the simulation of the transaction including error c20 rc721 approvals transfers etc it's like etherscan but before you even send the transaction this is safe nodes transaction simulation just one element of how we keep users safe another layer of protection is to block transactions of addresses on our blacklist one example of this would be recently i saw on twitter that a venture capitalist sent 500 000 usdc to usdc thankfully circle has an unchained blacklist of their own address which means the transaction failed but others aren't so lucky wreath and tether each have over 1 million dollars total worth of their respective tokens in their contracts these are funds that are irrecoverable safe notes blocks transactions to such addresses but if a user nonetheless wants to sign a transaction and lose funds then it can switch back to infira and send it in two clicks this block list can also be used to block a list of known malicious users in fact blacklist can be combined with oh sorry in fact blacklist can be combined with user reporting something that's really only possible with web3 playing on screen now is a full flow of safe node from sending a transaction that would have hacked all my paradigm nfts to viewing simulation on a safe node to reporting an address reporting is done through world coin's world id here the number of reports is shown and it's cyberproof so if you know that 200 real people have reported a particular address maybe it's a good idea not to interact but if it looks all good there's a button at the bottom to submit the transaction send it once and submit it to the mempool we also have some globally white listed contracts and addresses so for example openc unity swap curve wrapping and wrapping we etc interacting with these is the exact same as any other rpc study is similar to the billion dollar industry of ssl certificates and perhaps the main source of revenue this way safe note won't be obtrusive enough for you to miss a gas war on the newest mint i'd love to create a tokenized version of this as well of tokenized due diligence based on these concepts thank you all so much it's been grueling we had a pleasure wow [Applause] i'm looking for reasons to drop out of school vc and such so hit me up on twitter if you can try that thank you guys so much congratulations all right please give a giant round of applause for our 10th and the final demo for today eats dos please welcome him on stage okay i think i can just do it um hi everyone i am adian and um i'm representing team ethdos which stands for ethereum degrees of separation uh i'm here with three other people but they couldn't make it to the presentation so they will be i will be like you know they're doing it for them um so the inspiration for this talk for this project came from something called the bacon number some of you might be aware of what that is but the bacon number is based on the movie actor kevin bacon and it's uh how many degrees of separation do other actors have from kevin bacon if um like how many times have they co-starred in a movie with him so if someone has co-starred in a movie with kevin bacon they would have a kevin bacon score of one and if someone has a co-starred with someone who has co-starred with the movie and kevin with kim bacon that would they would have a score of two so we wanted to do something similar for the crypto community and what we came up with was called the ethereum degrees of separation for your friends and your your social graph so the way it works is um there's this origin node let's um so the way it works is the origin node is the one who starts and can send signatures to all their friends basically they can they can send these magic cryptographical things to their friends claiming and then those friends can now claim that they are um the origins uh degree one friends now these degree one friends can send and generate proofs to their own friends and now these people become degree two friends you can keep doing this on and on and you can like make a whole social graph or a tree with like n degrees now the way you would usually do this is you would just have like a graph online and you could like you can see the graph and you can calculate your number but in crypto we like to spice things up a bit so we use zk um or zero knowledge cryptography to hide all the parts inside the bacon number or inside the ethereum like ethereum dos so the way it works is say let's let's assume for now like the vitalik was the origin all of vitalik's friends would be degree one and they would get a signature by vitalik those guys can generate a zero knowledge proof saying that they have received a signature from vitalik they can send that proof to their friends those guys would be degree too and now those guys can send they can generate more proofs recursively using our recursive zk snarks and they can send it to the degree three friends and so on so now what you can do is you can go on chain and you can cryptographically prove that you are nth degree away from vitalik isn't that quite cool like and and then the best part on top of this is that you can mint an nft and in the spirit of things we would make the an nft like soul bound so that you can't trade it with other people so the way this would work is you go to eat dot eat dos x dot x y z you type in your friend's address and you click sign and generate a message this would open up a meta mask wallet and you would sign it and then it would generate a proof generating a proof takes a really long time about three to four minutes so for this presentation i'll just go to a proof which is already been generated the proof shows you originator which is who originated the proof your distance from the originator and a link to share this proof with others so if you share this proof with others and sign it they can be distance three and with the magic of recursive snarks this is all possible without um putting anything on chain or leaking any information about the path so um i would like to show a diagram uh with which shows explains all of this and you can see that the third degree here doesn't actually know about the first degree themselves because this is all zero knowledge and the third degree can actually generate um an nft based on this so yes um what we what we've done here i think is pretty incredible because recursive zero snarks are a very new um primitive encrypt um in like the crypto community in fact in surcom this was only possible until a week like until maybe like this wednesday because um a bunch of people made circuits which would allow you to like recursively do things so yes thank you guys thanks to the one person well why the slides load up please give all those 10 amazing projects a big round of applause [Applause] all right so i want to quickly give a big shout out to once again good old my wallet tsukiji nft safe launch pearl team tokenizer reverb meshlink safenode and hdos these are some incredible themes that we're seeing here from being able to protect someone's fun to being able to notify them for various things to simplify in their lives i i think the more we look at what's coming out of these events the more i get confidence that we're actually solving for all the edge cases that it's currently making it hard for people to build in this space and use things that we're building on a day-to-day basis and uh every event we do i get more bullish because i get to be a lot more closer to using this on a daily basis so with that i will try to wrap all this up in the

next two weeks so please be patient with us all the prizes are going to be delivered by july 13th and if somebody is found out to be cheating that will be disqualified on the spot and the prize will be adjusted accordingly so congratulations to all of these 250 projects and before we wrap up i want to take a quick minute to say a lot of thank yous so many people make these types of events happen the judges the volunteers the mentors speakers partners and without their help and support and physical presence this would not be literally possible so i want to start off by thanking 1500 of you that are in this building you are absolutely amazing please give yourselves a massive round of applause because you have been here all day and all night working on things that are exciting to you and you are going to shape what the next few years look like on top of that i want to thank all of our amazing judges that spent the last few hours talking to so many of these teams and giving them anywhere from feedback to inspiration to hope to continue building this space so thank you to all of our judges i want everybody to give a massive round of applause to every single volunteer that has spent countless hours 24 7 working and making sure everything is on track without their help they would this event would absolutely fall apart and of course some of our amazing mentors who were here just helping answering questions just making sure everybody's unblocked whether it's at the booth or on discord and so many amazing workshops and talks from our speakers all of this becomes so much more valuable as thousands more who are not able to be here in this building kind of join us and and watch all these things online thank you to all of our speakers and hundreds of partners that were here supporting a thousand plus hackers in building whatever they wanted to build please give a big round of applause to all of our amazing partners you are absolutely incredible and it's great to see you continue supporting these events no matter what the market says and before we end i want to give a massive shout out to the rest of the 8th global team you see them running all around but without them making sure things are actually happening as planned this would not happen as an event so massive shout out to chloe danish kevin cree huichi minnie anna moaz luke emily andrew and jacob thank you so much everybody and let's wrap this up by bringing on the finalists 10 teams presented on stage today we call them our finalists because the goal for eight global events to make sure that we're making it easy for all of you to continue building they're called finalists because we don't want this to be a competition the goal is to help you continue building and as a result everybody that presented on stage officially came first and everybody who was on stage will be receiving one eighth per team from the 8th global side so congratulations to all of these 10 teams and we'll be doing all of that again in the next two weeks this wraps up new york we have some obviously after parties going on here and for those of you who are interested in being part of some of our next events here's what's on deck in two weeks we'll be starting hack fs our month-long incredible web 3 hackathon in partnership with protocol labs you can head over to fs.eatglobal.com then we have metabolism with the zora team we're going to be talking about all the amazing things you can do with zora on august 4th that is going to be another online event and we're going to return back to in person on the
