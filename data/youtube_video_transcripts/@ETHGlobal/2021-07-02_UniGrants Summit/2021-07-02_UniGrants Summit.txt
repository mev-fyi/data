everybody who also signs in will get a poep nft tokens for being a participant at the summit and uh looking forward to seeing how everybody uh gets excited about all the talks that we have so uh we have a lot of talks that we're gonna be talking uh going through that cover what's happening on the union swap ecosystem so i want to give a quick overview to uh to everybody here we're going to kick us kick the day off by talking about some meta-governance structures and jeremy's going to come and talk about that shortly we're going to have uh cherry talk about cervet dimitar is going to talk about anti-fraud and fishing from how web 2 and web 3 differ then we'll have kevin talk about the universal web 3 integration standard and then ben from robin hole we'll talk about how you get more involved in the community and how rabbit hole works uh then we'll have lean in cover protocol kols there's going to be a lot to dig in there and we'll have dave going through uh going over just the benefits of units website pairs and how you can think about auto arbitrage then we'll have prabhav talk about the routing building blocks for unit swap and all the interesting things you can do there natasha will be talking about safeguard and then we'll have our final talk with boris who's going to talk about the stable uh and we'll be covering how the ugp subcommittees are set up and how they can all work uh together with each other so before we kick us into the very first talk i want to welcome boris from the grants program to share a few words about today what we have in plan and also ugp all together so uh without further ado let's welcome boris so hi guys uh my name is boris i'm from the unis for grant program to be more specific i'm the lead of the stable subcommittee focused uh on the individuals and the community uh maybe you're familiar with the units for grant program or maybe or not but what units for grant program does in general we try to uh you know uh help the units for core team grow the units of ecosystem and that does not mean only developer tools they also take care of the governance of the community of the user experience and everything in between first of all thank you each global team for organizing this thank you for having us uh and for the hackathon just quick two sentences we had an amazing response uh to our uh you know tasks for the hackathon we kind of left them open so anybody could build whatever they want but we have all over 40 teams building on top of uni swap which is amazing i took a quick look at the preliminary results and they saw different teams building one v2 v3 combining the two really interesting projects and hopefully some of the hackers are today with us in the chat yeah if you want to continue working on your hack uh you really enjoy working on that project and want to take it to the next step feel free to reach out to the unisport grant program we'll jump into the call we'll share some ideas uh f will be great uh as for the talks uh yeah uh as already mentioned some great talks today uh i'll be the last one so you'll see my face again but before that we'll cover some anti-fishing a little bit about governance uh serve that e theme which is as far as i know the only first level support team working in defy space 24 7 in our discord shout out to them and yeah all the other talks will be great really excited get your drink and snacks and enjoy the talks amazing thank you so much boris and uh looks like with that we are ready to kick us off with our first talk of the day so uh without further ado let's welcome jeremy to talk about proliferation of meta-governance structures jeremy welcome hey hey how's everyone doing all right awesome let me share my screen here all right so i'm jeremy guzman uh and i'm here to talk about a proliferation of metal governance structures so i'm really excited so quick introduction of who i am uh at the moment i'm a director of tech over at blockchain education network also the founder of mass adoption um and the potential governance champion over at uniswap which is extremely exciting stuff that we're doing both um at the ben end and on the unisoft band something that i'll touch on later on in the in the presentation so ultimately the bigger question here right as we've been seeing throughout all d5 is this emerging conversation of governance meta governance uh how can the community be uh more involved or earn participation um merits things of that nature and ultimately this goes down to the simple question of what is governance right so the the concept of governance has basically evolved to have like an array of definitions right um and i think we could consolidate them into three pretty basic fundamental uh rules right so number one is organizational organizational frameworks um that rely on the use of mechanisms individuals or basically both to carry out a set of rules policies and processes right um the second definition or second principle if you will is governance is the coordination of an organization's resources and actions to the use of contracts explicitly and implicitly something very interesting that we'll see as you transition into meta governance structures and lastly is the execution of all decisions and actions in transparent fashion right and is to ensure the accountability of all participants and stakeholders while affor while affirming organizational legitimacy um and overarching vision right so it's pretty basic uh pretty streamlined uh tenets right but now what begets of this is what it what determines or what dictates good governance right and that's something by and large has been in the conversation or circulating conversation within the crypto space for quite some time now now good governance tends to abide by five precepts right one is legitimacy and voice basically what this means is that the organization um in question uh decides or should be uh should be reached and uh decisions should be reached excuse me by broad consensus right and this is done through open frictionless communication or opportunities of communication to further stimulate uh participation within st uh by the stakeholders or or other participants within the community uh two is the direction of the organization or direction of this said entity right so everyone needs to be all hands on deck right in terms of understanding the organization or entities culture um there's the social complexities that lie within short and long-term goals etc right so decisions um have to be made with the overarching objectives in mind as well as the anticipated road map and future objectives in line or envision as well and thirdly is the performance right so efficiency and effectiveness in the name in the name of the organization is basically the name of the game right so participants and stakeholders they have to utilize any available resources uh to execute uh fruitful developments that will benefit the the protocol organizations at hand right and this trickles down into the fourth precept with the tr which is uh transparency right so there has to be an internal and external exhibition of accountability that's further reinforced by uh a democratic uh process whether that be in voting or that be a reason reaching consensus of some sort um transparency by and large is uh the the key to efficient performance right or efficient understanding uh and then lastly is just to be fair right good governance is to be fair in which organizations need to be steered by a rule-based decisions not not of discretion discretion-based decision ultimately um stimulates or provokes uh misunderstanding or misconstrued enough certain um proposed concepts that it really isn't um uh a good way to to organize or coordinate an organization right so this in turn produces equity and equality for all participants and stakeholders so as organizations grow we've seen that internal structures begin to consolidate or kind of constrict into these hierarchical shapes or structures right and participants begin reporting to a higher up of some sort what the president administrator ceo we've all seen in traditional um business or financial architectures right now the issue with these traditional structures is that as they grow or as they start becoming more hierarchical the bottom base or the foundation begins to decay or starts to carry the brunt of majority of the work or the responsibility and by and large have limited growth opportunity um or organizational equity right so that's a big problem and it's no bueno right so let's go ahead and transition into the meta structure which i think capitalizes and if not improves this this archaic hierarchical uh approach to uh to governance right so basically um as you can see here it's a participation for all kind of um ideation or idea right so meta governance aims to alleviate uh or potentially solve this problem of a centralized governance concept right so unlike a traditional counterpart uh meta governance tends to adhere to like a flat structure right so as we saw before is a high article it's a top down or up down whichever way you want to really label it but meta governance kind of eliminates that structure and just levels it for a fair participatory uh capacity for everyone to be have an equal voice right so meta governance again tends to adhere to this flat structure where stakeholders consist of governance token holders who actually have a genuine interest in the growth and improvement of the of the underlying protocol or product at hand right so since these uh tokens are available in the open market right uh gaining an equitable stake in is fairly feasible by and large right we could go on unit swap and go on any really decentralized exchange at this point and acquire a governance token and begin participating in in votes or the open conversation whatever that may be right so by holding these tokens right participants that have the ability to manage protocol resources in the form of let's say a treasury or and determine collective protocol parameters whether that be mining rewards or grants as we've seen in basically all protocols at this point um interest rates the list goes on and on right so they have an active role in the community and this virtually eliminates again this high agricultural structure and creates a community driven bottom up or top-down structure where governance power is widely uh accumulated and further disseminated into the protocol that allows for further implementation integration and overall adoption of this set protocol right so with this being said um ben has created this this sort of governance uh structure and let's let's go ahead and dive into what we've been up to over on the bedside so uh again with this being said over at ben we've embraced this exponential growth of meta governance and we really think that it resonates with our vision and our 10 10 goal right we want to grow within 10 years and have over a set amount of members within our uh with an organization member wise membership-wise and we think that this governance structure will be the next step towards towards getting to that goal so basically how this governance structure works is within each meta delegate community or committee which i'll get into in the next slide our members hold monthly to buy monthly calls to further scrutinize and maybe deliberate on forum discussions or proposals temperature checks consensus checks virtually anything that's going on in that said protocol and based on whatever decision is made or whatever uh topic of conversation really piques their interest uh the committee at hand will then execute an internal vote right so by this internal vote uh we'll kind of gauge the sentiment that's what we call as the sentiment check and we get to see where the committee lies for this particular proposal right so varying on the leaning of this of this vote um and if the proposal at hand that's being uh discussed upon it goes to a snapshot vote then from that internal vote it will transfer over to that snapshot vote so we'll vote on that particular leaning um if that snapshot vote proceeds to become an on-chain uh proposal or an on-team vote then the committee will reconvene and you know re-uh discuss the proposal at hand they'll re-initiate another uh internal vote and then they'll proceed to uh to submit the on-chain for the on-chain vote excuse me and we're not just limited to voting um we will also assist any emerging collegiate club um virtually anywhere that want to become their own delegate to attain uh voting power right so let's say by example i was the president and founder of mount st mary's uh blockchain club myself and some of my colleagues and let's say we wanted to delegate ourselves as a as a delegate on uniswap right but we don't unfortunately don't have the capital to uh acquire a substantial amount of uni to really have any real voice or voting power within the community so we'll reach out to let's say to the ben uh unison a delegate and submit a proposal saying hey um we need some voting power because we not only would like to participate in proposals and voting and things and the open discussion but potentially later down the line we'll also like to submit our own proposal um that will benefit the unit swap community right and then on the ben meta delegate side uh the community the community or the committee at hand will review this proposal um will talk to us over at mount st mary's side and say hey we're going to allocate x amount of voting power to you and we'll help them establish a delegate that they that they wish to to create which has been um very well up to this point and as of now we have about five meta delegate structures and we'll continue continuing to grow in fact we might come out with with an announcement later today or later on this weekend um but obviously the more pronounced meta metadelegate as of now is is uniswap it's our community is very lively as very proactive within the unit swap forums as well as uh just within the internal chats as well we're always creating new ideas and new proposals and stimulating the conversation on how can unit swap as a protocol improve to benefit not only the users but to also stimulate further growth to improve our overarching experience right we lately our our latest meta delegate announcement was with uh the meta steward with bitcoin and we're super pumped because with this meta steward we aim to uh support any entrepreneurial endeavors that maybe our student members may have and it aligns perfectly with git coins uh vision as well so it's a very nice synergy that we've established with that meta delegate again and we're growing almost on a weekly on a weekly basis at this point um but with that being said that's that's basically it that's my presentation um i appreciate everybody for showing up and i'm hoping for any questions thanks jeremy uh this was awesome thanks for uh not only a super amazing presentation but also super concise overview what's happening um so we have a couple questions coming in and i'll ask them here so the first question that we have is how do people make discussions on certain hot topics like what's what's the best way to kind of think about that and there's another question i'll ask for that so i'll start with this yeah that's a good question uh basically um all these discussions at least once you join the the committee right um it's held internally so we have our own telegram uh chat in fact we're um over at ben we're migrating over to what's known as the the band portal in which we'll carry out all uh governance conversation there but for now it's all held on telegram so um for whoever is interested you just hop on a telegram chat uh we basically again do these bi-monthly or monthly calls and we really just have at it we go into the forum and see what's the hot topic at hand what's the latest proposal latest conversation that's uh being uh talked about i guess a great example is uh harvard's latest um and basically controversial proposal right on on the education fund right that has been a hot topic within our committee for about two to three weeks now and it's been fantastic because we have a lot of turnout for our students so um yeah best way to do it is within our internal chat yeah got it and then there's a second part to that question and that is uh what if there was a uh so i guess maybe i'll try to interpret this but uh i think they're trying to ask um how do you kind of measure the the importance of that proposal so what if there's a formal proposal that we want to propose like a fee switch how does that kind of fall into your process yeah no that's a fantastic question and in fact the fee switch was a topic of conversation for for a little bit too um so basically again we we execute an internal vote and we gauge the sentiment on on our on our community let's call it a community or our committee right um so based on that on that internal check sometimes we even do a pre-check to the sentiment check right just to see where everyone's head is at and where the sentiment is pertaining to this particular particular conversation right um so then from there uh you know we'll scrutinize this proposal or the thread in the forum and see okay what are the pros and cons to this particular uh proposal um at hand right the the the fee switch or the education fund and will ultimately determine the outcome of where we see may not only best benefit unit swap as a protocol will also benefit the students or members or participants within the community to see how it uh improves their their experience as well got it a couple more questions coming in and what i'll do is we'll kind of ask uh some of them here but uh we also want to make sure that we're on time for our next talk so if we go over we'll uh i'll just ask jeremy to uh for you to join the chat on equivalent tv and answer those questions directly so another question is um and that's from ryan uh there's some university clubs becoming delegators for uni swap what's kind of the best way of understanding like where that community is growing and how they're getting involved and how do i keep up with what's happening and for context ryan is the president of the blockchain club in michigan nice nice well actually the blockchain club of michigan um is deeply embedded within uh within the ben culture so shout out to you brian thank you for hopping on the call really appreciate it um but uh actually can you repeat the question one more time i'm sorry so uh where can somebody go to learn more about uh being involved as a university delegate yeah absolutely matter of fact i could drop if not here i'll drop the link in the in the east global chat so everybody could check it out um but again basically we have these we have these committees uh not only for unit swap but we get uh with bitcoin a decentralian ah compound so on and so forth um so it's it's open to all students right or been members and that's basically where we conjugate and just discuss uh proposals and um and forum discussions right i mean if you want to see a leaderboard on voting power right um a fantastic uh platform that i'll suggest is tally charlie does an excellent job at aggregating all this information in into one dashboard and you can see the leaderboard you can see voting power up proportions i mean it's fantastic so if you want to check that out it's with tally.com go ahead and check it out and they have a list of all the supported [Music] protocols on their dashboard awesome well jeremy thank you so much for an amazing talk and hopefully you can join us on the chat and answer any following questions thank you for having me perfect so we are ready to move on to our next talk uh we're just going through some quick av checks and the next talk is by cherry v and uh she's going to be talking about cerveth and uh as soon as we have everything good to go on the av side we'll uh we'll kick off with our next talk so in the meantime for those of you who are joining us now um a quick reminder on how everything is structured today or you're all watching this thing on each global.tv which means that if you have any questions for our speakers on the chat you can ask them on on the chat box and we'll be able to relate them to our speakers and be able to answer them to you live and similarly anybody who logs in uh we'll also get it proof of attendance protocol nft for being an active participant at the uni grant summit so uh without further ado i'd like to welcome charity to talk about cervet and uh i'll have her do her intro and share the slide so welcome thank you good day to everyone this is cherry v and i represent starbet the uni swap customer support for this uni summit and by the way um apar uh this i would like to introduce you again my um my team surveyed support i would like to introduce you the services that we gave and continue to provide for uni swap as mentioned cervez is a customer support service that handles ethereum related questions service support was created in august 2020 after its founder mike azul to notice that many ethereum applications on discord servers originally mica tried to help out some of the projects themselves by answering questions but this quickly grew to be too time consuming unfortunately some of the applications um or some of the dapps don't have um the volume of questions necessary to hire their own in-house support team but they also can't utilize traditional support outsourcing services because ethereum support is too technical hence the birth of cervette support cervette started supporting uni swap during the launch and airdrop of the unit token in september 16 2020 unicef discord server was flooded by questions regarding the airdrop claim together with other ethereum related transactions that needed resolution sorry about that let me share my screen for a bit perfect thank you so much um so yeah um sorbet support aims to provide customers first touch on commonly asked questions we usually hang out on ethereum's discord server 24 7 to give technical support to answer ethereum related questions that are common we are trained in troubleshooting all of the common ethereum problems like gas price selection pending transactions gas limits token balance checks metamask issues and the likes we all easily learn basic basics of product offerings and assist users to the best of our abilities with using clients products as one of the moderators we protect the community from spam misinformation and irrelevant posts we also ban scammers from uni swept discord lastly we gather relevant information for issues that needed higher level escalation being a crypto company through and through we accept payments in the form of cryptocurrencies like east dye and usdc other coins are also accepted except for scam coins of course as for unit swap you get paid in the form of uni tokens we are composed of seven chat support representatives or professionals on hr and of course our ceo and founder micah zultu most of us have extensive work experiences in different international bpo companies like accenture ato's converges and teleperformance our founder is mike zoltu he is an independent software developer he works with ethereum projects and co-authors the original white paper for augur aside from that he also published a blog post describing an attack on maker down our team members like being cindy sherry ann dorsky dev la and yours truly are working from home while providing customer support for uni swap on shifting work schedules 24 hours a day seven days a week this is cervette's timeline from when we started last year up until the present the major events were highlighted on this presentation uh these were the uh these events were um during the airdrop of the unit tokens last year until the launching of the uni swap v3 this year we are proud to say that um servat has been and will continue to be a part of the uni swaps journey and progress by way of providing answers to the units of communities concerns cervette support have handled most of the questions questions we handled are mainly focused on level one issues so if we encounter challenging questions that needed answers that we can directly resolve referring them to the right people or channels is also part of what we do to help and this way we cover more and more people's questions and not leave them frustrated by not getting any response at all since september 2020 more than six six thousand questions were answered by sir beth which was roughly eighty percent of the total questions we fielded upon looking at the pie chart you can also see that 15.2 percent were answered by uni swap friends helpers contributors and admins and 4.7 were answered by other units of discord servers or users taking action immediately is what we believe to be the best thing to do and we can find the like making efforts to help union swap users in getting their issues resolved firsthand as much as possible on average there are more than 8 000 active units of users in discord daily we've taken on majority of the user questions currently questions are mostly managed privately in tickets which are visible only to the admins survey support team and other uniswep helpers on looking at the chart you can see that 2160 or 45.5 percent of the total questions were answered in tickets so 26.9 percent were in troubleshooting channel 24.3 percent in general channel 2.7 in liquidity providers channel and less than one percent in other channels there was a lot but we only saved three of our feedbacks that we can showcase on here with you and this uni summit take short time to read through some of [Music] these if you have any thoughts and what areas you can improve on let us know um thank you so much guys for your time and don't hesitate to contact us on survey discord if you have any questions regarding our services the floor is open for questions if you have any awesome well thank you so much for that that was an amazing overview of how you work uh maybe just uh we'll kind of wait a minute or so to see if audience questions come in um and uh and relate them here but if not i'll still ask you to just uh hang out on the chat on inktober.tv and see if any questions comes in uh in a few minutes just answer them directly over text uh maybe one question from my end would be just to understand sort of how you think about tracking uh like how do you think about actually managing um how effective you are and sort of how do you actually measure that across so many different channels that you can get support on so do you have any internal frameworks of understanding how you're doing um in terms of managing your incoming requests and then seeing how effective the team is we do have um our manual way in i mean seven of us uh um seven of our team members are manually tracking each questions that we answer we just count them not really literally tracking everything else we just count every questions that we answered so that's how we were able to gather the numbers that we have presented this on here today that's awesome another question from the audience is um how do you handle technical questions that come in whether it's with v3 or something specifically so for example for the hackathon that's going on does that overlap nicely with your goals um for for new issues or so for example for v3 we were able to ask our ceo mike zultu for for any new information we also asked unistop helpers and other admins we work together with them to be able to provide the right answers for questions awesome well thank you so much for that amazing overview trevi and uh i hope that others are able to join you and hop out on on survey so um thanks again and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk so i want to introduce our next speaker um dimitar and because the time zone constraints uh we ended up recording uh this talk and uh we'll be able to uh we'll just play a video here directly uh for this talk instead and if somebody has any questions dimitar will be able to answer them on the chat later so without further ado i'll let um let's play the video try to keep it fairly brief my internet identity outer ego is dubster my background is mostly related to it i've been working in it since 1996 back when the internet was accessible via dial up and unfortunately a lot of things have changed but a lot of things have remained the same when compared to the early days of the internet the so-called wild west and if we compare the digital revolution i guess that's happening right now with the decentralized finance systems like uni swap and i guess in a way is uh comparable to the basically to the way internet changed our lives two decades or three decades ago and when it comes to phishing attacks users are somewhat protected when it comes to let's say traditional or web-based web 2 based phishing as opposed to web 3 based fishing which is more or less a bit again like the wild west unfortunately and the key difference is i guess from what was that from from a scammer's perspective the the chances of getting caught versus the return of investment there isn't a big danger for threat adversaries and threat actors who fish mostly crypto because it's largely unregulated and some authorities don't even know what to do and or are not technically prepared to deal with such kinds of such kind of internet threats and again anti-fishing vendors are well acquainted with traditional phishing methods that are targeting web 2 organizations let's say ebay or netflix or banking and the worst case scenario if somebody gets phished in such an attack what happens is that they either lose their credentials or their digital identity let's say if somebody loses their netflix somebody could use their account or if somebody loses their ebay somebody could beat on their behalf or maybe do fraudulent transactions resulting in money was or purchasing ebay vouchers but all of those events are more or less mitigatable by contacting the relevant entity let's say netflix or ebay and up to a certain amount losses are redeemable in the banking world most banks have some sort of deposit guarantees even though they are more or less imaginary due to the quantity of easing and artificial printing printing of money which is uncontrolled and is totally tolerated by the central banks and of course the regional banks do whatever suits them so even though they are broke basically most of the banks they still lent money to institutions and people alike but if you get fished they will at least try to return the losses and this is the big difference in the web3 world if you get fished basically that's it it's early assets won't be recovered so in that aspect it's very crucial to to target web3 fishing specifically and tackle it in a little bit different way than the traditional fishing and i have just a few methods here that i have prepared it's nothing see well we do actually have a bunch of non-disclosure agreements and the methods that i cannot show but the ones i can show you are already uploaded and they are applicable both to web 2 and web 3 phishing the key difference is that in the web 3 world we have to shut down the bedsides as fast as possible and add them to all sorts of blacklists like google save browsing just so that we can protect users in almost real time the other bit that i do in order to protect users even if a given phishing site has not been taken down yet is to add the the phishing urls to to github namely in the meta mask it phishing detect repository and by doing that anybody who has the metamask extension is actually protected even behind before the site gets revoked and that's actually the power of open source anybody can contribute here and this is really a nice thing and this information gets consumed by a lot of entities so not only metamask but wallet connect trust wallet and other vendors also consume it so let's go to the methods and dive in the first one is fairly straightforward just use any email that has been leaked i guess everybody has such email that was leaked somewhere and simply wait for phishing to arrive there and then report it the first place to report it is spam cop because it checks the urls and it automatically sends the reports to the relevant entities then we can send the bad urls to vendors like fish tank urlscan or netcraft or fishfort so the more vendors of the bad content the better and this is uh again it's good to have uh let's say some fish is gay offense so it opens from only a given country the more vendors flag it the the higher the chances are it will get revoked even without reports being sent to the registrar so the other bit that we do this is perhaps my favorite bit it's done in real time the script's called fishing catcher by source it's open sourced and it can be used to sniff a search stream in real time and what it does is basically checks kalidok's stream which is service provided by sectigo and it matches any weird so to speak domain names based on a scoring system this scoring system uses a bunch of checks and mathematical checks and language similarity checks to check out let's say variations of brands that we're interested in so let's say uniswap.com cc or something like this was registered the moment the threat actors create a certificate for it that the clock starts ticking because we see this in the certificate stream so this is a neat way to actually monitor everything that's happening on to ssl level and that way we can have a sneak peak at scammers activities the other thing it's a retrospective check it's called hunting newly registered domains it's a python script again it's more or less does the same but instead in real time it does it for the day before so let's say today it's the 2nd of july we grab a file which contains all new files i mean sorry all new domains which were registered on the 1st of july and again if they can contain a keyword which is interesting to us let's say uniswap we can again observe the results the other scent that i tend to use for catching phishing is url scan and it's very nice because uh scammers are lazy they tend to reuse their both hosting domains and scam templates so by hashing um a given file we can experimentally find other sites which have those file there so that way even if domain has nothing to do with uni swap let's say it's a completely different domain or defaced site if it has the fish the fishing kit inside of it we can grab it as long as somebody scanned it on url scan this is applicable again to file names so let's say metamask logo is svg file and it's fairly often used so we can simply search for this svg file and find metamask fishes same goes for hashes so hash hash sums of the files same vps this is scammers tend to reuse a lot of hosting providers especially bulletproof hosting like for example close back ukraine or craigsfaxpax russia so those registrars and hosters don't usually pay attention to abuse reports and thus on the same ip address it's likely to find more than one fish other vendors like security trail and security trails risk iq and dns dumpster also allow us to deep dive into the bad guys infrastructure and find even more scams so by finding one scam by observing where it's hosted we can find even more scams and the last bit of my so-called presentation i don't know how the time goes but whatever so this those are the common ways scammers try to scam users i'll be very brief on those so fake youtube videos you you've seen those they use supported systems to generate views so that youtube's algorithms pick it up and user who users who are interested in crypto will receive the video in their site view as a related live stream or whatever and usually there is a recording of an existing event but they just change the text and it's like hey i'm vitalik and i'm sending you 5 8 if you send me two first or whatever so this is the other scam in the book and oddly enough it still works the bad thing is youtube are too slow to take those down and it's a constant guacamole game bitcoin revolution scams those are again very common depending on where you live the sites are made so that let's say if you're in the uk and you open the bitcoin revolution scams you will see a famous person who is in the uk let's say sir jeremy clarkson uh or some tv personality who got rich from crypto and whatever and if you're in um the u.s it will be a famous u.s person and so on and they those are semi legit because they're always related to legitimate payment services but they ultimately seek to rob investors and they then disappear fake exchanges and investment platforms those are the same those are a dime a dozen i mean there are so many and so much they constantly spam with them and they only change the woko and the name so it's easy to spot them once you have one sample twitter verified scans again very of often seen and unfortunately hard to tackle twitter is late what what can you do it's useful to monitor those because that way we can see the urls used by the scammers and nuke them and report them two is they do all sorts of trickery like they find a legitimate tweet by a legitimate crypto person and they use reply scam with stolen verified accounts so that it looks like as if the same person replied to the to their own tweet but it's actually a different one discord dm unsolicited spam so again very often every day we have uh spamming discord we try to warn users we have all sorts of uh warning messages like don't uh don't do this don't do that but it's i mean users ignore it and yet we have is we constantly spam with this thing and it doesn't really help what can you do uh fake icos those are well again from 2017 nothing has changed but people still fall for them well some of them are pretty complex and have like a provo trickery and other hidden functions that can still rob you and the red polio so always be careful and the fake uni swap notes that's like resynchronize your wallet or whatever fake reason to enter your seed phrase never enter your seed phrase compromise device this is the tough one well if your computer tablet or iphone gets hacked and you use it to trade crypto it's a matter of time that you'll be robbed and unfortunately usually very high profile targets are victim of this so it's spear fishing plus whaling so whaling is like fishing but targeting uh very rich people and the last vector i guess is fake hardware wallet supports which make you enter again your face phrase sim swapping is very dangerous but only if you use two-factor authentication with gsm socially social engineering attacks this is again similar to the discord the spam but can vary fake wallets and google play store apps very big vector for scammers to operate and unfortunately hard to take down and the last i think pieces fake forms in google uh google forms or other forms which are like uh hey do you want to participate in this airdrop enter your stuff here and you're good to go so those are the common ways scammers try to scam users of course the list is not comprehensive and we tried to circumvent the front circumvent the fraudsters as much as we can but it's it really is a constant wacomo game so thank you for the support and for your time and i hope this has been at least to some extent useful cheers amazing thank you so much to meet our um super interesting overview and all the different techniques people use uh to uh to fish and spam uh we don't have any questions yet from our audience but also given the lag um in terms of the live streaming delay we'll uh we'll give some some time and what we'll do is i'll just ask you to join the live chat on global.tv so if more questions come up we can you can just answer them directly over text um we are running a little bit behind on schedule so um he seems like you're already there um so that's this is great says any if anybody has any questions for dimitar he'll be able to answer them for you so what i want to do is quickly move on to our next uh talk and i want to welcome kevin uh to talk about polywrap and polywrap is a universal web 3 integration standard and now kevin will be happy to tell you more so kevin i'll ask you to turn your camera on and whenever you're ready you can share your screen hey everyone uh yeah thanks for having me um i'm kevin oh i'm wearing many hats at polywrap but uh in general i do developer relations engineer uh software engineering and some operations work so here uh today i'm going to talk about our project polywrap and our goal is to become the universal web3 integration standard before i dive into the tool chain i just want to talk about the history for a bit polywrap was first conceived at hack fs in august 2020 by jordan caesar roberto and ori and it was elected as a finalist at the hackathon which gave the project a lot of attention it gave it the momentum it needed to grow into a dao which is a decentralized autonomous organization with 60 plus members we were able to raise funding attract talented developers and some amazing launch partners uh some of our launch partners include wallet connect fleek gnosis three bucks labs pocket network tourists and many more um just a note about our launch partners um these are partners that have been helping us during our pre-alpha um and the ways they help us is you know reviewing our documentation helping us with development doing press releases and a lot of other things so yeah if any of you are watching any launch partners are watching thanks so much um and some other news where we've been working on pre-alpha and our alpha version will be releasing in about a month and jordan one of the original developers on polyrap will be speaking at youth cc in paris later this month so polywraps solve what we call the web3 integration problem so how do we define integration integration for web3 developer is if you want to um integrate protocol business logic let's say like unit swap or make your dowse um like unit 12 swap function or add liquidity functions or make your dials mint die or you know deposit collateral if you want those into your own decentralized application um that's what integration is in web3 and it's difficult today because of the tools that we have and um to really understand web3 integration we have to start with webview and what integration looks like in the web 2 era so in web2 um if you're a website developer and you want to integrate api logic into your application um for example reddit twitter google or stripe all you have to do is send a rest a query to a rest endpoint and um for example twitter would tweet on your behalf and it's it's fairly easy to do um there's a lot of tools for this and there's a lot of standards because um you know it's been around for a long time and you know exactly where to send the the fetch request with web3 uh centralized servers are replaced by decentralized networks like ipfs or the ethereum blockchain um so so uh protocol to interact with protocols what protocol developers have done is create sdks that you can integrate into your decentralized application and most of these sdks are in javascript so all the business logic that used to live on centralized servers are now bundled into your application allowing you to interact with protocols like do queries or mutations and while this is great there are a lot of issues when it comes to these types of sdks especially with javascript so what are the issues with javascript one it's not standardized so if you were trying to integrate say the business logic of uni swap maker and gnosis into your app they're all written in in different ways and you'll find that it's going to be difficult for them to be composable the second reason is that it's not scalable so um when you want to integrate more and more business logic into your decentralized app you'll have to download more sdks into the dap this is going to bloat the dap increase the bundle size and just make the app run a little bit slower the reason is javascript's low and insecure so we all know that in the crypto space and in the blockchain space that security is paramount to the success of any protocol so this is a huge factor too and lastly javascript is not multi-platform the javascript is a language that's written um primarily for the web develop developers and if you wanted to say developer uh your app on a drone or some other iot device it's going to be a bit harder so what what a what a protocol developer has to do is develop maybe another sdk in another language and this presents another issue because now they have to maintain multiple sdks at once which increases like the maintenance costs so our solution to the web3 integration problem is polywrap so with polywrap we're trying to take the ease of web 2 development and how easy it was to integrate api logic into your applications without sacrificing decentralization so the idea is that you would write a protocol business logic and bundle it into a what we call a poly wrapper or a wrapper and then deploy that wrapper to the centralized endpoint like ipfs then your client when it launches would download these wrappers at runtime um and be able to use the exported wasn't modules so i'll go into more detail about what that all means and for our example we'll be using uni swap so we developed a uni swap wrapper and uh what it is and this will be the same for any um rapper whether it's uni swap or gnosis or any other protocol but the the composition of the wrapper is pretty similar so you have a manifest file in yamo format and all this does is that it orchestrates the package then you have a graphql schema file um so wrap wrappers are queried at runtime um using graphql in your application so this graphql schema file will provide the types and the the the shape of the the queries that you can send to this package and most importantly it contains the business logic of uni swap in walls and modules so webassembly um allows for exporting functions that can be used in your javascript application so all this is done at runtime you can build your webassembly business logic using different language that compiles bouncy webassembly so for example right now we have support for assembly script which compiles down to webassembly and then once you wrote all your business logic um and the graphql schema you can deploy to the centralized endpoint in this example we're using ipfs but we also have support for enfs and more support for other methods coming soon so here's what happens at runtime your application launches if it's enabled with a polywrap then the polywrap standard will will download um the business lot the the wrapper at runtime which includes the business logic in webassembly modules uh webassembly the webassembly modules export functions like save swap or functions that let you add liquidity and then they could be used in your application so unlike a javascript sk none of the business logic is bundled into your application it's all at runtime and since webassembly doesn't assume running in a web environment there's potential for your application to use business logic in any type of environment so today we have support for web apps but it's possible to you know run daps on your apple watch for example or the phone or even a drone and again webassembly it can be written in just one language that compiles down to webassembly so this could be assembly script but pretty soon we have support for rust and go um so unlike uh like protocol developers creating sdks they don't have to create a separate one for javascript or python and be able to mb4s to maintain all those they just need to write one sdk in one language so yeah there's unlimited possibilities for um when it comes to polywrap today we have about maybe six rappers deployed to ipfs with the major ones being uni swap and ens but um we are going to be developing more and we're we're going to have bounties open for uh people to contribute to the project and create their own wrappers and deploy to ipfs to expand the ecosystem so now i'm going to talk about the developer experience of polywrap and how you would integrate it into your your decentralized application or that so all you have to do um a few steps so the first is to install the client so npm install at polygraph slash client-gas and by the way this is assuming you're you're creating a javascript application today we have the client in javascript but we're writing it for python uh in the future too and second um any protocol is just a request away but once you instantiate the client you can call the query methods on it so here where we have a query method and it accepts one object which has two properties a uri that points to the wrapper that you want to use so in this case we want to use the unit swab business logic so we're pointing to where the uni swap business logic is being deployed which is e s slash api.uniflop.edu and then in the the query property the value is a string that um that shows which which method we want to use from the business logic so here you can specify either mutation or query here we're using mutation and we're showing that it's a just a generic swap function now building your wrapper this is if you're a protocol dev team that wants to build your wrapper and deploy to a decentralized endpoint for other people to use so first you would define your schema and graph the graphql file and on the left here we have the the type which is a generic query and then a generic method with arguments custom type and it returns a string and then on the right you would implement walls and functions so what you see on the right here is a language called assembly script and it's and you notice that if you're from a javascript or typescript background it looks very similar so if you have a typescript background you can you'll most likely be able to implement something like this but what we're doing here is importing the custom types that we wrote from w3 w3 is just a custom folder that holds code generated types that you can use in your your wasm implementation and here we're defining different functions inside the that would hold the business logic and you can customize it however you want and it's highly composable um so this means that you're able to import other wrappers that are deployed into your own wrapper which is really cool so here on the left we're importing like a generic query from another wrapper that's deployed into our application and then on the wrap on the right we're able to import that query and use its methods so just reviewing the benefits of using polywrap it's multi-platform meaning that it can run in any environment that can execute wads and functions it's hyper composable meaning that you have other wrappers that you can lean on as dependencies and put into your application it's fast and secure because it used webassembly the webassembly is a low-level language and it runs very quickly in the browser and all webassembly modules are given allocated their own memory to use so it's pretty secure and it's scalable because no business logic is bundled into your application the only thing you have to install in a javascript application is the javascript client cool so now i'll head over to our demo all right um what you see here is the uni v2 swap page except that our team uh went through the entire interface codebase for the swap swap page and we replaced all the unisop javascript sdk with our own polywrap functions which was a huge task so i'm going to show you how the swap works but first i want to show you the deployed polywrap the univ2 polywrap business logic so we deployed it to enf which is the ethereum name service and if we go down here um you'll see this is going to be the uri that we ping with graphql and you can see the content that it resolves to in this case it's an ipfs hash and this ipfs is going to hold the business logic so if i click this it'll send me over to ipfs and you can see this is what we consider the wrapper so it has the yaml files that orchestrate the entire package again it has the graphql schema that provides the type and the the shape of the query that you can send to the package and most importantly it has the webassembly modules which were originally written in assembly script but compiled down to webassembly we separated mutation which is functions that provide write operations with queries which is just allows you to fetch data from the protocol so this package is downloaded at runtime and just showing you the code here on the top here we have three uh functions that are called when you perform a swap best trade exact swap call parameters and exact call and this is what the code looks like in your decentralized app so here after you instantiate the polywrap client you can call the query methods on it and we're pointing to the ens uri that you saw earlier which resolves to the the polywrapper and then you can call queries so here we're calling query and we're specifying the function that we want to use in the exported the instantiated webassembly module that exports these functions and here we have a variables objects that can hold variables to be injected in this template literal so if i go over to the variables tab you can see the different variables that are being put into the query so i'm going to perform a swap here just wait a little bit and then click this to perform the swap and then metamask will pop up and then we'll just wait for a little bit for the transaction to confirm but yeah what you just saw is um all the the business logic of uni swap v2 happening at runtime so if we open etherscan here we can see that the successful cool all right well thank you everyone this has been pretty fun and uh you know if you want you can follow me on discord and twitter is on the bottom left here or please visit our website we're looking for contributors and uh looking for people to join our community the community is super supportive like if you have any questions with building your polywrap applications or wrappers you can just ping me or anyone in the channel so yeah thank you so much amazing thank you so much kevin uh that was an awesome overview i feel like uh it's been uh so amazing to watch the grid the web3 api into polywrap over the past almost 12 months now so i'm just super excited to see that was an amazing demo that you were able to do and especially at runtime and all the cool things that you're working on so there's a question from the audience that i want to just ask is is there a use case for polywrap for non-developers right now or are you strictly aiming this to where it's just developers for more composability yeah it's a it's a dev tool chain so it's strictly for developers right we we try to think of two types of main developers developers who want to integrate polywraps that are already deployed into their applications or protocols that want to build their own wrappers everything's open source so it's on github right now so visit our github and you can see the source code but yeah it's mostly for developers right now well hope that answers your question to me um i have a question on my end uh what are some of the upcoming i guess whether they're features or problems or open issues that you still have to kind of iron out like what does that look like and what kind of things can we expect in the future yeah one exciting thing we have on our roadmap is um what's called the polywrap hub and basically this is a ui interface a ui to view all deployed wrappers and easily it's like a marketplace where you can view them and then integrate them into your dap and then even test them on the spot right there in the application so that's coming soon and uh yes so stay tuned for that awesome well uh thank you so much kevin for an amazing talk and for any other questions that come up feel free to ask them here and we'll be able to rate the those questions to kevin and he can also join the chat and answer them directly for you so with that uh looks like we are running in a couple of technical difficulties here we go um what i want to do is introduce our next speaker now we are a little bit ahead of schedule so we'll kind of let our next speaker go ahead and we'll just take a quick break after this chat so up next we have ben from rabbit hole and ben's going to talk about how rabbit hole works and how to dive into this ecosystem so without further ado please welcome ben thanks for having me guys really appreciate it and looking forward uh to telling you a bit more about rabbit hole and how we're enabling the future of work on in crypto let's see i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen um is it showing up okay yes great um so i'm ben um the operations lead at rabbit hole um rabbit hole is a platform that guides users um for lack of a better upon going down the crypto rabbit hole um and helps them learn about how to use different crypto applications while earning uh crypto for for doing so um i'm here today to tell you about how we're enabling um the future of work so right now um crypto is exploding in interest um getting more and more mainstream traction publicity media coverage um and it's really great um but if you if you look down and you start digging into the details only a really tiny fraction of people are actually using uh crypto products and and d5 specifically um if we look at this chart there's almost 150 million ethereum addresses out there just under 50 million of them actually um hold ethereum and then um even a smaller percentage of that are actually using the crypto products and the d5 products that are so important to the ecosystem if you look on ether scan they they say that there's only about 200 to 300 000 daily active users right now um which is which is a problem um you know if if we want crypto to reach its full potential we need people using these products and we need people figuring out how to learn to get involved and to contribute um and to to really start becoming crypto native users now even for people that want to use crypto products um it's really difficult to do so there's dozens of projects launching every week um millions of dollars flowing into the ecosystem whether that's uh through venture capital money or speculative investments uh and and this creates a lot of noise um and as a result projects can't find the users that they're looking for and users are getting confused on where to start and if if we take a look at why this is happening um the current system is not inducive uh for people to use and get involved the memes and all the focus are on speculation um that's going to perpetuate a a certain a certain narrative and unfortunately people don't realize that a lot of people don't even realize that there are applications to be used if you ask the average person they think crypto is synonymous with currency they don't realize that there's actually applications like uniswap that you can be using that are that sit at the basis of all this um hopefulness uh for the future of web3 um moving past that even if you do want to get involved onboarding is scary crypto creates um a lot of a lot of difficult situations for new users you have to figure out how to set up a wallet how to make sure that you're using the right platforms how do you know if this is even a smart contract that you can that you can trust um it's a it's a big shift in having to take on the responsibility as a user that crypto um gives to each user and and that can be tough for for new people that are looking to get involved and then from the project side um acquiring users is highly inefficient and especially the right kind of users you know most of our acquisition channels that we typically go to are not crypto native you think about ads or twitter that's all based in the legacy web 2 system it's highly expensive and there's no real guarantee that those are going to even result in uh positive outcomes for your project so rabbit hole is trying to fix all this what we do is we create quests that users can complete quests are essentially time box challenges where we say if a user goes and completes a certain task or multiple tasks we will reward them with a projects token for doing so this solves the problems that we've been talking about in a two-sided way for projects we help them increase participation on their platforms and help them find the contributors that they are looking for for individuals um we help them learn about use and onboard into crypto networks and all the while um they're earning crypto for doing so uh this is incredibly exciting where we've seen great results and i think especially where we're doing this in a crypto native way crypto web 3 in general opens up a number of new paradigms and possibilities for what we can do and we're tapping into those new possibilities for our solution so we're paying people people are earning for learning and onboarding into these networks with projects native tokens we're using gnosis safe um we are actually verifying that people complete the tasks that they say they do and we're using subgraphs on the graph to do so and then we have the issue of civil resistance uh it's the one of the things that people often think about is well how do you stop somebody from just continuously completing the tasks and collecting all the rewards well we actually use bright id for proof of a unique human so that we know that all rewards are paid out to actually unique individuals and we've only launched six or seven months ago but in december but since then we've delivered a some really exciting and impactful results for some of the biggest projects in crypto over 10 000 individual addresses have completed a task on rabbit hole we've distributed over a hundred thousand dollars in rewards and just to give uh a bit more of a sense of what we can actually do for a project um i'll highlight the recent quest we did with pool together which wrapped up about two weeks ago so pull together for those who don't know is a no loss lottery uh platform what that means is you deposit into pool together's pools um which is essentially functions as a savings account but you're entered into a lottery so that every week or two weeks someone wins a large chunk of cash pool together had a pool that you know was not necessarily as big as some of their other pools on polygon layer 2 ethereum solution and so they wanted to drive new users to deposit into their uh polygon usdt pool we worked with pool together to design a quest to do this and we drove a greater than a 300 percent increase in unique depositors in this pool which is a very substantial accomplishment this in turn uh when these users were rewarded for uh doing this quest to increase the number of pull together token holders uh by over 12 percent which in our opinion will have really strong impact on their community longer term so these are the types of things that we're really excited about delivering for both projects and users and we look forward to doing more of in the future um obviously we're here at the unit swap summit so wanted to give everybody a sneak peek of a quest that we have that will be launching in the next week or two we're not sure on the exact date yet so you'll have to stay up to date on our twitter or if you want join our discord uh for updates on uh on this quest but we will be partnering with uniswap to run a quest where we incentivize users for doing two tasks one make a swap on the uniswap platform um for any token and then two provide liquidity into any token pair um on the unit squad platform so we're really excited to be partnering with unifop on this um and and really we view this as just the start of a much longer term partnership um as you know the rabbit hole platform grows and evolves and really as uniswap's needs evolve over time we look forward to to being able to work together and incentivizing a number of different actions which we will get into a bit more shortly so this is just the start right now we're using quest to incentivize users to participate and contribute to crypto networks at a really early stage um but soon uh rabbit hole will be your on-chain resume so if we take a step back and and we think about what quests are fundamentally doing really we're we're taking an on-chain action verifying that it occurred and then rewarding people um for doing it and and credentialing it and ensuring that it actually happened when you think about a quest this way it becomes clear that there's so many more possibilities for for what you can do with this this type of process really what we're talking about here is building a foundational level of reputation where we're able to verify actions that took place credential them and make them legible and composable all across the ecosystem which is incredibly ambitious and something that's never been done before but it speaks to the the amazing capabilities that are enabled by um web3 so it's the first step in that direction we will soon be launching launching skills on our on our platform so what skills are if you if you think about quest quests are time box challenges where users come to our platform and have a certain amount of time to complete a task and get rewarded for it skills are now going to be evergreen tasks that users can come to rabbit hole and complete and earn an on-chain credential which shows that they know how to do something they've mastered a certain um action and that they're able to then use um to represent that they know this to the outside world um that's really cool um not necessarily in a vacuum but specifically the things that you can do with this this is going to unlock very unique opportunities that are that we're really excited about so for one if you think about token distributions when a project is new they're trying to distribute tokens to their user base or i should say who they think is their user base and they don't really have a good way of doing this right now um most projects use retroactive airdrops but these aren't particularly targeted they cast a very wide net and there's no way of knowing if those tokens are going to the right people our sense is that they're mostly going to people who care a lot more about speculation than actual communities so we see a path where rabbit hole can help different projects with token distributions in that they'll distribute tokens to a user after they have verified that they've provided value to the actual platform or network or community on the other hand the quest that we're still doing will be able to enhance their power and their abilities as we continue to build out the platform if you think about how skills can work into quests um you can only open up quests to certain people who have a specific skill so for uniswap you might only want uh people participating that are expert liquidity providers so that you can help filter and service the right people for your platform so a bit more on the specifics of what is actually possible um with an on-chain resume with the platform that rabbit hole is building um if if you're a platform who wants to do a token distribution um you know you could both filter for a certain type of person and based on their actions so you could only open up your token distribution to expert yield farmers who have both deposited and staked on your platform that helps you verify that these people are actually one the right people that you want in your platform and two that they've actually helped and provided value that they such that they deserve to be rewarded with your token um two let's say you're a platform that is um your your community has been a bit quiet as of late and you really want to increase the activity that's ongoing in the governance process you could use a rabbit hole quest to attract people who have been verified as protocol protocol politicians meaning these are people that have that we've verified as having created and passed governance proposals in communities and you could use a rabbit hole quest to attract them to your community so in this way rabbit hole and the system we're creating is really poised to become a talent and reward allocation mechanism for the larger web3 space but that's a extremely difficult vision to execute on and not only that it's one that's pretty foundational and uh creates a lot of dependencies for others in the ecosystem um and we believe that's the type of vision that's best um to be decentralized um there's a lot of questions that we have to answer internally before we do that we have to figure out how to move a lot of our manual work right now into smart contracts we have to figure out how to maintain quality and a certain level of work with the the quest system and the things that the core team is doing right now but we are really excited because we just announced the first step in this decentralization process and we're calling that the pathfinder program so through the pathfinder program we are starting to involve external contributors in our core function of creating and executing on tasks so there's four ways to get involved in our pathfinder program you can be a steward which is someone who goes to communities creates proposals and hopefully is involved in the entire governance process to pass proposals to approve rabbit hole quests you can be a navigator which deploys subgraphs on the graph which enables rabbit hole to query data this the sub graph is how we verify that people take actions uh complete certain actions and we can't verify if there's a verify in action if there's no subgraph so this is an extremely pivotal role in allowing us to create new quests we have the crafts mineral which is a role to design nfts that can be awarded as trophies to users who complete quests the the craftsman role we're really excited about because it can further enhance the rewards that we're providing to users and really strengthen our community and then the the pioneers which will create content that guide users through completing the quest if you think back to the early part of this talk starting to use crypto products and applications is a really scary process and we want to provide the necessary content and guardrails that are necessary such that people can use new new applications with confidence big picture vision though uh this is also uh enhancing our main goal of further immersing more and more people in the more and more users and contributors in the web3 world so if you think about what we're doing um first we are creating quests for which that we are receiving a fee in a project's governance token that enables us to become a governance delegate in different communities across the crypto ecosystem what we'd like to do with this governance voice is to be an advocate for the users and contributors that we're creating our product for it's hard for users and contributors to have much of a voice simply because it to to have a bigger voice you need to own more and more governance tokens and that's not easy for the average person to do so rabbit hole hopes that with as we do more and more quests and we gain more and more governance tokens that we can be the voice for the users and contributors in the larger community then over time as we decentralize into a dow this power then gets transferred over to the stewards of the rabbit hole network who are the actual users and contributors themselves um this enables them to get further involved in governance to further advocate for themselves and to help design the web 3 world that they would like to see and be a part of which is incredibly exciting for us so thank you for for attending and listening um if you're interested in being part of a quest earning crypto for learning building your on-chain resume or contributing please visit our website rabbithold.gg join our discord or reach out to me directly at benchhector on telegram and twitter thank you guys really appreciate it awesome thank you so much ben that was a really great overview of rabbit hole and everything that you're doing um i think we may have a question there but i'm waiting for the person to clarify something that wasn't super clear so in case we don't hear back from that attendee i'll just ask you to uh join the chat and answer that person directly a question on on my end is um how do you tie in the activity on chain uh with rabbit hole and the the protocol or any service that you're looking at is is this tracked like for example if you're tracking with whether a user did something or not is that all was like mostly done on the front-end side or are there actual contracts keeping track of this thing and how do you kind of think about all the edge cases for those types of cases or campaigns yeah so once a user completes a task let's say we're let's talk about the uniswap quest that we're about to launch um i go to uniswap i swap a token and then i go back to rabbit hole confirm that i did that task and then on our back end we query the unity swap subgraph to confirm that the address associated with your rabbit hole account actually completed that task um so that's one thing that we're we're involved in that process right now where we're using subgraph data but that's one thing that we you know as we decentralized like to move into an automated smart contract awesome and i think this is sort of i believe what the last question was touching on and the question was are there many sub graphs on a per version basis uh but i'm not sure if that yeah makes sense no that's okay um i think i'll answer this in a few ways um one is that we're clearly early um in the grass development in the larger web3 ecosystem development and so you know there there are times where we are working with the project and there's not a subgraph available um for us to to use um and so we have to push that project off for a bit we have to contract somebody out um to build that that's part of the reason we're so excited about the pathfinder program is because we can turn that into more of a community endeavor right we can have external contributors um create and deploy those subgraphs and then share the rewards from request for doing so um which is really exciting right now you know the the more popular applications and protocols do have some options on for subgraphs um for example unit swap will have more than a smaller protocol just naturally because you know you sub graphs are created based on their perceived popularity um but we're really excited over time for subgraphs to grow in popularity and for more and more to be created and deployed and we work um really closely with the great team over at the graph awesome well thank you so much for clarifying that and hopefully uh that answers dimi's question um i want to thank you again for this uh amazing talk and i can't wait to see what else comes out of the new pathfinder program great thanks so much guys really appreciate it all right so with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and that is going to be on protocol kols by leland so you know leave me whenever you're ready feel free to share your screen and uh welcome perfect hi so hi i'm leland um and i worked i worked on protocol kols some beef brief overview about myself i currently work at galaxy digital working on the investing team prior to this i did a lot of freelancing work helping protocols with design work or front-end engineering and here we're going to present about protocol 100 which is a project i built that was funded by unisoft grant leland i think the screen share is uh working properly so we want to just give that a shot one more time i think we're stuck on a froze perfect and then yep everything's good great so going through the ugp journey um got a grant early last year to the rice early this year to build out a governance dashboard and then i happened to get a full-time job and then so like as a process turns out i was like okay i will work on it this weekend i will work on next weekend and turns out several months later the entire market has moved and at the time when i talked to ken i was like hey can i really want to work on a governance dashboard that shows the current progress of proposals like who's voting on what how they're voting how's the vote changed um but by the time i really started building it the market had moved already and we have companies like tally and border and really feel that niche and then at that point i realized there's no point in building another you know governance dashboard that just replicates what other people are building so it's back to the drawing board like what is new that we can build that hasn't been built before and at the time it seemed like these tools are really good at showing snapshots of protocols you look at a protocol in isolation but it's not great at you know combining protocols together so the question was like what's some interesting data that we can show that like you know aggregates protocol data together and that's came and that's how protocol kol came around um so protocol is a amalgamation of like a protocol plus a ko well the kol is a key opinion leader uh more commonly in the us known as the influencer and we slapped on 100 at the end and the goal here is to create a like a list of influencers or a list of kols are in the top 100 no biggest influencers within crypto who are biggest influencers within crypto governance and there's many ways to measure governance we can look in terms of like how active you are we can look in terms of passivity we can look at like whether you're being active on chain or passive on chain or being or this off chain and so what's interesting here is like in terms of you could be very active on shane by like submitting proposals and then we can look at the engagement of these proposals determine whether they're popular or not and that could be a gauge of influence we can see you know whether you're voting which is slightly less active than submitting proposals and then on the alternative side we can something that's very passive is your your token balance you could have you know hundreds of millions of dollars delegated to you and yet you never vote at all but you still have some amount of influence because you have a lot of latent influence if you wanted to vote like you would have a lot of influence but yet you choose not to vote and so we see in some of these protocols we have some of the top like you know five delegates i've maybe only voted like once or twice yet they still have a lot of influence by virtue of you know having a lot of tokens we could also measure influence in terms of like who's delegating to you if someone quote-unquote famous is delegating to you should not make yourself as a protocol politician like more famous a lot of university programs have been delegated by andrews and horowitz so the question is like should we be paying more attention to you because of this like do you have more influence and then we can look at you know whether you have a lot of delegations or not on the converse side we can measure influence from an off-chain manner and so this could be something like more passive like are you engaging on social media on forums are you participating in off-chain voting we can look at like your audience size like are you like do you have a newsletter like are a lot of people reading it do you have a lot of analysis and these are a lot like softer so it's a lot harder to kind of like quantify your influence so in terms of calculating influence we can imagine having like a very complex or like well-thought-out methodology to determine like who is more influential than someone else for example we could like look at your success rate when it comes to so many proposals your votes protocols involved and etc and we can like weight these all appropriately however um i guess i took the easy way out and it's like okay the actual calculation of influence we'll do here is we look at how many votes you've been delegated and we just like times by the token price and clearly like this is not the greatest of methodologies it's probably quite horrible because some protocols have like you know multi-billion dollar market cap and some protocols are much smaller and so like you know if your medium size delegate and unit swap of course like your weight is going to supersede and overcome smaller protocols but you know i think it's a fun like memeable metric that we can use which kind of goes in hand with what i was building here so let's jump in so protocol protocol.club is my screen still being shared yes perfect so when we load up the app here it starts just giving you an alert and loans like a legend of what what's here um and so the question is like who are the governance influencers who's within the top 100 and we can select different protocols right now we have unit stop and compound selected let's add pool together in radical um and while wait for it to load like we can see you know we have some addresses that rank in the top one this is the rank this is their name uh address or their name from sybil we have their quote unquote vote weight which is in tokens delegated times price across protocols we can look at the total number of delegates we can look at their proposal number and then we can look at the number of protocols that they're active then and what's quite profound is across these four protocols it's actually quite uncommon to see someone active in all of them and actually within the top like 100 there's only one person who it who does participate in all three protocols so just like an interesting like data point we realize that like influence is very localized it is like localized within like one or two protocols at max um so here we can like you know drill down and look at individual delegates and see how much like voting power they have um some other features here is we can go like search for particular addresses and we can it'll say whether they are in the top 100 or not um and i just we we cap this at 100 explicitly because i don't know i think the fun part about you know memeable leaderboards that you need to have some amount of like caps to it otherwise like your leaderboard will have like thousands of people and it's less you know fun in my opinion um so some interesting observations that i had when i was building this is that there really is like concentration um how does this this method of like weighing you know protocol politicians is horrible because if you look at like unislop in a huge market cap or so we look at like pull together it's much smaller um so i think you know ultimately in the long run like if you want to create a good index for measuring like who are these quote-unquote influencers like you can't just multiply tokens delegate if i took in price and we've seen like other like good tools that measure um kols but there's a lot much there's a lot more work that you know needs to be done here so behind the scenes uh this is built using a lot of like some hooks from sybil uh we pulled the data from the graph and like i guess my hope for this project is that you know it becomes a meme that people are like okay i'm rank you know 20 on the protocol 100 list thank you carter awesome there we go um no that was a super interesting overview i guess maybe um in terms of just kind of understanding how this grows like and you kind of talked about initially that you don't you didn't get enough time because of just kind of starting the the other role a galaxy so what are some of the things that you think are interesting or maybe maybe better way of me asking is like what did you think was happening or was going to happen back early this year when you were thinking about this and then how do you think that's evolved so far um in the past six months so six months ago i so last year i had built a governance dashboard that would show like proposals and people voting and proposals along with tweets by these voters to have kind of like a real-time feed of like what's going on and like if you're a delegate you could be like okay like what is my or sorry if you're a delegate t what is my delegate doing what are they saying and if you're a voter like you can see what other people are doing and how should i behave except like later on several other products i kind of built tools that really fit that niche such as italian boardroom and then i was like okay i don't want to replicate what they're doing let's build something different um so then i was like okay let's just build a leaderboard and this really came around in the last like month or so and i think my where my head's at like i want to probably find a better way to quantify influence and like yes this is a very like you can apply a lot of judgment on what's considered like influence which should be considered influential uh but like have some sort of like simple like algorithm that we can weight people and then my goal is hopefully it turns into a meme and people can be like oh i'm like right so and so because i've realized that you know krypto is like super dramatic and like if it's not a meme there's no point in playing it well that's not true but memes make life more fun that's fair and so like my goal is like if you can encourage people to participate in governance and if it's through a meme i think it'll be helpful no that makes total sense um and i think uh this in a way plugs in nicely with the last talk on rabbit hole where you get to see that uh people are not only incentivized by understanding what's happening and they get to learn that through and earn rewards for and understanding how something works under the hood but then this sets them up for being more involved in governance after they know that they understand it or how something works and uh and i think what you're doing fits in really well with a bunch of other initiatives right now that are getting more and more people just plugged into d5 and specifically you know swap ecosystem including the the university funds for clubs so uh that's awesome well uh thank you so much for for that talk hopefully we get to see you again with another update on how it's evolved on the development side but uh with all that uh we are a little bit early and i had a schedule so we'll do it we'll just take a quick break and then we'll resume everything uh in about 25 or so minutes uh when we're back on track so lynn thank you so much and for everybody watching get a get some uh something to eat or drink and we'll see you in 20 to 25 minutes all right everybody thanks [Music] welcome back everybody hope you had a a good quick short break and uh with that we are ready to resume with the rest of the summit so we got a few more talks to go and uh i want to keep everything on schedule so without further ado i'd like to welcome our next speaker and that is uh david and david's going to be talking about the benefits of unit swap site pairs so uh dave is already here uh so whenever you're ready please feel free to turn your video on and share your screen and uh we can get rolling so welcome hey guys um i'm david uh you guys might know me as hiro from the unit swap discord i've been in the space of uniswap for quite a while i'm really passionate about it as the people that have seen me probably know and i really have the predication that a lot of this is gonna change the world so i'm gonna pull up my slides here really quick and we'll kind of start going through that one moment here all right so penguin party is a meta governance dow that participates as a governance delegate on the unit swap and compound protocols uh we operate penguin swap which is an open source community run interface for unit swap and ping analytics which is pretty much just a nice little community run fork of from the v2 days of guinness wob penguin party was created with the mission of returning value to the uni holders who delegate to it with our unispot brand request we receive funding to further develop in-app analytics automatic arbitrage manual pathing and a network topology visualization so like a visual network graph of uniswap where we want you to be able to see the liquidity pools and the connections between these liquidity equals and get a more intuitive feel for like what these liquidity pools are doing and how the money is moving around so we have three values that i've tried to stick with throughout my journey in running kingwood party and it's really simple we want to return value to the holders of uni we want to incentivize decentralization make sure no one particular group has a lot of ownership over uh the dow in any kind of way that would be bad and i was you know around for the dow the original dow which kind of failed and so it's really important that we stay true to these decentralized values and prevent things like that and lastly we want to fund protocol development and so what that looks a lot like is like the uniswap grants program which we've been really passionate about and we think is really allowed a lot of different applications to thrive um so our team is kind of made up of a diverse group of people from all around the world who have all come together to help build the most cutting edge financial applications on open source software we have an ethos of freeing and empowering people from all walks of life we want to democratize access to these products and governance protocols for everybody you know in the third world first world whether you're rich or poor we want you to be a part of this uh revolution in the way that we do things uh so all of us on our team can be found in our discord you can get involved with us directly we're always available in this screenshot right here is directly from that you can see our discord names everybody here is somebody you can pm um and they're all super friendly so you can always be free to say hi to us we're friendly people so what we currently do is develop open source software and public goods to improve the world we're very mission focused on that uh we want to ensure the composability of protocols we operated and metagovern for the best interests of the little guy we're focused on several products which are in active development and so we talked a little bit about penguin swap uh and ping analytics we're also working on something we call ethe.limo so ethol limo is an open source ens gateway as an alternative to cloudflare's dot link gateway um and as well we are finishing up in close to deploying an on-chain governance dial that we call castle so it's going to be an open source dow deployment governance token standard and it draws from a lot of different primitives that are kind of currently available in this space so it draws from everything from the sushi bar to compounds governance standards it's very neat so we have a couple of different tokens that we've launched as part of our ecosystem so we have the fish token and it's the main token of penguin party it represents voting power in the penguin party we have tori which is adi the tory contract redirects the underlying adai's interest to the penguin party treasury uh we have crab and it's wrapped comp so the crab contract delegates the underlying comp to penguin party uh we have shrimp which are wrapped uni so the trim contract delegates all the uni held in the contract to penguin party so part of the benefit of that is that you can liquidity pool and use your governance power at the same time which is very very cool um and lastly we have this upcoming castle token and so that's that's really exciting and we're um getting close to launching it so our current roadmap kind of looks a little bit like this we've finished up this castle dao which we've been hard at work on the last couple months and our ethe.limo is kind of entering into a testing base with our partners so we want to provide an ens gateway that is kind of a competitor to cloudflare solution in this space and we're super duper excited about that um and lastly we have the ugp grant stuff that we're working on for penguin swap and we want to kind of commit back improvements to the unit swap interface and we've been hard at work on that as well and so that kind of has four main deliverables so we want to put analytics directly into the application um we believe users should have enough information about the tokens they are swapping and pooling in-app to make somewhat informed decisions without leaving the app so if you've used nina swap you're probably very familiar with having like multiple windows open um to try to get graphs and look at the performance of different pools and that sort of thing and we want to do our best to simplify that so we've gotten done with graphs for our tokens and swap modals we're working on stuff like the apy estimations shown in the pool pages fee earnings and token price changes in the token list component we've finished automatic arbitrage so users should have all the same capabilities as our bots and should be able to route from any token back to that same token and look for opportunities to profit the app should have a feature to report arbitrage opportunities to users in some way so penguin swap does that currently you can route any token back to itself say swap usd coin for usd coin or east east and the app will automatically look for arbitrage opportunities so that you can swap one token for more of itself it's very cool we call it roulette as well we want to work on manual pathing which comes with things like use user customizable routing token lists user defined max hops ad-hoc weights and manual route selection uh which will kind of get combined into the last thing on here which is the more difficult um project that we've had on the back burner for a while uh which is a visual network graph of uniswap's liquidity pool network um so that'll be pretty pretty easy to conceptualize if you're familiar with network graphs at all basically it'll be like a map of unit swaps you'll be able to see the liquidity pools see how big they are you'll be able to see the connections between these different tokens and it'll kind of give you um really easy instant feedback about which tokens are big which ones are getting a lot of volume and those sort of things um and it i think that that will help people understand the kind of complexity of the connections between these tokens so i practice something i call unit swap as a philosophy so arbitrage creates volume for liquidity pools and it's the core mechanism for price synchronization that's happening on the blockchain it's keeping all of these tokens aligned to correct market demand and so arbitrage in and of itself through barter and trade is one of the core economic functions of society and this i believe is going to revolutionize one of these aspects of our society so uniswap represents a fundamental change in the design of markets because it enables a global audience to create new markets in a permissionless way and that's super important more profitable trading opportunities arise from highly connected nodes in a network graph and so users need better and more visual data on this network graph which is extremely complex we want to get better analytics data to traders influence using uniswap but this goes further we envision a world where microsoft shares and cans of coca-cola could be directly liquidity pooled without involving a fiat currency where all commodities have fair prices determined by globally accessible markets without exposing every single nation to the risk of any particular nation's sovereign currency and this should be the highest priority goal of our ecosystem of ethereum in general we want to make the old traditional world of banking and relevant by creating something better we're able to add value to our users trades by providing more intelligence directly in the app our more advanced routing explores more opportunities passing arbitrage profits to front-end users instead of bots we help users feel comfortable with their true trades and stay true to our values and democratizing access to these tools our goal is to make trading and pooling so simple anyone could do it because the future of labor is an ideation and speculation nobody should be excluded from financial or governance systems due to ease of use barriers and that's super important we want to make these things easy so that we can onboard the next million users into d5 and so our monetization strategy is uh really simple and i try and stick with this as a quote in a way that we run penguin party right we make money when you make money we want to keep our incentives aligned with the customers that are using our products um and by adding value to their experience they will add value to our experience and we're cooperative right and that's that kind of comes down to the last point which is that we collaborate with and add value to and love you swap instead of competing with it things like something like sushi swap would do uh by being a delegate of new swap with a vested interest and by routing trades through uniswap instead of our own liquidity factory we honor the people who created the open source software we use right and that allows us to be a part of uniswap instead of trying to compete with it we're trying to add value to uniswamp and to the traders and to govern uniswap in a way that returns real value uh to to the holders of uni and so sometimes that value isn't necessarily financials on sometimes that value isn't software and so that is the biggest most important thing that we can do for uniswop and that the uniswamp grants program has achieved is creating software uh that adds to the experience of the traders and liquidity poolers and the holders of guinea and so this is a slide that kind of details um how roulette works and so this is super important for everybody in the system to understand and it's really simple it's called triangle arbitrage so let's say that we have a thousand fish that we can change for 860 of token x so 860 token x is 590 token wise and 590 token wise is a thousand and one fish so you started with a thousand fish you ended with a thousand and one uh and here is a screen shot on the other side of a trade through penguin swap where a user is swapping tintori for 11.2 torrid so it's 10 bucks for 11 bucks not the most profitable trade anyone's ever seen but it is impressive from a technical perspective so you can see that there's um some interesting look to the route down there so that's because each one of those things on penguin swap is clickable you can go to the unispot.info page for that particular token or by clicking the arrows between to the pair page and that's part of what we're trying to do here about getting people better info about these trades and about the us dollar values and things like that and we think that uh providing the right opportunities to people is super important so i'm going to get more into the philosophical aim of penguins party in what we really care about um because we're a mission uh oriented organization um so this is about the fourth industrial revolution and i am going to kind of humorously call this uh universal republica so you can almost imagine like a global governance system so as the 21st century comes into full swing the internet ethereum starlink space colonization and other emerging technologies take hold a new industrial revolution comes into focus a new political philosophy takes shape one centered on transparency openness composability and open source software one centered on the abundance of resources that will be available to mankind this final industrialized phase of society from private space exploration global cooperation and the imminent realization that we must take better care of our earth and its inhabitants something that more equitably distributes value and aligns participants to common goals something between libertarianism and socialism with regard to human rights and the prosperity of entrepreneurs a penguin party if you will a political philosophy of code as law as we move to deploy the castle dow i do so with these ideas that i believe will transform mankind and society in mind and as long-term goals of the dow firstly i want to see a basic income for every person on earth we want to put crypto in the hands of every person on earth and on board the next billion users into the ethereum ecosystem and incentivize them to invest develop and participate we want to create jobs in the web 3.0 economy we want to see products as tokens we want every commodity on earth to become wrapped tokenized and placed in unit swap liquidity pools that's a pretty hefty goal but as a long-term goal that is what i want to see happen with governance protocols to control the distribution and production of these goods uh unisox mturk kickstarter and others prove this was not only possible but profitable and the coronavirus has shown us that we must embrace a new normal in the way that we produce and consume goods we want all goods to become public goods uh and what i mean by that is that uh the internet is a public good right it there are corporations that provide various types of infrastructure there's isps there's cable companies there's a lot of different corporations involved and of course those corporations want to make money but the internet is a public good that really benefits everybody in a very equal way it benefits uh poor people middle class people and rich people and so i refer to that as a common good um it's a public good and we also care about quadratic decisions so every economic function should become governable and consumers of products should have more say in the products they consume people are more important than wealth power should be more equitably distributed and quadratic decision making is an innovation that prevents governance protocols from being strictly plutocratic i think that's super important so fidelic wrote a great paper about quadratic voting and i really recommend everybody it's super great you know if you're familiar with civil resistance or right id and things like that you should be familiar with concept so on the subject of capsules as an experienced protocol politician i've been pondering governance as it relates to protocols for some time and i've seen increasingly seeing the promise that what we are building in the ethereum ecosystem is going to transform governments and economies cryptography will be used to secure elections blockchains will be used to record results for auditors to mathematically prove the validity of elections and there will be no need for people to wander to polls or register to vote because participation will be an inherent part of the web 3 economy castle is my vision for how optimum government governance of a community of people should operate through incentive alignment participants are engaged to communicate and develop products together it's modeled after the tried and true republic system castle represents the digitization of the idea of a nation-state it's organized on its base level by holders of the token which we call castle the power of the passive token holders is to delegate votes to candidates or themselves and to vote on proposals periodically a function is available to be called on the contract which enables the top x collection of senators to claim seats senators with valid seats are able to suggest proposals they vote internally on whether to create a proposal that passes to the general public to affect the treasury expend money mend new tokens etc periodically an executive is also elected by general vote who can create proposals without having admit senators the senators and the executive both have the power to veto each other's proposals prevent bad actors from gaming the system this should sound very familiar to you if you live in a western country most of our countries are structured as republics and i think that that is the best way to prevent takeovers or incidents like the dao from happening and so castle is kind of built on the compound governance system it basically uses multi-level uh uh deployment of governance tokens to achieve what is more hierarchical and similar to a republic uh so you have something more like an executive at the top and that would be me as the founder and leader and eventually i would be you know replaced by a vote then we have a group of senators who are kind of elected by the common people and the power of the dow is coming through the bottom here you can see that we have various tokens like shrimp and crab that are kind of giving us governance power on other protocols and so we want to focus on creating a lot of those kinds of rap tokens and accruing power in a variety of places and then making sure that we distribute that power equitably through fish so castle as i mentioned just a moment ago is a meta deployment and slight modification of compounds governance system which uniswap shares this makes it compatible and composable with many of the applications that currently integrate access to governance as well we plan to publish the contracts employment instructions for castle as open source code so that anyone can build their own castle it's of course built out of a lot of open source primitives republic it has a republic-like structure that we believe will prevent incidents like the dow from recurring while enabling fluid democracy uh the dow for penguin party will control all of the gaps that we have created uh through ens directly it has the power to mint fish control the transaction taxes on penguin swap shrimp crab uh and tory to do buybacks to liquidity full assets into metagovern other protocols such as you know placing votes or voting yes or no on your swap proposal um so that's that's kind of the idea of castle um and that gets into how fish are current token kind of uh escalates into a routing token and it goes through something i humorously referred to as the fish type and so basically fish is planned to begin a minting phase after the dow becomes functional and online uh by voting on minting a fish holders of castle are able to inflate fish within certain limitations it's range restricted to a percentage the percentage is somewhere between zero and four percent uh is the most that it's allowed to inflate per year and the reason that the dow has this power much like a nation-state is to fund internal projects and make strategic investments in other projects i humorously refer to it as the fish cycle like i said and it's pretty simple so fish are minted by the dow and used to reward participants in the ecosystem that might look like a variety of things such as a basic income pilot program that we're kind of working on uh as well as things like uh paying out bounties to open source developers that jump in and start working with us and the idea is that eventually those guys that are receiving those rewards are going to expend them they're going to pull them or they'll wrap them in the castle to increase their governance power and kingdom party and as that happens we're kind of continuously through smart contracts uh going to be buying back the fish with product revenues much like sushi swap and sending them to the castle wrapped in unwrapped contract which again operates very similar to the sushi swap sushi bar and kind of functions as a way to reward participants in the staking the governance taking contract and that kind of fulfills a natural cycle of these fish entering and exiting circulation and i believe that kind of having that be a continuous process is really important basically it keeps things level and make sure that it's not just a token you know it's more of an ecosystem and it's more of a functional economy right so this is kind of a slide about e thought limo which is something we haven't talked too much uh to the general public about so i'm going to kind of briefly explain what it is and why you should care ethe.limo is meant to solve a problem and that problem is that names are not being resolved very well by cloudflare who is currently running the dot ether.link service and if you go to a variety of ethot links you'll see that they don't resolve super well and so we embarked on a mission to try and solve that and offer an alternative so we offer a decentralized alternative to existing centralized solutions for accessing ens ipfs content currently the ability to publicly resolve and interact with ens resources is contingent upon the crisis of tech we're not big fans of that stylish and performant variety to web3 we use inter-regional infrastructure to ensure the best name resolution uh we have a lot of meme potential you know everybody loves riding in a limo we have a security first design so there's a lot of strong domain isolation we have great encryption we're trying to give back so the text app is being developed with open source and self-hosting interests in mind we aim to provide an out-of-the-box cloud-native solution for building public self-healing web 2.0 what to web 3.0 uh gateway infrastructure so we have complete feature parity with dot eth.link gateway services users will be able to request valid subdomain certificates like ssl certificates for their ens projects which is something if you've been hosting a donnie dot link you're probably familiar with as well that we're looking for seamless migrations for existing ethotlink projects it's super simple all you have to do is update your links to ethe.limo instead of dot ether link uh and you'll resolve through us uh once it's finished up employed so it's not dependent upon infira in in the later stages we will be using our own ethereum client in rpc endpoint infrastructure to provide this service we want to provide public ens resolution over dns dns over tls and dns over https and we want to be the champions of ens we really strongly believe in building a more decentralized world and we think that providing.e.limo is public service helps facilitate the transition to a web 3.0 world and allows these dows and smart contracts to trustlessly update ipfs content in a very secure way uh in a very public and auditable way so it aligns with all of our goals um it's it's a nice nice bit of tech that i think people have been sleeping on so um i promised a tale of penguins and who we are and how we got here uh and it's a lot like a bedtime story or a really good dream uh so once upon a time there was a unispot bear drop it was a pretty legendary event i'm sure a lot of you remember it uh it did an amazing thing it redistributed wealth and it changed the lives of everyone who had been involved with uniswap in version one some bought new ps5s some bought new gpus some saved their uni but all were touched by the magic the unicorn there were many people from across the world who gathered together in celebration of this most magical event and they congregated in a most magical place uh as unicorns are known to do the unit swamp discord a penguin named david received this airdrop at a time in his life but it really mattered and this is his story uh when i received the airdrop i was just a regular guy working in a call center at a credit bureau i've been buying me since it crashed in early 2018. um i've been in bitcoin since 2012 i really saw the promise that ethereum held i taught myself solidity in 2017 i worked on some pet projects but i never really had time what i wanted to do which was web development and that's what i studied for in college uh as a full-time focus uh it was near the time of the airdrop when the lockdowns first started i'm sure everyone's intimately familiar with them and i'm sure you remember exactly what you were doing when it happened um for me i lost my job uh i lived off my savings and i wondered how i would fit into a new home i was scared just like everyone was right i was really interested in d5 but never really actively involved from time to time i'd pop into compound.finance's discord i'd bother robert lesner with some questions about implementation um who turned out to be a huge inspiration to me so thank you robert lesner i love the way that he deals with the public if if any of you have ever been in his discord i'm sure you know exactly what i'm talking about silently i began making small investments i learned solidity uh more fully it wasn't until the unit swap airdrop and the lockdown started i decided i wanted to make a move uh when uni launched i joined the discord i got involved a particular guy that you all might be familiar with known as borfor or borah in the uniswap discord really picked really quickly picked me out uh gave me the friendly uniswap title i started answering people's questions about the airdrop it was really a busy time when governance began i decided to throw in my hat before i knew it i had a million or so union votes it was like in incredible there's a little news story over here on the side about it that's when i realized that we needed a way to decentralize delegates and one party was born uh we embarked on a mission to change the world from that point on i created a multi-sig for gnosis get people to delegate the votes to instead of me uh i created the cleveland party fish i threw them out to everybody that was voting for me i set up a snapshot that page to pass proposals through we continued to expand uh not long after creating fish a group of magical friends came into the interswap discord they told us they had a problem they're one of our partners now ethos or previously known as fifo hub they had the idea they could create liquidity pools such as biddle arte art unify etc only there was one problem uniswap's interface was only programmed to use specific routing tokens uh it's called preferred routing token list that's a kind of big problem uh and so after a lot of debate i realized hey i can create penguin swap this will fix this problem for this customer i'll add biddle as a preferred token um and that worked and really solved that problem for them um so then i learned react native and and got penguin swap kind of production ready and we went from there um and i think i'm coming towards the end of my a lot of time so i'll try and brush through just get the last deets here and drop right out um i apologize for running over a little bit uh but basically from there on we created all these tokens and then we supported the unit swap grants program and we really strongly believe that uniswap is going to change the world right and we've been really involved in it from the beginning our team has expanded from just being me to like 10 people are working here now i went from being really poor to being you know pretty middle class and well taken care of by the community and uniswap team and it really changed my life i think that for all you developers out there things like these grants programs can really change your life and so if you just get involved you're in participating in these hackathons those sort of things um there's a lot of valuable stuff happening in this ecosystem that actually is meaningfully changing the world it's not just buzzwords and things like that um so i'd like to take a moment just to thank all the voters who supported me um who helped nudge me in the right direction people like borah and the uniswap grants program in general it's been an absolute honor to be here for it um i wish i could have gotten more into the tale of penguins but i don't want to go over my time too much so um thank you were there any questions or anything like that david thank you so much for uh for that amazing talk and uh for uh going over how you got into this space this was super inspiring and it's been uh an awesome reception on on the audience front i think uh maybe the only question would be that i don't think you directly answered is how do people get involved with your community and and how can they contribute and help you uh with the mission yeah um so you can find us at penguinparty.edu link currently that's our home page and you can jump right into our discord um as well we're in the uniswap discord and i super duper encourage everybody to hop in uniswap discord and be active in participating in governance awesome well thank you so much for an amazing talk and uh congrats on everything you've been able to accomplish in such a small amount of time hope to see how pinging swap evolves i appreciate you yeah and i appreciate the grants program i hope we can get it renewed and keep it moving absolutely well thanks so much and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk so our next talk is on valve and valve is a routing building block for unit swap and uh talking about valve will be prabhov so uh whenever you're ready feel free to turn your camera on and share your screen hey karthik thank you for the introduction let me share my screen can you guys see that yes okay i'm gonna try to follow that presentation that was uh really exciting um so valve finance uh we got a grant from unit swap to basically identify inefficient unit swap routes so as everyone's familiar in this forum uniswap has a pool where uh two assets are traded um and the price is determined basically uh after a trade and arbitrages come in uh and either bring the price back to what it's supposed to be or um pretty much yeah uh what happens with uniswap right now with the ux in the front end is it's hard-coded to go through certain tokens so the tokens are mentioned down here eat usdc maker comp a couple of reasons for that uh one these are the tokens with the most liquidity that people are able to add pairs for and they're also the most well known tokens now what happens with the front end is when a trader comes in to trade tokenia for token b unit swap at b2 and uh just to make a note real quick this is all on b2 and uh not on unit 12 b3 um so on unit swap b2 what happens is even if there's an optimal route that's better the ux will route the trade through the six hub tokens and what happens there is the the pairs that are not part of those hub tokens the tokens there are mispriced then you have these vampire bots coming in and arbitraging uh them back to reality and the the lps of these mispriced token pools are experiencing impermanent loss the other issue that happens with unit swap is routing is they are focused on giving you the lowest gas fees now this is great uh up to a certain threshold let's say if you have trades less than 500 or a thousand pick a number like a small number this is fine because the gas fees are the lower gas feeds are better for that but when you want to do a much larger trade let's say in this example for 10 000 badger to grt you pay for it with a lot of slippage so the price impact is around 14 because unit swap just takes one route they don't do any sort of order uh route splitting like for example one inch so you can see in this example you got about 140 000 grt but badger uh but one inch gives you about 160 000. what they've done is they've optimized for returns over gas and in the next couple of slides i'll go over that some more but you see that they can basically one inch is a decks aggregator so they have the luxury of using multiple protocols in this case to give you the maximum return here's another chart that kind of reiterates what i've been talking about with gas fees so uniswap regardless of the price regardless of the size of the trade will always be the lowest gas fees because they will only take one route usually one or two hubs whereas dex aggregators what if you can see in the chart as water size gets larger they start splitting it they start to using multiple protocols and the gas fees are of course much larger but this doesn't really matter when you have a large enough order that the returns will more than offset the gas fees and we can see this in the types of trades that happen on unit swap and one inch so in uniswap the median trade size is about a thousand and it peaks around 2000 earlier later last year but on one inch there's a lot more larger trades happening and this is a big problem for units well because these are all p fees just go into different protocols where they should be on uniswell so the solution that we're working on is to algorithmically solve the routing inefficiencies uh instead of hard coding the six hub tokens and uh expecting you know to solve the eighty percent uh the problem and just kind of like not dealing with the 20 inefficiencies what we're proposing is a solution where we traverse the unit swap graph uh for all routes regardless of hub tokens and give you multiple options to take so our initial our current grant that we were working on right now is to identify multiple routes from token a to token b regardless of the six hub tokens what we want to do in the future is split trades across multiple pools so this is exactly what oneness does but instead of going through multiple protocols that one inch has a luxury of we can still do this with uniswap with the multiple routes that are available uh more interesting ideas are to actually test and simulate these routes with accurate gas and liquidity information that's real time whereas right now we're built our system uh using uh this graph uh backend uh and also crossing protocol versions so there's a lot of liquidity moving to v3 there's still a significant amount of liquidity on v2 and with talks of uniswap deploying on layer 2 liquidity is going to get further fragmented so giving users a holistic view of where their trades will get the maximum return of course we can do more interesting order types like limit range orders buying every month etc that the current ux just isn't able to expose so here's a quick example of our tool um so similar to the trade that i've been talking about from badger to grt all these routes are unisop routes that we put together uh for a small enough trade for 100 badger of course uniswap route makes the most sense but as you get larger and larger trades just by splitting the order with two routes or three routes you're going to significantly decrease the slippage which as i mentioned will more than offset uh the gas cost and more importantly all the lp fees are staying on unit swap instead of going to other competing protocols the idea of fragmented liquidity i've mentioned uh i just wanted to add more data to that so if you look at it here right now with unisport b2 and b3 there's a lot of trading pairs that are replicated on both v2 and v3 and as you can see the liquidity is fragmented so just doing almost like a uniswab dex aggregating of routes you can get a lot better um returns on larger trades and traders who want to you know make those types of trade don't have to go to one inch or a different decks aggregator they can do small trades to large trades all on unislop some ideas that we've also explored is mav protected trades so with the advent of flashbots we've all been familiar with what's happening with mev and uh if you go to explore the flashbacks you will see that unit swap v2 is the biggest contributor to meb there are a bunch of different reasons a couple like ones that i've mentioned earlier of mispricing of uh pools that aren't in the hub token routes is a big reason for this and also uh using flashbots to hide your trades would greatly improve uh mev protection for unit swap users some future opportunities that we're exploring uh one of the ones that makes a lot of sense is a unified professional interface for unit swap traders so similar to what coinbase is and coinbase pro have for professional traders what we're thinking about is building a unified ux for unit swap where you can view uh liquidity on multiple layers layer two layer two providers like arbitrarium and optimism you can view it on multiple protocols there's v2 or v3 and also the advanced features that i've mentioned before and there's a great parallel for that with quinta cuenta is a team that spun out of synthetics that built a better front end that had advanced features that the synthetics exchange just wasn't exposing and they're using synthetics all in the back end some other features that we were considering uh and this is mostly for future grants there's of course a trade generator that i've just i went over testing and simulating i'm even protected trades the unified front end live price and real-time data this is going to be absolutely absolutely critical when you need to make trading decisions based on the data that we're providing and of course constraint editors if you want to set certain slippage gas thresholds are a number of hops protocol flares as we solve the problem for traders it just makes sense to look at the other side the supply side with the lps some of these ideas have been discussed on the uniscope discord of the features that the community is looking for uh automatic uh position management algorithmic uh i know somalia is addressing some of this there's also interesting nuggets like uh supplying only one part of the swap so let's say you have bow uh and mkr and you just have bowel in your wallet and you just wanna supply that and you have to wait for some other parties apply mkr so some ideas there are kind of what uh cow swap is doing with coincident ones uh basically uh finding the other side of liquidity for you to add to the pool and of course unified front end keeps coming up over and over again whether it's the lp's or traders having a front end that allows you to view all the liquidity across different protocols and layers is absolutely critical and then opportunities for you to invest your money so if you are an lp today not uh you know this has been on the twitter bars on discord lping on the current uniswap interface is confusing where do i set my ticks etc and also which up which pool should i put my money in where where is the best return for my money so those are some of the problems that we can potentially address in the future uh that's all i had for the presentation i can quickly go over our uh still working demo so here what we have is just a basic interface for input and output token uh so let's say i want to go from ava to balancer i can put in some sort of the amount of tokens i'm exchanging increase the number of hops and then say this is the max amount of impact that i care about so when i do that it's going to return a bunch of routes so obviously it's a small enough trade unit swap will be the one that will have the most optimal trade and as you see this animated line is indicating that this is also the trade that we recommend now when you try to go to bigger trades like i was talking about with badger let me just do that real quick so let's go from badger to grt and i'll start with the 100 badger and that will show you the different routes that are possible and again these three routes maybe even these four routes have pretty similar returns but if you just split this with two or three routes um again you'll get a lot more return versus the gas fee you'd spend now if i increase this to a thousand you'll notice that you swap the wrap will start becoming uh a lot worse because they're just uh picking the hub tokens but yeah this is uh uh kind of like a quick demo of what we're working on uh i'll ask ac to just paste a link to the paper that we have written so this kind of walks through the ideas that we've had how we're thinking about it and it has a lot more technical details of how we modeled our data and also what we're thinking about in terms of caching and scaling when this needs to go to real time uh and of course uh we do mention some of the information that i went through with future potential ideas would love to get the community feedback on this if you guys think that some of these ideas are great what you're interested in maybe there's ideas here that we haven't uh addressed i would love to hear from you guys on that um that's pretty much all i had to present happy to answer any questions thank you that was an awesome talk and a really interesting idea um we do have a question from the chat and the question is what happens if somebody ups one side of the lp pool with the other decks as you're making this trade that's a good question uh we so is this uh from a different decks is that uh i believe so uh i'll ask them to clarify when they hear this in a few seconds but uh the assumption is yes yeah uh not really sure we'll have to think about that more um so from our perspective at least initially what we've thought about is just getting better returns uh for users just because like just doing the bare minimum because people shouldn't be going to a deck aggregator when there's multiple routes available on unislap to get from tokenated token b uh there are definitely edge cases that as a question as the person is asked about that we need to address uh happy to take that offline and talk more i think ac is also on chat so he can of course uh answer that and then we got a clarification which was yeah the context is on other decks in that case so makes sense um you showed a really interesting demo i guess maybe uh and a question from my end is just what are kind of the silly open problems that you haven't figured out uh that have different tradeoffs here and just sort of what does it mean for the roadmap here for this to uh be readily available for others to test yeah uh as i mentioned i think in the earlier slide the first part of our grant was just to identify these routes so what we plan on doing is uh now that we have a at least a working demo of that we need to have more up-to-date data on the liquidity and the price information um so we update this like about once a day what we want to do is get closer to uh maybe like every 15 seconds or every like couple minutes eventually what we want to get to is directly connect to the json rpc and get real-time data so you can make these trades and you can compare with unit swap if you want to uh and splitting the trades is just it it's a solved problem in a sense with you know how airline companies you know uh move people around so it's gonna be us just trying to figure out what will get you the best return uh after talking to the unit swap team that is that's what they're excited about is it can we get uh them uh from token a token b uh with more of a return than what the uniswap ux can offer it's awesome and then uh there is another question that um ac is actively answering on the chat but i'll ask it for completeness which is um can unit swap itself be optimized so that people don't need to go to other decks um and or use a alternate service like what about back porting these changes or routes into the main protocol that's my that's my understanding absolutely i think uh maybe it was a design decision on unit swaps side to say you know what we'll just use six hub tokens and uh we will always optimize for gas fees um so they could definitely do this but as we've seen like they're pretty busy with v3 and an interesting point to make here is with v3 this problem gets even more complicated because there's active and inactive liquidity routing through ticks um so would be really exciting to see how this would work with that uh our initial foray into v3 is probably doing what uh dexter is like one inch are already doing they're just looking at what v3 rats are available and just suggesting those uh instead of us building our own pathfinder algorithm for uh v3 but i think it's just these are very straightforward optimizations that i think of course unit swap could make um i'm not really sure why they wouldn't but of course they could totally do this well i hope that answers a question from our audiences and thank you so much for that awesome demo and presentation and this is a super interesting problem to be working on so thank you right congrats and uh with that we are ready to move on to our next talk so our next speaker is natasha and she will be talking about safeguard so without further ado please uh welcome tasha on stage and uh feel free to share your screen um great thank you so much kartik for having me um let me know please when my screen is showing everything is great um great um today i will be talking about safeguard is a application we built for the first wave of the unisoft grants program is an optimistic governance accountability tool that brings uh a way for governance to retain better power over any group committee or grantees they have within the program so let me talk about a little bit the background uh you know that uh on chain governance tends to be a little bit slow so this because it requires you know a lot of coordination between many individuals within the protocol to pass a proposal or a vote which is a little bit too slow for managing day-to-day operations or expenses within the protocol that's why protocols seek to scale increasing the agility by delegating authority to smaller groups all decision-making bodies could be multi-seats uh comedies etc this uh this way of doing things also brings a trade-off which is even uh the the communities can be secured because of the security that brings uh montysik this uh delegation of power over the funds they they they give is a little bit like one way there's no way for the protocol to regain back control to those uh funds if anything goes wrong so uh also there there's a little lack of accountability that you can help over them uh much of the protocols um the committees can make uh decisions but the protocol will basically agree on the past agreement they did it so sometimes let's say there's a diversification of stuff that the committee can do but may or may not align with the things that the protocol wants to do so this project brings a way to help accountability and also change uh things a little that's how safeguard was born and the solution we came up with was a little bit uh simple because we wanted so it can be composable with the already existing structure of the governance but that bring also this flexibility that the day-to-day operations needs for even the committees or grantees events etc so the solution we came up with we built that permission ledger on top of a timelock contract that has a delay a smaller delay that the overall governance and it could be one day or even minutes if you need it the funds are held in the time of contract but they can also be held let's say on the token contract as well in those meetings through the timelock there are different ways you can do it so the comedy is grant permission by the safeguard at me that could be that mean can be um the governance can be another comedy can be one uh executed from protocol etc and you see like all all the roles can be assigned to different uh kind of entities or persons and so it's really composable to making uh like word for a lot of different scenarios so the request that the company can make for funds can be reviewed this is done in an optimistic way because if no if no one takes action over the request that the committee do it will pass and they will receive the funds easily um it just when there is something that needs to be reviewed or something that needs a little bit more context they can uh post that and continue later or after the review process for the use cases of this token holders can oversight commit trees through governance committees can oversight subcommittees they can build and also can oversight events they form etc so there are a lot of use cases that can be make the solution um for the general grant project we just thought of these two but as i mentioned before a lot of uh of the composability solution that we bring we allow for like a lot of different scenarios that people can come up with in different flavors of it so it will be great to see what the community came uh with for the roma uh of this project the other night we apply and receive the grant during april we built the smart contract and may we build the front end for it right now in progress we are prototyping uh the usage of the project with the stable subcommittee where we're just going to talk about about this comedy after me so you can hop up to know more about them in the next step for this project are the audit of the contract with you um we are currently testing with a small amount of money because the contracts are added after after audit this project can also help like really big funds without any problem furthermore all the repo links are on valley are available open source so you guys can see and afford work on them make github issues if any questions or or even bring up more solutions to this project um this was my presentation uh thank you you can help and talk more with me in retaliation if you like is a pleasure and also if you have any questions about the project about how it works i'm here for you guys awesome well thank you so much for uh for that amazing overview of safeguard and uh for everybody who wants to learn more be sure to join the tally discord and ask the tally team for any questions or for clarifications uh thanks again for uh for presenting and uh we look forward to seeing how uh cali girls live and sorry how safeguard goes live helios life awesome well thank you so much bye guys amazing so with that we are ready for our last talk of the day and i want to invite back boris to close us off by talking about this table um and of course we'll talk about the ugp subcommittee that uh he leads so without further ado please welcome boris uh hello maybe you see me maybe you don't uh let me do it yeah sharing screen now okay do you see it yes no i clicked share again wrong steps present okay so hi everybody uh nice to see you again hopefully you enjoyed all the previous talks uh they were really interesting to me at least uh and now for the end well just you know something that everybody can you know you don't need really to understand tech into the deep to understand a little bit about what this table is about and what we're doing it's just community stuff as you'll see and yeah i'll share how we try to empower the community within the stable what the stable is all about uh and yeah let's let's start let's go to the first slide okay so uh hi everybody my name is boris tanich i'm croatian and before i started doing unesco community stuff i was a beckons team lead for a night gaming company here in croatia which means i don't know too much about community management marketing or things like that but i am fairly comfortable with tech topics and crypto topics and yeah i've been in crypto space actively since 2017 uh and right away i started with the community stuff and then in 2020 i joined the as a contractor that the union swap team by pure luck as it says here i don't know really why they chose me uh it was i was just lucky and then this year in may the stable was born and what is the stable so stable is a subcommittee in the units of grant program and we are focused on on the individual uh individual brands so we provide financial help but also we try to provide mentorship technical guidance connection to the community and and whatever our grantees need and uh somebody asked me previously okay what is this table is it like the subcommittee is it you or and i think the best answer to that is the stable is both the subcommittee in the ugp and its grantees so if you become a unicorn in our stable you kind kind of you know shared the values that that we tried to promote through this table and natural question is why is their need for the stable and defy space and crypto space is really specific there are a lot of enthusiasts and these guys so guys and girls sorry uh they kind of work for free really like they are the best employees you never have to pay uh they you know they they are fueled by their enthusiasm for the defy space and crypto in general and every project should value those individuals and in my second point i put here it is irresponsible not to support those people because you can't really count that that these enthusiasm will last forever or if they you know encounter too too many obstacles in their work maybe they'll get frustrated and give up while with not so much effort you can really you know uh nurture their enthusiasm and your project will benefit immensely it's just insane how much work these individuals can you know accomplish um and like how do we operate uh it's really simple uh so every one of us in this table so as i said this they are me and the grantees we spend unhealthy amount of time with the community so you'll basically currently we had only way one and we have so there's a six of us now in the stable subcommittee uh and basically you'll see somebody always online in the official units of discord next thing that we do is we encourage the most active candidates to apply so everybody is invited to apply uh but the problem is uh they they need some encouragement because they it feels to me like they are a little afraid of a commitment because they think they'll become employed uh if they join this table but that's that's that's really not the case uh my third step is we just let them do what they enjoy the most and just support them along the way so we try to to find area uh each grantee will focus on but there's like minimal micro management or anything because these guys already know the best and yeah they already proved so many times also can sometimes drives his car in new york city uh to promote uh the stable and uniform grant program and you can see the picture here at the bottom uh what are the challenges so this is more for me personally uh than for the rest of the grantees uh the first big challenge is uh we as a sub committee we get unit tokens you know to to move forward you know to give to our grantees but financial help is nice but it's not usually the highest priority so from my experience our grant is you know they usually have their main jobs and some people like i don't know to to read novels in their free time and these guys love to spend time with d5 or unislop community uh what's also hard is breaking the barriers on the grantees way one of the barriers is always reaching out to the core uniswap team and sometimes you just need to reach out to them and this gif at the bottom shows how it feels sometimes to reach them in dms but it's understandable you know the unisop core team maybe they reach 20 members not sure but they are managing such a huge project and there's all only a handful of them so yeah they they have their their you know they focus on different things don't have always time to to respond to the messages and one of my biggest goal is to make sure the grantees get the recognition they deserve so uh all the great things that they do daily i try to to make sure that uh general communi unisop community knows about them and recognizes them for that great work that they do some of the stuff we do as the stable subcommittee so one big part is the community support so you had an opportunity to listen to serve that e-theme so they manage a lot of repetitive support tickets which is usually gas prices and stock transactions and metamask issues uh however if you listened carefully you could hear that chair we mentioned that if they get something that they're not sure of they always reach out to other helpers and friends of uniform and other helpers and friends of unisvop would be the stable grantees so they're always there ready to help we got couple of really you know i wouldn't say senior level solid developers but close to and they're always ready to help if they have time we also do a lot of educational resources such as guides faqs some tips and tricks for example rachel which is one of our stable grantees she wrote a really nice guide on how to recognize scam tokens because we know there's a lot of people that are new to uni swap end up buying scan tokens so if you're new to unispot make sure to check out that guide and quality of life tools maybe you know a simple tool that would allow you to see all the allowances that you did and stuff like that so our grantees build all those stuff another thing we do i put running in in quotation marks but basically core unispock team doesn't have too much time to run the units of discord and our grantees kind of run it it's not far from true community calls so yeah we had four of them uh the fifth one will be june 14th uh you can submit your topics for the agenda we'll always keep it really open it was really interesting for example on the last one two days ago we had couple of interesting projects that are working on automating liquidity providing on v3 and one of them has like insane aprs not recommendation that you should invest in those projects but it's really interesting you can find like nice projects during our community calls and we also discuss different governance stuff what should we do next or not we but units for projects and stuff like that we also bridge the gap between the units of course team and the community so yeah we have a system where somebody has a like an issue uh that unisoft team needs to check we have a procedure how to notify them and stuff like that and to phishing in that this camera program you heard the talk uh from our guy dubstar he's an expert in that field uh he he's in the space in internet space for 30 years he knows all the tricks and he keeps our discord queen and saves all the new users from phishing sites and yeah last thing we do but we do but more but last thing i put here is making unicef inclusive to non-english speaking communities so uh one of our grantees yg shout out to him he speaks i think two or three languages spoken in asia and he helps out that community uh reports back on on what what they're talking about just so we know and the coordinates team what's what's going on in non-english speaking communities uh and yeah what what is our end goal so our end goal for this table is to make community self-sustainable self-sustainable i just made it up basically but [Music] it's a state of the community where if there's a need for something the community will organize itself to produce a solution for that need and yeah that's my definition of self-sustainable community also provide financial and other support where it's needed so it would be nice if you know governance would recognize if there's some money needed and there's an efficient way to to send that money to solve that problem at that right place or any other help whether it's educational technical whatever and yeah we try to make uh unisop community an overall cool place to hang out so uh our big goal is to make it feel like your voice is always heard within the new swap community that's that is why for example we let the community choose topics for the agenda for the community calls and if you join a community call and raise your hand you'll end up on the stage you can you know last minute call we had almost 200 people so it's an easy way to share your ideas in front of 200 other community members and you don't really have to have you know twitter cloud to reach that level you just join and raise your hand so right now you're probably wondering how to get involved uh first step so i made a nice flow chart say goodbye to friends and family because you'll enjoy spending time with us so much you'll just forget about them and next step is maybe you already have an idea that that would benefit a uni swap community and if you do reach out to this table uh we'll jump in a call uh and yeah find find the solution for that idea if you don't have an idea at the moment just become an active member of the community best way to do so is join our discord uh sono tower but unispops project discord you'll find the links pretty much everywhere i forgot to put it in this presentation but maybe somebody can share it in chat uh and yeah eventually you'll get an idea how to improve uh the uniswap community because there are so many places and ways uh this young community and project can be improved and then you'll reach out to this table and and both just find a way to make that happen uh and for like the last one is the model motto old creation saying is if you take steps in the right direction eventually you'll end up in the right place unless you're on the wrong side of an escalator and yeah so first thing to consider is are you on the right side of an escalator and unislap project is definitely on the right side of an escalator uh and our goal at this table is to always take a step in the right direction so we understand that we don't have enough you know power to really revolutionize anything in the uni swap maybe it happens but let's be realistic it won't but we try to make you know a lot of smaller steps in the right direction write a guide to help another community member answer somebody's question or create a cool tool somebody can use and all these steps will accumulate and unislap as a project will be a happy place uh application form huge link here uh i'll share it in youth global chat as soon as i'm done with my presentation and for any questions uh i'm available uh didn't have the chat open so i didn't catch any questions uh but maybe uh you can help me out with that fatigue yes um we have any questions just yet but i think uh kind of the biggest one would just be understanding uh maybe just clarifying sort of what it means to be involved on the gp side versus the stable directly so if somebody's interested in in helping out in the union community are they making a conscious in a exclusive choice of uni grants or the stable or what are the some obvious things that they can go to the stable for and and how do you think about how is it just generally set up so that they know where they can go for help for various specific things yeah so we at this table tried to work on on a smaller project with an outsized impact so something that that you don't need a whole team of developers uh or or you know a whole team in general uh to make happen uh but an individual can and uh if you need you know more like guidance technical help and less financial help then this table would be a right place to you however me and can we talk every day we go through all the applications and if we see that some of the application would be more suitable for the stable or that this table application would be more suitable for the ugp we just you know mix it up and you'll end up in the right place also there since we are the subcommittee uh it's not like if you join the stable you will never reach out to ken or if you are in the ugp don't talk to boris we are all like a big family help each other out we just really focus on different areas so yeah use the stable application or use the ugp application both will work will manage that's awesome yeah and that was the one question we just got and i think you already answered that in parallel so it is it's fine if you apply to ugp if if your project is better suited for the stable it will get redirected or if you apply to this table and it gets better suited for general egp instead of that subcommittee you will also be redirected to the right place is that a good summary yeah yeah you'll you'll end up in the right place ugp as a whole is the right place so a smaller part of it which is the stable is also the right place you can't never go wrong with with the ugp wonderful so well boris i want to thank you for doing this amazing presentation and giving us an overview of the stable and how subcommittees are structured at ugp and with that we are at a wrap this is this was the last hack of the day i want to thank everybody who is watching and stuck around and asked super interesting questions and uh kind of engaged with everybody here in the uni swap ecosystem so um if there are more questions here we can obviously relay those questions to our speakers you can always re obviously reach out to the speakers directly either over email or chat or anybody on the global team will be able to connect you with anybody that you are trying to get in touch with and um for everybody who pinged us about getting a poep token for being an active participant at the summit uh stay stay patient a little bit more we'll be emailing everybody who signed in uh with a unique link to claim that so and we get that question uh quite a lot so for anybody who asked that or has asked that in the last few hours um you'll get an email from us directly on all of this so i just have a couple of last uh last closing thoughts here i want to just briefly remind everybody that uh the union swap grants program is an active program so you can go to unigrants.org and apply for grants to help make the union swap ecosystem better we kind of learned about a few subcommittees we saw a lot of interesting demos on uh of what the what the projects are doing that have been given some grants over the past few months and some of them are incredible uh engineering challenges some of them are incredible community efforts some of them are making the swap ecosystem better for new users there is a whole range of what you can do to bring more people into this ecosystem so i hope you get excited about that as well and if you are interested in getting support for anything you're doing uh head over to unigrants.org and lastly i want to thank the unisoft grants team boris ken and unispoplabs for making this event possible they've been an awesome partner to work with here and we're glad that we were able to host a the uni grant summit today as part of hack money so thanks again for everybody who spoke today who helped ensure that everything goes according to plan for for the summit today and overall uh the union of grants program for making an
