[Music] [Applause] [Music] uh welcome everybody and sorry for the delay again we have our workshop here with taivo who's going to teach you how to market your nft in a few hours and taivo i'll let you take the lead if you have any questions feel free to pop them in the chat and we can take them towards the end thanks yeah thanks for the intro so my name is taivo i'm the vp product at nfd port and let me give you a bit of a bit of a personal background so i come from an ai background and i came into web3 and actually my journey started with a hackathon so i'm hoping that for all of you guys uh this is also the start of something bigger and we see in our community lots of hackers lots of people just getting started and just trying out you know what the nfts are all about and trying to apply them to their own idea so we're really excited to see what they're going to build and we do believe it is still early with mfts so most of the interesting and important use cases i think are still out there to be discovered and i'm hoping the next week or two will be the time for you to do that so let me share my screen and and show you what nft port is all about so if you go to our website nftport.xyz this is what uh what you're looking at so energyport is the or strives to be the stripe for nfts uh to give you very very simple api calls rest api calls for doing anything that you need with nfts and our goal is that you as a developer get your application your game deployed as quickly as possible and the way we do that or the way we help you is we help you not deal with all of the blockchain and smart contract complexity necessarily yourself if you want to you can of course do that but we give you a layer which helps you create contracts in 10 of these read data without worrying about the unders underlying infrastructure all the time so the three main main categories of products or things that mfd port can do for you are first minting nfts and the deploying contracts so if you want to create none of these we got you covered the second one is if you want to get data about nfts for example uh giving given a wallet figure out what the nfd is that wallet owns today uh we also that you covered there and the third category is um kind of value-added or enhanced apis on top of the uh the data which means searching enough these um getting recommendations or similar entities trying to figure out if you're trying to figure out whether a particular nfd is counterfeit we can also help with that and i'll i'll show the exact endpoints in a minute uh how do you get started there's the big button here click on that and you can sign up here once you fill in the forms submit you will get the api key directly to your email i think you can start testing everything out so once you have the api key you can go to nft port documentation docs.nftpart.xyz and um you can see a relatively high level over overview here of roughly similar things that i'm talking about but the main categories of things that you probably care about are tutorials yeah someone is drawing here uh then the full api reference and then there are a few support links so let's jump right in so if you want to that the thing i mentioned before if you want to um see nfd is owned by a particular account so for example you might see on open open c uh there may be uh an account let's say c dixon someone who is quite well known in the web 3 space um i'm getting their account address and um in a single api call i can fetch all of them a list of all the mfds that that this account owns or for example if you want to see if there is in the board ape yacht club collection you want to get the list of all the nfds there so let's find the contract address where is it here so once you have a contract address you can get all nfd's in a particular contract put in the contract address and the contract is on ether and again we get a list of all the all the tokens on that in that contract um you can do you can do more you can get more data and if you want to get details about the particular nfc so for example dape number let's say two two two two i can see the uh the contract token id we can see we can get the metadata url we can see all of the attributes for that particular nfd so if we take if we look at it on openc sorry and you can see it's white you can see also here fair white what's perhaps can be useful for you is that getting the actual asset the image behind the nft from ipfs which is what the link here it can be quite slow so for your convenience we provide this cached file url which is essentially like a cdn where you can take the link and just display it in browser or in the game very easily and it should load much faster than directly off of ipfs you can also get transactions so if you're if you care about what has happened to a particular particular nfv you can again it's the same nfd so for date number 222 we can get a list of all sales for example uh i think there hasn't been any or there's been one transaction here uh but you can you can select which transactions you want to include you can get all of them if you want and this might help you show it to the user the history of a particular nfd like what has happened before who have been the previous owners so this is the beta side i think was possibly more interesting for you maybe the minting side so instead of just looking at nfd data that is out there on the chains you might want to create your own nfts so to do that the easiest fastest way is easy meeting with a single api call you can create an nfd and there are two ways to do that you could put in a url of an image or you could just upload the file with the request i'll show you the url method because it's uh it's just faster let's take a placeholder image so this will be the the one that will maintain your nft uh use the file url and i will use my own wallet to mean the nfd into my wallet and it will take a few seconds because the we have to download the file and upload it again to ipfs unexpected here that's the the demo effect but anyway this should work most of the time and you can this is the fastest way to meet what happens in the background actually is that there is this this nfd port contract and all of the api calls all of the nfcs created with this method will end up in the same context and this may be you know for the hackathon or for testing might be something that's uh you know quick and easy to get running but you might want more customization and for that we have a customizable meeting so the way to do that is you have to first deploy your own contract we have an end point for that and um i i i want to go through making all of these api calls here but you can try them out in the interactive documentation like i did with the other endpoints so what happens is there is a template smart contract which is public open source you can see it on github and we deploy this contract onto the polygon blockchain for you once the contract is deployed you can mint into that contract or maintain to that collection as many nfcs as you like um and you can see the the calls and options here so um you can it's quite basic uh i'm and i think you'll you'll be able to figure it out uh if you want to to go through like um if you want the more step by step walkthrough you can take a look at the tutorials because uh this will have like a relatively relatively detailed tutorial so a video and and lots of steps and code examples for you to get started quickly so this is uh this is roughly how how meeting works and since by since you have to also upload an image and metadata to usually to ipfs you have to store it somewhere you mean the nfd then we also provide storage endpoints so to store images or metadata on ipfs you can just use our upload file to ipfs endpoint and upload metadata to ipfs endpoint so we got you covered in the whole life cycle from deploying a contract to minting your nfts to actually fetching data about these nfts so you can integrate everything into your application uh and to go to to look briefly into the enhanced apis we actually have an online demo as well so if you go to nfd port dot txt and single on the top menu bar then you can search enough these for example if i search for vitalik i get um you know some placeholder images italics plot elixir but um if i do something more concrete like italic smoking with a hat there used to be mfds like that um anyway you should be able to find most of the common common collections or find from the descriptions and names of nfts using this this search and the endpoint supporting that that that website that i just showed you is our search multi-chain nft search endpoint uh where you can put in the text uh choose the chain or chains that you want to use uh and you will get the results something else that you can do which you might find interesting is uh duplicate or similarity detection so i mentioned before that you might want to check whether an nft is counterfeit or some whether similar nfd exists to that particular nfd and you can do that with either uploading and uploading an image so you upload with the request you upload a file and we will check whether an existing nfd across any contract matches that image so that you know whether that is unique or you can do that with url or token id and the the interesting thing i think for for you guys in this hackathon is that we have just launched um this was earlier today we launched an unique sdk so if you're building something with unity then you will be able to use that we haven't it's not it's very early stages very alpha phase of that sdk so we haven't made it you know like fully public with complete tutorials but for you this weekend you can go to github.comport and see nfd port unity and here you will be able to get the asset or get the get the sdk and iterate it into your uh into your unity app um there's a there's a walkthrough with steps here and a brief brief demo quick start and the list of functionality that you can use and essentially like the the idea here is that you can with it with that one i think with a single line you will be able to do some of the things that i explained before so get all nfds of a particular account or get all of nfd's in a particular contract you can mint nfts directly from unity so this is like i said this is quite quite early stages and you can get you can interact directly with the developers behind it on our discord um the discord channel of of uh of this hackathon the sponsor sponsor nft port is the channel you can get support not just for the unit sake but just like all of your questions help about using nfc port uh any way we can we're we're here for you and um if you want uh some some inspiration you can go to the community page of nfd port and you can see under the gaming section or depending depends on what you're building but your you guys have probably been building games um you can see different gaming projects that you might find interesting going through just for inspiration like what are what are other people doing what are they using nfcs for um and uh there are quite a few here i think 10 today roughly and one more thing if you if you want to get started meeting uh we have um we have increased limits for you so we have this growth package on our website it's 99 per month but for you for this hackathon we we're offering one month for free so within with the package you can mint up to 500 nfds for free and use increased api limits increase rate limits on other apis to do that to get this this offer just uh there's a link in our discord channel you have to fill in the form and then you you get instructions for how to claim this offer and i think that's it any questions so uh if you have questions i'll i can take them from the zoom chat uh i made it pretty quick right now uh so that uh i i don't take too much of your your guys time because i'm trying to be mindful of it here which chains are currently supported so if you go to the documentation and look at feature support by chain then you can see a list of by endpoint which chains are supported mainly it's ether for the data apis and the polygon for most apis including the minting and storage uh mint again contracts um rinkabi from which is the ether testnet so that's these are the support chains but you can see the details on this feature support by chain site page lucas is asking how does the mint thing on the fly when the user buys the nft works um i'm not sure what you mean by the by when the user buys the nfd i i guess you mean like um if you don't want to mint the nfd up front but when the user um is like push about you push the button that they will buy the nfd uh so we don't have like a web 3 native way for doing that yet we're planning to read something uh next week on monday so uh stay tuned for that but uh the like the easiest way for you right now would be to mean uh like call the minting end point at the point when uh when your user is buying it uh but then the payment would not be webster native so this is a limitation with the with the meeting right now uh jason is asking are there any features for event log data or maybe future plans uh event lock data i'm not sure what you mean i assume no because like the only thing is that the only data we parse out of of the chains are entity related uh like transactions and nfts themselves and collections contacts so if it's not one of those we we probably don't support it right now and probably want it in the near future so we are focused on nfts not generic chain data so a user is asking any plans to support other chains in the future uh yes we're actually building we just started building solana support right now uh it's i i can't give you like a timeline exact timeline on when that will pretty because it's uh it's not quite trivial that uh like in the next two or three months we intend to add several more of the most popular chains uh we're also looking at immutable and potentially others so it depends on on where the the developer interest is and where most of the nfc activity is any more questions waiting for your your fingers to type quickly in the in the chat can you use nfd ports to transfer ownership of nfds no so we don't currently we don't have api endpoints that help you make transactions yourselves other than minting and creating contracts so you would have to handle that on either with a direct call like rpc call to the to the chain to the contract or with some other api uh michael is asking can you burn any of these uh you should be able to yes let me like we just said i i'm not sure reject the recommendation uh quickly so deploy contract yes you search one uh yes yes there is a burn function um you are able to burn them but today we don't we haven't yet released the end point for burning them so again you would have to do this either like manually on polygon scan or uh you do the rpc call yourself to the contract uh an sql service we're probably not going to build uh build an escrow service and the reason is that we like nfd ports focus as a product is providing the essentially read and write access to nfds at like a large scale reliably across all chains and making it extremely easy for developers so it's probably not something that we are going to build in the near near future so any more questions let's give it okay uh 10 10 more seconds for for you to shoot the question we we can go on a little bit more later if you want since we started late so feel free to ask any questions okay it seems that that there aren't any coming in but like i said we will be on discord feel free to ask any questions that you have if you get stuck somewhere we'll be there to help and also um you can check out nft ports discord so if you go to an nfd port contact you will find our discord link here thank you everyone thanks divo see you at the next session [Music] [Applause] [Music]
