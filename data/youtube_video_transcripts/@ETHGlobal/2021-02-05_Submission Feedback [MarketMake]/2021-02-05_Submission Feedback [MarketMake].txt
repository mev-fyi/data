all right looks like we're good and the first team is watchful eye so if you guys are ready to go you can get that going uh should we screen share and then just play the video yeah so um sorry yeah for context the way this session is gonna go is we're going to try to keep it pretty close to um you know what you would experience with the judging session so i'm going to time these and we'll we'll keep it at you know the four minutes for your video and then four minutes for responses and feedback from our uh pseudo judges today nicola and mark so um let me just get that timer set up and then you can start all right thank you sure all right uh you want to go ahead yep and share all right here we go this is the watchful eye the watchful eye allows ave debt holders to send automated stop loss based on the risk factors of their loans the watchful eye uses an oracle that monitors the prices of the debt and collateral and compares it to the user defined stop loss once the stop loss is reached the oracle calls upon the watchful eye to use an ave flash loan to repay the pre-existing debt swap the collateral for the flash loaned asset on the one inch decks and then repay the flash loan asset with the proceeds from the swap to use the watchful eye a user must first take out a loan on the out of a protocol when the user comes to the dashboard they can see their total debt in eth their total collateral in eth and their lone health factor or their ave health factor just for the viewers sake in our wallet we have tandai which we borrowed from ave and we have 10 a-link which is our collateral on ave so first the user has to specify the details of the position that they hold on ave and as we showed a minute ago the debt we have is in dai collateral we have is a link and we have 10 die in debt and let's liquidate one a-link if we cross our threshold because that's worth about 25 and that'll cover the debt and let's say uh our debt price limit for die is usually around one let's just put one and let's say that when the link goes below 28 which right now it is we want to go ahead and liquidate so let's configure the i with the information that just adds that information to the watchful eye contract confirm then we have to approve of the i's intervention which just means that the smart contract can move around the collateral asset so go ahead and confirm that transaction so after we've approved and set up the watchful eye we can actually go to the watchful eye contract and we can go and look at the watchful eye here's the watchful eye and it's not really human readable at the moment but that's just the way that it comes back from the blockchain so now that we see that the smart contract has the the watchful eye that we created a second ago we can check out the price oracle the price oracle as we said before monitors the current price of the debt and asset and compares it to the watchful eyes set price limits so let's go ahead and start that oracle up so we see that the oracle pulled the watchful eye saw that the price was below the limit liquidity started to liquidate the position and then successfully liquidated the position watched by the watchful eye and now that the liquidation is finished we can verify that that debt was paid off in our wallet and would you look at that we no longer we have one less a link and 25 more die so we paid off the initial debt and had a little bit of dye left over and aside from what we saw in the wallet if you check the ave user data as shown on the dashboard we can see that that loan was in fact paid off and this is the watchful eye and the watchful eye is always watching nice that was uh three minutes 46 seconds by my clock so you're well under all right uh let's keep it going um judges what do you want to say uh look very quickly it's definitely um definitely you know a needed use case of course uh i see a good product market feed maybe of course you can iterate on the usability on the uh ui but of course that's that's something that can be polished later but um it seems well functioning as sims on spot on thank you it's better if i turn on my mic right i see i've seen a good amount of progress since your last presentation so congratulations on that and yeah and also good luck for for the next few days for finishing up and polishing and the product as nicola said there's good product market fit for that i will still say exactly the same advice in terms of ux you should really consider not asking or asking the less amount of information to the users because everything that you need to configure the the watchful eyes is actually on the blockchain so you can just get user account data you will do a web recall and you will retrieve uh directly if the user has a link or whatever amount of collateral what is the collateral what is the depth what is the the asset of the debt and just ask the user when do you want to basically uh execute the trade because at the end of the day it's a take profit or or stop loss uh when you look at it in the eyes of a trader and uh just configure that part just let the user configure that part and everything that you can do on behalf of the user do it directly and that would be like just a much better ux okay thank you and the ui like i love the the design and the what should i narrative like it's super cool yeah thank you great yeah and so um i don't really have a ton of feedback other than um i appreciate that you're using scaffold eth i know a bunch of people have found this useful for helping them to get a little bit further on their ui without having to you know build their own from scratch so uh i'm sure austin would love to hear any feedback you have uh if if there is some uh anything else if not we're gonna move on thanks for presenting um like i said this is pretty close to what judging will be um except you'll have a few more minutes i think there will probably be one more judge three judges per uh maybe two but um either way this is very similar to what it will be on monday and tuesday depending on when you've signed up so thanks uh watch fly for for showing us what you've been working on next up is malice and i'll just go ahead hello yes so um i think you guys advice last time and i actually created a flow chart showing how funds flow through the application um i did because my my demo is basically um it's basically finished right but um you guys said i should have created a flow chart showing all this application actually work so you want me to show um the flow chart um that's fine yeah um so this isn't going to be your your final video submission you're just going to walk through some of your yes yes um okay this is not my final video submission sure all right yeah i'm gonna still time it just so we we stay on track for people but yeah go ahead and do a quick run through and we'll give feedback on that okay so basically the way the application works is um so in step one imagine um peter has a hot dog stand right and he basically wants to accept ether as payment right what peter could basically do he could deploy a store right and by deploying a store you could use it to um attract crypto pin customers on to his hot dog stand right so in step two he's gonna deposit a hundred dollars worth of um ether into the store right because and for simplicity's sake we're gonna assume that the price of ether remains constant and it doesn't change um during the the process in step three um peter is gonna stake seventy dollars worth of the ether out of the out of the available hundred dollars balance that's on the store right um the reason why he wants to stake seventy dollars right because rather than giving a discount on his goods and services um which is the hot dogs it could stake seventy dollars worth of ethereum right uh hang on a second are you showing a different screen because all i see is seven percent cash back oh oh my god oh wait let me stop sharing this don't worry about it this is why it's a demon okay yeah okay training perfect i hope i should start over real quick um yeah yeah you probably should start over all right so in step one right peter has a hot dog stand he wants crypto paying customers to come to his hotback stand and pay for ether right he's gonna deposit a store in step two right peter is gonna put a hundred dollars worth of ethereum into the store right the price of ethereum is gonna remain constant in this scenario we're gonna assume that it remains constant and doesn't change right in step three out of the 100 worth of ethereum that's deposited right he's gonna stake seventy dollars worth of ethereum right and the reason why he wants to stake seventy dollars worth of ethereum is that rather than giving a discount on his goods and services by staking he could still achieve the same effect by attracting customers to his business rather than giving a discount and it's important because i'm going to show you why it matters in the future so in step four right the amount of the seventy dollars worth of ethereum that is staked right so imagine that three friends came to peter's hot dog stand to buy let's say a thousand dollars worth of um food even though that's a lot of food um the reason why they want to go to peter's hotback stand now is because they want to get 70 7 cash back on that thousand dollars that you're going to spend in terms of ethereum right so the thing is peter doesn't want to give give back seventy dollars worth of ether right away right so the seventy dollars worth of ethereum is going to be locked up as collateral right and there's gonna be a new token that's gonna be minted that's a one-to-one ratio with the amount of ether that's locked up right and by doing this now when the ether is locked up peter can't remove it doesn't have the ability to no longer remove that eater from the store but the users the tokens that they get back is basically going to be a wrapped ether that's back um you know one to one ratio with that one that's locked up so let's go to stomp step five so let's say at some point in the future there's some disaster hurricane or virus or something some unseen event and peter business is kind of slow and peter needs those funds that are locked up as collateral right what he um is able to do now he's able to say that hey i'm accepting i'm not accepting about those tokens that i gave out right and when the use the users come back with those tokens and respend it the collateral would be unlocked and given back to peter on in his business right um and let's go to um step six now so this is where things start to get a bit interesting so imagine that peter's business is affected the hotdog stand is really affected badly right the users still have the ability to use that token at a different store so now imagine that store b is run by alice and store b is selling nfts right so imagine that alice previously had a hundred dollars worth of collateral in store b right the users are are able to spend that same seventy dollars worth of tokens that they receive from peter that's minted in a one-to-one ratio and once once they spend it at store b to buy some form of nft right seventy dollars worth of ether would be unlocked back to out alice right and alice would still have seventy dollars worth of collateral in store b right but we still have the um and finally let's go to um the final part which is step seven so in in case seven right peter still has the seventy dollars worth of collateral locked in his store right but he still needs those funds but his business is too badly affected where nobody don't want to come back um users don't want to come back and spend those on those tokens at his store so alice decides that hey there there's a there are more circulating supply of those tokens in the market so she's gonna put up seventy dollars worth of collateral relief at a rate of thirty percent right by doing that um what peter is able to do right he's able to make a trade with alice's store right of the 70 worth of collateral that he has right by making a trade of about a 70 to 30 percent that alice put on the 70 right peter would lose 21 20 21 word of ether it would go to alice's store right and that's 70 dollars that alice put up as collateral relief would be would be locked as collateral and 41 and 49 worth of ether would be available to peter and by doing this we maintain that all the tokens that are minted in the system are always backed by ether right so users always have somewhere that they're able to spend they either whether it's by buying nfts whether it's by going out to a restaurant buying clothes wherever um anybody is able to create a store it doesn't even have to be a valid business anybody could create a store and this is all basically um and all of this could just happen just by scanning a qr code and paying for something either all of this is able to happen and that's all right cool uh that was a bit over but i'm sure once you start to make your video you'll be able to trim it down i would be able to make it shorter um because the um i basically have a demo already i just got to finish another part of the ui but this is basically how it works um users would have to use e s names to name their stores so i would be able to go online say for example i go to germany i'm in germany i'm in this city i could search okay let's see who's accepting ether in this location right and then i could find places where i could spend my ether and get seven percent cash back right without the use of a card it's completely peer-to-peer just by scanning a qr code gotcha um why don't we move to nickel and mark if you have any feedback or questions look quick one it's definitely helpful to see the diagram and and the flow chart last time we i think we all struggle to explain and understand um there is a very interesting vision behind it for sure the one thing i am uh not concerned but you know something to think about is the fungibility um that you want to [Music] you know in a sense like provide for the network that you're building so um that's not gonna be super intuitive for you know the masses right so i see the vision and i see that a sort of like iteration of these crypto networks can take off but think maybe about uh you know how easy you can integrate the stores and and the the fungibility not really technical but on a qualitative way like to make understand that people can go to one store to another and and mint and it's it's a little bit um heavy lift on on on a consumer side right at the end it's not very clear what's the benefit for them so i would i would try to make it as clear as possible for all the participants in the network what are the what are the you know the benefits of doing this because it sounds not super easy or light to do in a click i mean this is like the technical flow but it's very simple for like the customer because i'm just able to like search say for example i'm interested in a restaurant i'm in this area i'm able to search for example let's say new york city this street let's see who's running a store and i'm just able to go there and just scan a qr code pay for something with ether and the tokens that i received back are backed by ether one to one right and it's seven percent of what i spent right it's back one to one and i could assure that it's back one to one because the ethers that that's locked up by the merchant they're not able to touch to touch it the only way it's unlocked on lap a lot back to them is um if um a user actually um comes back and spend um the minted tokens the minted tokens are so think of the mint and tokens as something like die right they're backed and they're able to they're able to trade between different users right and they're they're big they're they're essentially an erc 20 token right think of they're basically a form of wrapped eat that's what they are right okay the merchant the benefits of the merchant is that you don't have a you don't have to give a discount on your goods and services you could stake and still achieve the same effect by not giving discount but in future in terms of some future event where your business is struggling that amount of ether that's locked up you could always say hey i want to unlock those on tokens that that i locked up in the initial stages mark do you have anything one of the thing like uh at the core of the project is that uh i do believe that uh ether is an asset and dai for example is a currency and it's not exactly the same thing like i don't believe that there's a future uh i'm not part of the bitcoin maximalist that think we all gonna pay in satoshi to buy stuff and make our groceries and i think it's going to be the same thing with eater because at the end of the day an asset we usually don't pay with like financial assets or stuff i don't buy a car with this last lock if i want to to buy a car with like a tesla stock i sell the stock into a currency that i use as a medium of the exchange to to actually buy the services or or the goods and that's why and on top of that uh so the good thing we have with uh inside the eight area ecosystem is that we have the stable coins and basically i'm much more confident that there's a future that more and more people pay with dye usdc or whatever stable prints they they want to use and in the the eyes of the customer and the the shop owner uh they don't have to expose themselves to highly fluctuating assets and also uh stable coins are much more borrowed in the file so if your shop owner for example instead of just stacking uh whatever they do with the the heat they they do exactly the same thing but with dye i think that just the passive income of the dye deposited will allow to slightly maybe generate over time uh the the the cash flow that is needed to back your local currency the three tokens uh one two one and basically have some kind of monetary supply that increase according to the interest of the deposits of the the the owners and because having local currency i don't know oh it is in other countries but in france it's quite big like there's a lot of local currency within the city within the area cultural stuff but uh and there's a definitely a use case for that i just think that a stable coin to be used at the core of your product would be much more easier to implement and also to adapt for all the actors involved so um so the thing is each store is also able to set accept other currencies for example like um usdc um die and and so forth the problem the problem at the core or ever cause i did research and trying doing it with a stablecoin at first but at its score one of the main problems with the current um erc20 model that all stablecoins have right is um is if i'm supposed to make a payment right currently um the transfer function right it would just transfer without having no formal way to actually check to see if there is enough um collateral to back what um what would what would essentially get minted but with ether the the the interesting thing is that you could have a fallback function that would that would be able to check that right any smart contract can implement a fallback function so erc20 is a standard but on top of the standard you you can build whatever you want so if you want to have a fallback function so a method that doesn't have a name and just execute whenever you send some money uh to it uh you can obviously do it with a sequence here token it just erc20 just means there's a standard this is like the core stuff you need to be named a erc20 token but you can add new stuff on top of that so i i don't think there's a technical limitation maybe i'm wrong of this but i don't think there's a technical limitation uh i don't i don't want to get too far in the weeds but um this is these are both good feedback from nicola and mark uh one one thing i will say warren is like this this diagram is a good step from the last time we spoke but it's still um like if this was on a slide it's still too many things going on and the text is too small or there's too much text so for your submission video try to you know condense this take this one step further and cut down the amount of text um try to get it down to like bullet points of what happens at each step and that will help judges you know really quickly scan over all these parts of your project and then it'll it'll give them a better understanding so less text and try to make it a little bit larger where you can and remember that it's going to be a single slide and you're not going to be able to zoom into it okay so have like each step on a single slide and just no no no it's good that it's all together but i just need um like for example storehub make that larger to occupy the full box there in step six uh that's just one suggestion but then these large blocks of text i'm not going to be able to read that if i'm seeing this in a presentation so try to you know trim it down condense it where you can and that will help a ton for uh legibility for whoever's judging you okay thank you thank you yeah sure uh we're gonna move on to the next project but thanks warren it's good to see progress from the last time and uh hopefully uh you'll be in my judging session i can see you know the next step of improvement uh in a few days all right next up is revert and i want to let you guys just start it i'll time it just so you have an idea of how long you're going um but you can start whenever you're ready okay uh sharing my screen true well not i will subtract d from that and then okay am i on um okay so this is our our landing page um so robert is an analytics platform for liquidity providers indexes so you can uh connect um your account with metamask or port this but uh for this demo we're gonna use some very notable movie dot eph account and so what we're doing right here is first it gets um any historic position which is really easy from the uni swap sub graph um we're just doing units for now but we go and also like query the blockchain and see any any event pertaining to those uh historically positions so like the mint the burns any transfers and from this we um build like the historic and and complete position of of the account so we can see here like the dashboard and um hey yeah really quick can you just start with a one or two sentence summary of what the project is yeah sure sorry um we were this an analytics platform for liquidity providers on decks so so will it come i think that's a i don't know like a one sentence definition but um so like um this is this is the dashboard right then uh so like this these are the open positions it looks so i'm pretty bad as this is the the total p l for the open positions but if we toggle here for like the historic um exited positions we get a really different story um so um like this is uh the current open position and on the left side we see um the metrics that are pertaining to to this specific position like the current assets what was invested or withdrawn possibly the difference between was invested and withdrawn any possible staking rewards and on the right side we see what's pertaining to the pool itself so like the volume for the last three days the reserves the volume to rate you would will inform how uh what kind of uh fees you can expect to get per dollar invested the prices for each of the assets and the price divergence between those assets which would um inform what kind of uh divergence those you can expect and uh from the position log you can see all the relevant transparent you can see here this um this position was staked at some contract but um part of the work we have to do is like um see detect what type of api the contracts conform to we have like a few this one is clearly um there's some rewards that hasn't it hadn't been um computed for this position but if we go for example to this one which was also staked in two different contracts we can see that it correctly computed um like the sashimi and sushi rewards which um what would uh show the the the important difference like pull pnl is only down the returns from the positions um from like what was getting computed from fees and uh and possible diversion loss and the total pnl includes all the rewards and also possibly all the gas costs and you have like a little index of all the relevant transactions and uh if you go to pull history you can get a uh like a much nicer visualization of uh of the same metrics which are really pertain to the pool itself and um so so from that you can get an idea if um you should maybe exit your position at this point um or or um if it looks on if it looks positive given the volume to to research radio and and the price divergence and um and yeah and just have like a an historical log of of all your exited positions these are exited positions so the asset values is zero but you can still um get the the pool and p l computed given uh what was originally invested and what was withdrawn at at the point of exit and uh like there's a lot much uh work to do but like this is our minimum bio product um using um only unit swap for now we will be adding other pools we will be adding uh other um features like notifications like it's important to maybe um be aware once you're getting close to either going negative in your p l or or otherwise and once you um the the price divergence um comes back to a point where um where you when i exited a profit um so so that that's that's the idea an analytics platform but also to be um to give you very actionable information with regards to what you want to do with your own positions and um i i think that's it i don't know nice yeah you were that was uh 40 seconds over but uh totally possible to trim that down uh let me stop your sharing um yeah so good job you're pretty close to the time limit um one thing i recommend is like you you have a lot to demo but it's always good to start with you know like i asked you the name of the project a couple slides that just have the name of the project uh the summary of what problem you're solving and uh or rather like the solution the problems that you see for your specific users and then how you're solving it and then you jump into your demo it doesn't have to be more than 30 seconds you can just do it so you recommend adding a couple of slides then before the before the demo yeah yeah it's it's a good way to just you know get everybody accustomed to what you're actually attacking and then you jump into your demo uh another thing you can include uh i wish i'm i'm sure you probably have a few things here but um uh what some features that you weren't able to include or things that you didn't get to finish but you'd like to continue working on like have that as the last slide at the end of your presentation but i think you're like 85 90 there this is a pretty good overview uh i'll let mark or nicola pick it up if they have any feedback sure look i i agree i mean it's it's to me even more than 85 90 percent uh there it's it's it's very impressive barrio good job um it's very useful i liked it a lot um you know with my uh i would say business and and and crypto network mind um i always think of where it could go and you know starting with the product going into business going into a crypto network that can attract uh powerful network effects so what i would suggest you to to to think it's yes this is a very good product there is a strong use case it can be on top of you know you can pull more than be on top of other protocol but you can pull from from you know one decks and whatever um one thing i i would like to ask you is can you combine the position i i don't know if i missed that can you actually combine the position and have a uh p l overview of your portfolio sort of so it kind of becomes like a portfolio management tool which is very powerful um but it's you know it's different from from zerion's upper like this one is more uh on literally an overview of what you holding and the risk that you're managing so think it more like a risk management tool uh for for like a lp and stuff uh yeah so can you combine the positions yeah yeah it's the first like that has like a total aggregate position okay okay you can toggle between like the open positions only or your like historic exit positions to see like your p and l okay but yeah and you're exactly right like this is specifically for um for lps and not not like a general wallet tool like just to and manage risk is a good way to to define it yeah yes absolutely so yeah so total position i didn't know if it was referring to the like total of one position above all or portfolio yes i mean there's so many things and think about it also i don't know you can you can have a link for you know option protocols and you can hedge it by itself and and it's very very powerful as a tool so good job thank you yeah i have to share that i'm impressed you gain yourself a new user and i hope you have good service because uh i will it around so expect a lot of connection in the next few hours and uh i during your presentation i tested and it's actually on main that is working right now it's a it's an actual working project there's still a lot to do and to improve uh obviously but uh it's it's a fully fledged project as it is today and it's uh completely impressive what you managed to build and what uh the the challenge uh i can see for this kind of project is oh to maintain and keep uh the flow of new asset to watch and uh that's will be i think the the most technical challenge uh do because right now you i i have the sense that you are doing a bunch of hrgs cool so basically when i connect my wallet with my meta mask you basically say balance off balance of balance off and then i just ask for everything that is inside your white list of uh lp pools but uh if the guy has like 200 different pools with like many uh uh transaction it would take like 10 20 minutes to to load and it's uh and servers are are not cheap so i i i don't know if you sell hosts or oh it works on your site but uh it's quite a challenge and also there's new tokens happening like every hour so how to keep up uh do did you think about this aspect do you want to open source your backend so anybody can do a pull request and basically uh do the the the leg work to add a new asset to monitor just like for example v-fat uh and uh i'm thinking of the fat tools that is doing like some guild farming uh monitoring as well and uh they have this model so everything is open source the keyboard is public and if you want your protocol to be uh supported uh by vidfat you you can build the the pull request yourself um yeah so so first there's there's clearly no back end this is all javascript talking directly to like instagram clion site so everything else but we bring another important point though like you're absolutely right once you get to like these accounts that have a hundred positions it'll take a lot of time so having a back-end then that can like catch um those those type of accounts so it's faster um yeah it's like definitely an improvement that that uh we plan to make i i think uh you asked something else that i'm forgetting uh right now oh do you handle the because the project is very interesting but in order to work you will have to constantly uh monitor new pools so it's quite a technical challenge i think it's possible technically to do it automatically but at some point you will need to do some creation because uh you have the ambition to for example monitor if uh this uh token that is linked to a farm is there some claim rewards but not every single token is a fork of uniswap which is a fork of yam or whatever we had this summer some uh token and some project have like not very standard uh way to claim reward to stake and all this kind of stuff so what uh what did you think around uh this area yeah you're exactly right man i wish i wish everyone was using like the original synthetics taking rewards contract and it will make my life much easier but um but yeah for now like it's gonna be like uh sort of like a cat and mouse game of like determining the different apis like right now we we have uh four or five different um apis which we can um and so some are used by a lot of different pools but um but you're right like it is it is um it is like a constant work i'm hoping eventually the industry will like converge in some sort of standard with regards to that but but yeah like uh open source is definitely something we are considering it would be ideal if we could somehow make it so that people can contribute like those like apis that are specific to their own project without um necessarily requiring to open source the whole thing i mean i'm not i love open source obviously being in this industry but like strategically like for building a company i'm not sure if we're ready for for doing that but maybe there's like uh somewhere in the middle where we can just like expose an interface where um the farms can like uh add their their unique apis or something without regards yeah well thank you so much for the kind words mark that that that's great tradition and i really hope you you keep working on it i continue thank you excellent thanks for sharing and some good feedback from mark and nicolette victor if you're ready uh i will let you start and i'm going to time you are you going to share a demo video or what's your plan here uh yes i'm ready i'm sharing okay i will start the timer once you go hello i'm presenting future salaries a fair way to pay salaries to sign looks like we lost sound yeah i don't have the sun let's try again [Music] victory can you give me the youtube link and i'll play it i think i think what happened is you didn't share your audio so it's coming through your speakers and then going into your mic or you can try to share it again uh victor you can either send me the link or you can try to reshare it by one of the things you have to remember to do is there's a little check box in the bottom bottom left and it'll ask you to share your computer sound i think that might be the issue yep i can't tell if you're waving to me or you want me to check dms or something um he's also muted uh can you mute him uh tren or uh yeah victor you want to try and what we can do is to take the the next team and then go back to victor don't worry victor you will have to your time to shine okay yeah that makes sense so uh who's next haciendas do you want to try and share that would be lucia and xavier hi uh yes so it's me and javier i think he is yeah he's here as well um so our project haciendas is um in browser game so um do you have the video link maybe you can just play the video uh i can find it but if you have it on hand that would be yeah i'll just send you the link okay so i'll send it just to everyone just to a chat sure so it's on there okay and you'd like me to share this yeah if the audio is better sharing from your screen uh it would be the same either way but i have it up so i can do that for you are you new [Music] all right here we go not seeing anything on my side yeah really to start it yeah yeah oh did i switch to uh the wrong screen sorry about that it's all right it's a practice day for everyone yeah apparently i can try to share my screen yeah if you want to go ahead and try it it's actually good practice for you as well okay okay let's see if this will go back to the start okay so let me know if the volume is is that is it already there's no audio okay all right sorry turn i think you won't have to share this yeah i'll try it again and make sure i'm actually on the right screen this time okay we could see the screen it just audio was videoed the video didn't start yeah previously it was isn't that isn't that zoom that is trying to prevent to to to have another source of audio perhaps yeah i'm not sure why it would do that for me i think i have all my settings properly uh victor we are seeing your message we basically don't know how to make a transition you still still no audio action yes we do have a joke it's worth it do that yeah let's do that okay cool and victor we saw your message yeah your turn is just after don't wait transactions do you find it hard to wrap your head around token swap and liquidity pools it's so confusing it's even been called weird defy no one really knows what's going on you're not alone and being confused and haciendas is here to help in the magical world of haciendas you can meet and chat with other d fires you can chat with other characters and trade tokens with each other haciendas offers you a simple and intuitive chat interface to chat with your friends and make new ones in the game you have assets stored in your inventory use them to deposit swap transact and borrow not only can you see how many tokens you have by opening the inventory you can also drag them around for making real world transactions not only can you chat with the other players but you can also transact with them using real cryptocurrencies simply drag drop determine your amount and send if you'd like to exchange your tokens for some other coin you can go visit the market and swap out ether die or several other coins we've leveraged the power of one inch exchange so you can easily exchange your coins for others with the least possible hassle we hope this video made you want to learn more about the exciting world of d5 and we're happy you're starting your journey with us try it out today all right thanks trent um so yeah that was our demo video and just a quick note on that we're still working out two more key actions one is the governance feature the other one is i think token swap so we will be adding more content to this video and expanding um sort of like what the game can offer so this video is what work in progress is not complete um we'll also edit it to be more fluid so in the beginning it was a little bit you know the pacing wasn't right because we're like very tight on that line um but yeah so this is this is the the idea and yeah let me know how i can present this better if you want more introduction on what this is about and that the roadmap and stuff yeah yeah yeah it sounds like you have already already know what you have to add to this uh it was uh not enough knowledge i want to know everything about this project um you've given us like a tiny sliver and it seems like a really cool concept of thanks um i really wanted to open up a medieval pawn shop for avi there with like a small ghost that uh as a teller and you can deposit your die and the small girls will give you a die in exchange into your inventory let's do this together yes yes yes so um maybe just like some background on why this game was created and what we're trying to solve is is that the like the format of this yeah you you can you can do that now but definitely you'll want to include that in the there's a few slides or just like a little bit of preamble before you do a demo video oh so you actually want that information in a demo video as well yes yeah that would be good to have because you know when this is going to end up as part of a project showcase so when somebody goes to look at your project it's good to have a little bit of background in the videos yeah okay we'll add that um yeah so um our target audience are people who are new to divi so they have some sort of um basic understanding of cryptocurrency but they're not anywhere near proficient at using uh different device apps and different protocols so there are three pillars of this game that tries to solve the problem kind of break bringing innovation to people who are used to conventional banking apps and you know conventional everything so what we see is like the gap between uh d5 where everything is very abstract and it uses a different mental model and what people are used to for money being very visible and untangible and even very social so we're adding three things to to help people learn so basically to teach people how to use d5 protocols and to make it less daunting for them to start using these tools so we're making it more social so the feature where people can walk around meet so meet virtually other users and have a real interaction with them before swapping tokens so that's the social aspect we're making it more visual for users to see how token transaction happens because oftentimes when you're doing a transaction between wallets or sending it like into the ether like you don't really see where it end up and there's no visibility into like the back end like the system so uh so just having that interactivity on the front and for them to drag and drop the tokens it appears and disappears from their inventory add more realness to uh these transactions and the other thing is just make it more fun so like the game idea is to make it like less boring like just like instead of looking at strings of hash and you know like digits like up to like 12 decimal points like would just make it like a bit more like dummy proof in a way that they can still learn different protocols in a way that kind of prepares them to start using um like ave or like unit swap or all kinds of d5 apps so um we are adding the governance feature to it so in the governance feature um they are able to vote on proposals in a very kind of you know fun and visual way that they're literally voting on pieces of paper in in a town hall building so that's that's the idea i think this is really great i'll echo what i said before is like it's a really cool concept and we've only seen a part of it uh my one question is would this make more sense on the test net if you're trying to is it more an educational tool or is it uh an interaction space for people who are already in d5 because if so you're trying to get somebody to learn how to use these protocols it's pretty tough to do that on mainnet currently especially if somebody's just getting just learning about this stuff and then they go to transaction and it's the transaction cost is more than the actual uh amount sent so exactly i would strongly suggest if you can um not not by sunday obviously uh look at doing this on a test net or a side chain like medic i think that would really help the the educational tool aspect of this but i love the concept yeah i think it is currently living on the test net yeah and um the users get you know like fake ease obviously they're they're not going to have to connect their real wallets um so that's another way for them to feel like they have some confidence to start doing stuff without or having to learn how to set up a wallet but xavier can correct me if i'm wrong here i think we're also using matic oh right yeah exactly yeah it makes a lot of sense like to travel integration of quick swap for example on magic and uh just enjoy the game like uh as this kind of game and the the targeted audience at least at the beginning will be people just discovering crypto you have like on-ramp for example with transact directly on matic so you have almost no transaction fee uh where you can convert the small elements and have it directly inside the game so that's probably an integration that might be interesting and then i just use like in the the market quick swap and do everything on a on a sidechain uh directly from day one because uh it will kinda win the user experience if you try to do it on the settlement players these days yeah yeah we're going to do that guys quick quick uh quick feedback as well i like it it's interesting is it's a sort of like you know two different uh vertical crossing roads so it's it's very appealing one thing you know a risk to sound like a broken record but that's also my role i guess here always think about it um yes it's a cool product is something fun but also is it like a it can be a business is it investable does it accrue value can we you know pack economics on it can we attract users so always at least have on the back in your mind all those additional metrics that you know will help you make it more fun more interesting more attractive and more uh you know valuable as network effect yeah definitely so the when we were thinking about the business model is uh you know this game um when we're presenting it so the demo um project is branded for abbey so there are the branding elements they're trading avi tokens ausdc and they're going to use the the ave governance protocol to to do the governance stuff so what we're thinking is that this can be kind of like white labeled for different kind of d5 projects so say if um i don't know sushi swap is trying to onboard new users they can use this game as kind of like a like their onboarding process just charge me some rent for my job my bishop in the game i will pay some rent don't worry about it yeah this is genius yeah very very good concept yeah but i'm sure there are other ways to monetize it if um if people actually start using it and then uh when we can see which features engage users the most um that's other monetization opportunities but right now yeah white label yeah look monetization is uh especially on you know the vast majority of the conversation that we have um with very early like pre-seed or seed stage it's not really the focus right because users um usability ui traction that's the most important things you know we also saw massive like multi-billion company on web 2 that they didn't know how to monetize and then all of a sudden it just you know turn the page and they don't monetize and they fund it so it's not a priority it's more i see it in in in in crypto and on the blockchain sphere it's more about something sustainable you know it like crypto is about economics right and crypto economics so you like if it's fun if it's cool it's gonna just last you know until it's cool uh something else but if you build some economics behind it then it's gonna be more sustainable so don't really focus on we need to find a monetization right now it's not needed but think about sustainability of the of the of the network that's it yeah yeah super uh i don't i don't want to cut the discussion short because there's a lot to go over but we do have three more projects so we're going to move on to the next one thank you lucia and javier this is really cool thank you thank you uh all right round two victor you want to try and share we'll get this going uh hello i'm sharing again i think this way this time it will work i'm starting to share hello i'm presenting future salaries a fair way to pay salaries to scientists researchers developers might be journalists etc i will show the demo here is the demo anybody can register for a salary let pressing just one button suppose i'm registered here i have uh tokens on account tokens paid every second you see every second and i mean to withdraw by a single metamask transaction uh anyway you can't donate if we will press this button we see safe where we can choose the date uh the donations will be transferred and can play in or token i have even uh sorry um git coin version of my software a model for bitcoin i'm shown it now i'm switching to the presentation future salaries project prediction market of prediction markets or how to hire google to create an oracle how to finance science and facebook where transferring money from the future how to hire search engines to do the job for us how to use prediction market to stimulate the market to create oracles for us prediction markets the production market is here as a definition uh the traders tend to buy a conditional token if they expect that an event happens in the future so prediction markets aim to transfer value from the future to the present a prediction market could be a good tool to determine salaries of scientists make salary determined by a predicted score in the future for example after 100 years a promising student could receive the same salary as an established nobel prize winner we can receive future donations in 100 years and pay this money now huge salaries for us the big trouble is that somebody needs to pay to develop and run oracles in the future events i'd like google to do it for me if you want google to do it for us we need to create market that will pay for google it my market will play to search engines well it's designed by walls so in this diagram during 100 years after 100 years so i might idea you saw it that pays every registered user one token per second everybody including himself at any moment can't request to recuperate user's salary that is to create a new token for him if he changes the job returns or dies the more thematical model of transferred money from the future and more in my scientific article playing sellers to scientists using prediction markets on blockchain thank you for your attention these questions i'm finished cool yeah uh you're definitely under time so if you want to like uh add maybe another let's see it's a two less than three minutes so you have another minute if you wanted to expand on things just so you know uh my first feedback is you might want to consider putting the slides before the demo that way people can have a better understanding of your project before you start you know uh i did consider but decide it's best to show how it works first to see what it is for the user how easy is it is to use it okay um the other thing is you had a slide with a diagram that showed you know the relationship between people making markets and then people receiving payouts but you were only on it for a split second so maybe stay on that slide a little bit longer just so um judges and anybody looking at the video can uh understand the flow of ether through the system a little bit better i understand but i don't think it would be better because on the diagram it would take too long time to really analyze the diagram it would be it would take all the time just just show that it exists uh i think i think it would still be helpful to have you know you stay on it maybe at least for 10 or 15 seconds again you have extra time you're well below the four-minute limit so i would um stay on that graph a little bit longer and just try to explain the flow of of funds um but it's your choice whether to do that i'm afraid it takes entire four minutes to explain it makes no sense i think so i'm not sure but i think so okay uh yeah i would still recommend that but it's it's your choice how you want to present the project um nicola or mark i'll turn it over to you look very quickly uh it is definitely more organized and and clearer than the previous time um i still see a little bit of jumping from uh paying salary going to scientists uh google i don't know i didn't really get the reference that you have on google at some point on the slides and then um one suggestion i would give is keep it up as general as possible in terms of use cases i understand that you have you know this interest and pathos for paying salaries for scientists but i would keep it more general just to you know the common audience to understand better and and yes yeah the common yeah audience people uh to understand better uh also you know more versatile as application so that's that's my feedback do you mean uh to say paying salaries to common good producers instead of saying paying salaries to scientists i mean it seems like that you know if you say paying salaries to scientists just you know that very specific niche and but maybe can be broadened to a larger scope no uh let me explain i agree on that right now so this system is very appropriate for paying salaries to scientists and software developers as free software developers it also may be good for paying salaries to uh journalists but i'm not sure and important and important thing it's a good thing for pain to open source and all open access publishers but to enumerate the full list takes much much time i decided to focus on true look look also you know since we are on on crypto blockchain the developer and open source i would say salaries use case is pretty strong so what use cases like the you said scientists and developers right so of course i would probably shift onto developers since you will find so many developers interested right into the model maybe they can contribute so you recommend to say um pain pain salaries to open source developers yeah i mean if you think about who is going to spend right mark yeah support to open your software let's say uh while you're there that he did a super great project uh just before uh i want to support him for x amount of uh die per month and it's paid like every block or every second in increments uh uh for as long as you keep uh doing a great job but without finance i think a tool like yours can be useful in that case we have very different accents i'm russian you are probably from uh echoing what nicola is saying that it might be a good use case to consider open source developers um so yeah i think we're i agree with nicola and mark as well um maybe you can consider describing it to a broader audience not just scientists like i know you did mention developers or journalists maybe it could be broader than that it's like just public goods paying salaries into the future the hard part is that the quality of the work need to be measurable measurable scientists work can be measured free software developers work under measured but how to measure journalists how to measure whatever i don't know if it's possible well i mean if it's subjective or if it's if it's uh by the community of people who get value from it wouldn't they just be able to measure it themselves it is uh excuse me i told it it's measured by future search engines traders predicted how it will be measured it's the prediction determine the price now that the salaries it was this way okay gotcha yeah i guess they could all fit into that model roughly any any other any other comments or suggestions i need community review of my project it would be better if i publish it on my net without first getting a review for many people i'm trying but it's hard to get the review yeah i mean that's that's what we're doing now we're giving you some some feedback and some comments detailed review of details uh i don't know how deep we can get in this session but um at the end of the hackathon you'll have a showcase with a description you know this video that you've produced and maybe that will allow some more i mean detailed review after reading all the details uh how it works maybe not all the details but my article my like white paper needs to be read before giving any comments it makes no sense to comment without uh without reading it um i don't i don't know if it's a reasonable expectation that people should read the white paper before understanding the project it's a it's a it's a very unusual project it's impossible to explain in short i explained but in short but not in details okay yeah just keep in mind that uh for judging it will be like you you already made a short video so it's gonna have to be explained in the short video um judges aren't gonna have the time to read a long paper so all right uh we're going to move on to the second to last project which is liquidify uh morris are you around yes uh i mean i don't really i don't have a video um available right now i just wanted to roughly discuss my idea um which is i'm basically just following uh the the escrow protocol and trying to have more multiple people join uh perhaps like a flash loan or a uh uh just get a collat a collateral debt uh do you have do you have slides or any anything that we can look at concrete i can uh let me share my screen do you okay do you see uh the screen yes uh yeah so basically it's i just want to expose the the flash loan uh and at the point of the loan i'm trying to have it so you can have multiple people and also multiple assets um you know basically it's been done before but uh i was thinking that at the after the loan is is put in and you have before it's paid back um perhaps you have multiple users um in an escrow and before that loan is paid back they could put it in a pool and get interest on that okay so are you are you looking for feedback on your general concept um i guess just the general concept because uh it's very slow on my process so uh you know it's it's one thing once you have the loan and then you and then you have that period before you pay it back so i'm wondering if it's feasible to have multiple users join put a deposit in and then attempt to maybe arbitrage that before the loan is paid back okay yeah i mean this is uh i i don't have a deeply technical background so i might have to outsource this to mark or maybe nicola um yeah i don't have any comments on the the technical parts of this right now i think we it's more a technical question to to unlock yourself from this situation and i don't think the current section is the best match to have this kind of discussion and to go uh deeper into to it so what we we will do is that uh please add me directly on discord and i will create a group with you and we will fix that together don't worry about it okay but let's talk about the project and the back-end side of things uh we will solve that at a later point let's try to have this section about the project in general okay um yeah i was just trying to just take advantage and uh so why don't you state the concept of the project really simply in one or two sentences i guess uh facilitating an escrow and then uh having multiple people join in and then then perhaps apply the loan a flash loan at that point and then during the loan um deposit that in a lending pool to earn interest i guess that would be very quick on the technical side that's not an option because there's no uh time concept within a flash loan a flash loan is a transaction that starts with borrowing some funds do some stuff with it and then uh sending back the money and everything happened at the same time from a technical perspective so as there's no time frame there's no accrual of interest so if you take a flash loan and deposit some money into ave and then withdraw that money and pay back the flash loan uh you are guaranteed to lose money because the flash loan is not free there's a flash fee and there will be no actual accrual of interest so your gains for that operation will be zero what about putting it into a pool um there's no time frame everything happened at the same time okay so we have to be before alone uh in other words you just have a bunch of people who give you that you'll be able to uh have more collateral if you have a larger group there's no concept of karate only in a flashlight so you don't need it's zero collateral loans to flashlights so yeah having having a dow with like 1000 heat in it will not change the situation of the flashlight at and i think that's the discussion we should have after the session and to to get back to to all the other protocol works i will be more than happy to support you on that and david as well which is not present today but it is also his job to to support you on that side don't worry about okay that sounds great yeah to echo mark i i don't think um i think you you may have a misunderstanding of how flash loans work in that you can't use a flash flood to gain interest in depositing a pool because it's it's never actually in the pool it just it goes in and out within the same block so there's no interest to a crew but yeah mark marcus and some of the other ave team members are probably uh best suited to walk you through that or uh look look closer at your quote in the discord nikola did you have any comments no no i mean i i guess on this aspect mark is your man um and you know when when you gravitated to the pool and and sort of it sounds like the multiple parties wanted to run a strategy together but yeah it didn't really make sense with the timing of the flesh loan so i was actually confused myself but then mark took off the doubts uh from the table so that's it for me so what and what about just an escrow a straight escrow i guess that would be like three parties where uh one person would um monitor that escrow amount that that multiple people would have deposited but i guess it would have to be uh you know a reason for that someone to be paid back yeah i was just thinking to see you know just to group the funds together first or during the loan but of course not during the loan because it's too quick but i guess group the funds first and then uh pull them together gain interest uh yeah i guess the loan would be that's also going to pull out on their own so if you want to pull fans in order to take a loon together and your only advantage to do that would be like the economies of scales are doing one borrowed transaction instead of three for example or x x amount and you may consider that you will save on transaction fee doing that but the thing is that setting up the smart contract vault in order to set up the funds depositing there then initiate and execute the transaction from the vote to borrow and then distribute it back the fund to the user will i'm quite sure of it cost you way more uh in transaction fee that just do the action separately and if you consider any individuals there's no difference of benefit in defile in general if your position is 100 or 100 million dollars you will pay probably the same uh the same rate uh of course there's the liquidity available in in the in the reserve that will change at the uh the interest rate depending up the available liquidity but uh there's no direct advantage uh to pull funds and borrow together unless that's the main use case so there's a community that wants to pull food together to borrow in the in order to fund a project together that might be a use case oh yeah definitely follow up with the ave team they are experts in anything flash loans uh but that's probably best on discord and async okay thank you all right uh we're gonna move on to the final project which is guardians but before that just a quick reminder for everybody's submission is sunday uh february 7th at 11 59 um p.m so basically midnight you got to get in yourself before that uh because directly after that we're going to be reviewing videos and leading up to it you know making sure people have good sound quality they didn't speed it up we want to make sure that judges can understand your videos so we have some guidelines that we've put in the discord please make sure to check those uh if your audio is messed up or there any other issues we will ask you to re-record because otherwise the judges will not be able to understand what your your project actually is um but yeah so remember sunday midnight eastern is the submission deadline we've already got about a good chunk of the projects coming in so uh that's that's good to see if you don't have it you still have a few days and if you need feedback please reach out to anybody on the youth global team we're more than happy to provide video feedback um emily is there anything else that i miss um no nothing specific um yeah i guess but everyone has got their videos kind of on the go just to make sure to put a lot of effort into those videos because that's like a true showcase of the work you've put in this past three weeks right uh the other thing i'll mention is judging is you can sign up for a slot now the judging is going to be monday and tuesday of next week you're not obligated to nobody's required to be judged of course but um it's a good way to get feedback in a structured setting from people who work full time in the space and if you're interested in that feedback that's that's how you're going to get it is by signing up for a judging slot okay we're going to move on to guardians muhammad if you want to go ahead and share are you going to be just talking about your concept or do you have a demo uh i will be just talking about the concept we still working on the demo but we have like some codes and i have like a diagram to explain the project okay go ahead thank you okay ah can you guys see my screen yes yes so just before i want to talk about the project guardians of wallets so the idea was to solve the problem of recovering wallets um i know it's it looks like a little bit far from d5 but we introduced d5 to this project as well uh so we have been thinking and there have been a lot of solutions um like uh starting it with your family member or delegated to your institution but we went for a very different approach so the idea will be a user connected to our application and he can actually ask to uh store his password what's going to happen next is as uh his phrase will be split into multiple pieces and our smart contract gonna get random guardians to store his his key so how it's actually working once the the split the seed phrase are split they are encrypted with the public key of the guardian chosen they are chosen randomly we're using channeling to generate some random numbers who can to match uh people that we get on the guardians that they're gonna uh hold the password and then we encrypt with a master key this is very important this is the only password that you need to remember uh once this is done uh we're sending all these things off chain and the guardian will receive an alias for example for me i'm gonna name it um sea cucumber and then he will have sea cucumber and one seed phrase encrypted with his public key and then with the master key and he need to store it and then we generate a token for him which is a one-on-one token uh that he will be earning interest on and every time this user came back and asked for his password recovery uh we will release the the price or the award for uh storing this this password of course this is a payable uh service uh the second part of it it's which is very important the question is like what happened if he uh lose the access to our application uh we give him the chance to store the guardian list in ipfs so it's going to be like seekercumber and this is the user that the public key of uh the address of people holding my uh my password and it's going to be a redundancy because maybe in when we want to retrieve the password later one of the guardians cannot answer or he don't he no longer have the password so we have redundancy as security uh the same thing happened when you want to recover it so you just come and ask to recover your password you send like the master key which is uh encrypted uh for each uh user so it's going to be encrypted by the public key of each guardian and then you send it to the smart contract then the smart contract needs to uh forward that to to uh to the guardian so they can send you your password and then there is an acknowledge uh uh it's like an agreement that could be signed so we can release uh release the token for them that's uh that's the idea i hope that it's uh clear and yeah if anybody have questions the same the back end is very simple it's an invitation sent to the guardians uh who want to activate to accept it they need to accept it and uh then we have like uh the list of guardians and um everything else just for this demo is happening here uh uh all the encryption is happening on javascript side so all in the display and encryption of the word is happening in javascript this is just for the demo it's not gonna be uh it's not gonna be on on on like that uh we have like a backhand and um yeah that's it if you guys have a question please don't hesitate to ask uh who wants to start so so the first thing maybe i missed it but how is chain link involved in this we just need some random we just like for example okay just to get some random numbers and just we can choose the guardian randomly so that okay we should not know each other they should be completely random yeah yeah uh so if if you're gonna use like i probably say this every session diagrams are really really helpful um but if you're going to include this in your slides you know i've been recommending people for their four minute videos start off with a few slides to introduce the problem they're solving how they solve it and then a diagram for a layout i would simplify this dramatically um like it looks like this is a technical diagram where you have your functions and stuff in there um try to get an enormi friendly version of this for people who might not be technical uh that would be really helpful okay yeah sure oh i think yeah that's i think we already have a simple one as well okay perfect yeah i mean just generally the concept is good um yeah please go ahead i'm listening uh yeah the concept is good you know not everybody can be expected to self-custody and i think the middle road is some sort of recovery scheme like we've seen in argent uh uh or even gnosis is is kind of along that the notice multisig is uh somewhere along that that spectrum um so it's a worthwhile project uh mark or nicola do you wanna have any feedback look very quick before mark can really had uh much more on the technical side it's interesting there is a definitely a market uh it fits in between existing um solutions um i would like to ask you um about the you know how you envision it uh is it a standalone application as you said or you want to be on top of um different solution you want to be like what label you want to be a sort of like uh how how do you envision the the final product to look like for the user and where the users can actually interact with it so uh yeah that's uh that's a very good question so we're basically uh thinking should deploy this on magic blockchain because we want low fees and also we're having a lot of transaction happening of chain especially when we handle the seed phrase even that it's encrypted but the public key uh but it's uh for now we're discussing that it's gonna be a standalone application so uh okay yeah okay okay gotcha but definitely uh if there is anybody in a sponsor who is willing and interested uh interested to integrate it i'm i'm just thanking any wallet who want to integrate a service like that yeah that would be great yeah i i think that's the the main project market fit actually having one of the existing wallets to uh directly sponsor or buy the technology or whatever uh like you can still have it open source but the implementation and the the new uh to to implement it on behalf of wallets could be or something very valuable like in our ecosystem it happens quite a lot at the end of the day it's quite interesting uh i have to say it's uh it's quite a twist because usually uh recovery scheme uh you are based uh with people you know as guardian and you introduce this context of randomization to have like people you absolutely don't know as guardian and that might be interesting i would need more information on what is the incentivization scheme for the guardians to actually do their work and keep your data because uh i'm not a good guy if you give me like some data to someone which is just a a chunk a file i have to keep on my computer i will forget about it three day after and just never think of it again and if there's some kind of incentivization that might be interesting uh and uh yeah this kind of things we're also talking that thinking that he can actually put it on ipfs as well since nobody knows nobody knows about this guy it's not connected you know he's gonna just put like all his private uh storage seat race in one place and once we need him he can come back calling otherwise he can always they didn't have a call storage as well but uh the motivation would be really that the the award because he's sitting on an award he's he's he's earning interest on his uh avi talking but he cannot get him unless someone uh asked to recover the password so if you don't have the password and we have redundancy remember so if we come and said like who has the first for example the first part we send it to the first person and if we don't have it we're going to the second one right so this is a motive this is the motivation so it's like a it's like a proof of work kind of so if you don't give me back the password you're not getting paid okay okay okay thank you very much for your work of course thank you i was actually impressed
