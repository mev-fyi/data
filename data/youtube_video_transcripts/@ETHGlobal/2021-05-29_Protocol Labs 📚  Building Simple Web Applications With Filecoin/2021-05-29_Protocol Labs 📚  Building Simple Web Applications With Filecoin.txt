just waiting for the stream to go live okay what's up great okay thank you everyone for joining we have cake from protocol labs who's gonna give a talk titled building simple web apps with falcoin that i'll let you take it away cake thank you heather and um thank you everyone who's taking their saturday today to build with me um i have a cool workshop today we're going to split it up into a lot of cool segments where you can kind of follow me as i build live and make a lot of mistakes and i hopefully can show people that it's not too hard to store data with filecoin ipfs you know you can just kind of quickly whip together an example application and maybe turn something bigger so i think um hopefully whoever is working on stuff on this hackathon or the sweater weekend um kind of a good time with some of this so um i've been for some context um i've kind of my mental model for file coin is probably different than a lot of the other people's like discussions in social media i think it's pretty simple what people want to do without going they just want to store data find data and retrieve anything anytime and there are a lot of other terminologies that kind of get thrown around but this is really as an application developer i want to provide this value prop to my end users and so just a quick reminder everything we do is open source and i'm really happy to help and give you all our time i'm a total nerd so all i do is really program all the time and i'm more than willing to just you know like help you work through these projects um so you know check us out online um there'll be links later and also i want to give a quick plug from my sponsor uh we have micro grants and so um if you're building something really cool um with the ipfs file coin libpdp we'll go into those topics later uh you know there's five grand to take it to the next step so you know you should take advantage of this uh you don't have to work alone in a room by yourself you can reach out to us and get a grant get some help um and you know have a you know if you have a bigger idea you know talk to us too we have a lot of great people who have ways to help you and move you along the process and so i was talking about earlier there's two fun worlds there's a building of textile hub which um you know i'm like the biggest textile fanboy hype man whatever you want to call it um i think what they do is incredible i think the team is incredible i think they you know we're this year we're going to make a lot of cool stuff so you don't miss out on the stack i think it's kind of like using amazon services apis that are a lot like way easier um and then we also built this thing recently um called estuary and i think it's a really cool way to upload data to the file coin network and you know really see deal progress and see which miners you're working with and it's like part consumer tool part developer tool i'm really excited to show you guys um so build a textile hub um you know if you if you're on twitter and you see like what they're sharing a lot there's buckets there's thread db there's powergate um there's documentation for all of it and um you know i'm i'm here to kind of show you guys how this is like gonna be uh a lot simpler with just a simple code example and the the example we will be going through is uh this repo i keep sharing non-stop sorry it was annoying but it's uh called next bucket and basically it's like an example next.js application um that you can basically just you know use a little pdp identity and then you can uh you know get a follow-up address right away but you don't have to use it it's kind of just a thing that you have um and then you can uh create a bucket upload a file and it's really quick so we'll we'll walk through setting this up because i i'm curious you know how hard is it today i've looked at the repo in a while so um we'll do that to get it together and um part of the reason why you want to use a i don't think i ever talk about this when i give a workshop it's part reason why you want to even use um you know a service provider like textile is because maybe you don't want to deal with all the state that's involved with you know deal transfer and you know maybe you don't want to like infer all the values that are tough to infer because you know like you don't know the file coin spec and you don't know what like sectors even mean you know you're just an application developer and you want to build an app for people and you want to get files on online and so you know textiles api i just showed some code that looked complicated but like this probably looks complicated but we'll walk through it um you know this is all you really need to initialize your textile uh bucket and create buckets and upload files and so we'll do all that and um you know it is another example of you know why textiles valuables because maybe you don't want to manage all these go dependencies when you're running your own you know go server or go code or node and so um you know another advantage to kind of just using a simple template using a library and letting other people run in front for you as an application developer and so here are some examples of things that i've built that are also part of the example that i'll show you guys today so we have storage market we have file app this code's all open source although this one's not very good i apologize but data is accurate so please battle me on the internet if you don't think this stuff is accurate we because of verified file coin storage deals prices are near zero so i mean you know say what you want and then um you know here's like uh my first test with textile stack and you are able to make file client storage deals i went and verified my filecoin address i went and up took a cid and put it on um and put it through the flow and it does work so um you know your source code for that too so without further ado let's do it let's uh let's get into the code and so i'm gonna take a break from my presentation i'm using nova it's kind of a i know sublime text 4 is uh going to be available to developers soon and so um or i think it currently is but i use nova and you can use any id you like uh here i am at uh the application research repo and right here if i click on next bucket people are wondering okay jim like what are you going on about like what is this stuff they'll read it you know why would i use this gem um you know you want to put things on ipfs easily you love using text style well you might once you start using this um you can use any gateway to achieve your cid um you know cids are the whole topic you have to understand later if you have no idea about the ipfs ecosystem or anything involved with it um metamask is probably like a foreign concept unless you maybe came from foundation you used uh metamask to authenticate there and um yeah so let's just do this there's some setup steps this is probably where people most people turn away um you know this whole git clone thing this whole environment variable thing gosh what is that secrets i don't know um so i'm just gonna go here i'm gonna use this template and i'm gonna do it in my own repo and i'm gonna be like my cool storage app and this is a cool storage application and i'm gonna create a repository from template cool let's hopefully this goes quickly and there's gonna be a lot of like painful breaks during this uh things take time to load cool so code i'm gonna clone this and here's my terminal here's where i do software development it's the real deal as interesting as it is i guess i'm going to do git clone my cool storage app i'm going to go to cd my cool storage app and i'm going to ls you can see all the files here that i have in this that's kind of neat so um yeah what are the steps so here i ask you to create a m.local file and i'm using a mac but this also works on linux so you can just do touch and local cool um if you follow that step there you're like okay jim like whatever uh lsh hlt you can see it's there and you might still be like whatever um so if you hit open we can go to um here's all the code i write i guess um where is i can't find my own stuff where did i put this oh sorry guys cool so here's the app and then here's your m.local file it's empty i'll just copy and paste this in and gosh i need to get these keys right because i need these secrets to run this web app and so i'm gonna do what jim says and go here and this version might be out of date um so i go to releases and there's 269 by sandra pick the cool guy does a lot of really cool stuff and i see like okay cool there's um billing buck buck i don't care hub i need this hub thing so i'm going to go to the hub and i'm just i'm just going to click this cool it's on my desktop i probably i didn't download it twice before i'm going to open the archive and i got this hub thing here and i need to go to it so here's a trip through my computer and i'm going to uh cd into hub v2 i'm going to ls sales see all the files cool there's an install so um here's uh how i install it and it moved it the hub to this right here and so i should be able to just type hub right like it should just work um and hub is an application an app downloaded from internet are you sure you want to open it yeah i want to open it cool and so it lets me do all this really cool stuff i need to i need to log in um so i'm gonna do hub.login and i i'm gonna use my protocol labs email please don't send me stuff that email and i'm gonna wait for the confirmation i got the email doing on my phone i'm gonna open on google chrome and this is the kind of this is the thing you see right it's a smiley face pretty cool awesome so i i got i'm in i'm in the i'm in the hub now i'm logged in you do hub who am i um i'm slate clear i don't know if that keys secret or whatever hub key um ls key ls i think cool clear um so hub keys create and i'm gonna go to user group this is a test developer account so um you know no problem with sharing keys on the internet i'm going to do no cool so i have these keys now that you know i have a hub key and a hub secret and yeah because this is my test account i am comfortable showing you guys these keys but don't show that when you're doing this don't tell me your keys i don't want to know your keys so hub key here secret here oh and then there's no feedback when this happens it's just kind of a thing you do when you're uh writing web apps when you put secrets into a file there's no magic or anything like that even though the term is secrets and maybe there was supposed to be some magic i don't know um cool so now that we're where we did that you're probably like all right i'm gonna go back to jim steps if you're still with me and uh you know these are the last two steps you have to run so we do npm install and then we're going to do npm run dev cool so localhost 301. and voila we have the app running on our screen um for a first time developer you're probably like what is going on here it gives like three columns there's the name of the boilerplate or template there's creator set token um there's used token there's a make file and storage bucket archive history that's a lot jim um yes it is a whole bunch of stuff here uh so let's go through each of them so uh in this api um we have add file create delete and list we have filecoin we have archive which is another way of saying make stored uh storage deal uh get address get archive history that'd be like looking at your uh deals for given cid and then token generate and so when i click on generate i'm actually calling this code here and it's designed in a way that i think the reason why i use an xjs is you know this is a really simple thing to read you can go here and you can look at the textile functions that you like and create bucket or list buckets they're all um you know here just kind of the simple function uh if you read textiles docs you'll probably end up at this point where you'll have like to figure out the setup and those are just two secrets that we added you know earlier um so i'm just gonna generate a live p2p token and you can take this lib p2p token and you can put it in a database or you can uh not use a database and um just have the user keep it but what you can do with is you can authenticate to the textile hub with the keys that we provided and through here you will actually uh initialize this is a new user account where you have a follow coin address and um you can verify this file card just by clicking this link you'll have to do some steps you have zero file coin and you have a a link here if you click this it's actually an ipfs block so you can see there's a textile seat if i click on data you can see that this is uh um you know with the contents of that bucket and let's add a file to the internet so let's go to um let's go a temp of temps i don't know what's in here uh let's see uh i'll take my estuary folder uh and this ping looks cool i guess so we'll open that cool and then if you click this link right here um this is uh on ipfs so if you change the gateway even you can still retrieve it which is really cool so uh that's about the amount of time it took i think like roughly under 10 minutes to get this template running where you can provide basically a storage application to people you obviously have to change the ui so let's go do that um in public that's where your fab icon is not very useful and index.js is where the the all the code is for this current page and you know maybe i i don't really want this side uh sidebar i think it's kind of you know i'm not going to give this to my end users or whatever and there's a whole bunch of stuff here that i don't care about so you know you can just delete components and they'll throw right but you can do this and hopefully yeah and so you can just get rid of the whole thing and go into the components here and um actually i probably should bring it back so i actually need something from there so i'll bring it back i need this little p2p key i'm gonna put this right here for now i'm actually gonna delete the sidebar completely and maybe i don't even want to you know deal with this right now then make file coin storage deal stuff maybe i you know i'm not ready for that yet to look at later so let's just get rid of the right element here cool so there's have this buckets experience and then maybe i i just want to let's see um i'll go and go into app module and then take this left just get rid of the dongle completely cool so i just have now like a storage app right and if i refresh the page i'll lose this but what i could maybe do is take um this live p2p token go here in m.local and just add it lib utp token cool and maybe i can instead of um you know instead of doing you know the whole setup in the beginning i can go to index here and um i can go here to um just add as a token here to process dot m lib p to p token and i can go here to my m.local i spelt it differently double they match up and then my state here see uh let's just try this token is this props and i need to change one other thing see just take all this do props then we can kill this sidebar okay and then it should work let's double check if we're even passing it to oh reboot the server and we're not passing it down because i did not restore this so token process m p the p token do it again cool yeah it's there sorry about that we take in the state that would happen later on and we basically uh put it here it's in a loading state right now though so um there's something i didn't do which have a look here on its page index what else did i not do uh i didn't do this i didn't get the file coin addresses and i didn't list the buckets so that's something for me to do so do it real quick already doing that so i actually need to do it here sorry about the quietness i'm just kind of coding on the fly and trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong cool so sorry about that that was just a long way of me um kind of messing around with my own setup and i have finally figured it out give this right element here and so that's how you can kind of in a few minutes um kind of basically simplify the application where it's just an app where you have files and there's uh the file that i used previously i can add another file and you can basically just you know keep customizing this application you can keep you know taking things out you know playing around with it and so here is um you know you can even get rid of this top thing maybe you don't like that you don't need it cool this now is just a storage application you can even go here and change this to um let's have a look and content uh buckets all right maybe maybe i just want to say like uh f global web three weekend storage application of the future cool all right so like just changes real time so that's a quick demo of basically um how you can use this example like this to uh you know customize it make it a hackathon project you have file storage it's working you take the little p2p token you can basically turn it into like a simple app where anyone can add a file you can you know share these files on the internet really easily you have links to do it adding a file super simple and hopefully that's really helpful uh and there's more examples like this if you like this example i hope i sold it well but if you go into um you know we have the file app source code is here um next storage deal is here so if you go next door so you can check it out here's storage market um it's a way to just take any cid and pin it to the file coin network so i can go here and i can take the cid although they're not gonna like how small this deal will be so this is not gonna work uh but take the cid and double check its contents right and so yeah it's on ipfs cool i can pick a miner um i just have this winner here already so f zero one one nine three three six i can make a falcon storage deal and then i can afterwards if that succeeds hopefully it does but you guys get the gist there's obviously sometimes some issues with making storage deals that we're always working through um but that wraps up i think the first part of this talk i wanted to give which is kind of using textile hub using next uh next bucket and uh it's a really easy way to get started really easy way to put storage deals or storage on on the ipfs network so back to my slides um second part of my talk the second example i'll give is uh with estuary and something that we're we're building right now um we plan on doing an internal launch uh where people can help test the code and then later on in the year hopefully get it out to everyone else so you guys can all make uh file coin storage deals with ease and so uh shout out to my friend andy who helped do some of the art here and then i put a cube here it's like some of the earlier artwork we did for s story that was pretty cool um estuary uh is automation attack it allows anyone with public data to store and retrieve it using a few api calls um it's for infrastructure operators for developers for follicle users so the previous example was kind of for application developers who kind of just wanted to build simple apps and you know textile services they provide are absolutely outstanding for that but estuary um gives you a lot of details as a developer about you know what minor my data is on and you know the receipts and the status and all the data and we're going to walk through all that so can't wait to show you um it's a full and end service so you know you have all of the stack that we have including documentation including the website including the node you can run it yourself you can provide the exact same service to someone else if you want to and so uh there's docs i read out everything a lot more detail so everything i'm saying is probably a lot more clear if you want to check it out and we have a lot of api endpoints that you know you can expose to other people or you know you can run for just yourself that will be documented soon that make um you know expand the functionality of your applications and so i'll give a demo of that right now so if i go to um ester documentation right here one thing we want to do differently documentation this time around is we want you to be able to run the code on the side and get the curl commands so with uh all of the estuary endpoints of our hosted estuary node you can just run them in the browser i mean command line so there it is you can just copy and paste them it's really simple and estuary uh is a kind of a brand for two separate things so estuary tech the website is our hosted node that we allow people to come in uh create file coin storage deals and all of the estuary stuff is available for you open source so you can run it yourself and so uh what you're looking at right here is documentation for if someone else is running an estuary node um you know you can read through these docs and kind of get a sense of how to interact with their api wherever they host it whatever domain name they put it on so uh you know i'll let you read this yourself why you should care um estuary is not different than ipfs um i updated that just a few moments ago but how does this reuse falcon ipfs there's a lot of the components that are in um you know existing ipfs knows there's little pdp there's go live pdp custom manager go ipfs block store uh dht bit swap um but what's different is that we've integrated a lot of the other file coin um modules and you know we use those gateway to read information about the chain and publish messages uh we have a filecoin client that we also are open sourcing that you can use to uh do a lot of file coin operations uh there's a falcon wallet for automation and escrow funds um automated replication until six deals are active and on chain uh and this value is configurable to whoever's running their own esterary node uh deal estimation automated file coin retrieval if the cid is no longer pinned uh bandwidth tracking minor logs performance tracking and deal lookup id and so some of the stuff is actually exposed on our website if you go here to ester attack you can see that we we keep a public listing of all the miners that we work with if we suspend a minor because we can't make deals with that minor we'll actually go and you know suspend them and they can check and they can look at their errors so here you can see that error logs are public and we can help work with the miners the minor concept is kind of interesting because uh for someone who just wants to upload data to the file coin network or to ipfs they don't care about any of these like you know minor or you know network type things or protocols or what stack you use they just want a product but if you're working on providing these tools or these services or platforms to people you do have to care as a builder so here is kind of like a way that we kind of you know are able to debug and look at deals and kind of see which one succeeded which one's failed uh we have the stats here for every miner so you can see um you know with this miner we have had no deal success um but you know we we know their lotus version we know how much their deals cost again file coins pretty cheap if you're verified but even if you don't have a verified um uh client you can it's still pretty cheap they set the prices pretty low and then what they're asking for is at least 16 gigs when you upload a file there so um and here's an example of i can just show you in some of our examples as we're doing um our testing right now this is a deal with 6951 files and you can see that if you are active on chain if you you know haven't made it but we're actively debugging this um so anyway you probably are curious how to use it so what you're going to do is you're probably going to go and create a an account and i'm going to show you what an admin account looks like if you want to provide admin accounts to your own users so here are my files here's upload upload a file uses cid instead here's upload by cd uh and so uploading files pretty simple if i go to upload a file and go to custodian and i go to files and let's say i want this video of you know this nice scene open and this is kind of like typical stuff you see in other applications that um that provide you know file uploading cool and it's already on ipfs here so if you visit this dwep link should show up immediately so it's pretty quick and if you go here to the view staging area you can see that we're going to wait a little bit before we make a file coin deal with it um when you go here after a few hours you'll see that these are previous attempts of me uploading files and then you know getting it on chain where you can see the status here you can see uh proposal receipts here and you can also see once it's filing on chain the file going deal receipt so if you want to prove to someone like hey this is going to be on the follicle point network for a year starting thursday may 27th to may 15th um here's how much it cost me uh you know what the miner had to do as collateral to store it and so yeah so this experience for a good reason why i'm showing you is because it always has a filter to api and so i'm going to go here to the api keys and i'm going to generate one and i don't care people see this because i can delete all these keys anyway so i always delete these after just revoke api key and you can use this api key to do some cool stuff so i'm going to keep this on my clipboard and go back to the docs cool so all of these examples here are uh editable so you can go here to this line and do api cereal tech and just type in help and you can just change these and play with them and you actually can write out you know even like a miniature app in this little section so um the first thing that we do when we're trying out estuary is we need to uh get an api key and we'll do that here we'll follow this these steps and so you'll need to create an account straight out tech if you want to create an account and you want an invite and you're serious about storing public meaningful public data uh click here to get an invite and fill out this form and you know i'll i'll get back to you real quickly and give you an invite key so you can use estuaries api to upload files during that uh hackathon or whatever um set up an example application uh use api you should do something level application you can use our nexus or our origin repo origin is really cool it's um a static site kind of template that is using vite 2 and view 3 and typescript and so well we're not only a react camp here chris warren did an incredible job busy setting this up so if you are you know you want to build a static site deploy to fleek uh you can totally use this um and we're we're improving it week over weeks so uh watch the space but uh yeah so once you have an invite sign estuary you'll create a new account the generate an api key and then you'll test your api key and so i went and generated an api key here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to replace this with api key and voila it just works i'm able to access my estuary account information right through here and then if i want to replace this i can't so that's not an edit field but i can go and i can prep it here so this is really happy sorry um just take this key i can also do this by the command line and it just works so every all our documentation allows you to kind of play with it modify it so you can easily do something like this and upload your first file this is really cool so um with the api key once you have it so let's um copy and paste this back in you'll see that you can take this little gui this example and uploading a file to file coin is as simple as going here let's take this nature 6 video seems pretty cool nice trees hit open and i kind of like hacked together a little i'll be like the least amount of effort progress response i can so here's the progress and bytes um and when you go back to your ui and you go to staging the file is there so it's really easy it's really really easy to upload files to the follow coin network you know just a simple xhr http request you can use fetch too so um let's just use fetch as an example uh dietrich asked me if he understands correctly that the next buck example you started with is it basically a quick start toolkit for building text based application and the answer is absolutely it is totally a quick start tool kit for building textile based application so i can just replace all this if you don't like looking at xhr hp request you want something more simple and just take this take the api key so it's it's even you don't get any any logs from this but at least your code is more reduced so if you didn't like what you saw earlier with xhr request i was messing you just want to use fetch here's an example of fetch let's choose another file which is a small one because i'm not sure how long it'll take it's a nice video here and hit open and there's no response because i don't have any code update that we did this but i imagine that if i refresh this it's there it's cool so the file is there and that's another example of how easy it is to get um of course it's going to take a while to load how easy it is to get files onto the filecoin network and so simple as that and then obviously from this point you're probably going to want to list your files i mean you know you got an api key you're uploading a file and you know you saw the files uploaded you probably want to list your files you can go here replace this api key and so here's an example of the output that you'll get and ta-da um you get a list of every file you've uploaded so with these three simple api endpoints or i guess two api endpoints and then getting an api key you are uploading files to filecoin and you are also listing your files and you can easily retrieve them through any ipfs gateway so hopefully they demystifies like difficulty and complexity that usually exists out there for anyone who wants to upload files um i know that some people are like it's really hard but you know here's a live code example you play with in the browser that allows you to do it uh now you're probably wondering like okay well jim that's all nice but i want to see like the deal um the deal the deal uh status i want to actually understand like you know what deals you're making with miners programmatically i don't want to look at a gui and so i can take this id here this 14 and uh actually see i like this nasa space elements maybe i'll pick a bigger file of nature videos i like this one 54. and i can take this right here and then go to this one and i can click on modify this simple as that 54. and i can take the api key that i had this api key and i have all the deals now and so i know everything about the deal i know everything about the transfer and i also know that this deal is not unchained based on this so as a programmer this is super useful you know really easy just to get this information from any application that you have a fetch call is not a crazy thing to do you know all you need to do is just have the api key and you have your deals so you can put this in the app and you can make an app about deals about like your deal success rate if you want to um you take some information do whatever and there's a lot of other endpoints like we have endpoints that don't require um an api key so this is like the amount of storage that your estuary know that you're running so in our context it would be the estuary node that we're running for everyone on s3 tech and so this information right here is that this api points a state point that's powering this right here we're a terabyte of storage where 29 000 files stored um you know we if you want to look at specific miner you can just do it from api here you can even take this line just as shown before and curl it here so nice and simple and the same goes for deals of a specific minor any minor we can we take a look at the story front page and maybe find like uh this f02401 looks cool let's see if there's any deals doesn't seem like it um in the admin panel has something cool that you'll you'll have if you run your own s3 node i can see how many deals i've made of every single miner so let's let's take one like f0 1 247. type it in right f 0 1 2 4 7. it's cool you see all the deals let me take a quick break real quick to answer some questions um following the steps in jimmy lee my cool storage app in hub key creation i i get asked require scenario authentication recommended uh does yes no matter here uh not for our case um in our case it's just uh um we're we're we're not letting people interface with this key directly like the people consuming your web application are not going to go and uh interface with the the public key at all they're not going to see it ever only you will see it so it should be that doesn't matter next bucket example is basically a quick start tool kit to building textile base app if you look at dependencies in next bucket it's just really small amount dependencies this is the only textile dependency we have and everything else it's really compact in a lot of other apps you'll see when you're starting out you have like a ton of dependencies like maybe up to 15 or 20. this is pretty simple and you can probably do away with a lot of these if you don't want them i mean if you don't want to use next even like you don't want to use reactions like just build like a a static website you know and just use these so if you don't really want to do like my my uploads i have my upload code here so if you want if you're adding files we use busboy um it's pretty simple but maybe you want to do something else uh you know just delete those and the whole setup ends up being pretty minimal dependency and then origin is something you can definitely use standalone so i'm hoping that chris will you know show you guys later uh how to do stuff um with uh origin uh it's it's really really nice and clean set up that does a lot for you and uh yeah so here are a few more api endpoints and love to get some feedback on whether or not these are useful or not whether or not you know we should add some more stats and deals and so another thing is like you know you can just take what you've been doing right here with the deals let's say let's go back to listing my files and i'm going to use this example i'm going to go back to content and just grab this replace with api key and you know i have these ideas and i want to get specific information about a specific deal on a specific minor and so what i'll do is let's grab this nature videos one again change this here and take my api key and i'm going to show you guys how i kind of you know debug this so each of these deals have a deal id right and maybe i don't you know i don't see the end point i want here i'm kind of like gosh you know there's only a few things here it seems like there's not much you can do and really that's my fault because i haven't written the api docs for pretty much all the things you can do so one thing you can do if you don't want to wait for me is go here to github.com application research and you can go to the estrella repo and we haven't written anything here so it's going to be cryptic you go to handlers and you can see that the endpoints are all here and maybe there's something you want to do so you have the content right and you want to find out in the deals you want to get like the info about the deal specifically just that specific deal and so you can take this info deal id and deals and point so we have some information let's let's let's take some notes here so we're going to switch this over to info.dlid we have 54 as the status id or this is like the content id and then we have um our off token here just so we don't lose it in case we need to change it and so um i'm going to get i want to get more information about six nine seven so i'm gonna do this and so like i did earlier i looked at this right here you can see the implementation like we we don't everything is open source you can see how we do everything um you can find the code here this is all we're doing to get deal info um state market storage deals where we get information for it go here and let's change this so uh deals and the only reason why i know to do that is because every uh group is labeled as such so here's deals and this um endpoint belongs to deals so deals info and then i know the deal id is 697 and it's not returning anything um so again deals info deals info that's correct that's because i'm using the endpoint wrong so let's go back to what it was and let's see if there is a deal id i can look at prop deal id cool so i now know i was using the endpoint wrong and it was pretty easy just to debug this so now i can change this to deals deals info and deal id and try this here instead this value i kind of like scratching out what i'm doing in the environment i'm working in maybe you like taking notes and cool i have that information here now so that's really cool to kind of be able to um see like you can just modify the code here and kind of you know play with the endpoints and maybe you know as you're you know work playing with this you might want to give me feedback and say like you know cake protocol.ai jim why on earth did you not add this to the documentation if you did that would have saved me time cool and we'll get that feedback so uh that's pretty much wraps up my talk i hope uh everyone enjoyed it i know i was going through things pretty quickly let me check the zoom chat i think there's a question there that's a lot of questions um there's some links from dietrich um but there's a question most recently from lucas i don't know if you want if you can see that i can relay it here okay yeah so i i love these questions um you know on your local ipvs statement that's like total control right so you know you're paying your electricity bill cost and you're paying paying for ingress if you're going to open that up so if you're going to like let you know traffic come through and so maybe you don't like the ingress costs on you know azure or aws or uh google spacing on actually their their uh gcp sorry um and maybe you you just want to manage all that yourself and run your own ips name and i totally recommend you do that um but just so you know the ipfs code that you're running might not be fully integrated with file coin stuff so you might end up with you know a set setup or if you're not super technical you might have difficulty um you know stitching it all together in a way that is a reliable thing so we're just trying to find a better way to do it and the way we do is through exploration and through implementing things that work better than the existing stuff so uh there are many ways to answer your question four related to your question one of doing all this and uh you know we're we're one of many a lot of the providers we work with have great solutions to a lot of really smart people trying stuff out and we're standing on sources of giants learning from them and also trying our own stuff other servers like pinata piano is awesome like piano piano i think he meant pinata but he said pinata so i'm hoping it's pinata uh i don't know pinata panada but that's also a cool name uh i just don't know them so uh yeah like uh pinata is awesome and they are very similar textile and they also work with each other like they all share what they're learning together and um you know it's it's great so you wouldn't go you can't go foul using a service like that because every time we learn something we share our knowledge together and then it aggregates and helps everyone out in the ecosystem it's not like you know uh other like kind of traditional web 2 sas you know industry warfare where it's kind of like everyone's you know trying to keep their ip against each other we're actually really helpful and so um nothing can go wrong there you just have to deal with their pricing if they set up a pricing thing that benefits them based on what they provide you might like their service to this cheaper um but when it comes to being in good hands and being taken care of taken care of you know you can totally uh trust them and definitely textile as well uh dealing with fall coin miners um you know depending on who you are right like so if we look back at the beginning of the talk um i'm sorry i was all over the place today and i apologize but um you know we're for infrastructure operators developers and file clone users and what i mean by that is you know maybe you're not you don't care about miners and you don't want to look up every single miner you know that's a lot of minor there's actually like 7 000 miners but i think there's only like under a little bit under 3 000 like that are reliable easy to work with and so you know i've parsed through three thousand textile miners and you know 2247 field rap miners and i look on these lists and i can see like you know these are all the this might not be fun for people like they might not want to see like how you know all the miners are participating the file coin network they're not developers they just want like hey i have my data hey i want to do something with my data i want to make it available to everyone in the world you know and so uh dealing with homework is not fun and and also like when you look at estuary i try to make this more fun but it's not necessarily fun to go through and debug every single miner's failure to store data you know you'll have to dig into all of the context that exists and that's a lot so i think uh you know estuary is kind of a developer tool that allows you to if you want to do it like if you want to jump in and you want to see things that usually other providers hide like dropbox is not telling you which hard drive like you know uh is this exact same uh to answer these questions exact same so lippy to be key in the next bucket ui exact same text textile key and then local and so the reason why i did that in that example is to show people like if you just want to not have that authentication portion you know you just want to show a simple app i think it's still up i hopefully didn't uh kill it so localhost you know still here you know this is the app we built together the f global web three weekend story application for future uh take a little bit to load but uh really easy way to get a bucket set up see we have our bucket and your data is still there so you can easily create a key and create a simple application using textile and then you can do a storage deal later if you like we can take the cid here and we can use estuary to log into my account to the local version because this account is of course lucas thank you for for asking uh i i know i there's a lot to go through so i'm always refining my delivery but there's a lot of content and i'm trying to keep it approachable but there's a lot of stuff so yeah back to this example i can just take this cid and so in my example here oh gosh i'm already lost uh i named it esterotec.ping but you could before you put on the file code name it name it like reallyfuntime ping you know and uh let's make a file comes first yeah why not so cool you made a file coin storage deal with the cid there um so all this stuff is interruptable even though the first example the first 30 minutes was working with textile stack and that's one ecosystem in itself it also is part of a greater ecosystem where they see ids can be used to you know move data around and um yeah it's a lot of fun so if there are any other questions uh thank you for spending an hour of your saturday with me i hope it was fun yeah for sure thank you so much cake that was an awesome workshop exciting stuff thanks everyone for joining if you have any more questions for the protocol labs team don't hesitate to reach out on discord they're hanging out all weekend and yeah excited to see what you
