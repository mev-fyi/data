on how to use variable protocol with alex um so i will uh let alex take it over soon and just a quick reminder if you guys are not fully staked for the hackathon please do it as soon as you can and if you have any questions following this workshop please go to the discord channel from the sponsor and feel free to ask any questions on the chat we will answer them either as we go or the end of the workshop i will let it on for you alex thank you catherine uh i'm so happy to be here today i can see we have we have a lot of listeners uh how much they're actually like some something like 50. so not sure uh what's the experience of everybody here already with nfts but i believe uh since it's a hackathon there there is some basic technical uh understanding so i'll uh today i'll briefly talk about variable protocol and and how do we see you guys are working on top of it and some rationale behind why we ever created that protocol and then what's what's the global vision for all of it is and then uh i'll i'll i'll screen share like the basic flow of of the order inside the protocol so you can actually understand like what is the the overall what is again the overall circle that that you need to make in order to for the order to be fulfilled uh that's that's the program for now so at first i'll i'll talk about variable for quickly uh we started 1.5 years ago is is an open platform that democratizes access uh for nft creation to everybody uh we basically wanted users to experiment and find out what are the great use cases for nfts are we knew that nft market is great we didn't want to target some some use case specifically so we created that that simple platform that allow you to connect your wallet uh we run decentralizedly on ethereum blockchain with our smart contracts you can connect your wallet and directly interact with our smart contracts to mint an item with an easy form just that requires only an image name and description from you uh we've grown much more than that lately and and the second the second big part of that is the marketplace um we've grown that platform for several months uh until until this uh last summer in july we decided to launch the quality mining program so we understood how difficult it is to grow the marketplace and we started rewarding people who are making trades on variable uh proportionally to their volume transacted both buyers and sellers and and that create an extremely uh great incentives for people to start using the marketplace and since then we've been growing uh we've grown uh quite quite quite great for for the last um several months and now we are uh at the position when we do two million dollars of jelly marketplace volume with 30 million dollars of monthly marketplace volume with 5 000 uh guys transacting each day on the marketplace uh in transacting so making specifically transactions on chain and 90 000 people just just interacting with the front end uh so it's a lot of eyes uh on on the platform and uh our our next big step in developing the platform is basically going even more in in decentralizing uh so we're launching wearable protocol we are taking all the tech behind wearable and we're making it uh for available to to build on top of it for everyone so uh wearable protocol consists of of several parts the first part is actually minting so minting with the host and me and erc721 and erc 1155 contracts on chain that supports uh laser minting and custom royalties and and and multiple beneficiaries so so you can make collaborations and you can set up arbitrary royalties that would be downstream on the on the matching process and we also support lazy minting that means that item would not be created until it was bought until until the contract that is responsible for matching actually uh matched and ordered that uh that has this nfg that wasn't yet created and it gets created on the matching event on top of that we have an indexer that indexes all the nft's data on ethereum blockchain automatically like picks up all the new collections uh not even uh not even diverged from the wearable ones collections so all the all the nfts all the collections out there get indexed and is is given uh and then that information is served by our api so you can query api to to understand like give me all the nfgs by this user or give me all the energies by this collection so this is the structure of um this is the structure of our uh protocol i i hear that there is a question from on on our youtube stream so uh the question is what is lazy minting uh so i'll i'll explain that a little bit more when you need to create an nft what actually happens just the simple flow of creating nft you're going to erc 721 or 1155 contract on chain and you're calling the mint function uh you're supplying the token uri to that main function and the token uri is basically the ur uri that tells you where the metadata is stored um so this transaction is an actual contract call that's why this transaction is paid moreover uh this transaction is quite costly because you need to store uh this token uri on chain so uh if that creates this situation when people in order to create their nfts whether they will be sold or not they need to pay first something uh and and these transaction costs are are quite huge for the starting creators that's why there is this uh other flow you can actually create your nft you can have your uh token uri you you can have your metadata uploaded to ipfs or some other storage you can have this token uri but without minting you can create an order for this nfg to be sold uh and and load it up to the variable to the variable protocol after this order is on the moment when this order is matched with the contour order uh so you're you're you're created in nft but not yet created on chain you created an order uh that that is telling i will sell this nft for uh for 10 years then there somebody comes to the to the platform and and making a counter order of order they they're saying i'm i'm ready to buy this nft for uh for 10 eth on the event of this order matched uh our exchange contract uh is our exchange contract is taking the money from the buyer and creates an nft exact same moment when the order is matched and and sends it to the player so that's that's what lazy meeting is i i can see other questions here so um let me probably go over all the structure of the protocol and then we'll come back to the questions because i i don't wanna i wanna wanna break the flow um i will get back to you guys in a moment so let me share my screen uh with my brain browser so um that's what i already told you we have this minting and exchanging indexer uh all the source code for the contracts is available by this link under under this repository you can find uh you can find uh our set of tokens um which are 721 and 55 under under this repository you can find our exchange contract that is actually making swaps and um yeah there are several uh several helping helping just uh libraries for example royalties uh it's it's it's the description of how should you build uh your your erc721 contract if you want it to support royalties so you can create your own contracts that will be available to trade on wearable and wearable dags that will be indexed by our indexer and that would support royal just because on chain there is information like how much royalties you set up for this particular account for this particular uh token id so your your contract should just respond for the specific for the specific uh function call that our exchange contract is doing when when performs in a token match so uh this is on the on our contracts uh let me get back to the uh let me get back to uh to the the documentation so uh we we encourage everybody to build on top of variable protocol there is several features uh there are several like positive factors why would you want to do that and the biggest one of this is that it's really hard to grow the buy power and sell power uh when you're creating your pro your project from scratch so the first buyer uh comes and there is no sellers and the first seller comes where where there are no buyers that's why uh we want all the projects building on top of variable protocol to be instantly accessible to to have an instant access to all the buy and sell power of wearable platform because wearable is is also the client of wearable protocol uh and and wearable has a lot of users so that's that's the best part about it and moreover we have such features like monetization that allow you to set up arbitrary front-end fees that would be taking before an order gets matched um so you can instantly monetize your product and off of on top of wearable protocol and we have a dow that would support all the projects that are building on top and it's a great that you're starting early you can you can help us design the incentives for the projects building on top of variable protocol and we are fully devoted to support everybody in the wearable ecosystem uh so the the url for for wearable documentation is docs wearable.com we have deployed our new contracts just recently so we have the series 721 1155 and exchange contract on the rinky buy network uh exchange contract is a proxy contract so if you want to interact with it uh you can you can use these tabs as read as proxy and write this proxy just to play around with it and let me get get back and and and and take you over the flow of of all of order creation so overall the protocol flow is the following at first you need to have an asset you can either deploy your own asset derived from the wearable we have some more questions here let me let me check okay okay so i can get back to those particular questions afterwards so the overall flow of using the protocol is first you need to have an asset you can either deploy your own asset it can be derived from the rearable asset contract to support royalties and lazy minting or it can be just the simple play in your c721 or 1155 asset uh basically afterwards uh when you have an asset you know the the asset collection and asset id you can you can take that asset collection and asset id and and create an order for it so uh an order is the structure consists of of different fields such as maker taker make asset take assets so it's it's an actual description of what are you willing to to take and and what what are you willing to make in in in that swap and what are you what do you want to take in response so uh that's that's the uh basic uh flow of order uh then there is a contour order again the simplest the simple structure that uh needs to match your order so if somebody willing to make an nft and take 10 years in in response then the counter offer would be i want i want to make 10 is and i want to take an nft so uh this is the matching process uh as soon as you've got this two signed orders uh you can go to variable tax contract and you can swap uh you can execute these two orders you can match these two orders and they will be executed and assets would be swapped between the buyer and seller as soon as you so the orders aren't stored on chain uh so far that's why after you created an order and this design structure you want to submit it to the variable protocol to the variable backend you want to submit the register this order uh in order for somebody else to be able to find that order so you've created a sell order you call the wearable backend api and you you pasted that order to the backend api and then somebody else came queried the list of orders understood that this is an order that they want to fulfill create a counter order and then from a front-end to go to the variable smart contract and to match these orders uh you can also cancel or update and order uh canceling of orders happening on chain you need to actually call the contract method to cancel an order and and updating an order is is creating a new structure and submitting it to the same wearable api endpoint to make sure that this order gets registered um again here's the contract addresses uh here is the simple flow of how can you create an asset uh this is this is full fully fully done uh you can you can upload your your metadata to pinata and then to call the variable called the variable contract to make sure that that the item was minted so here is this exchange overview this is the order structure the list of fields that you need to have in the in in the structure to to create an order it's maker it's make asset it's taker it's steak asset uh it's it's salt random number uh it's the time and when you want this order to be valid from start to end uh then there is this a large chunk of data that can be basically arbitrary and we have several this data schemas uh when you version one version two uh uh that this this part of the order stores the origin fee and uh payouts if you if you created an item with several uh openers with several creators then you store this data here as well um and then there there is this understanding of how the order execution works one more thing and that i want to cover is um in order to swap uh an asset you need to to to call an approval function for your nft so you need to approve our contract to actually move this asset on on behalf on behalf of the of the user and and the same happens with erc20 you need to approve this erc20 to be spent by our contract in order to do that uh you need to call uh you need to call approval functions uh for uh our nft proxy contract and erc20 contract so uh that would be it that would be the basic flow of variable protocol i know it's a lot to unpack you can always find alice and me and the team under the wearable sponsor variable discord channel inside the nft hack discord we would be providing any help that we can to you uh just just yeah uh we are operating under european time so mostly we will be able to help you on warnings uh on mornings united states time and uh if you want to to to get help from the team um let's let's go to the questions and we have a lot of them um so there are some questions about whether we want to go to layer two uh yes we want we will adopt some evm compatible chain uh like xdi or or polygon or avalanche or or moonbeam we haven't yet decided which one so uh but that's basically the the next feature after after we've rolling out the protocol so the protocol contracts are all upgradable uh we have our own deployed contracts um we will we will extend them with new features uh and and upgrade them uh on the rolling basis uh if if you use your lazy maintain contract you can still trigger uh asset creation uh by calling the mint and transfer function of of your nft contract that's what that's actually what exchange is doing exchange is just calling this main function when it feels on the on the order matching level so you can you can obviously call it yourself and that would work um somebody asking about the protocol uh does this mean that they took that the contracts are already deployed by wearable or it is possible to deploy the contracts by yourself to l2 like x die with your own symbol uh yes the source coin record of those contracts is public you can deploy your own versions of the contract uh but i think like um it makes sense to deploy contracts uh asset contracts if you want to create your own nfts but when we're dealing with this exchange contract the single best value proposition of that is the shared order book across all the projects so you need to you can make sure that your your your orders created on your own front end will be automatically paste and wearable website after wearable adopts variable protocol so so far wearable.com uses the previous version of the protocol so the shared order book is the value preposition and the key value proposition for the protocol so um we will go with our shared order book to other chains as well lots of questions [Music] again asking about uh polygon medical tool uh so variable contracts can work with with polygon medic and we are expecting to deploy our version of of of contract in in some future for like like a month to some somewhere to solution uh well you can deploy your own contract so far but again as i was referring previously the shared order book is the key what if the nft was bought somewhere else well uh so we have this tracking function of whether this order is valid or no or not in our indexer as soon as the nft was moved then we understand that the seller doesn't have this nft in his wallet anymore and we trigger uh the order to be invalid on the on the back end so if somebody would find this order and try to go to the contract and match it the the matching won't work because the contract can't transfer the the the asset because it was already moved and as we understood on the indexer level that the item was moved where where flagging this order is invalid and the next request to the order listing api would not return that order if it was like if it doesn't have the valid assets on the on the maker side anymore the same happens with the taker side um how much how much gas is minting on chain is the next question uh then and uh the answer to that question would be from from 20 to 100 on the inferior mainnet and right now i haven't tracked the gas prices and i think it's more like from 20 to 50. um so the multiple royalties works like this uh on your contract level your c721 there is this function get royalties uh exchange our exchange contract is calling this function get royalties for the specific item for the item number five and this function returns an array of tuples uh that has address on the first place and the amount of royalties that need to give to this address on the second place so we have this array of tuples of addresses and respectful royalties for them and contracts just respect that array and gives the respectful payout to these addresses so all you need to implement in order to support multiple royalties you need to implement this function uh on your on your asset contract um what is the main advantage of wearable versus openc uh well i think uh you you you can you can think about it uh on your own we we are all friends in the in the ecosystem so uh we probably have more more users uh on chain so like like probably when uh much more users on chain uh less volume though and i think the main advantage would be that we have a dao and we're pushing on this protocol thesis really heavily if you want to build on top of something you want to build on top of the permissionless protocol controlled by the token holders yes herrera will be used as a governance over this protocol so far we do not see so far that's the only utility we will we expect the rare holders to perform moderation work and verification work in the future once once we develop these features for the protocol it is possible to use variable to create a marketplace where people can can create nfts make sales make bids and accept this this bits that's that's totally possible uh protocol supports every c721 your c1155 and erc20 swaps uh in any uh order so you can make rc721 to 1155 or years to 22 or 320 or here's a 721 to 721 like the main case is obviously swapping energies for money when creating your own marketplace you can list all nfgs only created through your own marketplace we have this origin fee so in this site inside the order structure you're supplying the list of origin fees again the same way with royalties and you can query the wearable backend to give you only the orders that has a specific origin address in them i think that's it for for now uh we are we're out of the time uh you can find us on the wearable disc on the discord and inside variable discord but i think it's discord is better variable discord is so big thank you so much for your time for the talk uh it was super interesting if yeah as you said uh anyone who wants to reach out to the team go find them on the discord channel there's a specific sponsor wearable channel and their team will be there uh and we're out of time for questions so ask for any more questions thanks everybody for um for all the questions that were sent i know a lot of people wanted to learn more so excited to see the project that will come out of that
