good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of youth global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to the superflow reactor summit so all of you are watching this on eve global.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is a platform we'll be using for all of today's summit and this is the place where you can ask questions say hi to everybody else watching and also claim your collapse so everybody who's going to participate on this chat today will be receiving this amazing super fluid reactor summit pro-app so i can't wait to meet all of you and uh let's uh let's get started so today we have an amazing next few hours planned we're going to be talking about the future of payments we're going to start off with introducing the superfluid reactor which i'm super excited for all of you to know about as well then we're going to have tony come on and talk about how do we actually successfully manage subscriptions in web3 sunny will then be talking about how do we actually invest in more real-time payments and just make that way more seamless than it is currently then we'll have herbal talk about salary-backed loans and how you can stream um paychecks and salaries then we're gonna have an amazing panel on just going through some really interesting ways to think about what three native business models uh we'll have christoph tyrone julian and mike as our panelists and then meow will be talking about the next kind of steps in evolution of the superfluid protocol and then we're going to close off with a way and a talk from mike on just how do we think about the economy in web3 that's a lot more connected to each other and just a lot more seamless and we'll have another final panel on just on chain payments and how we see that world evolving with luke and kill and friend and then finally we'll have some closing remarks to wrap up the day so super packed next few hours and i can't wait to uh get in right into it so next up i want to just without further ado bring on our very first speaker for the day and that is friend from superfluid and uh without further ado let's welcome friend to really tell all of you about the superfluid reactor welcome friend hey everyone uh thanks for inviting me um i guess yeah i'm very excited to be here i'm going to share my screen and show a short presentation while i do this so welcome everyone uh to the superfluid reactor summit we're extremely excited to have so many people joining in uh to listen to this we're very excited to be partnering with eve global for this we're we've got a very strong relationship with global we've sponsored a lot of their hackathons and it's a great honor for us to be able to have this platform to tell everyone a bit more about our ecosystem our community and the future we see enabled through our protocol so first of all let me just do some sound check here i hope by now most of you know about superfluid but just very quickly superfluid is a defy protocol for digitally native programmable cash flows we enable users to stream money on chain with no capital lock-up and with full programmability so effectively superfluid is a protocol what this means is that it's a shared means a shared set of rules that govern the way information or value is transmitted right so what we're doing is we're building the rails we're building the rails to enable a new kind of finance that happens in real time because money streams happen every second so everything needs to be kind of rebuilt to use and to adapt to these real-time money streams and the way we envision this is a completely free-flowing economy right where money can flow from application to application from hand to hand in a peer-to-peer fashion on the blockchain with no friction that's that's what superfluid means superfluid means no friction but obviously a protocol in itself is not that useful right it's just again a set of rules that govern the way information is transferred what's really necessary and what we're really building for is for builders like you to enable you to come and build applications that leverage this cool technology that we've invented right but that in itself is not useful there's so many use cases that can be explored there's so many different verticals there's so many different ways that streaming money can really change the way a lot of people experience the transfer of value and that's something we can't do alone there's just no way we can explore all these different niches and uh industries where money streaming could potentially have a big impact and this is the reason why we're always trying to build for builders we're always trying to invite more and more builders to come and explore the opportunities of the superfluid protocol so far we've sponsored over 20 hackathons we've had over 400 projects built at hackathons we've uh we're incubating a lot of projects although so far it's been mostly informal we have a lot of integrations and there are a few projects that are already live and that you can go out and test right now that leverage the superfluous protocol but ultimately what we noticed is that a lot of products tried to build something at a hackathon but it wasn't quite enough right a lot of people don't know how to go from a project built at a hackathon to a real life production application that step is not that easy but that step is what we did and it's what we can help you do right superfluid was born out of hackathon which means we know how to go from a hackathon project to a real-life working startup so we asked our community we said you know how can we help more of you more applications uh go from you know the prototype stage to the production stage and obviously a lot of the people who even replied to this question were people that we had helped right because we helped a lot of people you'll hear a bit more about this uh from the next presenters but we've helped people build on superfluid and go and build startups from their ideas but we never formalized that and what what the response was was pretty clear we need to create an accelerator so what i'm announcing now is actually the superfluid reactor which is an accelerator focused on your growth we help startups that build on superfluid by selecting the best ones the best teams the best founders and the best ideas to come and join our community and start building with us we follow you from fundraising building the product and launching the product and securing those key partners that will get you started as a rocket ship and not just as a hackathon project and the best of all is that all of this is free we don't charge neither in money nor in equity so it's 100 free and the applications the projects and the teams that we select will be able to go through all of this free of charge and this is a very big difference compared to most accelerators out there who take a significant part of your equity now if this is interesting to you sign sign up here so you can just go to reactor or superfluo.finance you can find all the information there's a signup form and everything is there but let me just tell you a bit more about the ways that the superfluid reactor can help you get ready for production and again the superfluous reactor's objective is to get you to fundraise and to production after that it's up to you so we're not going to do the work for you but we are going to help you to get there so the first thing is technical guidance now as uh vincent says from our team it's very easy to learn solidity it's very hard to master solidity now building an application for a hackathon is not the same as building an application for production right you can make something that works once but working once and working a million times with no faults is completely different and we can help you both architecting this but also developing the right practices in terms of testing in terms of adversarial thinking that are really necessary when building in web free now unlike web 2 as you might know web free contracts are generally immutable there's a lot more that can go wrong and there's a lot less you can do about it so it's very important that you know the architecture of your app is correct and if you're coming from web 2 there's a lot of new things that we can help you quickly learn about so again building a prototype is not the same as building a production application and that's where our guidance can really help you accelerate along that journey now second the second thing i'd mention is product refinement right if you look at most web-free products they're not that great but some of them are amazing now how do they do that they do that through interviews they do that by talking to their customers by hearing their feedback and by by basically adopting that feedback quickly and adapting over time so the way we can help here is obviously with general product management practices but also with introductions to who your actual users are right imagine you're building something in web free but your target user is not some it's not really a category that you are that familiar with right in that case you can talk to us we can introduce you to the people that you need to talk to to actually understand what that category's needs are right and this is very important in the product discovery phase on top of this you can always book one-to-one time with our product manager vijay which means you know you can get his insight get some of his expertise and this is something that's always going to be available for the superfluid reactor participants obviously building a great product is very important but you also need to get the voice out right you need people to know about it and in this regard marketing is the way to go but marketing webfree is again extremely different to marketing and web too right if you think of web 2 most startups spend almost all of their budgets on advertising right they'll give their money to facebook to google just to blast out advertisements and that mostly works for them in web free that doesn't work at all if you spend money on twitter ads nobody's going to read them and in fact that's generally bad practice and people will actively ignore your product if you advertise so how do you do it how do you get out there what you need to do is build a community how do you build a community well that's really hard but we can help you right we've built a community at superfluid we have some people out there who are passionate about what we're building and they are the best marketing tool that you can possibly have in webfree because in webfree marketing is organic and this is something we can talk more about we can help you and we can also introduce some of those early supporters that can really help you build an audience which ultimately is what you need uh when you're launching a product in web3 on top of this obviously building a great product is important but you need to also get to market you need to be able to get those first customers and perfect your product to the point where you meet product market fit now how to do this there's a lot of different ways right you can try and build in isolation and maybe your right may be wrong but the approach that we generally suggest is to try and involve customers in your journey as soon as possible and this is what we suggested to tony from diagonal you're going to hear a bit more from tony after after me but what we did with them effectively guarantees that the day they launch they launch with great launch partners with a product that is specifically tailored to their needs and uh basically with the best possible partner that they could launch with so we're very excited to help help them and we're very excited uh to hopefully in the future enable more people to launch great products with immediate uh go to market now how do we achieve all of this well most of this is not going to be us it's going to be people we introduce so introductions are by far the most important thing we can do for you and this leverages over five years of uh industry connections that me and my co-founders and our team have created right we've been in the industry for a while we know a lot of people a lot of people know us and people respect us so if we introduce you to someone they're gonna listen right and they're gonna help you and that's the single most important thing for product interviews for marketing and community building and of course for those key partnerships and those key launch partners that can help you go to market much quicker right so the people we can introduce are you know all sorts of different different key people in the industry and of course the best investors ultimately whatever you do in web free is going to take time and time is money you're going to need some sort of investment this can come from the community or it can come from venture capital investors or angel investors we have a very broad network of investors we can introduce you to them and most importantly there's a lot of investors who are looking into our ecosystem they're very excited to see the next application built on streaming money and they're very keen to explore those applications very early stage so this is the perfect pipeline for us to introduce you to them very early and get you uh with the right resources to get to production much faster so overall if this has sounds like something that you would like go to reactor.superfluid.finance and apply now it's a very short form that you need to fill in we'll get back to you and what you can expect is periodic check-ins introductions help throughout throughout the time that you spend with us connections with other people in the reactor project which means you can you know talk about your experiences and help each other and of course some exclusive perks for superfluid reactor participants now what else to expect from today so we have over three hours of content so during this reactor summit we're you know very pleased to invite a lot of people from our ecosystem so you'll have people from ricochet diagonal huma finance and these are all applications built on superfluid none of them went through the reactor because it's a new thing but we did help them in different ways to get ready for production and we're very excited to have them now come and share their experience share their learnings with the rest of the community after this we'll have two panels the first one is about webfree native business operations and here you'll see some of our partners request network coin shift and unlock protocol who are building basically products or protocols that help businesses operate on chain this is something we are very passionate about because at superfluid we enable uh basically recurring payments right so these applications are using us to provide real value to real web-free businesses and that's something we are very grateful that we can partner with them about after this we'll have another panel with people from makerdao and usdc so we'll be able to discuss stablecoins and on-chain payments on-chain payments in our opinion are something that's very unexplored and needs to be explored more so we're going to talk about that and we're lucky to have some you know very important experts so thanks a lot for listening to my talk i assure you it's going to be the most boring so the rest are much more exciting but all i can ask you now is if you don't follow us on super follow us on twitter superfluidhq and maybe follow me as well and now i'll give the stage back uh the cardigan maybe there's a few questions we can we can answer and then we can move on to the next speaker absolutely um first of all this is this is incredible uh and uh thanks for kind of formalizing it i know you've been helping out a lot of teams already a lot of them we're going to see right now come on on stage and talk about what they've been doing um i guess my broader question is um overall kind of if you can just give some insight into how do you think about managing this thing for the first kind of cohort here like is there an expectation how many teams you want to get into uh the first round or um essentially like what are you looking for in terms of what stage they should be at like maybe we can start there well we're hoping to get pro uh projects basically straight out of the hackathon right uh as i said superfluid is born out of hackathon you know uh if global is kind of very embedded into our uh history and for us getting projects when they're still got that um that excitement from the hackathon is the best time to really propel them at the moment we don't have a clear number in mind but there are definitely some projects that won't make the cut for the first uh for the first cohort but there's definitely a lot of room still so if you're out there listening one of the reasons we wanted to launch this during hack money is because hack money is the best defy hackathon in the year right so we expect to uh hopefully find some great projects here and bring them into the reactor and help them from here to go forward so don't have exact numbers but it'll be a i'm sure it'll be a good cohort because i've already seen some of the applications and they're pretty exciting and then uh this just in in the best interests of the teams that are going to be applying we often see a lot of people think that they're not good enough and they end up disqualifying themselves so maybe if you can give any comments on like what do you think is kind of considered a acceptable level of kind of progress so that they can convert their account projects into something broader like is there any advice you would give to like when they should think about their being ready of course um it's really not so much about the product it's a lot more about the team and the motivation right the product obviously is important right i think what a lot of people are going to see is now with the market shifting a bit there's not as much money out there so bad ideas are not going to have as much funding as they could have had maybe six months ago so really a good idea is important but ideas can change over time right what you build at the hackathon might not be the uh idea that your startup builds uh over the years but your team is not gonna change your founding team your cohesion your motivation and your um grit right your your basically determination to make it is the most important thing so whatever whatever you're building when you apply just make sure that that comes through that we can tell that you are determined to uh really make this happen right and then i'd say uh you're good amazing well that's uh excellent timeless advice and uh thank you for uh kicking us off today so uh without further ado let's uh welcome our very first official talk which is tony from diagonal and tony's going to be talking about how do we actually successfully manage subscriptions in web3 so uh tony please welcome uh well welcome page and i'll let you take it from here hey carter how you today i am doing great all righty then let me kick it off um okay share my screen please just confirm we're all live okay uh alrighty guys so my name is tony rosler i'm a co-founder of diagonal finance and today i'm going to talk to you guys about web free subscriptions so the agenda of the talk today is three-fold first we're gonna look at why on-chain subscriptions are a hard problem and why largely we haven't seen much in this space kind of largely up until now secondly we're going to talk about the benefits of streaming subscriptions and lastly we will talk about why kryptonia payment rails are important alrighty so let's just kind of set the stage so first uh we're all familiar with website payments and house subscriptions work with webto payments the way they work are essentially the bank pulls let's say 10 a month out of your account once a month now this works okay because you trust the bank to pull money out of your account and if the bank acts maliciously then your account is fdic insured and you can always claim the money back now the issue is a little bit that if you try and move this model to blockchains uh you kind of run into some problems so the first is there is no native way to pull more tokens out of users accounts uh simply on the execution layer uh in blockchains now this is largely by because by construction blockchains are push-based payment systems where every change in state requires a transaction and every transaction requires an elliptical curve digital signature from the user's point of view so what that means in a very naive way if a user wants to submit a 10 a month payment they'll have to manually sign a transaction and kind of submit this payment however that's not really the full story because we can build uh kind of certain approval based applications on top of the execution layer however these payment systems have certain flaws so all of these kind of pull-based payment systems largely boil down to this mechanism where a user will infinitely approve a contract and then a bot will on a kind of schedule schedule transaction and execute transaction pulling money out of the user's account and then paying the merchant at the end of the month now the problems with these payment systems are firstly that they have trust assumptions so when you are infinitely approving a smart contract you are giving that smart contract the opportunity on the right to essentially empty your entire account for that token now we have seen time and time again smart contracts uh have these bugs when it comes to uh infinite approval and there have been plenty of exploits around this area and now the kind of important thing from a user's point of view is my wallet is not fdic insured so if the smart contract or the bot x unit transaction acts maliciously there's no way for me to get my funds back now this is a real problem the second point is counterparty risk so because payments are essentially enforced by external actors i the bot has to make a transaction once a month to execute that payment if the bot fails to execute a transaction you will not be paying the merchant and essentially the merchant will cancel your subscription and you will not have access to that service now this is an issue because suppose the bot just disappears then yeah there's no way for you to essentially contact that boat or sue that bot because there are in kind of ethereum and smart contracts agreements are enforced by code not by courts lastly an interesting point is kind of the lack of scalability so having kind of these scheduled transactions requires end payments to make end transactions so the question kind of becomes so who first of all pays for the gas and then what happens when the cost of execution of the transaction is greater than the fees earned from the bot for executing a transaction so should the fees kind of should the cost be pushed to the merchant side as in canada should be cut into their profit margin should the user pay the fees so it becomes more expensive than it would otherwise or should the service provider the the payments friday pay the fees now okay this is kind of there are many different ways you can go here but if we perhaps look at some numbers so this is some this is based on analysis i did in last february granted things may have changed but i looked at usdc and kind of the average uh on a 30 day kind of average what was the average erc20 transfer on the cost in some gst and arbitrary everything a dollar same for optimism and main hours of v10 luckily this is way more expensive than it would be in traditional fiat payment rails so if we kind of summarize the problem one thing is the beach problem what would happen to your subscription if your payments friday went to the beach um essentially your subscription would cancel so this is not a decentralized famous rider and this is not um every kind of ecosystem we want to be building so right then so how does streaming solve this so first of all streaming has uh zero trust assumptions so the user pushes money continuously from their accounts to the merchant's accounts there is there are not they are not approving anyone money is pushed continuously secondly there is zero counterparty risk because payments are settled continuously so this is incredibly important for businesses where essentially they provide a service to the user throughout the month and then expect to be paid by end of the month a good example of this is let's say an rpc provider like infuria alchemy where you are allowed to make rpc calls and at the end of the month they send you a bill and they expect to charge for that bill now these merchants have a massive problem which is essentially that users can rack up huge bills that they are not able to pay for and there's really no clean way to mitigate this because there's you cannot settle continuously you cannot settle every time you basically give value so with streaming you can do that which is quite beautiful where essentially every every single second the payment is settled and money is leaving your account and entering your account so this reduces the risk for the merchant dramatically lastly scalability is an incredibly important way so you only have to submit a single on-chain transaction to open a subscription and a single on-chain transaction to close a subscription and lastly something which is very cool is uh and also important is capital efficiency so merchants are paid every second which essentially means they can always put their money to work always be earning yield and just dramatically increases their capital efficiency all right then well let's also kind of think a little bit more broadly so why is streaming not only better on those verticals we touch but why is it logic better in general so let's consider netflix so as we know netflix has been in the news a lot recently for essentially uh they've been struggling in terms of their revenue and their business model so if we look and if we and this is not all that surprising really if we look at netflix's business model so netflix charges ten dollars a month now this is a bad business model if we because essentially you have a cohort of people who have a higher willingness to pay and ten dollars a month and these people are getting a bargain where they are paying less and they're willing to pay you also have a code of people who are not willing to pay 10 a month they're willing to pay less than that but they're being pressed out of a netflix subscription so this means that netflix is just capturing a very small area under the demand curve and leaving a lot of money on the table now if you introduce streaming uh something very very interesting happens so first of all uh if you just make netflix a ten dollar subscription a streaming subscription you're essentially now creating an infinite number of price points below the demand curve there is now a price point for a user who wants to subscribe for just one second a month there is now a price point for user one subscribe for two seconds a month or maybe you just watch 10 minutes on netflix a month and now the total revenue is just integral in this area and as you can see the total revenue cap by netflix is much much larger now that's just with one package we can consider a multi-package setup where you have a team family whatever and what you essentially see is that you can now capture all area under the demand curve okay now another important thing is that when we are dealing with streaming payments we are dealing with on-chain verifiable payments payments which are by construction crypto native and this really allows us to reimagine and rethink uh from first principles how we think about payments so i know if we look at the history of crypto and d5 one thing that you should always keep in mind is that you should maximize for composability at every vertical of the stack so there's a reason unit swap tokens and v2 tokens we rc20 and v3 tokens are 721 same similar with a token to c tokens or the rc20 so by moving states into a tokenized state you become composable and in the context of subscriptions that can mean quite a lot but we will discuss two things the first is that subscriptions themselves can be composable they can be represented in the form of nfts all right so let's just imagine for a second you owned an nft saying you were the first subscriber to the joe rogan podcast now clearly this nft would have economic and social value in today's society um however sort of along the way joe rogan would have experienced a lot of benefits as well because the moment you bought the nft you now acquired a real stake in his success so the better joe rogan does the better like kind of the more valuable nft and the better you do similarly this provides joe rogan with organic distribution because essentially now joe rogan's subscribers are now his greatest brand ambassadors because incentives are aligned and lastly yeah this can be very interesting from joe rogan from a business point of view because you can now essentially identify your subscribers you can identify google's early and you can reward them appropriately you can assign them property rights for example early access to podcasting episodes or special meet and greets as stand-up gigs and he doesn't even have to provide all these services themselves people can build services based fundamentally around these kind of building blocks because again the subscription is fundamentally composable now another vertical which is very interesting to kind of investigate is your service or your business itself being on chain composable so what what i'm kind of what we see on the screen here is something which is a little specific to superfluid and also what we're doing at diagonal but nevertheless i think it was interesting to share so the way diagonal represents your business is that we represent your business as an nft in the form of a specifically it's an nft and a supra now a super app is a smart contract where users stream money in to smart contracts and the smart contract redirects that money automatically to the merchant and pays them every single second so what you now have is you have a business which has predictable unchained verifiable revenue which means it can do things like take out under collateralized loans because now external actors can see this is a business this business makes this amount of money every month it's this reliable and we can actually offer you a loan based on your in based on your risk profile not the one of some risk agnostic pool okay another kind of interesting area about this is that you can also sell your business on exchanges like openc or even potentially fractionalize your business creating kind of shareholders and community and distributing value to your community now lastly kind of we want to touch on why are kryptonated payment rail is important so we'll perhaps only touch on two of these verticals but let's start with those so as you know there's a dow there's a kind of a b2b dao service industry that's really booming at the moment and has been for a long time and essentially all of these services are sas services which are providing services for those in return for conversation now one thing dials will have common is they want to settle in crypto on cryptonated payment rails because interact with fiat is a massive headache and more specifically if they can pay in their own token that is a huge benefit so clearly in this scenario having kryptonated subscriptions encrypted native payment rails is very important secondly you can think more in the future perhaps uh gaming so if we get to the metaverse such as decentraland where you can create your metaverse to your own space you can even i remember reading snoop dogg was hosting concerts in decentraland and the kind of economic activity which you can do in these metaverses is becoming increasingly sophisticated and i really believe will kind of eventually will be just as sophisticated as the economies we see in the term kind of the real world today society now this means there will be service providers and this means people will be demanding crypto needed payment rails because they will want to settle in token like uh i find it very hard to believe that one day let's say decentral under sandbox will redirect you to a fiat gated checkout link where you have to put your credit card down and dodge yourself to let's say buy an in-game item okay so that was kind of the talk uh and again yeah i'm tony work at diagonal finance if any of this sounded interesting to you and you think streaming subscriptions uh are powerful please get in touch uh either through kind of twitter or you can even reach myself on twitter or our website and finally we're hiring for several engineering roles so yeah have a great day everyone tell me it was an awesome talk and a really great overview i think uh i mean i'm super excited and obviously good to see you and uh on the other side after being a hacker too uh my only kind of question is um you kind of talked about how all these things are working now and what you are able to do um curious like what you think is missing in this space and what would actually supercharge yeah um yeah well so what i think is missing is frankly a clean abstraction to in use this technology so streaming payments is like what i think we will discuss for quite is very cool and this this is very powerful however if you want to bring this piece of technology to the masses to businesses or even other protocols every protocol is not going to write the solidity to integrators themselves they're not going to pay the money for the audits they're not going to build off-chain monitoring infrastructure to make sense of the payments they're not going to build the relevant dining dunning flows and the sdks to integrate into their existing payment systems so if you really want to bring this to the masses you need a clear abstraction which truly makes it just as simple as integrating string payments as it is to integrate stripe or whatever it may be it really shouldn't be a trade-off from a developer point of view and i don't think there there will be in the future so this is what i really think is missing here um and also largely what motivates us at diagonal isaac got it so i gotcha it's not like we think we need a new opcode or a new framework for everybody to generalize deployment yeah that's interesting i don't necessarily think we do so there there have actually been people who've suggested opcodes in the future uh previously but this was uh rejected uh tremendously and i think there's a nice blog post by the way metallic why something like an alarm opcode that doesn't make sense uh specifically in doing asynchronous actions uh it becomes very complicated um and yeah it's just this should you don't want to do this at the execution layer this is a protocol layer problem and then the question becomes do you want to have do you want to do stuff based on external actors and trust assumptions or do you want to have on-chamber reliable value transfer and i really think it's yeah we think it's this one i think uh i don't think many people will disagree on you uh well that's awesome um well i am super excited to kind of see how diagonal finance progresses and uh yeah just generally the fact that you can now use this thing to make a new way to think about under collateralized loans is uh to me super exciting so hopefully that becomes more and more common and uh really appreciate you taking the time and uh giving this amazing talk sure no problem thank you very much amazing all right with that we are ready for our next talk and that'll be sunny from ricochet exchange talking about investing in real time so uh i got a preview of what he's going to talk about but uh without further ado let's welcome sunny and uh i'll let you take it from here bye this car jack just gonna pull up my screen real quick awesome everyone i'm sunny really excited to be talking to you guys about real-time investment today it's a concept that i helped pioneer at ricochet exchange last year and uh today we're gonna be basically defining what real-time investing is go over why you want to invest in real time and the advantages of doing it and then lastly break down some projects that are currently in the ecosystem building on top of the concept of real-time investing so first what is real-time investing let's put it let's put a definition to it so i define real-time investing as initiating a super fluid payment stream by the second on-chain payment stream to a special superfluid enabled smart contract which we call super apps which will take the money that you've streamed into the smart contract that being the super app and periodically invested into the target investment asset of your choice so the only thing that you're really doing here to interact with this recurring automated investment process is simply starting a super fluid stream there is no need to repetitively do deposits or swaps it's all abstracted into a single constant by the second super fluid stream and so some examples of this would be you know streaming your money into a super app which will accumulate ethereum for you streaming your money into a super app which will invest into bitcoin for you you can even get more advanced such as streaming your money into super red that will invest it into yield bearing tokens or even state sushi lp positions so the possibilities with real-time investing are limitless and it's really kind of a really it's really kind of a paradigm shift when it comes to uh investing um which we've traditionally experienced in kind of discrete um swaps transfers and deposits so let's talk about now why you want to invest in real time what is let's let's point out the the real advantages of real-time investing so the way we traditionally experience um d5 investments and those kinds of d5 investment vehicles is through discrete transfers and so with real-time investing you're taking away these kinds of discrete transfers and these you know swaps and you're replacing them with continuous payment streams when you think of investing or sticking your money in ave you traditionally take x amount you go to ave and you deposit it or if you want to swap x amount from from uscc into ethereum you go to sushi swap you go to an amm and you make that happen with a single transaction right and if you want to you know invest recurring in a recurring basis you'd have to basically go and you have to do these on your own right you have to go every so often and make these swaps make these deposits and that's kind of cumbersome and it's uh requires transactional upkeep uh with with superfluous trains we're able to and the code and the composable nature of them you're able to essentially hook up these payment streams into these d5 protocols and these d5 investment vehicles um through super apps and you're able to basically abstract away those discrete transfers and deposits into continuous payments range and basically make investment investing in these kinds of opportunities hands-off and effortless uh the second part here is the fact that real-time investing is responsible it's a responsible way to invest some of us are familiar with the concept of dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging is the idea of doing fixed investments on fixed intervals into an asset of your choice right so example here would be investing um five dollars into bitcoin every single day so the power here is that you are investing in basically every single price instead of picking and choosing different prices and trying to time the markets and so as a result your diverse find a way price risk which is very powerful um especially in the kinds of markets that we're seeing today you may invest you may believe heavily in the theory of the future price appreciated appreciation of it but if you had bought in a lump earlier this year you would be like well in the red and so with real-time investing you're able to linearly accumulate these kinds of investment assets and basically remove price exposure um as a one-time one thing and make it kind of a gradual linear exposure which is a more sensible and responsible way to invest the third aspect here is the networking of cash flows so the idea here is that if we have an ecosystem of money moving in real time you can network cash flows from inbound streams into investment streams and so this is so critical to the superfood ecosystem um that i've basically dedicated a slide to it so the quote here is if money can move in real time it should be able to be put to work in real time and so the idea here is if we're having an economy where we're constantly paying for things in streams and we're receiving our income in streams and we're having this money move around by the second we have to wait for that money to accumulate and then kind of do our swaps and investments and these kind of discrete discrete one-off transfers the user experience hasn't been improved that much and so the idea here is to basically connect these kinds of real-time cash flows that are moving around in this digital economy to investment cash flows such that the second that this money hits our wallet we can put it to work with these investment cash flows so um by creating a korean ecosystem of real-time investing apps and giving people the opportunities to invest in these traditional d5 vehicles with um with real-time cash flows you're able to basically you know provide more utility for these people that are having your real-time finance and you're also able to reduce the transactional upkeep that these people would traditionally experience without these real-time investing applications so overall um it's really kind of it really adds more utility to people using strains it gives you another reason to transact in strings and kind of is an incentive to enter the real-time finance economy and uh yeah as the ecosystem grows i'm sure that the use of these real-time investing apps will grow as well so that's the idea here kind of like you know if you're receiving say a thousand ten thousand usdc per month in a salary stream like buy the second superfluid salary stream um an example of using number cash flow will be carving off a stream of like 3 000 usdc per month into a real-time investing app which will convert it into ethereum or something for you um basically kind of cash flow investment stream out in like a in an adjacent stream so that's a that's the idea of network cash flows all right so i want to talk about two basic entities that could use real-time investing kind of dumbed it down into individuals and dows or organizations so when we think about individuals and um their use of real-time investing well traditionally when we invest we think about that in a monthly amount right we say okay i'm gonna invest five hundred dollars into my roth ira each month i'm gonna invest 200 into ethereum and this usually requires us to make those manual deposits on our own we have to go into our accounts we have to do those transfers and we have to you know make that in a manual fashion and so with real-time investing you can automate that you can basically create a customized automated investment plan by choosing different real-time finance real-time investing apps and which kinds of investments you want to invest into and customize which rates you want the rate at which you want to purchase these assets and essentially create like a stream portfolio you can basically say okay i want 100 uh 100 ucc of each month i want 100 ucc of of the d5 pulse index index each month these kinds of different assets you can basically customize them into a real-time streaming portfolio and make that process very easy and hands-off um and basically initiate it with single your star stream transactions so it's it's very simple and so um it's really awesome the way that we're able to abstract this away into a single start stream it's amazing user experience and traditionally accomplishing this is very kind of uh difficult and technical some people they make these kind of investment scripts that do that connect their wallet and do it in that kind of fashion um some people they try to go through centralized exchanges and face them and i'm facing like very heavy um exchange fees this is a very kind of nice lightweight um simple way to accomplish it through superfluid um with real-time investing um another other entity here are dows or organizations or businesses a lot of these dows they sit on a lot of lego capital on chain and they have low risk tolerance and playing that capital to work it's a lot of the conversation around playing its work um usually comes down to the strategy of dollar cost averaging like i spoke on and it seems really like the the primary way that these dallas put their capital to work in that kind of responsible fashion these doubt these dowels they don't want to be in the business of you know having active trading groups and things like that um they simply want to find the most simple way to gain exposure to the assets that they trust in and real-time investing is the best way to do that you simply start a stream and there's no need for that uh transactional upkeep which can be difficult with dows because you know you have these multi-sigs you have levels of permission with these treasuries and having to work with that those kinds of recurring investments can become difficult when you can turn it into single streams and super fluid you know automation um it becomes a lot easier for for these thousand um reduces that kind of red tape another kind of red tape that real-time investing reduces for dallas is decision making so with um with real-time investing dapps an example here would be like a dow they can trigger an on-chain start stream transaction that will invest say 10 worth of its treasury into an asset over the course of the year with a single vote so that really kind of paints a picture of how you know these dallas they can basically turn the their investment strategies into um very kind of simple decisions because it's all kind of coming down it's kind of all abstracted into an easy start stream transactions so um does help 1000 those kinds of that kind of sense as well so that's the idea on who um needs real-time investing kind of painting the picture there oh let's let's kind of flip the page and talk about the kinds of products projects that are in the ecosystem building these kinds of real-time investment solutions so the first i want to talk about is butter butter was a hackathon project from i believe eat amsterdam they help dows essentially diversify away from their governance tokens over time using super fluid strains by streaming those governance tokens into balancer v2 pools and so the reason this is powerful is because daos oftentimes they have a lot of financial exposure to their own governance token right i believe the missouri report reported that most dallas have like over 90 of their value blocked 90 of their treasury value locked within these governance tokens and so butter allows these dials to gradually over time reduce their exposure to these governance tokens into more solid assets such as stable coins or you know blue chip tokens such as ethereum or wrapped bitcoin and so that's what butter's accomplishing um hope to see that product project uh take flight soon another project we have in the ecosystem is the dam protocol um stands for decentralized asset management protocol we refer to them as damp they are working on a project called dsip which essentially allows you to dollar cost average into managed portfolio positions on d heads using super fluid streams so essentially you're automating these streams which will stream money into these different portfolio managers on dhedge that run these kinds of different investment portfolios um based on their own kind of strategies and so it's um so it's quite advantageous for for investors that are looking for this kind of management match exposure in a responsible fashion and last but not least we have ricochet exchange ricochet exchange is the real-time investing og um i helped co-founded last year ricochet exchange allows you to basically dollar cost average into investment assets into various tokens of your choice um ricochet exchange was the very first community deployment of a super app on polygon so they're kind of the the the real ogs when it comes to not just real-time investing but also uh development on superfluid in general and so they're so uh they're so important that i dedicated a slide to their flagship product uh the rex market the rex market lets you essentially dollar cost average with super fluid streams i want to kind of break down the kind of uh architecture of their of the the rex market super app so the rex market super app here is represented by the ricochet logo um in that black box there essentially what we have here are users investors they streaming their diax into the rickshaw super app the ricochet super app every 30 minutes has a trigger has a keyboard triggered the distribute function the distribute function takes the die ex that is accumulated in that rex market super app turns around to sushi swap or an amm swaps it to the target asset that in this case being ethereum um and then distributes that theory impacted investors all in one shot using superfluid's instant distribution agreement and so this um this is an amazing user experience they're just streaming in money in their dollar cost averaging and uh it's also very scalable because um believe it or not this rex market can have like a million different users and it will still have the same fixed gas cost when it comes to distributing that target asset ethereum back to the investors um because it uses something called the instant distribution agreement by superfluid which basically assigns distribution shares um to the different streamers based on the size of their streams and so there's no need to do kind of individual transfers up and down the list of people who are investing through the wrestling kit so it's a very kind of interesting um scalable structure to do this kind of real-time investing and um it's super powerful and it's honestly the very best way to do on-chain dca i've done my homework i've looked at all the models and this is the most scalable framework to make it happen um so it's a great app that's made possible by superfluid um i also want to touch on the fact that using the rex market is non-custodial so when you um when you invest right it's like when these people are streaming their money into the rexmark contract at any one time the rexmark contract only holds 30 minutes worth of the total value streaming into and so as a result there is very little tbl in these rex market contracts and so there's little smart contract risk and also that ethereum is distributed straight back to investors so these investors they don't have to go to the rex market contract and claim the money on their own um it just shows up straight to their wallet and so they can start you know using it in their in their day-to-day um and take action with it and take advantage of other d5 opportunities as they see fit that's the money's you know straight in their wallet so uh yeah that's the deal here um with rex markets the best model for on-chain dollar cost energy so yeah i want to end the presentation with the call to action real-time investing is growing it's going to grow with the super cool ecosystem and so i highly recommend that you join the community join the real-time finance and real-time investing conversation by hopping in the superfluid discord up in the ricochet discord you'll find the links there at ricochet.exchange go build something there's so many things that have not been built yet with with real-time investing we still need an app that lets you stream your money into into stake ave um a tokens uh there's just so many different ideas out out there and our devex team is ready to help you um get off the ground with them if you you want to kind of keep them up and uh we'd love to help and basically help developers bring these kinds of real-time investing apps to production and they'll lastly use ricochet exchange try try out their app it's live at app.ricochet.exchange um you can try today and um it'll really give you a taste for what's possible with real-time investing and uh yeah i hope you guys embark on that real-time investment adventure that is my talk i want to thank you all for your for your time and attention um go follow me at sunnyjacer on on twitter and i hope you guys enjoy the rest of the super fluid reactor summit thank you amazing thank you so much for that sonny um it's been an amazing presentation um we're getting in a couple questions uh from the audience so i'll start asking them and in the meantime if you uh anybody in the audience have more questions just type them up in the chat and we'll relay them here so uh okay the first question is um i think there's uh we'd love to get a bit more um understanding of how are people able to get the e-tax token from providing die so i guess what's happening behind the scenes and if you can sort of uh cover that uh flow i'll start with that yeah yeah absolutely so essentially what's happening is the e-dex is being streamed into the rex market contract is accumulating there the distribute takes all this it basically sweeps all the diex that's landed in the contract it takes it to an amm converts it into edx so basically like basically um regular ethereum that wraps it into edx that being the the super token version of ethereum that's able to be distributed with an instant distribution agreement um then it is sent out to investors all at once using the instant distribution agreement and the reason that's possible accounting wise is because the the superflu this the rex market super app it assigns district distribution agreements sorry distribution units to investors proportional to the size of their stream right so if you're streaming in 200 you die and i'm streaming in 100 per month you're going to receive twice as much of the ethereum as i do and so based on that accounting the rex market super app is able to distribute out the e-tax in the commercial amounts based on this kind of proportion um accounted for in the instant distribution agreement um so really cool stuff there that makes a lot of sense uh hopefully uh that also makes sense for the person who asked the question and uh there's another question that came in but i think it's more directed towards super flow at the protocol so i'll still ask it to you because i think you can still answer it but uh if we need more clarification we'll have somebody from the superfloyd team directly answer on the chat so the question is um just overall i guess how dynamic uh actually let me say that directly can we control the stream using the an external dynamic value in terms of uh what the amount is that gets distributed i'll control the stream based on the what dynamic value just any externally defined dynamic value yeah um so superfluid now has a thing called acl so this is called access control list and so basically with this kind of function with this kind of functionality you're able to give a super app the ability to control your stream and change different changes stream rate on your behalf and so you could have a keeper or or oracle or something connect that to that super app and then the super app could respond to the changes in the oracle um based on whatever kind of indicator or kpi it is and then adjust your your stream rate accordingly and so using that you can accomplish something like uh like a stream investing tool that will only invest between a price range or something like that so definitely possible awesome well that's uh that's a lot more uh kind of power on the programmability of this stream payment so uh hopefully felipe that answered your question and with that i want to thank you for taking the time today and uh really appreciate this [Music] awesome all right with that we are ready for our next talk so next i want to invite purple from human finance to talk about how do we actually stream salaries um software-backed loans um and uh i think this also is a really nice sidewalk for what we just answered so uh this kind of enables a lot more new creative ways to uh talk about this so without further ado let's uh welcome and i'll let you take it from here thank you so much kartik um hello everybody i'm gonna share my screen quickly um i changed the topic slightly to streaming income background uh because i think salary um is a is a component of that and um instead of talking about you know human finance and um you know how the product works and everything um i'll kind of like talk more about why this is important and why right now is the right time and how superfluid actually enables this experience to be so much greater than what could it be so again argued from emo finance i'm one of the co-founders um and i'm glad to be here the the first thing to understand is basically where things start and where they are going um in the grand scheme of things um it you know you all know it started with you know this white paper by satoshi uh they defined bitcoin what is bitcoin i know as many people call it it's kind of like a digital gold it's a digital asset and it has a blockchain system behind which is a distributed ledger that keeps track of who owns what correct um and that you know obviously you know excited a lot of people including many people in this room today um but that was very limited because it only defined a single type of asset and only basically who you know owns what and the biggest innovation after that was actually ethereum uh because ethereum enabled uh this new concept called asset portfolios right because of the erc20 standard nft standards you have all these different standards that can actually liberate people who are creators to create this kind of assets and we started building asset portfolios people started to talk about this asset portfolio zeros and portfolios their token portfolios and empty portfolios and naturally defy as we call into state class finance um start basically thinking about okay how do i tie these things together right these assets together to create protocols that kind of like does some kind of a financial engineering maybe you know introduce some kind of inflationary token some reward mechanism so people can use place asset portfolios so for a long time if you look at the d5 protocols they only understood us as the only leveraged assets and they only created these kind of pairing structures or bonding structures between assets to do finance financial engineering um and we got to a point where majority of the you know d5 protocols were over culturalized protocols where you have to have in a lot of assets that you need to collateralize to be able to benefit from these protocols and that created not only a small market for a small number of whales and speculators because there's not much use for over cautioning all these assets it also created a you know highly kept and efficient market um and it also created a higher dependent market where every single token is tied to each other right you have all these engineered payers and um things that tied to each other where anytime you know something bad happens to one of them uh we have this cascading effect across the ecosystem um and we're in one of those probably downturns right now unfortunately um and and that's also probably one of the reasons why you know dfi as a kind of whole hasn't really grown um as much but innovations are you know right right in front of us and one of those um changes happening in the whole ecosystem outside of d5 is basically this transition from asset portfolios to income portfolios if you think about the next billion people right coming into this ecosystem they're not bringing in millions of dollars in assets right they have not much utilization for all these overclocked class protocols and they're not necessarily interested in speculation they are coming into this ecosystem because of the income opportunities right income opportunities that are you know eminent in the nfd marketplaces as craters income unfortunately in dollar marketplaces incoming purchases as well you know builders and developers uh like ours um but also you know opportunities in these new platform ecosystems and people are being attracted to this and the next billion people are coming in because of the income opportunities and they're starting to build income portfolios right instead of the kind of real-world scenario where you have maybe one job and one salary um now you have actually all these different ecosystems and communities you're a part of and you're building these income portfolios and this is going to be the new type of passion gig economy um uh you know in the next uh 10 20 years so you know that's why i call it buy buy huddlers and welcome builders because that's kind of like where we're going and the next building is i'm interested in and this this actually gives us a pulse because um if you think about you know the next building coming um for this income opportunity and building income portfolios there is no d5 protocol today they can leverage that they can actually understand your income portfolio and can lend you against that however when you got stuck in assets again we talked about this kept connections problem uh the income underwriting incumbent and running can also solve the skip connections problem if you ex you know actually look at how traditional finance does landing today income is the most critical input in landing right so if you want to get a mortgage forget a car loan if you want to get a personal loan credit you know card business loan doesn't matter what you want to get if you go to a lender doesn't matter also you know what your credit score is uh the first and foremost thing they want to know is what is your income right you need to provide this you know payroll statements or cash flow statements if you're in a business getting a loan and then they actually put that in as the most important input into calculating you know what kind of a loan they're going to provide you and there's this term called you know debt income ratio and and that's kind of like the critical critical input they use from the income again yet there's no use for income today uh in any of the defined protocols and that's that's kind of like why um we believe it is you know both the time but also uh it is it is our you know opportunity and responsibility to provide this kind of financial opportunities otherwise you know if you're like me if you spend you know most of your time in this this world and actually you know a measure of income comes from this ecosystem uh if you want to get a mortgage and go to a traditional bank today they will laugh at you they will not give you anything if you want to get a car loan they'll not give you anything uh again doesn't matter what your credit score is because you know your income doesn't necessarily count uh in that world so that's this that's where um we believe um this critical input needs to have its own primitive and needs to is actually become a significant part of you know the lending protocols and um superfluid here um provide a very interesting opportunity uh when we went to ethereum denver a few months ago and start thinking about okay like how do we really you know leverage this and build this and and one of the first things we realized is first and foremost you know when you again go to traditional financer and want to get uh you know a term a type of loan they ask you for this no copy or photo photo of your income uh statement it's like in a pay slip or you know whatever you might have um but it is much more useful for d5 protocol for these incomes to be actually in a contract and streaming is one of the actually best ways uh to look at and understand income on chain because streaming um signals couple of different things right streaming means that the the payer who's paying this income actually has very high trust in this payee uh because they're you know creating this very continuous form of payment which is streaming it's also something where you can understand in real time if there is actually uh you know a a breach of contract or if some some kind of a divorce between the payer and payee because the stream is going to be cut at that point so you have full understanding of you know the uh different events that might impact this kind of underwriting so when you start you know looking into super fluid obviously you know like many of you you're very impressed with uh what they have built and it gave us a very easy sdk to utilize to understand all these different streaming you know incomes uh that are happening and we're able to you know build a simple prototype that leverage that and not only that it actually helps us in another way which is one of the most important things in automated landing uh is to be able to collect also the the money you landed automatically uh again this doesn't actually happen in traditional finance we need to remember you know to pay the lender back but if you're actually getting paid um in in a stream uh the moment actually the user borrows money against their stream they can also open a payback stream as well and start paying like every single second right so this was not necessarily again possible in the real world traditional finance scenario but it's possible in a streaming scenario because both you can have a very strong understanding of the income because we have this in a stream going on and it's a smart contract and you have the events emitted but also you can open a payback stream and the people can actually start paying back in second uh the moment they you know borrow the money from the protocol so it's also very convenient for that perspective and creates a large amount of trust within the protocol itself um the other thing actually when you look at you know what's going on with the large ecosystem uh is this you know a new uh paper published by vitalik pujain glenn uh i guess about you know 10 days ago or so and you have to read this if you haven't you know read this yet it's called the center society uh funding with three sold i mean let's talk about you know the sole bond tokens um one of the uh challenges in uh under quote lies landing of any kind uh especially unqualified lending that's income backed is a mechanism that understands you know who is behind this who is on the other side of uh this parabolic and in our current form of our kind of like v1 design uh we don't have a great mechanism to actually understand who is behind us that's why you know we have to design a protocol that understands the wallet and talks about you know the wallet and looks at the income potential of the wallet however uh going forward uh there's a you know a huge enablement that comes with this all by tokens because soulbound tokens can uh make sure that certain things are transferable uh between different wallets and they are kind of like sold bound to the uh person that's behind that wallet uh in in the wallet in the paper itself it talks about basically one of the biggest enabler enablers for for this technology is basically the issuance of um unculturalized and under quartalized lending um another actual interesting utilization of this technology is creating a debt statement that actually stays involved right so if actually someone takes a debt um position against their uh streamed income you can actually create a token that defines that statement uh that is soul bond uh foreign as well so there's kind of like a lot of interesting ways you can create this more contract you know uh like um environments and uh uh use cases uh on chain um and again uh when we look at you know uh the evolution of female finance and why we started you know it then were uh especially with uh superfluid um one reason was the utilization of the superfluid uh streams in terms of like the understanding and the signal of the income but the other aspect of it was basically the the awesomeness of the super fluid 10 because uh when we started digging into you know how to utilize this um sdk that built in the ecosystem they built uh we quickly found a group of people who are very passionate to you know sit down with us and begin with us into how we can build things um both within super food ecosystem and also outside of the ecosystem uh so we found great partners um and we start building you know our uh prototype and ethereum denver two months ago uh utilizing uh their their technology and we already defined track winner at ethereum denver and also uh we were picked as the best overall project built on superfluid uh and that really gave us the kind of courage to actually all go full time and do this um as a real um startup and we just raised eight million dollars also in seed funding from some of the best investors again you know uh thanks to fran and the superfluid team and their their one of confidence in us and some of our other partners and uh where we're going next is uh providing a credit line for every wallet out there because we strongly believe income service credit reason to use any time and it's also important to denote that uh we should never think about income only as a streaming salary because the the overall growth of the ecosystem is showing us that income can come in any form so one of my co-founders richard uh he's a big uh you know participant in the plate or ecosystems he's actually earning you know probably upwards of thousand dollars every month uh by just you know playing uh with three games uh and we're seeing you know uh millions of people coming to the ecosystems and earnings you know total of billions of dollars from this ecosystem same thing with crater ecosystem same thing with metabours the same thing with some other mechanisms where artists actually can start earning you know in this ecosystem uh through royalties and and rents um of different types of tokens so uh there's just this you know growing ecosystem of income portfolios as we see and that's why we're so excited to be here today talk about what we started building we don't have a website uh that has an application just yet we will have something in the coming weeks uh and we will be in production um in q3 uh this year but um in the meantime i'm more than happy to take your questions and talk more about income backed um streaming income backed loans and anything along those lines thank you [Music] amazing uh that was super awesome and i'm super excited to admit that all this happened in the last three months uh that must have been a crazy uh journey already indeed indeed so uh maybe one kind of obvious question would be just how do you uh can expect people to uh to use this and like what would you have some ideas for uh like how this could be a better integration what would you like to see from the end users and like what can we do beyond just the basics of streaming this perfect question so the way we kind of i'm going about integrating this into different ecosystems is we're looking at specialty ecosystems one is the on-chain payments ecosystems right so superfluid obviously is a key participant in the ecosystem but if you look at what super fluid is also integrating with you know you see things like request network for example where request network is an invoicing you know um system where you know hundreds of millions of dollars every year is running through the invoicing system uh you see you know payment companies like pay magic utopia labs where these are the tools utilized by dows and their treasury is to pay people so we're looking into direct integrations with those tools because we heard from many of these uh players and and partners that people who are actually getting paid um are in need of simple financing right so they cannot go to their own bank they cannot necessarily go and you know double down on their credit cards because their income that they need to you know utilize to borrow against is is on chain and uh we will be integrating deeply uh with these uh ecosystems and and partners uh to basically provide the nato capability in those uh applications another uh uh partner uh uh uh ecosystem we're talking to right now is this again you know plato ecosystems and external ecosystems so if you think about the biggest barrier uh for uh you know different type of gamers to join those ecosystems is the barrier to acquire assets required to play the game so for example if you want to you know play certain play turn games you might need to you know put up two thousand dollars maybe sometimes more uh to acquire first assets and then um play the game and yes there are you know maybe guilds that you know will lend you some of these assets and then they take away eight percent of income but you know you never have to assist yourself you're never liberated as a player and the you know more you play the guilds you know have more income not you uh so you know we're looking at basically partnering with some of these large ecosystems right now so that you know when they want to onboard new gamers uh actually you know we're able to look at their future income opportunity and land against it so there's more of a liberation from the you know players perspective to participate in more of these ecosystems uh so the other two big you know ecosystems looking at and we're excited about the growth of those um overall uh we have some other um you know ideas in mind that we haven't practiced yet you know one of them is we're talking to some you know wallet uh partners where again we envision eventually a credit line for every wallet so let's say you go to metamask you go to in a rainbow whatever is your favorite wallet and you say check my credit line powered by huma boom you have a credit line that might originated by some of our liquid department so it's kind of like the um different use cases and scenarios we're looking through and building for well that's a that's a really good uh no way especially if it's available as like a line of credit on a wallet that just gets to a closer normal banking experience that uh exactly uh it's a question from the audience from from rachel um the question is gonna from could this also be used for for business income as well because you kind of talked about personal loans but is there anything logistical difference there totally there there's no difference from political perspective the protocol understands income right on a world perspective from a perspective if anything actually business income usually is more reliable um as a mechanism to underwrite against and a lot of these you know dao's that actually also paying service dollars or you know small businesses um of the crypto world um and this information is is the same it's represented either you know as a stream as an invoice as as something else so it can be utilized by both business purposes or personal purposes awesome well hopefully that uh clarify that your uh question uh maybe maybe i'll put you on the spot with uh the final question which is uh when can we expect the app to go live great question so uh we're working hard with our initial set of partners for alpha lunch uh sometime around september so please look forward to that uh and you know feel free to reach out to me on telegram as valedi you can also email us at gm humour.finance and we will soon put up a website where you can also join our waitlist thank you amazing well please follow at home and finance on twitter to keep up with everything they're doing and with that thank you so much and we are ready for our next panel so as we kind of bring on all of our speakers i'm super excited to welcome and kind of start this panel uh we're going to talk about web3 native business opportunities there's a lot of stuff that we've already talked about that is possible what this new business ideas to just new ways to think about using these protocols or just various protocols together but what we want to do is focus on the ability to uh honestly just think about what is a on-chain company look like or the future of managing businesses on chain look like so for this amazing panel i have uh four amazing panelists i have christoph from request network terune from coin shift julian from unlock protocol and mike from superfluid so we'll bring them all on stage and get started so welcome everybody [Music] good to see a lot of familiar faces um hello and uh before we dig in i'm going to do the very boring thing which is i'll let each of you introduce yourself just so that for the audience who doesn't know what you are doing uh they get some context so maybe starting with mike um we'll let you know who you are what you do and then we'll just go next with with julia krista thank you kartik it's a pleasure to see again after all this time working with youth global um i'm mike or mikhili um i am one of the co-founders of superfluid i had the pleasure to meet francesco mia my co-founders almost two years ago now and build um you know this kind of platform that allows a value to be transferred in real time on uh on chain and with evm network so far amazing julian hi i'm julian and this unfounded unlock a company that's trying to build or that actually has built a protocol for memberships an easy way for creators brands communities of any kind to mint their own membership contract and then sell nfts in the form of membership cards and these nfts have an expiration date which enables recurring revenues for businesses and creators so uh hey everyone pretty excited to be here i'm tharon founder and ceo of coin shift so we simplify crypto trading management for dows and web 3 companies so started out last year and yeah i think pretty pretty excited to be here and my turn hello everyone christopher i'm an ex-cfo and i'm ceo and co-founder at request finance and very clear request finance is doing invoicing and payments in digital currencies and we have plans to launch a super food integration next month amazing well so it looks like some alpha has already been dropped but we'll get started uh with uh with our first uh kind of very obvious question which is it's definitely a trick question um but are there do we see actually businesses happening on chain or is it just speculation and and people just trading nfts and then uh putting money in defy and yield um i'll just kind of open it up anybody wants to take the first step we'll kind of go in yeah yeah i can start yes the answer is yes uh there is some business uh happening on chain uh just for i think just for conscience there's like 80 million but tarun you speak about that for request finance with processed invoices for more than 200 million so far and this is basically happening from our point of view for bill payments expense reimbursements and salary payments and basically the companies who are doing that kind of business there are of three different types the first one is crypto native companies and deos second one is basically professional services like lawyers marketing agencies software development companies and the third one is more web two companies transitioning to a web three how amazing any anyone anyone else i want to add something to this and uh yeah yeah just to add on it and all the categories i think the software like mentioned uh definitely like a lot of our users actually use request network as well so like you know it's a combination of invoicing core payments mass payouts like a lot of lot of things so all the categories are definitely there and third party sort of you know reimbursements and all those things are really going on so a lot of crypto native companies and the good trend is like there are some companies which use us like they just want to accept payment from you know overseas right and they just want like a non-custodial kind of solution so that they have like full control like how they should manage it so they they also are looking to really expand through on change sort of payments and acceptance right so it's like a new new sort of set of market which is coming i would even go i mean further in the consumer world where we're also seeing uh we've unlocked a bunch of creators basically monetizing with their audience and their fans and people are paying to access their content or access their communities one thing that i think some of you have experienced is tickets to conferences um a lot of web 3 events are now selling tickets through unlock and these are consumer you know people paying to access something so yes there is some business happening definitely i would i would i mean defer to the other guys christoph and tarun on the business side of things but we're also seeing that on the on the consumer side of things which is really really exciting yeah and i would add even that uh what we are speaking about basically activities that is happening on change for businesses are resilient operations so meaning it's not really depending on the market direction so whether there's a bull or bear market it's fine it's growing anyway so i think i'm speaking for all of us we're actually what we have seen at superfluid is that you know last year or the years before there was a lot more of this defy summer vibes or you know nft speculation but as the teams that operate in this industry start to grow and get funded and start building you know essential pieces of the infrastructure that powers all these services well guess what they have to pay salaries and raising voices and you have b2b value transfer but also b2c value transfer so um it's interesting to look at the blockchain industry as something that is also robust over time and not just as fragile as market price is um so i guess that anyone anyone here had that experience over the last year or so and it's good to kind of dive into that i don't know if you guys have seen any trends in this direction like have you seen more business happening on chain everyone's talking about you know is this the year of the dow is this the year of of on chain payments what do you think about it that's a great question but it's uh definitely the year where the builders are basically standing out and standing on top so the big builders exactly like you are seeing michelle the ones other companies which have funding whether it's a dao a crypto native company or a startup from more the web to world but what we are seeing is that they are even the web 2 companies they transition to web 3 for efficiency like tarun was saying earlier and and this is something that's going to stay for very long and uh i think what also happened is like you know i think in the last sort of if we call this market a beer market i would say in the last sort of where we were not having like you know boom off like really usdc or our stable cryptocoins right and all the vcs or investors have like monies majorly in btc or eth and that's why you know all the major the companies were not able to raise like specifically in a stable sort of form and that is it is highly coupled the growth of robbers infrastructure and do into the speculation or or other things right but in the last few years it just you know highly decoupled from that and and that's why like you know two people just come to eat globals like hackathon and they can raise money that was not happening before and they can raise in stables and they can literally you know run like a proper business on chain and once that is you know exponentially growing uh i think that is like a tremendous sort of movement and this uh sort of business launching business native operations right and obviously dao's is like i would say like a super set of all these things like you raise money and then you finally exit to the community so there's like a next level thing do just addition to that so i'll say like crypto startups all with three major institutions even investors know all of these people are just now running businesses they they operate on top of crypto so that is something like really really good habits yeah and i mean you all mentioned usdc and stable coins she meets one of the major innovations not from this year i've seen from i'd say probably two or three years ago that's finally starting to completely uh period everything that we do in crypto like most people deploying uh contract with unlock right now actually using usdc as a base currency they're not charging an eth or any of the volatile cryptocurrency even like medica on polygon or others they're charging in usdc and so it's pretty clear that from a ux perspective the predominance of stable coins now is definitely a big unlock and has given businesses but also consumers a lot more confidence in terms of trading things because there's obviously the technology that you have to trust in but also the currency that you're getting paid in or that you're paying in and so seeing that is is something massive um and something that honestly is extremely extremely bullish as a signal yeah totally agree and i would add that i'm surprised that we don't see a big other stable coin that is not ust usd packed actually so there are some other very big currencies in the world and so far a lot of businesses even in europe or in asia they are dealing with usdc that's surprising yeah well i'm uh this is already a great panel because uh my job is already reduced from asking questions or getting all of you to engage so i'm glad here that on the next 30 minutes um but i mean like if i'm just kind of understanding all this right and i did start off with this this was a trick question right the answer is obviously yes and the answer here is like what we're clearly seeing is that people are behaving like businesses on chain without actually needing a legal entity for lack of a better reduction and that's kind of first of all just mind blowing because you can get to almost the same skill as a really successful company in tech or or even any other part of non-tech world and never even have to deal with largely the real world and uh it that just still blows my mind uh and so maybe the question kind of i have is um all of you have uh customers that are in that category of companies that are not necessarily uh like the electricities they're directly mostly on chain if you can observe any kind of obvious patterns like are all of them just behaving like exact normal companies like yes they have to do payroll they have to manage uh accounts receivable and send invoices or send money um is that just one to one are we seeing something better like maybe turn like seeing that for so many dials like what's kind of been some highlights yeah i think a lot of uh i will say like the needs if you just compare from any company like the needs are somewhere similar but the experience and the things they want is like you know entirely different i would say so uh in short like uh you know if if you are holding sort of a lot of crypto assets and now we want to run like a payroll right what a traditional sort of uh system look like you can just you know rely on certain bank and then you just schedule payments and you can just do a lot of things through the sort of simple database right and you want the same operation in crypto as but if you just say you know like we'll take the custody of the funds then you want automation they don't want it right so the the basically i think uh all the operations are very similar but the infrastructure and companies like ours request and you know like we we need to build that infrastructure layer basically to support those operations because the fundamental layer is like self-custody right you cannot just use the same sort of tools to provide like the same experience and now the question is like how we can achieve the best experience plus building this you know ethos of right delegation trustless or permissionless kind of systems so that we can once we combine this this entire system is far more i would say superior than what we have seen in the in the traditional sort of system right so that is the common pattern we see so a lot of times we also try to apply certain principles because we have a banking app as well as a coin shift right and now we have as a coin shipped as a user like as a platform as well so we sort of a lot of times we compare like you know what what kind of experience we want but not at the cost of taking the custody or taking the trustlessness from [Music] [Music] is that uh the same kind of set of values and kind of principles that matter when you're thinking about adding more features to request or how does that kind of change um anything for for you um no i'd say so basically how request finance works is you raise an invoice and you get paid on a on a wallet but you can get paid or whatever that is a custodial or non-custodial you decide then the one who is making the payment so far he's paying from a non-custodial wallet so he's uh right now the integration that we've got is for example integration with the gnosis safe but uh basically a project like coincides seems super super promising as well with an even better experience so basically i would say i am a bit agnostic whether most of the future users is gonna do some self-custody but the way i'm thinking about it for myself is i would not do 100 of one or the other so basically um i don't know like 50 50 or like trust some custodial services a little bit and also trust the non-custodial uh wallet which basically when you trust the non-custodial wallets you trust yourself yep which uh which has some downsides because uh there is no centralized risk or a single point of failure in some scenarios with the not a lot of them uh but it's not a bad thing either i mean we've kind of been successfully doing that at scale and it is in a way working for all of your customers uh to do some degree and uh but i agree uh maybe one follow-up that i have for turin is uh essentially like you kind of commented on there's some new infrastructure or just infrastructure in general that we need it is kind of the goal the way you think about it that hey we want to make the experience just a one-to-one with how existing banking looks like for your customers or do you think there's more than that like what's kind of the missing infrastructure pieces here for you and um how do you think about that yeah so the mix of definitely both things like there are certain things definitely you need to replicate as well like you know invoicing is there where it's it's mandatory like you cannot miss invoicing right when you are building like a crypto banking layer so this is there and then then you have to have like you know scheduling of payment these are the certain things you can bring but i think the interesting things which cannot be possible and people needed us like you know some kind of kpi based performance kind of things right and and how will you really do that in a in a normal kind of database application it is not that easy so so these news permits what do you mean by that like can you share more yeah so so let's say you know you want to reward certain contributors based on some kpis right and it should be trustless for those contributors now so you don't need to ask the admin like you know i need this payment at this time so i'll perform this and i'll get the money right so it's a trustless system which is not possible right so i think those kind of new primitives will be there so i think we'll be building more kind of you know those kind of primitives and then there are certain things which is highly crypto native so one example could be like right now i just feel like you know multisec is highly operationally inefficient right it is built for security it is built for like securing your funds but it is not built for running your transactions every single day right so for that i think what we need is like more kind of modules on top of this base layer so that you can be operationally very efficient and that that is something like new kind of things you can do like scoping out certain call data operations technically right like this person can execute only these operations through multisig or some kind of delegation so these kind of modules will be required and it is entirely new right so so yeah and uh to uh to confirm what tyron was saying no i added that basically i think the we're saying the same thing but basically there's we can add the workflows to how the money is sent to whom and even in which conditions and basically the the smart contract is allowing us to do that so we could apply a smart contract together combined with a superfluid for example for streaming of payments where basically there's total transparency and there is a trustless system for the the workers the builders the creators to get paid in a very transparent setup so if i take an example in the web to industry basically when the client pays and a sales guy gets a bonus basically all this could be automated if the client pays the bill then the sales guys get a percentage all this is automated transparent it's a clear workflow and it's managed by smart contracts and this does not exist yet but i think we are we are building the first pillars so step by step we're gonna we're gonna go there amazing um i do want to give uh the other speakers a chance too so so what i'm hearing is um i don't know i just meant like uh just there's a lot more that i think we can add on to this thing so they're really interesting topics so uh we're essentially you know we're starting off with okay let's try to get the basic building blocks of running a business on chain up and going from what we already understand how any normal company would do so you got stuff like invoicing you got basic kind of payments scheduling managing uh payroll and just kind of money flowing in and out those are simple building blocks that everybody needs um and it's great that it's not custodial but also it's fine if sometimes it's custodial uh because um you can have the best of both worlds on where the asset is coming from um that seems like usually the building blocks you need for running a normal business with a bank account and an illegal entity clearly there's a lot more we can do here so maybe starting off with like what you think you like what are some of these like new pieces that we can add on and how do we kind of supercharge this absolutely what christoph just said is is very inspiring in that scenario because it means that when we think about companies on train we're very schemorphic we're really trying to apply the same model that we have when in practice i mean if i'm a sales person and i'm being paid by a company organization but i'm also getting bonuses based on whether the customer is actually paying the company and again with air quotes why do i actually need to be an employee in that scenario is that is that something that maybe i am just a member of a dow in that scenario and so that's kind of pushing us further down the idea of kind of you know theory of the firm where basically the company exists as a way to reduce friction uh between different people inside and outside when actually the chain itself is the thing that actually produces a lot of that friction and right now if i'm a sales person i need to believe i need to trust that yes the customer is going to pay the company and then the the you know the the accounting inside the company is going to report that to the hr team that's going to pay me well if this is all unchained actually there's no need for me to get that information from the hr team there's no need for the yeah you know the the accounting team to actually report this thing i can as an employee be immediately paid when indeed the customer pays for the product so so that's to me one of the things that i'm excited about is like we're going to move beyond this kind of skeuomorphic phase where we're just replying rebuilding the same models of off-chain companies and organizations to on-chain and realizing that a lot of these is just craft that we don't need anymore uh and so that's gonna reduce friction and kind of make things much smoother and much easier down the line how does that unlock fit into this uh equation for yeah yeah so the way we think a lot about these things is like uh unlock itself is a protocol from memberships and we think that many many businesses eventually will have a membership so in that framing maybe we're more like a 2.5 model in that scenario where it's like we're still the same you know existing companies the same media organization the same creators but they actually want to start thinking about okay what is it to be what is it to have a membership as a core business model versus just a transactional one so for media businesses that means that you know i get a membership and i access some of the content i don't actually necessarily pay per article i'm gonna say pay in the form of ads per article because like the the ad is a transactional thing where i pay with my eyeballs in that scenario but i'm moving to a different status uh where okay now i'm a member of that organization we also are chatting with venture you know consumer goods product we're thinking you know what it's very very hard to do a customer acquisition but customer retention actually is something that can be improved a ton of times by having memberships as the core model and so we all know that amazon prime is a very good example of this where you know if you're a member of amazon you're more likely amazon prime should i say you're more likely to actually use them to ship your next good because you're you have this sunk cost uh analogy where you i mean energy sun cost system where you've already paid for the membership why would you go some other store uh to get free shipping because you get it from them right away um and we're discussing with some of the brands you might have seen that starbucks in the us is going to do nfts for their loyalty points that's a pretty obvious use case of the unlock protocol in that scenario yeah and also for example what membership looks like in general right and i think fundamentally like in a way employment is a way to think about members if it's say you can imply and you're seeing a bunch of dials actually use unlock for their memberships where instead of being kind of how much you own of the government service that you have one and you pay every month and the fact that you become a member of that quickly gives you access to certain benefits and maybe the right to actually represent the company uh in kind of sales deals for example that's it yeah and just similarly even benefits could be memberships right like you can get all these various perks even if you're employed in a different form or just directly unchained and exactly right exactly right mike do you can you think of anything else that we can use anymore well quite a few actually um you know i love what uh what you said julian about this idea of moving beyond this geomorphic you know phase of crypto where we try just to mimic what is existing in tradify um we have seen that you know with every major transformational technology where people just try to replicate the existing world into the new technology standard but i'm extremely excited to see um you know what can be done natively on web3 right so there are some properties of the chain that are really really powerful like transparency a custody self-custody uh but also the kind of permanence or immutability and the fact that is you know normally good chains should be uptime 100 so it never goes down right and in this environment you can see how most of our operations that generate friction in the world we're living in can be deferred to the chain and in that case they're not they're not only automated but they're also taken care of independently from what the community or the organization or the company does so you know you can envision services that are fully automated with very little friction or overhead that can provide outstanding you know value to the consumer or other businesses out there that's what i'm extremely excited personally but of course you know looking at the world with a superfluid angle i'm really excited about this idea of interconnecting economical players such that we remove this kind of delays that are really generating a lot of cost and friction for the world right so if you're thinking about this idea of like payment failures or delays in payments in general like the world used around checks being sent out by mail right now we have credit cards we have a lot better infrastructure in the tradify world but what if you could just like have a situation where a company can get all the value uh it generates from revenues in real time from their consumers or their you know clients in a way and then redirect that to the suppliers almost as it comes in so in that case what happens is you can really reduce the amount of capital that you need in your own account say to then manage these delays to make sure you have the buffer to manage the cash flow and that means that if you take the world economy and then you kind of reduce the buffer or the capital the working capital needed to just make the company work across the board can imagine how much capital we can free up and put at work building better technologies for addressing things like climate change or you know those major problems we might just facing today so that's what makes me tick with this idea of web3 right you know you can have someone paying a membership through unlock that goes to a business that operates uh you know maybe in a super great fashion so with superfluit streams in real time and that value goes directly to someone working for that business that then is a collaborator that has been invoicing by a request network or you know using the management payroll from from the county shift world and try to connect the dot such that the person has that money ready to invest in real time through say ricochet exchange and that goes back into some sort of investment world eventually or some lp position that then fuels the next company that's gonna innovate you know and then and then this cycle continues over and over so this idea that you can basically inflate the economic value of a state or or an economy without adding more capital to the mix just using the existing capital in a more efficient way really makes me excited oh no that's amazing and i was gonna just open this up for everybody else like there's clearly a lot of ways to do this thing in real time with just not just streaming payments super fluid altogether like how do you cannot see this changes what you're doing at your core yeah so i think like uh specifically what we're trying to build is like you know the the first layer is like co treasury layer one kind of system right right now the trees infrastructure is does not even exist uh we we have like we're calling like you know multisig wallet as a treasury sort of infrastructure right or so that infrastructure layer needs to exist and then basically how we see this is like all the any kind of any kind of you know core primitives to those strategy layer can be automated uh and then it can be run like you know real time so payroll is one aspect but we were very interested in things like where you know our employees are sort of you know getting the money and then they're just doing like a dca on on ricochet right and then it is already we are already doing that right so it is not like these are assumptions people really want to do something like that and that is something like you know we want to bring more these kind of perimeters which can literally automate the entire workflows in a very crypto native way and super fluid just you know uh do that like out of the box and and only like you know what i would love to add on top of it is like the entire experience of you know interacting with the current system is not that great right now and and we just want to make it like really really seamless so that from even you know the dow and min side or the delegate side it should be super seamless to manage the flow rate editing the flow rate or they can just come for the right operation otherwise as you know mike was saying like they shouldn't be worried about like any other thing right for the the the payment will flow themselves so this is this is definitely we are looking and then on the asset management aspect as well uh we want to move forward on to that as well where you have certain kind of vaults where you know one wallet is sort of generating certain yield and that yield is redirected to the payroll wall directly right so you and and it is like you know harvesting directly and when you are paying from that vault like you don't need to worry about like i try to come back and do all those things right it is like directly flowing so all your treasury operations are automated so just an idea actually we did not speak about it but i think there's no use case about paying a rent in streaming or maybe michelle you're aware of that because actually that would really make sense you get your salary in a stream way and you pay your rent in a stream way that would be fun michael are you aware of such a project yeah there's there's been a few um and someone's doing it more like from a hackathon point of view and others are doing it more like a business so what's interesting about it is that we we managed to stream to nft so that if the nft changes hands the stream redirects automatically so if the nft say is your house or is a parcel of land into central land and you're renting it out to someone the moment you sell that to someone else the rent redirects automatically without you having to you know ask someone to send a stream to someone else and redirect the stream manually which is part of that automation we're discussing before where you're basically you're just delegating to the chain all the kind of business operations to some degree so yeah that is one of the key use cases for sure and i'm really looking forward to seeing something like that happening for example in the b2c market as well like for example i don't know if unlock has looked into this as well to like have memberships like on streams um i think we were talking about it and you and francesco were talking about it as well but that would be amazing to see and yeah i'm just looking i think there's an ongoing project of interviewing both uh where basically you're right like the as long as you pay you've got the membership and the minute the stream ends the membership expires basically which i think is a very very brilliant integration um i want to jump on that actually because uh one point that i think taran made earlier is like one of the core ideas of web and blockchain is the composite the web3 and blockchain is composability that these things could all work together kind of lego bricks versus kind of the platform monolithic approach was like okay it's you go rely on this thing for everything in your business um i think businesses have realized like on when it comes to kind of digital at this point they're very very reliant on a very small number of actors like if you sell goods online well you know what your ads are all driven by google on facebook and then your shipping might actually powered by by amazon and these things are scary when it comes to doing businesses like you really don't want to have this much reliance on a small number of actors and one of the opportunities of web3 in many ways is to actually say no no you don't have to rely on on platforms like this you can be using open protocol uh like i mean um superfluid is a good example of this um and what's i think even beyond that is like normally you can use these open protocols that would not be kind of rugged uh under your feet uh if things change but also you can collectively manage them and co-own them and which is kind of also kind of a very novel aspect like i i know a lot of businesses that are you know selling things through amazon or through facebook really want to have a say on the product world map of these companies and say no no you facebook this new kind of way you approach pages is not the right way we're going to we're going to struggle with this at this point this is very much kind of a impossible like basically every business that relies on these platforms at the mercy of these platforms but with web3 and protocols not only they're using open things decentralized things that you know are immutable or at least have a clear mutability path but also they could collectively own them which i think is even one step beyond and one step further absolutely i was going to say we're getting a couple comments and questions from the audience too so if you have any other questions for a speaker please just type them in the chat and we'll uh we'll be able to ask them here no it's a really really good point too because um i feel like in addition to seeing in a way the basic building blocks being offered on chain like you're essentially what you're doing is you're you get to play with the granularity right like if i want to send a wire or some deposit is usually a minimum required uh when you do paychecks they do every two weeks or every month and you kind of now have a per second if not even less than that as a time interval and you get to do a lot more creative things when you can actually do this thing by milliseconds or seconds or just any denomination that's as granular and we've already kind of with blockchains we already kind of got to the point where you can now send money up to like a billionth of a dollar if not longer or more um and uh that becomes more creative because now you have more service here to kind of do interesting things and yeah like it will be amazing if your salaries stream by by the second and same thing for a membership if i have to commit to an annual membership for x dollars and i decided to stop it three days in or 99 days in um you can prorate that and and those are just not easy to do in reconciliation in traditional sas or any other model and i think superflow just makes that world amazing and beyond that you can even automate what happens i mean the thing that i love about square feet is that you know it's like because i mean says businesses you know uh expiring cards is a nightmare for them it's like oh these guys experience you now spend like an hour on the phone to try to get them to update because they forget about it and at the same time the fact that they forgot about it is kind of a cool thing because they paid without reach worry too much but now that they're going to remind them that we exist are they going to stop paying and so i know there's a ton of businesses for which kind of it's a challenge but the fact that you can automate all of these things on training actually don't waste a dollar trying to call back a customer it's like hey you stop paying this is going to stop you know working for you is a massive massive opportunity absolutely and uh and one thing that kind of just stood out to me with what you said mike before is uh like one like first of all there's way more room to explore what new web 3 kind of building blocks are here for running in operations on chain but like even if you assume that there's nothing new to be invented which is definitely not the case there is still a massive opportunity to increase kind of anything from what you can capture in values use the value you can generate for just existing building blocks and kind of one obvious example which comes from a comment from uh from the chat is the fact that all these things are composable interconnected and inspectable on chain you have so many new benefits that you don't get in the real world now i can basically design let's say a tax management system that just understands everything that's going on it can fully make sense of everything without me having to connect something or having a custom integration and you simply just get to expand the size of what you can achieve or how you can actually use that information for better decision making or just better efficiency and we haven't even seen that world yet and that's just uh even if you invent nothing new from iran you can still have a massive improvement uh in existing processes and i think that to me is like the probably the most exciting part especially as we do a lot of logistics here on our end this is why would you not want that um and uh there's like 50 more things you can do on that one yeah i don't think i don't think accountants will like me or at least what i have to say now but the fact that you can if you if you were to have visibility on the revenue streams of a business um or even a consumer that means you can pay tax in real time and that the amount you are going to pay tax is very transparent so i can imagine how governments would love the opportunity to charge taxes in real time for example on a stream so that part of your business operations are transferring directly into the government with a downside of them to have to be transparent as well in a way right so that makes it fairer for everybody now there's no real cheating but then all the information is available and i guess the public can make better decisions because of the visibility they get so i mean we can bring this to the kind of extreme but we don't have to the point is there is efficiency everywhere you look um when you're using this type of infrastructure and i think web 3 is just a matter of time it's going to it's going to just unlock it over time yeah the way i see it is uh it's super promising but i uh basically it's difficult to imagine that the authorities are gonna set up this uh streaming tax system but uh i'd see first uh some kind of solidarity tax system that would happen like at a more or less global level just for certain causes that we could do on some transactions and uh voluntarily and this is something that could happen tomorrow morning yep yeah so i mean since we've opened attacking on accountants um they'll uh i mean one piece here is that like there are so many things that exist just because there's a lack of transparency right um the fact that i can generate a anywhere from code to manage the most amount of cases whether they're educated just common conditions to have a consistent system that just works across anywhere from jurisdictions to to standards like you will effectively can um get to a point where these things are generated on their own and forget like even if you don't get to the point where you're paying real time tax uh i can i can foresee some some friction on that one uh from some government sides but uh the fact that you can still generate what it is um automatically even if it's real-time or even if it's static is still a massive improvement that just is a painful process for every single company here once a year you got to figure out what transactions are happening on chain what are interconnected sort of swaps in there you can fix this and uh and sort of enable a whole new frictionless sort of more granular world so i think that's uh to me already an improvement from this world yeah definitely and the the the reason why accountants are actually preparing books the reason why bookkeeping exists is so that we pay taxes so basically you know what i mean accountants would not exist anymore with that kind of job but would do some things which are probably a little bit more interesting oh you're right this is interestingly a perfect example of uh cutting out the middleman um yeah we've seen the financial for existing systems we've seen that on payment side and now there is like the the processing piece that is still incumbent um i know we're kind of getting uh close to our time on the panel so maybe uh one thing that i think will be interesting uh to end on would be uh kind of seeing what you're excited about like obviously all of you are working on open platforms um and if you kind of can have anywhere from requests to ideas for people to kind of build on top of like what do you think is like top of that list and what would you like to see more creative exploration on um i'll kind of maybe start with julian because i think you have a lot of ideas on how memberships can actually be integrated yeah so i mean it's it's going to be a segway from from what we discussed but i think uh you mentioned a couple minutes ago uh stablecoins had been one of major innovation i think we're now at a point where we have all of these evm chains and i think we're all uh building on these um i know the bridge topic is a contentious one but i think it's also very very hard for end users and businesses to at some point manage you know five six seven eight balances of tokens across different chains and so thinking about a world that would be abstracting away some of the complexity of being on multiple evm chains where as a user i pay i start a stream from one chain and i know the stream is going to go through a bridge onto something else wherever that something else is is something that i'm really really excited to see i know there's a ton of teams that are working on this but for me that's the next big unlock haha uh in the uh in the ecosystem it's like how can we actually work how can our our protocol abstracted with the complexity of a multi-chain world um and and i i think it's going to be through um you know portable specific bridges rather than kind of agnostic bridges um and and hopefully we'll see that uh happening in the next few months and so if you guys are working anything fun uh on that front please reach out to us we'd love to hear about this amazing attorney dave anything on ad i think 100 aligned with like julian we just feel like a lot of you know our customer base is just setting up accounts on different chains for specific reasons maybe they are moving their protocol there they have a lot of treasury assets there right and the most friction is like the card between multisec like they can't between the money between multisects in a very seamless way right it's very painful so we are also sort of looking for these kind of solutions which can work out of the box and i think uh like protocol based sort of you know right efficient sort of bridges will make a lot of sense for us and you know front end legs are like can can integrate in a very seamless so i'm pretty excited on that but one other thing i'm pretty excited is definitely on the layer two of specifically on ethereum because previously like you know uh we all know like you know other than the theorem it was very difficult to really trust any other sort of chain where where you can just park some funds right with the security of ethereum so i think the the major defy is growing in the layer twos and that is something like you know we are very very excited about to grow maybe we will build a protocol specifically on layer 2 right and just like you know superfluous did that so so it is it is really really you know appealing to us very excited no absolutely um christopher i'll let you go next and then yeah just in a few words basically there are many innovative solutions many opportunities of thing that we can integrate and there are many others that we could create and that we don't have yet but if um if we can have a next step where the next tools and the net next apps that we build are actually about uh execution making them happen so for example build on top of super fleet build on top of the great projects which already exist and make them happen and help the web 2 economy to convert to web 3 that would be really nice and and further innovation can happen a little bit later that would be fine yeah you're right i think uh like there's a there's a we've kind of essentially been talking about just how do we exist and just do everything in web3 site but there's a clear argument that's a much bigger world that we need to move to web3 to be able to do these things efficiently on chain with the new features um and it's a really good point that was that was missed and uh when i'm just kind of processing what julian and insurance said uh uh you're effectively talking about having different currency bank accounts which is still a problem in the real world side uh even if it's the same asset existing on a different chain behaves like a secondary account in a different currency and you have different properties there that you have to deal with and i don't think you saw that at all in the web 2 world uh we're in the banking world so i i actually am personally excited for that to just be solved where we just have a all-in-all solution that just doesn't let us spend any mental brainpower on thinking about where it's coming from uh we'll end with mike uh i'll let you uh kind of share your thoughts there too yeah i was just wanted to say that what you just said is something that tarrou is addressing with this ability to manage multiple safe and also multiple networks with their new v2 so that's very exciting and we want to try to use it as well see how it was um for me i'm really excited about you know all the building blocks needed to power a real a web free native economy coming together so you have seen you know invoicing treasury management membership management subscription management i think you know we just missed some of the understanding of how to manage crypto and putting some oil on the wheels to make sure that the mechanics are fine so we don't have to go crazy chasing you know c-level executives of a project to sign a multi-sig transaction every other day just to pay someone because they made a bounty and they deserve to be paid in time right so these bits and pieces are coming along um and you know even some of the backend infrastructure now needs to have high slas right and when the service level agreement reaches enterprise grade um and there is no friction anymore then we will reduce so much inefficiency that will unlock a lot of time for everybody more specifically i'm excited about how you know real-time value transfer would play on top of that once that's ready because with automation um you know assuming that all the friction is removed by the chains and by the tools that we're building then kind of real-time finance would hypercharge all of that so i'm very much looking forward to seeing like how this could uh could unfold over time with a real-time hardness body transfer this year no problem at all it's like i am uh myself on one of the live streams okay um no i mean that makes a little sense and if anything i think superfluous reduces that friction with you know having a more optimistic once we go ahead with that and if something is not right you get to sort of put a pause on that um instead of taking anywhere from the full penalty to going through the decision if it needs to be uh to be reversed or stopped um so hopefully that was super informative for everybody else on on the audience side and if anything were i'm just gotten more excited by running a whole company without having a legal entity and i can't wait for more building blocks too to exist so we can really think about that world just being our default so uh thanks again everybody and uh looking forward to in future events too thanks everyone bye thank you amazing all right we are ready for our next talk so you can get a preview of all the building blocks that we think are are needed or we need to in a way perfect but uh that doesn't leave still a lot of room open for what we think we can do with the world of streaming money so without further ado i'd like to welcome meow what's going to talk about what is upcoming in the superfluid protocol so welcome to uh stage and uh feel free to get started whenever you're ready yeah thank you kartik um now to start and show the screen yeah thanks everyone to join our first superfluid reactor summit so uh i'm meow um on my github it's uh hellwolf and uh i'm cto and co-founder of uh super protocol super fully financed uh so today i'm going to talk about what's next to the super fluid protocol right so maybe let's first look at the super floating railway mirror so how it was started so exactly 440 days ago probably 441 now after a few hours um we deployed to polygon um that was a transaction and then we had two packages for builders to start with and deployed then also to xdi uh both of network i changed the name if you if you remember it was called matic and uh now it's called polygon and it was extine now it's called a gnosis chain right so that's how we got started so how is it today let's look uh now we have a vibrant development activities in the mono ripple so we have a lot of forks on 27 and we have a lot of stars and we have quite consistent commits to our uh dev branch so and uh our smart contracts projects also evolving so we have we have just added the access control list to our cfa constant flow agreement and we also switched to hard hat for functional testing uh we also integrated with foundry for additional fuzzing testing uh we recently actually yesterday also introduced hot fast a new product a new test framework for super fluid applications that means your super apps also so you can now use something called hot files which uses echidna from trail bits for even more sophisticated uh uh fuzzing testing right so uh now we have more than two packages we have uh new and better packages right js's case being deprecated we should really switch to sdk core and we have also a redux flavor of the sdk um we now put all the network support on subgraph we have a quite good uh support out there and uh hot files recently and we also have some something called a spec haskell i'll talk about that later and now we have also more much more many many more examples right so there is even an archive folder now because there's just too many uh which is good there are more um so if you haven't visited our dogs go dogs.spookfully.finance you'll see the protocol overview uh developer section things about sentinel and all the peripheral resources you could find and we also have continued contributions from our community right so here are the badges for our contributors some of them actually join you in our team full-time we're always committed to contributing back to the community right so we have pull requests to the truffles suit for example we have pull requests to the truffle plugin verify we have issue reports and technical feedback to the graph and uh we have also pulled requests to uh clean up for example uh many many more actually and uh we adhere to the open collaboration and free and open source philosophy so that's our part of our way of working as a result we have continued the usage from builders so now if according to github we have almost 300 repository depending on our ethereum contracts projects and uh there's also continued download from our npm of our npm packages from npm.js and also we are live on many more chains now right so we just recently launched on avalanche a while ago we also launched on layer 2's arbitrary optimism morticon um also we have a cumulative flows going up so that's so far a figure that i can share so what's coming next to superfluid uh more networks of course so uh but first in order to do that we're gonna enable uh minimum deposit so that's only for networks with high fees we're talking about things like ethereum a net and some of the layer twos also have uh relatively high fees comparing to polygon and gnosis chain for example uh we're trying to make it more profitable for sentinel out closing the micro streams meaning that those streamers have really really small value and deposit and with minimum deposit that will make it a slight more profitable um we're also targeting for more community engagement so we have now a framework deployment guide updated many times and each time we go to new network it's always our community member deploy to the new network we also make i have made the deployment of erc20 wrapper easy most for most of the network you just need to go to one of the ether scan like scanner and click a few button then there is a yasi 20 wrapper of super token um we're going to create more we're going to do more work on the custom super token templates uh for the for you to create your own pure super tokens and uh if you need the more custom features you should also look into it and i will do more work on that to make your custom super token creation process more smooth and sleek um we're going to also support token lists standard one of the frequently asked questions how can i know how can we know um uh the list of super tokens that i use so we're gonna work on a bit more making that available on the token lists [Music] um the next big thing for us is to do some formalizations so there will be a yellow paper um so we'll be citing existing papers right so things like existing eips things like existing research on the theory of money and payment system and they will keep a fairly high standard of intellectual honesty so we'll be reusing existing terminologies trying to generalize existing framework if possible not just flag just for the sake of it right it's not about your idea or versus my idea right and as a highlighter original but at the same time won't also want to highlight the original idea and contribution from superfluid money in the process so the yellow people also use a technique called embedding the specification where it will be written in literal literate high school this is one example they're defining something called a decaying flow agreement and the benefit of doing so is that we have well-defined terminologies which basically equivalent of saying we are defined types and we also define some of the language in a more rigor definitions which is also equivalent to say have testable properties the idea of super superfluid protocol we actually become a pascal program even right so the whole process will make it a sound platform for research topics so what are the research topics so we will be experimenting a bit more exotic agreements things like uh decaying flow uh general distribution step flow this kind of thing uh we'll also explore it a bit more regarding different uh solvency models um currently our system is uh so-called uh using so-called buffer-based associate uh you might be familiar with uh the concept of buffer if you have programmed on our vertical but there are other techniques such as syncing the time as opposed to using buffer etc so many units models can be also a topic to be explored we're all familiar with the current token model uh that's quite widely used on evm in fact a defector one um there might be also a chance for we to make a utxo model right so that's our research topic and composibility models right so we use we use extensively callbacks to implement super apps but the other technique to do composibility perhaps using state syncing as opposed to synchronous callbacks right all those can be uh good research topics so we also so the work done in the in the formalization will provide a very solid reference for additional superfluid mining implementations but what it can be evm superfluid v2 a non-evm system or superfluid enabled blockchain itself right so these are the open question um so additionally we're also gonna develop a protocol validator so it will become a simulation environment for new ideas and concepts and with that it can also provide a very good functional specification testing tool for your implementations right so you can visualize the account account balances during the test during a test case for example um but at the same time we also need to do some deep refactoring of our existing evm implementation we'll deliver the functional style agreement refactoring so split to the pure code from the side effects side effects we're talking about things like reading protocol parameters from governance evm storage operations callbacks to super apps this kind of thing um in doing so to make it also easier for formal verifications of each component especially each agreement and it will make ways for more feature development right so um another thing we will be doing is called a token centric interface we're phasing out the usage of a core agreement you might be familiar with if you have done some development on superfluid so that means you'll be using more idiomatic token dot kind of interface right so for example it'll be token.createflow will be token.updateflow token.deleteflow and the ida the instant distribution framework you might be familiar with will become a multi-purpose index right so you'll be using token.createindex instead as a subscriber to the index you do like token.subscribe to index talking about approve index and uh you might be familiar with the idea that it does distribution instantly right so it then become token.distribute to index what about something called token dot update distribution flow rate of index right very wordy mouthful but it's something called gda i will introduce shortly and uh something about uh decaying flow agreement right token.update decaying flow rate of index right so i think that's really become a multipurpose uh instrument for publisher to chan influence balances of all its subscribers providing more design surface for your superfluid applications so all we are doing here is trying to complete the jigsaw a jigsaw puzzle so that's so called uh super fluid payment modalities matrix what does this mean so uh payment before super fluid money well there's only one that's one to one an instant for example erc training everyone familiar with right so sending from our account to the other instantly payment with super fluid money right so we have a matrix here so we have one two one and we're going to n from one dimension uh from the other dimension we have instant versus streaming so one-to-one instant uh we have also a name now called a transferable balance agreement um one-to-one streaming that's basically constant flow agreement or the decaying flow agreement one to an instant that would be the idea so it will be gda with instant distribution aka ida we are familiar with and uh want to end streaming that would be gda with constant or decaying flow but it's not there yet but it will be there at some point so so-called gda is general distribution agreement it is a multi-purpose index with instant distribution with constant flow with the game flow or something else so beyond the corporate code was there's also many things ongoing one of the objects one of the uh the goal is to make the sentinel more profitable right so we'll make the sentinel more that more than just for solvency production from hostile actors add some civilian services to the sentinels so for example uh closing stream for you by uh end late i mentioned that we have a feature now called the uh access control list so basically you allow a third party uh to close a stream for you or even update streams uh how about wrap up more underlying token for you when your balance is running low right so these are the civilian service we can add to sentinel in a decentralized manner also we want to add more power to our subgraph uh implementation to the protocol so the problem we try uh we're facing at the moment is that super fluid distribution index is too powerful because index can change balances of all subscribers a subgraph indexer unfortunately cannot scale as much as it's current uh in its current architecture so we're working with the graph team to find a solution to tangent uh we're also adding more features to the sdks right that's that means the sdk call the sdk redux so i would uh call for everyone to be part of it um so you know to join this uh journey we have a bi-weekly protocol public forum uh it's everywhere um it's on wednesday 2 30 gmt if you join if you're interested join our discord and ask for invitations and also check out our bounties on moonrepo there's a tag called bounty also can check out our bug bounty for smart contracts on unified shout out to them and if you want to join us full time there's also jobs available on jobs.superfluit.finance so well that's it uh thank you and uh the slide source code you can also find from our wiki page so that's it thank you amazing well thank you so much for kind of going through basically the i think uh early look in that romance road map of how we think uh money will change um maybe just a couple of questions i have on uh sort of how you're kind of thinking about this thing and also what at the learning span over the last 40 days um my kind of first one is like have you like how do you kind of decide to focus on a new uh chain like is that just like we we can just deploy the same code there or do you think you see like a different demand coming in from those users and that have different needs on different kind of destinations like what kind of goes on and what are some like observations that you've had from uh using different chains yeah so currently we are uh we don't have evm implementation right sir and we don't necessarily decide uh it's uh uh we will call for deployment and we'll wait for it for the committee member deploy first so it's more of a community driven at the moment for evms and their own evm is more more of a research side so it's uh it's not nowhere near the deployment okay awesome well um that clarifies the question i was going to ask but i think one question from the audience is uh yeah if you can send us a link to the slides we'll share that with the chat and everybody there and then we'll also uh kind of explore that put that on our discord for anybody who's hacking and we'll see that same thing so uh thank you so much and i really appreciate you uh giving us hair lulucon next version release of superfluid thank you and with that we are ready for our next talk and i'd like to bring on mike back on stage and give us an overview and some of his thoughts on the interconnected weapon economy we've already kind of gotten some sneak peeks around what we think is that world and how we think it's going to evolve so uh i'd like to uh ask him to turn on the video and say hi and uh kick us off with this talk welcome hey hi kartik again so um yeah i'd like to talk about this idea of the interconnected web free economy let me just try to share my screen and if anyone can let me know if you guys can see anything everything is good i'm just trying to put it full screen what do you see yep brilliant so yeah i'd like to talk about the idea of having an interconnected web 3 economy is not something that we hear every day in crypto um so it's a little bit tricky to try to explain it so i'll try to explain it by telling how inefficient our current kind of financial system is so i'm sure that everyone here relates to this idea or this feeling of having to queue at an atm just to take some cash out to make a payment when you maybe are in a hurry or you want to grab something quick at the store so um you know this is one of the best ways to understand how inefficient our financial system is and was of course you also had issues where maybe you were ordering a delivery or some sort of food online and you got a kind of failed transaction and sometimes it's because of course you didn't have enough funds on your card but sometimes it's for other reasons and so this is a very frustrating experience other times you are maybe someone who is like working in uh the web free economy and you know you are just like a freelancer or contributor and you're just waiting to get paid maybe as a ux ui designer for some design you have done and it's just a business that pays you late because for example there is an internal process which is to happen for clearance or just even to understand your details or you know your bank account details to send the money to you so there are a lot of inefficiencies in kind of the fiat um in financial system that we can experience every day even though we have been innovating so hard around money so for example you know the world has changed a lot from sending checks over email to being able to put your credit card details into a website and have a subscription chart to your account every every month or so so even for like this world that we have innovated so so far so that is somewhat seamless and abstracted even in that kind of subscription model there are a lot of inefficiencies um both for the consumer or the one who is actually paying that has to for example input the data and then making sure the card is not expired and if it's expired to renew it but also for the merchant um so if you are like a sas company that has hundreds or thousands or or even millions of users even just a small percentage of these payments failing is a massive headache for you so to put some numbers to this um let's just look at a report by delight that was published in july 2019 called economic impact of real-time payments so all the businesses interviewed for this report um you know 31 of them say that their business would be willing to pay some type of fee to ensure they receive all payments immediately so it is a massive uh interest from from this kind of inter instant payment let's say but also if we look a little bit deeper into the report we see that you know the slow speed of payments um is somewhat holding up capital in the system so there is a lot of inefficiency in having to deal with delays when it comes to payment processing it's not only just on the operational side but it's also on kind of the social side so you know real-time payments would make financial services more accessible and attractive to consumers and also they put potentially help consumers budgeting because the less delays the less variability the less variability the more certainty and enhanced it's easier to plan around your personal finances so all of these are real real problems for both the consumers and the business world but you know have we innovated around this have we tried to make payments instant from a fiat traditional financial system point of view yes we did and of course in some countries we have seen an uptake of instant payments for example in korea and the united kingdom and another is a little bit less so looking at this chart you can see for example the uptake of uh instant payments let's just call them instant because real time doesn't really fit what these are so here you can see how korea for example have really started to use mobile wallets or even you know fast payments that are bank bank transactions that are instant so that your money gets to your wallet as it's sent so there is no time delay between when someone presses send and when you receive it or just a few seconds so there is no you know days or hours of delay so we have done something but is not probably enough and this is still very nascent it's a new industry the instant payment industry is like not then been there for over like 20 or 30 years so if we if we try to look at how much our society has evolved over the last say 10 years and we look at how the payments have evolved we see a little bit of a lag let me try to give you an example here so imagine that you know you are in your 20s and you want to watch a movie on a saturday night how the old world worked is that you had to go to a shop and try to rent a dvd for example if you didn't have that movie at home and you know everyone here that is you know 25 or 30 and above knows blockbuster and you know you really had to go to the shop so you have to go get it then maybe you wanted to see say matrix and matrix maybe there were five copies available and they were all five out and you have to change movies so you have to browse you know the whole shop to find another movie to watch they also have a limited catalog so you can't see every movie you want you kind of have to choose the ones that are there and it's kind of high effort for both you and for the ones that have to you know refill all the shelves and manage all this kind of physical goods movement around now of course you know that netflix have been tackling this issue and so they had this beautiful paper catalogs or you know web catalogs that you could choose a movie from and then order it and then it would come to your home as a dvd so this is a massive improvement because a you have a massive catalog now you can really choose every movie you want is lower effort because it comes to you but there is still a downside which is it's somewhat delayed it doesn't come to you instantly so we all know that netflix have evolved into a kind of web online streaming platform and so today what we can do is that you know we can see the movie we want across all the catalog in the world instantly here and now as we want it from our couch so it's a massive change in society in terms of service provision it's a lot more comfortable there is a lot less effort and so we have been seeing this massive transition from something that was a very high effort and very limited and very expensive to something that is very easy to consume and where we want it when we want it and what we want as well and this kind of where we want what we want when we want has been somewhat characterizing the latest generations that have grown up in this world where we can just decide what movie to watch in a second and then have it delivered to us immediately the same concept of say amazon prime next day delivery what you want where you want when you want and the issue is that this new generation has to deal with a payment infrastructure that is nowhere near these expectations so let's look at how for example a sas payment looks like so we believe digital money is somewhat broken because we ported this outdated financial system to the digital internet native economy we're experiencing every day so let's look at how kind of a software payment looks like normally in the sas economy you normally start signing up for a business in one moment let's say now and let's assume this person stops using that um service in a year time so there are two actions from the user here they kind of sign up and kind of log out or sign off so they don't want the payment anymore right so the system anymore so it's one year and it's just two interactions the start and and the end um however if you look at how our payments world work today especially with online credit card subscriptions this requires 12 interactions between some of the service provider systems and the kind of consumer systems in this case and all these interactions take time effort cost and can fail so across all this period of one year where you know the user has been using the service a lot of items can actually go wrong so what happens here is that you know maybe one of these payments is failing and normally what would happen is that someone will chase you up maybe tell you to update the credit card details that the one maybe was expired and you have just to put a new one in and so there is a cycle that starts that you know might just take some effort and cost from both sides because on one side they have to chase you up and on the other side you have to update the data but normally is resolved say so you know your page is a little bit delayed the system doesn't stop the service is available to you and everything is fine with the issue that there was some cost in the process that was additional to what would have would have been needed if the system didn't break down and the payment didn't fail however in a big amount of these situations over 10 what happens is that the failure of the payment discourages the user to continue using the service so this actually was a user that was willing to continue paying and suddenly uh you know is not a user anymore and so you know how big is this problem like in the sas industry alone uh well it looks like 11 um of failed payments turned into churn this is uh according to a report by forrester in november 2020. so it is a big value and if you consider scaling this across a large organization and netflix i can imagine that it generates quite a lot of cost so um you know let's look a little bit deeper into what this kind of payment failure means for the user for example so you know there is a decrease in customer satisfaction clearly there is an increase in cost of recovery because they have to recover the funds sometimes the user maybe didn't pay but then never pays and this generates some debt so you know failed payments can turn into bad dap that is really hard to collect because it's really hard for a company to chase you for you know 11.50 that you have to pay to them but if you scale the amount of users that have to pay that amount that never do it can create a bit of a revenue issue for the sas provider so it is actually a big problem so we believe that services should as services flow in real time from provider to client payments should work in the same way so we don't have we we don't have to have so many more interactions uh from you know that from both parties to make this agreement work so uh we believe in a better way and so we're trying to dissect how that could look like for especially this kind of sas industry so let's think about what i was the example i was doing before where someone signs up today and then stops using the service after one year with this kind of 12 payments one per month in between so what would be the kind of ultimate solution to this problem well ideally the minimal effort solution would be that there are two interactions here when i sign up and when i stop paying and so it would be ideal to have this interaction when i start this is i start subscribing to a service i basically start potentially paying and then when i stop i stop paying this is the most ideal situation because we are coupling the action of turning on and off the service provision with the payment the issue is that if we do this with a traditional system you would either have to pay everything up front and that is unfair to the client most of the time especially in a consumer market or you have to pay everything at the end with a very high risk from the provider of the service so this doesn't really work and that's one of the reasons why we have subscriptions on a monthly basis because they make it easier for both sides to at least manage their revenues and cash flow but there is a better way so imagine if we could start signing up for a service and start the payment at the same time and then pay along the way and then stop paying at the end so imagine just the ability of sending a small fraction of a dollar or a penny every second or in real time from one side to the other as the service is provided to the client the payment goes back to the supplier so that is a very powerful idea and um you know it can really unlock a lot of value in our economy because it removes all this friction with this 12 payments or even more if you're signing up for like say 10 years or five years or if it's rent going to your landlord so we call this payment streaming is this idea that you can send value over time in a frictionless fashion on chain between parties and i just want to kind of try to expand more on what does it look like when multiple parties are trying to start this kind of payment among each other so um just for those that don't know the kind of value provision of streaming or what they bring to the kind of in terms of features let me just detail them for you in a second so why streaming why would you want to send money over time a fraction of a penny per second well first of all you have this kind of constant flow so both parties know the payment is ongoing and every second money is moving along the way so it's fair for both because nobody has to pay up front or at the end but you have an atomic swap between service provision and value payment also you don't have to lock any capital because your capital is only used and then moves across to the other side in real time so either you have it or the other person has it which means both sides can put that capital at work while it's not moving and that transaction is really instant so it's really powerful for per capita efficiency also these streams are interconnected so if you pay someone in a stream that other person can forward that on to whatever the person wants to so they can direct say 20 of the stream to some savings account pay their rent pay some of their expenses or bring it into d5 so you can create concatenated streams in an interconnected economy also you can have open-ended streams that don't have an end date so if you have an ongoing service but you don't know when you're going to stop using it you don't have to know in advance or set in advance and end the date so it can be an ongoing payment rather than a finite payment and also there is no gas fees on the chain for as long as the stream is running so you do pay gas to open a stream edit it or close it but you would never need to pay gas for the status quo or keeping the flow running and this is a very powerful you know economic structure so that you can actually move any amount of money between two points without paying any fees for the ongoing flow of money and all of this comes with a simple token wrapping so you know to add all these features to any erc20 token all you have to do is just wrap it with a superfluid wrapper so that's why streaming is so powerful because it has the ability of leveraging all these features together so what would this look like you know among multiple parties so as you can see here i just tried to map blocks as entities or consumers or businesses and the green lines would look like streams and that's kind of the value flowing between them so imagine how efficient it would be if a business could receive all the revenues in a stream and have them say immediately available on a per second basis and then use all of these revenues to then pay their suppliers and making sure that they you know they can pay in real time so this quantomatic business could have all of the revenues in a stream or a big chunk of them and then all of their expenses so imagine they're almost equal because they're growing aggressively but without basically borrowing any capital then you could create a company or an organization which really works on a very thin buffer they don't have to have a lot of capital in-house to absorb the shocks of you know normal traditional cash flows of course they will need some buffer to potentially manage streams changes if someone stops paying then the stream will stop and so they need to absorb that and they can't just pay out directly but is greatly reduced and so it would be very efficient for an economy to run in this fashion but it's not just about you know business to business trade or service provision it can also be for something like investing in real time or exchanging so let's add in here an exchange now you're sending a currency and you are receiving the other currency in real time what this allows you to do as a business is if you have revenues in say dollars or the dollar equivalent in crypto that means that you can pay your suppliers in a different currency and get the real-time market exchange rate at all time so you don't have to bet on it you can if you want to but you didn't have to so now you can see how this can expand even further so imagine a closed loop now where you know someone is an employee in a company and gets paid in a stream goes out there in the world and um you know pays a subscription to some service like missouri for informing himself about crypto and then someone at massery is an employee as well and or a contributor and gets paid in a stream as well so what you can do here is you can do some sort of closed loops where the money flows really across the different players and doesn't really sit anywhere but it is really just efficiently flowing across the economy if you were to expand this even further you would have effectively an interconnected web 3 economy where value could throw frictionless with no delays across the different players and have an allocation to something that is valuable or meaningful at any time so that you can direct capital to what is meaningful for the economy or what is convenient for the economy so is is this kind of idea of having an interconnected network where financial players and economic player can interact one another without intermediaries really and with instant or real-time payments and the ability to um have this flowing across them without any use or delays that could create inefficiencies so you you might look at this picture and say wow this is very interesting but you know it's topic or is far in the future and uh you know we didn't see this yet so what i'd like to share with you now is um a 3d visualization of just uh 300 wallets that are streaming stable coins on polygon and they are doing so in real time over superfluid protocol so what you're seeing here in this visualization is polygon network on a stable coin and you can see how there are economies like the one in the middle of the screen now where there are different addresses in this case interacting with streams to one another to power a micro economy i tune down the amount of addresses in this visualization to show you exactly how micro economies are working so this could be easily a super app which is doing some interesting financial transaction or just distributing tokens this one it's more like a reward dao or a reward stream where someone is rewarding a lot of contributors a small amount of you off of civil coins um over time then if we go here we see like a circular economy where players are transacting to one another in what it could even be like an endless loop so there is really a lot of opportunities um that we could build with this kind of infrastructure now let's expand to more than a thousand wallets and look at what the polygon network looks like on a stable coin as well so this is over a thousand wallets and now you start seeing how it looks like a brain structure there is a lot of interconnections among different players and you can see rather sophisticated connections like the one in the bottom center of the space of the screen now where we're going to zoom in in a second where they could really build this interconnected web free economy and value could flow in real time across all these players with no friction so if we were to do this with a hundred percent efficiency which is of course impossible to achieve um we would reach about uh infinite velocity of money streaming so that there would be an infinite infinite velocity of capital uh which would be very very effective in uh you know reducing friction and reducing cues uh in in our economy so i just wanted to kind of leave it there uh with this visualization of the polygon network because um the the possibilities are somewhat endless and i believe this concept of a frictionless interconnected economy um has all the potential um to you know transform society fundamentally because you can generate economic growth without having to inflate the pie by just reducing inefficiency in the existing gdp that a country for example is generating so thank you very much for your time today if you have any questions you can ask them now or you can find me on twitter at michele delesi or on discord.org finance and we would love to talk about what you can build with these tools like what applications we can generate and you know if anyone has any idea we would love to hear from them that was uh amazing i think the question i and everybody has on the chat is that is an incredible visualization who made this thing what did you use and how can we make it prototypes yeah so um visualization is actually done by someone in the network of francesco so i think he would be better placed to answer that and he's uh he has been hacking it away just for this presentation so we could uh yesterday night he was just doing it so that we could have it uh for today but um it's just a start you know we can do a lot more and you know we can color addresses based on what they do so if they're a dao or if they are you know an exchange uh or an end of user wallet um so you know we are just getting started that's that's amazing and and it's like overall just i think a really good way to kind of think about structuring how we think payments would work and you are gonna i think this kind of came up in our panel earlier too which is the second you kind of have anywhere from multi-chain world to multiple labs talking to each other and just overall composibility then most things turn into a routing problem and that's where most of the efficiency comes in and being able to say hey we can make this processor cut this step is an actual massive improvement and uh you're just going to get that as a default tape which is which is great um my uh kind of only other question would be uh actually let's see i feel like there's a comment coming from oh no it's just friend replying to who made that visualization on the chat this is great uh well i think the questions i want to ask will probably overlap with uh the next panel so i'm just gonna pause here and we'll just kind of go into the next one early because i was gonna curious about more real-time application examples but that's exactly what the next panel is about so i wanted to thank you for uh doing this chat and the presentation and uh i love to bring on the next set of panelists thank you kartik it was a pleasure right so as we bring on everybody here on the panel i'd like to welcome three amazing people so luka from maker and kill from circle and friend from superfluid we're gonna talk about just how we think on-chin payments is going to evolve uh make our circle at superfluid are kind of the common pieces here that everybody's using for just interacting on the chain especially as we think about stable coins being the fundamental base layer of sending money here and what defines done so i could be more excited to bring everybody on so at this point like to ask everybody to turn on their cameras and kind of introduce themselves and say hi and we can get this started so uh welcome everybody um we uh we already know who fran is um but i'd love to invite uh luka and nikhil to uh introduce themselves and talk about what you do and uh just give an overview of the product for those of us on the chat that may not be aware thanks having me guys uh luca here um so i i work with maker i am one of the core team members of maker pretty much looking at anything that has to do with the financial risk oversight of the protocol i am an independent researcher i write my own research and publish it under a sub stack called dirt roads that i hope that some of you have heard of and invest in the space and have great great chats with super smart people like frank so thanks for having me excited to have you thank you yeah thanks for having me kartik um my name is nikhil chanduk i am chief product officer at circle um what circle does is uh it makes a makes a stable coin it sort of ships the stable coin which i think everybody knows about it's usdc um uh we have products in the payment space uh that we have in market and that we are building further out uh we're excited about payments we're excited about lending so we can talk about uh anything today so uh thanks for having me we're excited to have you as well um so maybe i'll kind of just jump right in the most kind of obvious question is um you've kind of seen this ecosystem evolve from multiple angles here what's kind of been the most like interesting trend about specifically payments that each of you have seen we can start with friend here and uh have you kind of just showcased what has surprised you in the last year well i mean working at superfluit obviously i think the most interesting part of payments is streaming right uh more in general recurring payments uh the reason specifically i'm excited about recurring payments is that it can actually bring income on chain right and that's very interesting if you look at for example herbals uh presentation from uh earlier right because bringing income on chain is what will on board so many users right one of the examples he brought was gamify right so like play to earn games and these are onboarding literally millions of users and they're not coming to speculate they're coming to earn money right so the earning potential that recurring payments or streaming brings and the the fact that those earnings are on chain and can be used forever stuff i think is very interesting i think we're still just scratching the surface here i think puma finance is going to be a very important protocol in the future regarding uh lending against these earnings in terms of other payments infrastructure i've seen a lot built on superfluid i'm very excited about we've seen a diagonal finance but also another startup called the drip which are building checkouts with uh let's say specific mechanics built into the payment layer itself right and that's something that you can uniquely do uh on chain well you can't really do off chain right so if the payment happens then you know trigger something uh you can deliver a loyalty nft you can deliver a social token you can you know redirect a recurring um for example referring referral revenue right all of these things you can encode directly into the payment stream because it's happening on chain so this is kind of the the most important and uh interesting thing for me amazing uh luca any anything to add here i mean i i i started uh chatting about what the guys at super fluid were were doing almost a year ago because i think again streaming payments can be abstracted into into streaming value uh that can have so many so many um applications and i i always thought that the the way dfi or crypto in general steps up to the next level is by onboarding as many use cases as possible from the real world so i think stream allowing value to flow seamlessly through people-to-people in payments but also in supply chains i think is what fascinates me the most i i had a couple of chats with companies that are trying to innovate in a suplate supply chain system by creating a a seamless flow of value that goes along the chain and i think it's uh it which is an incredible source of inefficiency these days financially with a lot of value trapped so i'm very excited to see the evolutions in that front as well that's awesome um i think you've already gonna all touched upon topics that i want to dig into in general and uh and by the way for we're already kind of getting some comments from the audience if you have any questions for our speakers please just put them in the chat and i'll be able to ask them here but uh to me this is an interesting point because i think both maker and circle are kind of at the intersection of onboarding existing businesses that are in web 2 to more web 3 but also then enabling a whole new set of web 3 native companies and types of businesses to exist kind of from how you've seen usdc or diving used um has there been something that's kind of surprised you uh in terms of like oh i didn't think this could be possible or of course streaming is a perfect example but i'm curious like what has been an unintended consequence of a good example of how your stable coins have been utilized by people maybe uh i can i can take the crack i feel like the uh so i'll say two things one is uh we have the circle has this partnership with strike where they're doing payouts on twitter um and so the use case is uh twitter have creators that they want to pay these creators are all over the world they they want to make sure that you know they can essentially share earnings with them what's in what's an easy infrastructure to build to be able to do that well clearly using on-chain payouts is the best way to do it doing it in a stablecoin is like uh is definitely preferable so twitter likes tripod stripe and twitter are experimenting with usdc uh for these payouts why this is interesting um i worked at youtube for seven eight years i was there really early and youtube is one of the earliest companies that did creator payouts and so for those who don't know if you upload a video on youtube you get to keep and you monetize it you get to keep 55 building that infrastructure that connects like connects the ad impression the ad payout to the creator payout is extremely complex and then scaling it to the whole world is where youtube is at i think today at like two and a half billion users is incredibly complex uh so um i think to do that so simply is like fascinating to me uh because that was one of the ways we built a motor on youtube because nobody else could do it facebook didn't do it and i think they're just doing it now and so i think the power of that is pretty phenomenal i kind of love the idea of streaming payments there uh i haven't wrapped my head around like you know add verification to streaming payout uh like a payout to a creator uh i think there's some nice use cases to explore that as well so that's sort of one bucket i'd say the other bucket that is really interesting to me again is um i think there are two large ecosystems about to collide which is really interesting uh one is uh payments which is uh you know how can we make it more efficient we can have we can make things more efficient and we can unlock more use cases because we do things on chain so that's super interesting um whether it's streaming whether it's payouts like you know there's all manners of things we can do the other is like uh is the ads ecosystem and we don't talk about ads much in crypto because i think nobody likes ads but ads basically built the internet and yes along the way there were some trade-offs that were made that are not that are not pleasant and not good um and but i think the fundamental business need is to acquire users and and and have a way to acquire users and businesses will pay money to acquire users what i see happening now with like novel payment formats uh with nfts with these new novel platforms coming together it's sort of a collapse of like the payment sql system with the ads ecosystem and i think like that is super interesting which is like if there is a wallet that pays me and if i can have a close relationship with the user because they paid me on chain and then i issue something to them on chain and then i have a loyalty program and if that becomes super portable and allows for new networks to emerge ads market is a trillionaire market payment payments itself is trillions of dollars market so the need for like cheaper payments and the need for acquiring customers is not going to go away and if you collapse those two things together we are in this new world of like payments and ads working together um which which i just find intellectually very fascinating um and i think we're just seeing sprouts of that now so that is a really good framing um i do want to kind of comment and dig into that but i don't want to deprive luca of any comments that he wanted to share so i'll go for it yeah i sometimes i get a bit abstract so i apologize in advance it's the mathematician in me i i think uh i think all of us that i have are seeing a different angle of uh the stable coin and the payment system in defy which is fascinating i think the usd usdc guys at circle they have an incredible um perspective on the on ramping of ramping of liquidity and the true use of usdc as a minimum means of payment which is fascinating and die uh wait is slightly different i think at maker we are we are starting to see the use of dye as a as a as a great stabilizer of defy you will never imagine because die ultimate is like his very sen is a central liquidity source of defy very trustable and now after the last two weeks we are starting to see the value of this trust uh i always thought the other collateral is the the the the problem that over collateralization is not a scalable system increa in stable coins is a meme is not true but and i'm i will not i will got into that rabbit hole but i think we are starting to see dye being used as a stabilizer of many use cases in define from interest rates to credit credit uh interest rates and uh liquidity risk here here and there and i think this is something that i wouldn't i wouldn't have it was not imaginable a couple of years ago right i think crypto instability were two things that were not going together but i think it's um it's something that we will see more and more and more over the years absolutely and i remember just two years ago we're celebrating uh d5 tbl hitting a billion dollars and then now we're over 100 and nobody even thinks about like that exponential leap and uh the pace that everything is evolving is just truly mind-blowing um fran i wanna also kind of give you a chance of course streaming is a super interesting massive category of its own what's kind of been something that you've kind of seen uniquely enabled on the streaming money side well actually without uh mentioning stream money i think what uh stripe did was super interesting as nikhil mentioned i mean that was just uh incredible right it really shows you how crypto can break barriers significantly right where a traditional fintech would have to go and have specific partners in each country they want to make a payout and that's you know effectively you know means only google can do it with crypto you can send money anywhere right and that's something we're seeing a lot uh also in superfluit you know if you look at some of the teams that are using superfluid to pay compensation right they pay people all over the world in a lot of cases they don't even know where their team is right and they can just pay that because an address is just a unique identifier that that is all you need to make a payment right contrast that with a bank where you know you get asked the reason for the payment you get asked you know the address of the payment i recently got asked the birthday of the payee right so it's just a completely different world and if you think of the fact that you can establish long-term financial relationships just by clicking a button and making one transaction on the blockchain i think it's clear that there's a lot of opportunities there and as nikki said it's it's a massive market so you know bringing payments on chain and bringing uh onboarding that next billion users will be through payments i i have no doubts because not everybody needs to trade uh dog money right but everybody needs to make payments and that's absolutely and this is exactly what i was going to comment on now from nikhil's question which is yeah fundamentally the the reason why some of these massive kind of companies sort of got the network set up is because yeah you have to take on anywhere from the legal cost to understanding the generalization of this payout network and it's different for every jurisdiction different for every country different for even different amounts triggering various edge cases and you now just get to eliminate that by having an address that just exists and you can figure out multiple ways to now use that or disperse that in different places and i think like that's to me an interesting good example of a middleman where you've just made that the abstraction and it can flow anywhere from there and now you have explorations possible on both sides so i can need to figure out which fiat railway to connect to to disperse it in different places that's what strikes kind of going on on the other side now i have the money i can stream it in different places but it's on the top there that's where superfluid is going and you fundamentally have uh yeah programmatically sort of enable a whole new world that just wasn't possible before when we kind of think about that essentially of course i agree money is a massive market everybody needs that for for everything in any capitalistic world but uh is is kind of the thinking here that we fundamentally just get the same experiences that we already know and use in our daily lives they're just now more transparent or or faster or do you kind of believe that it changes how we also interact i mean nikhil touched on like the ad part of things and customer acquisitions becomes a lot more easier but uh like how do we think about room for improvement on now bunny being on chain it's an open question we can oh i can have anybody of you first luca yeah i i i can say that if it's fine for the the other panelists i i i always joke that i think money is the most sophisticated must must be mass market product in the world it's like the most complex philosophical product we all use it we completely ignore how it works and we're all happy which is incredible because i mean but i think the point is money does many things right we always we always have the the canonical definition that money is uh currency in general is a unit of account is a storage of value is uh is a means of exchange but i think there is another there is another point that i think is the most important is an allocator of resources we work more where we get more money and it's four very complex uh functionalities that are wrapped into one it is a bank note we have in our pockets or the money we think we have in our accounts that is actually very different from the banknotes but people ignore it uh but i think so we we are we we go used to the idea that the net the money of the future should be the same should be like uh this omni comprehensive product i don't think it's gonna be the case i think we will see different types of currency or subsets of currency doing different things and then you might have a great stable coin i hate the term but it's let's keep the stablecoin i get a great stablecoin for transact a great stablecoin to access leverage a great stablecoin to store value great stablecoin to allocate incentives and and this is what the token economy is enabling and i think we will start seeing this type of specialization in the future uh what are some of the properties of like these three examples like what will be different for for a coin there and and why does that classification exist i mean i i'll give an example that an infamous example of what happened in the last few months so tara was meant in usd people were not using usd as a mean of exchange they were not using ust as a storage value they were using the usd as an access for leverage that was the only thing it was not a stablecoin it was a it was a money market product within uh within a coin and you know i don't want to go into the details but it was it was a source of leverage uh people are using die to store value on chain because they think they believe in this principle of decentralization and over collateralization and the crypto natives they love using die as as that that storage of value but dye itself uses usdc because usdc is a great stabilizer because represents mimics the power and the trust of the us economy into crypto and we are the largest holder of usdc in the world at least until a couple of days a couple of a couple of weeks ago uh so there it is and the relationship is synergic usdc is also used for transacting off ramping and ramping and and maybe other tokens that can be can flow through the superfluid protocol for example that are not coins will be incredible tools to incentivize people better than currency so i think we started to see things being they differentiate themselves and it's difficult for us because we have always considered money as one single monolithic construct but it is not even in the real world and i i stopped rambling mumbling but even in the in the real world people are using the dollar in a different way compared to how they use their local currency in emerging markets that is a payment tool the dollars is an international payment tool or storage of value and i think it's it's become it will become more and more and more specialized now what would be the ultimate experience of the end user i don't know probably would be seamless but in the background many many interesting things will happen i think that's a really interesting abstraction to dig into i i think fran you wanted to say something so i'll let you and kind of comment on the original question we can dig into this this afternoon i wanted to comment on lucas uh on what luke is saying that's something i've i've been thinking about a lot and i think with things like superfluid where you can actually really accelerate the movement of money and automate it we will start seeing people having basically no dollars in their bank account right but that's not because they're not transacting in dollars they are transacting in dollars they're simply transacting really quickly but they're not holding any dollars they're holding maybe bitcoin or ethereum right so they're using dollars as a medium of exchange but not necessarily as a store value or stability or anything else right so these kinds of things become possible as you build financial automations and financial tools to enable money to move faster and exchange forms faster right if it becomes easier to for example imagine if as a user you can uh put your bitcoin or ethereum as collateral and then borrow in a stream to pay your rent right at that point uh maybe you're the person you're paying a rent to is then reinvesting it into bitcoin right so i'm paying the rent in uh in dollars i'm taking the leverage in dollars but i actually never hold dollars and the counterparty never holds dollars either so we're using dollars purely as a unit of account for the rental contract and as a medium of exchange but neither of us actually have dollars right so it's a pretty fascinating idea if you start thinking about it really is i was going to say we're kind of coming up with the photons of the money world's analogy in this case yeah i love that idea by the way i think like the i mean money is many things to luca's point like you know cash is highly inefficient sits in my pocket and doesn't do anything and so cash money dollars in my bank account sits and sits in the account and doesn't do anything well it does do something it allows the bank to lend forward but i think like one of the things that fran is pointing out that like it can do more things for me um like if i have 200 hours in the bank i can have it be in bitcoin i can you know real time essentially stream my rent i find that idea really fascinating like because i came to work on this primarily because i think the risk capital in the world is like misallocated and like how can we get it to be allocated better because it's sort of that's what people who are poor need is they need risk capital they don't need a gift of money right like if they need like a stable form of capital and they need they need to be able to take risk which is in america it's it's phenomenal like the way you can do that and crypto does that on chain now you can take on risk um you you can change not take on risk you know there's not as much risk capital it's all or collateralized but i think like the dream is that it's under collateralized and like you can have like the money if i have like a thousand dollars sitting in my usdc account it's actually true for me today i have money any cash i have i put into maple finance now it's it's not quite streaming there is a lock-in but it's just money that i parked there because it's being used to like fund these businesses on the other side and there's a very specific type of business there today but the reason i fund it is because i believe more real-world businesses are going to come in through these pools that maple are exposing and it's highly efficient for me to be able to deploy that money it takes me like two minutes like going to my metamask to do a couple of clicks and the money is deployed i think that kind of efficiency is really really powerful uh in terms of like creating opportunity for people right like that's what that's what gets me asked which is uh i mean all the other d5 constructs are fascinating but like if we can connect the real world to this then we should be able to like none of us should have like that cash uh we should all and we should that doesn't mean that we don't get access to liquidity today we hold cash because we need access to liquidity i think we could deploy our cash and still have access to liquidity would be like the magical place to be and then we can have like fund more things in the world because we would just be fundamentally more efficient so um but yeah friend i i'd love i actually was just reading your paper uh before starting i find it fascinating yeah and i i think i can jump in here because i think it's it's relevant to what nikki had just said to describe how we can compose this monetary stack so die we have an infinite balance sheet we can print as many times we want as long as there is trust in the die so we need good collateral to print die against and we started with this idea of onboarding real world use cases a year ago in a bootstrap way saying okay let's go to the borrowers directly but it would be like the fed trying to underwrite a mortgage of an individual of a corporate so it's very inefficient it's a test so we are starting to do protocol to protocol liquidity and the example of maple is a relevant example because maple has been currently approved by the maker community to develop a direct deposit module where there will be a dipole potentially where maker will be the stabilizer of the pool maker will print money and deposit it as a senior trench of the pool that then loans the money out together with other other money through pool delegates that take first first loss risk into the real economy and in this way we are we are letting die flow in the hands of as many people as possible but in a very sustainable way and composable way where we have a competitive advantage infinite balance sheet at quasi-zero cost of capital other pools have other competitive advantages they are great in creating products they have great access to the ultimate borrowers they have a great user experience or structure whatever so we give them our advantage advantage access to a super cheap and infinite source of capital as long as they do their job well and they do the rest of the heavy lifting and take most of the profits in this way we can help other borrowers to other lenders to take the right type of risk they want and not being exposed to a bank run and borrowers to access risk capital because i i agree this is this is the real what what we want we want to give risk up good risk capital to the right borrowers and maple is doing it to our frequency traders tomorrow we'll do it to somebody else goldfinch is doing in in the emerging markets credits wants to do it in emerging markets trufy is doing it to corporates so there is a great there is a there is a lot of innovation there absolutely i think uh no that's a that's a really good way to think about kind of just framing that and i was going to say like for both of you uh luka and not nikhil like how uh i feel like i think usdc especially is in more of a position where you get to see more traditional businesses coming in and and on ramping um kind of from your perspective like what's holding up uh more volumes to kind of go up or more anywhere from immersion adoption to just a high kind of volume case like what are some common themes or roblox that you see or questions that get asked yeah i mean i think from uh we can look at it both from a lending perspective and a borrowing perspective i think from a lending perspective um people are still skeptical of crypto yields they don't fully understand it like i think was it last week that u.s tera died like uh yeah so uh that is not good for us right like as an industry people just equate usdc die uh usdt uh with terra and they have the same questions and even our largest largest lenders called us that day and they said well how does this affect you uh even though we are very clear that we are bitcoin uh well like you know when you put money into circle yield it's over collateralized with bitcoin and it's there's no connection to us there but still makes people nervous and i think it's just early days in terms of people getting comfortable with uh yield that crypto markets can create um also our yields are not the best right now because like you know there's just the fed is giving out amazing yield and and so and i think that is not lost on people so they're like well i can take on the risk of crypto but for what so i think that'll that'll eventually settle uh one argument can be well those things are gonna converge uh eventually because like who cares whether it's crypto or uh or not well i i still think there's some time before that happens the on on the under collateralized landing side i'd say on the on the borrowing side so to speak um i'd say we're just like maple's just a year old even goldfinch i think it's less than a year old like being in market i'm sure those projects are longer but like them being live it's so early look at the experience of like lending into a pool on maple today like you can go and evaluate like you know the pool you can see their history you can see who they're lending out to but you really don't know because you really haven't digested the data there's no grading service on the debt that they have there's nobody who is tracking like the performance of the underwriter or a long enough period of time and arguably there hasn't been a long enough period of time and so the at least my my vision is that like eventually we move into a world in which there are hundreds and thousands of like underwriters on the internet and they are in these like very specific pools that are specific to industry um and like you know if you're in climate you want to represent carbon credits uh on chain and you want to make sure there's a unique representation of a carbon credit so it's not sold twice it's like a common problem that i have found in my discussions um if you are i talked to somebody who was doing a protocol and they were just buying invoices and they had a specific protocol where they would buy the invoices um and make 10 on like a net 90 invoice and they have specific needs and that's going to get encoded in a protocol and then eventually they will have specific underwriters within the protocol um you know who are who are essentially managing that debt so i think this whole ecosystem will evolve really fast we need is i think systems that can help it across these different pools systems that can evaluate the different pools uh more more primitives to represent these assets on chain because those primitives are very basic right now um and then what could be like what's the list of new primitives or variations that we we need to see i know you already could i think they're industry specific like that's what i said like you know how do you represent the carbon credits like uh there are these voluntary carbon markets like um and now verification is easier for some class of use cases because you have satellite imagery okay great so i know that the trees that you said are going to be there are there but now if i there's no way of knowing did you stand at carbon credit three times uh well if everything goes on chain you can be sure that it wasn't sold three times right like so um i think it is going to be by industry so i don't think maybe there's one protocol that rules them all and it's possible um but i think there will be some sort of like you know if you look at the web and then they will search and um i don't know what the equivalent of search is but i think we will go looking for yield across these vast pools as as an economy and we're gonna have to figure out like you know what are the systems we need to sort of allocate capital across these different yield pools like people will have a zillion preferences and and then all of this how does this intersect the real world in terms of security laws uh do you only want this to be a d5 system not really if you want to attract all the money then you have to intercept the world of securities laws at some point how will that work i think so those questions come from businesses as well going back to the original question like you know well if i buy this am i buying a security and what happens if i connect my wallet to it uh what is the wallet is hosted there's all kinds of regulatory things that we're still reasoning through but i'm very optimistic that if you can show the benefit then the demand will come the supply will come you can call them you can call either side the demand or the supply because the need is there like the if you are starting a business today if you want to do something new in the world you need capital and that need is going to not is not going away anytime soon and nobody will say that it is a very efficient market so i think for access right yeah the internet will do for like uh for allocating the stress capital what like you know the internet did for like information it made it super cheap so how will that happen i don't know it's one it's only been like nine months or a year of this ecosystem yeah i i'm very excited about it though so like i think it goes past payments i think payments is really one i'll give it to uh i'll give it back payments is really interesting because it creates that on-chain data that can be used for verification like um you know is the supplier somebody who pays on time how much have they paid who have they paid can you analyze the network of payees what can you learn about it can you then grade the supplier higher or lower based on that it's just it's it's like navigating a network and like learning and making building an index and like learning about it and then but yeah done very differently because you're allocating money my monies has value getting information wrong has also has cost but the cost is not immediate it is diffused so you've essentially made the case for lucas argument for specialization needed yeah 100 i i just don't know if like i believe that there is a stable coin per ecosystem or if there's just different ecosystems that all have like different rules and they're all normalized using uh dollar denominated stable coin or if you look at franz argument which is like so in each of these ecosystems you hold maybe the native coin and then you use the dollar just to settle and you're in and out of the dollar really fast that may be just fine like i don't know which will go luka friend anything you want to add to this i mean i i agree i think i it's great to be to remain open-minded and i think i have no clue as well how this will develop and i think a good researcher reacts to new information with new hypotheses so it is something that we keep we keep evolving but what is exciting of this industry for people like ourselves is we are not like journalists that are trying to predict the future we are working to make that future real so we also have an influence on how these things would develop and i think i i myself i came into this industry after 15 years in traditional finance and i see incredible amount of talent coming into this industry and they don't really care about prices so i think even the bear market is going to be extremely productive and i i think more talent will come in the more ideas and would be developed so it's something that we can we can shape together and we don't need necessarily to to mimic exactly what was before defy i also think for example that i i this is a dream because i think it will mean that we will have had a successful transition on on chain economy i think at some point we will abandon the pack like like uh like a an emerging market that doesn't need to be packed to the dollar for credibility but now is is big enough to to walk on his uh on its own uh legs i think i mean at some point maybe is the value of if they will represent the value of their economy and it will be the base of the monitor for the monetary stock of a certain ecosystem and they will and it seems impossible now but maybe maybe maybe not not in the future also considering the inflation data and the uncertainty on the value of the monetary staff we're seeing but institutions like institutions like circle for example are so important because they are bridging the old world into the new rails and although i have no doubts that we will migrate completely in a blockchain enabled financial system i don't know when this is going to happen and i think if we screw things up we might delay this adoption by 20 years which in our in our perspective it seems like it's like the same as it would never happen so i think having incredibly professional and dedicated innovative bridges between the the off chain and the on-chain economy is the most important thing we we need we have and i i truly hope that the dialogue with the regulators will be constructive because um because it's so important for the regulators to participate in this migration order the migration otherwise it will happen anyway but it will happen it will happen in a messy way and the weak ones will be the ones who suffer and we don't want this to happen so it is very exciting but i'm also like for me my call to action is we are not here looking at the future and trying to predict how is it going to be and back in the capital markets based on our prediction we are here because we want to shape it so everyone has a responsibility in the quality of the tweets and the quality of the research and the quality of work uh to not just to speculate but to create uh the future we want and i'm not i'm not an idealist here i think it's real and we all have this kind of personal responsibility how we interact with the ecosystem or outside of the ecosystem now i think that's a really well put argument i wish that was my last question because it would have been a perfect note to end on um i do have one more question but i want to give fran a chance to comment as well and uh we can get to wrapping up the panel yeah honestly there's not much i can add those work to great interventions um the only thing i might comment to is something and he said about how yields are leaving because they're the fed is hiking up their own interest rate so and that's something that's uh we've seen a few times right when uh when we started superfluid the yields in d5 were at zero i don't know how many people remember that um even uh maker dow i think had negative uh negative interest right at some point so what um what that tells us the fact that they're inversely correlated tells us that uh the interest that we see in defy is purely driven by speculation because there's no actual economic activity if there were uncollateralized borrowing and lending then we would have yields even if yields in in the traditional markets are high but we don't because there is nothing except for speculation at the moment and i think it's very important to bring those payments on chain to create those markets from uncollateralized landing because that will stabilize yields if people are borrowing on chain then there's yields right regardless of what the off chain yields are right and that will break that inverse specular inverse relationship between the yields and defined treasuries which will also mean that you know crypto in general becomes a real mature market right so ultimately breaking the direct connection between speculation and crypto is the only way we have to make this mature and i think payments are ultimately the harbor of that right because everybody needs to make payments it's the simplest way to bring people on board and it will bring with it things like credit it will bring with it things like more efficient supply chains potentially cheaper everything right because we have more efficient rails for moving value so overall yeah as as luca said feel responsibility to make that future happen and work in that direction i absolutely agree so so maybe one optimist signature and i will be uh just maybe getting a preview of how each of you are kind of enabling that would love to learn about what you think is important for maker to do and for circle to do and for superfluity to actually get millions more people coming in and be onboarded i start with maker very quickly i i i spent an immense amount of energy over the last few months trying to protect the this concept of prudence because we have a responsibility managing a stable coin and unfortunately these days it is quite evident that i was right it doesn't feel good to be right and i want to keep evolving balancing this the need for prudence because i think it is very very important so what we are trying to do at maker is through protocol to protocol interactions we want to onboard as much high quality collateral as possible on chain showing to the word that there is a super efficient source of capital out there that can be used to distribute tuning expo and uh risk capital around the world so showing that the this value also for protocols that can build on this portable liquidity from maker and if we are successful pro the ecosystem will thrive capital will go into the right ends not to the ones that want to speculate or originate to run away maker will expand and the diet will be in more hands and obviously we will be even more important in difficult system why staying you know being composable with others and i want to stress for example there is space because everybody has a different specialization so we have a very strong and deep strategic relationship with usdc and it's a pillar of our of our construct and we think this will be will remain and will expand as we grow and mature so i think this is what we're trying to do over the next over the next few months i can go um i i think click for for us um uh we have like three broad focus areas one is uh we want to increase like the programmability of ustc so fundamentally we think about usdc as a platform uh we think about um the platform attributes being uh liquidity trust and speed and that's what we push on all day um like that's what frames our entire product effort uh how can we be more liquid how can we if you want to do something with usdc how can you do it fast and and then how we how do we maintain trust at all times so so we're going to keep pushing on that and like that just means supporting more chains we have more functionality coming uh and as we do that like we are sort of uh guiding light is where the developers are so we go where the developers tell us to go and there are good ways of analyzing that data and like we just we consume the data and we follow the developers it's very simple um so that's on the stable coin side on the and then like broadly speaking we have two applications that we care about deeply uh one is payments [Music] payments is uh we're gonna do more in terms of increasing uh increasing value in like crypto payments uh i think um and supporting like various methods of payments for the merchants that we are working with like merchants come to us today for vr payment rails uh we're going to give them uh a way to manage uh crypto rails as well uh in the future so that's one aspect and then there's like all these accessory businesses around that and the third thing for us is uh is trying to figure out how to bring real world assets uh on chain and how to enable those markets what is our role there uh we're still reasoning through it because a lot of this is very exciting uh but still very early so i do agree with fran's point that payments is ready today like you know everybody needs to do it it's a great way to onboard people and the last thing i'd say is like um [Music] there's a lot of one thing i am careful about as i reason about this is i approach everything with a lot of curiosity and not a lot of judgment because i don't know like you know there's a funky new liquidity scheme that like is is really really important to the ecosystem i'm gonna read the white paper i'm gonna try to make sense of it and sometimes it doesn't make sense like you know and it's just mind-boggling to us like as to why something should exist but it does but our job at circle is to keep making widgets like that's what we do um and and we make widgets for developers and we make widgets for businesses and like i am pretty confident that we have plenty of widgets to make over the next two years i'm not bothered by the bear market i'm not bothered by like you know like all the noise with regulation like because fundamentally i believe like what we're doing is useful we're reducing costs we're increasing opportunity and as long as we can make that argument in good faith and with at two very high scrutiny i feel good about like uh what we're doing so yeah the best thing about that is uh it's measurable and uh defensible on chain we can see it measurable and defensible on chain so yeah you don't have to believe me you can just you just need to write you need to write something that can aggregate the data that's it and it's clearly working so i totally agree friend last words to you well i mean similarly to what michael and luca said ultimately we have to keep building doesn't matter right whatever happens in the market doesn't matter we started the market when yields were negative that didn't matter the yields might become negative again it still doesn't matter right what we're doing is useful it's bringing efficiency increasing opportunity in our case i also feel we're you know fundamentally bringing something new right so it's even hard to tell exactly what the use cases will be so the most important things for superfluid are actually very similar to uh to circle right it's keep building for developers and enable those developers to explore those use cases to build those applications that will on board the users right ultimately pro like crypto loves protocols but protocols don't on board users right protocols are pure uh you know rules for information exchange we need people to build applications that solve problems right what we do is just provide the primitives that allow those applications to create new things right but we still need the builders and they need to build useful things so ultimately providing developer tools is the single most important thing that all of us can do and onboarding developers will on board users because if what we're doing you know unless we're all being extremely wrong we're bringing efficiency right and there's no uh there's no way that you know regulatory scrutiny or you know the occasional implosion of uh ill-deviced financial scheme will stop this right it's still uh useful and that's not going to change regardless of what happens outside of the industry but i just want to echo again what luca said i do feel that we have a responsibility to make that future happen and uh it's one of the reasons i think a lot of people don't take crypto halfway right you see people fall down the rabbit hole and the reason they fall down the rabbit hole is that they are seeing future in the making and that is extremely exciting right it's not like uh you know changing button colors at google you're literally changing the way the money exp the the world experiences money right then experience is the transfer of value so there's something about uh krypton web feed which is extremely exciting for builders and uh building more exciting tools for those builders is extremely rewarding for us so that's what we'll keep doing there was a time in google where it wasn't just about changing colors but i know that but there was like you know i was early like mid-2000s like 2005 google but like there was a time where like and the same things happened like you know first they were the semiconductor companies and they were the you know the ciscos of the world and like eventually reach google then it became about youtube and it became about the apps so i think we're we're following the same path and i think we're somewhere in the early part of that cycle um but yeah it's like uh i may be older than all of you so i have seen this movie at least once before but it's exciting it's exciting to be part of this uh to be building uh at this speed which is which is i enjoy tremendously yeah i think there's a perfect note to end this on i want to thank all three of you for uh taking the time today so look and you kill friend really appreciate the amazing thoughtful discussion and uh we hope to bring you on again and have a round two of this thank you bye thank you very much thanks for joining folks all right well that marks the last panel i taught for the day so before we end the summit i want to bring on fran again to share some closing remarks and then we'll wish all of you happy hacking because submissions are due in two days so uh friend [Music] thank you uh thank you cardik so i'm just gonna very quickly share my screen can you see my screen so we'll just uh wait for you to be on the workspace so we can just there you go perfect all right well uh thanks everyone for joining us today i think it's uh it's been actually really interesting at least for me there were a lot of uh things that i learned from our early guests from our later guests the panels everything was really interesting i just want to bring you back to superfluid right so what we're doing at superfluit is building a protocol we're building uh streaming money with no capital lock-ups and programmability on chain right and as you might have understood by some of the panels some of the content what the reason we're building this is really for builders right we saw a technical opportunity to build a very interesting tool for builders to innovate the way money works and effectively what we saw was an opportunity to to change the way money works right to change the way people experience money what happened there i think the screen share stop would you mind doing it one more time yeah sorry for that oh the application the application crashed okay sorry for that so as i said we saw an opportunity to change the way money works right and that's uh what we were building we wanted to change the way money works from lump sums to money streaming right and we can make money more more fluid and you know we can bring this new tool to webfree and then we realized that this meant we could network cash flows right by simply changing the balance of function of an erc20 we could enable businesses to receive and send money in real time and see this real-time balance move without any actions on their behalf right this was something that really opened our eyes to the opportunities that uh bringing cash flows on chain meant right because suddenly we could effectively uh create subscriptions salaries all these beautiful things that effectively created web 2 right web 2 was created by ads arguably but also by sas right sas is the most successful monetization strategy in web 2 has created massive companies right so when we understood that superfluid could enable this in web free we realized that this was really an opportunity to push webv forward by enabling subscriptions by enabling cash flows to come on chain we could effectively create more sustainable uh web free economies and this is something that we also acted in the last panel where we talked about how yields really currently depend on speculation and the demand for speculation and leverage but with cash flows on chain we can change that we can make webfree its own economy where people are paying for services right not just for leverage and that's something we're very passionate at super fluid about and it's the reason we organized the summit so that we could get people who are building these tools to talk about them and their importance of them so i just want to share with you an imaginary future which is actually not too far so i expect we'll start seeing web free businesses that get paid through subscriptions managed by diagonal those same businesses in real time will pay their salaries through coin shift to their teams and their teams will be invoicing them through a request network and those those people working for these companies will then reinvest their money through a ricochet exchange or another streaming investment platform and use part of the that salary to maybe borrow money on huma finance right and all of this is being built this is literally happening in our ecosystem under under our eyes right now and i'm extremely excited to enable these kinds of use cases to happen in web free because these things have never happened before right like forking uni swap for the tenth time is not as exciting as building uncollateralized numbing so come and join us come and create this vision for on-chain networked cash flows with us uh we're really excited to you know involve more people build more of an ecosystem and increase the amount of money that we can flow through our system and you know our ecosystem is growing we already have a lot of apps but there's never enough right there's so many different use cases so many different verticals to explore and we're really excited to you know enable you to come and change the way the world experiences money with us so for all of the developers in the room join our superfluid reactor as i said if you're building out hack money at the end of it if you really like what you did and you think that you want to turn this into a business apply if you get in we will help you fundraise we'll help you launch and we will not take anything it's completely free right so this is the best uh the best accelerator out there because we're not going to charge it now bringing us back to superfluid of course it's streaming money on chain cash flows but it's also building a web free native economy with on-chain subscriptions enabling credits and connecting cash flows to effective effectively make the web free economy leapfrog traditional finance and hopefully usher in a new internet native economy that doesn't rely on the intermediaries that have uh you know uh grapple that we've grappled with so far so that's it for me i think uh that is uh an amazing wrap up of what today was all about thank you again for uh being an amazing partner and uh being the support system for a lot of the hackers that are trying to understand and basically change how money works so once again thanks to all the speakers thanks to all of you listening and watching this and you spent the last few hours with us uh asking questions sharing comments and uh talking about everything um web3 and money and uh to mike and fran really appreciate having the opportunity to work with you here on this summit thanks man thanks for having us we got it and that officially concludes our superfluid reactor summit so thanks again to everybody who was part of it and as a quick summary if you participate in the chat then you will be getting this amazing animated poep very soon so i'll keep it at keep an eye out on the email that you signed in with and we'll be uh sending this prolap to all of you surely and with that i'd like to uh wish everybody hacking this weekend uh the best of luck with the submission submissions are due in on sunday at about 3 p.m and with that i'd like to sign off and wish all of you a great weekend and we'll see you all next week with the hack money finale with some of our favorite teams that will go live so uh thanks everybody and in the meantime enjoy some low five beats take care you
