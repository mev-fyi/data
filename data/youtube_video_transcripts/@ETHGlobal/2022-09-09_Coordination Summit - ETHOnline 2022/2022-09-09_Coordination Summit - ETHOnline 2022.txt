good morning good afternoon good evening everybody I'm kartik one of the co-founders of global and I am super excited to welcome all of you to our coordination Summit for youth online 2022. we got an amazing next step four hours playing for all of you and uh appreciate everybody's patience and us getting started they're all watching this on global.tv and this is what we're going to be using today to not only watch everything but also to be communicating with all of our speakers so if you have any questions you can sign in and ask those questions on the chat and we'll be we'll be able to relay those directly to all of our panelists in terms of what we're looking forward to today it's going to be a jam-packed session there's a lot of stuff around coordination and how do we actually do things at scale especially as we now lean more and more into how gals are becoming so more involved in our day-to-days so we're gonna kick us off with Alicia talking about some social rules for Dallas we're gonna have an amazing panel on how do we do better Collective funding in web 3 we're gonna have Parker come on and talk about some of the threats in Urgent calls to action on what we've seen on how community community down governance uh are evolving kaido is going to be talking about treasury management and how do we do that sustainably we're gonna have Tina talking about organizing communities Daphne will follow up with talking about how do we onboard more and more people through Dell participation Ryan will be then covering culture Marketing in Dallas and then we're going to end the day with a history of coordination and kind of what we've learned from anywhere from science fiction to how we have evolved all of our processes today so eight amazing incredible talks in coordination and how do we do this at scale and uh to get right into it I want to bring on our very first Speaker for the day and that is Alicia and she's going to be talking about social rules for Dao so without further Ado let's welcome Alicia and get the summit started bye Alicia hi how's it going okay sorry I don't have video at the moment but I'm just going to shave my screen everything is good to go cool so uh hi I'm Alicia eighth and I'm the governance lead at ANS and over the last um year or so I have been working on launching the enist out and then kind of facilitating putting in place uh infrastructure to allow the Dow to run and um in July this year we kind of just hit the start of our second term so we had been running a structural working groups for six months and it kind of led me to reflect on the time since launch and I ended up writing this piece social rules for dows and I thought I could just run through this pace because uh social rules I guess are something that people tend not to really focus on or perhaps think about as an afterthought um especially if you are launching a token a lot of thought goes into everything that you need to do to launch so related to token distribution um you know getting contracts set up and things like that um but what I really have spent most of my time doing um since November last year is thinking about what happens once you want your Dow and you have the mechanism to govern a project or a protocol um through executable proposals that are done on Chain by token holders but um a Dao is much more in terms of operating efficiently is much more than just getting token holders to vote so uh ANS has kind of implemented a range of different social structures or social environments that kind of hopefully increase the efficiency and also help the Dow work towards its kind of north star of promoting the development and Adoption of ens so I guess the starting point is what people think adao is and so um basically a down it's purest form is a collective group of token holders who use tokens to interact with a smart contract that um can be used to govern a protocol or and or manage a treasury and so that's kind of the strictest definition of what a dow is which is that um it's just essentially the smart contracts and then the token holders around um that smart contract that vote but I guess like over the last 12 months in particular we've kind of come to think of dowels as including you know all of the different social environments that um kind of work alongside the Dow and so that is kind of where actually a lot of I guess like the culture and the the action happens as it relates to a Dao because passing a proposal is like quite straightforward um the inner style uses Telly which a lot of other dolls in the ethereum ecosystem do as well and so that's one component and um kind of beyond that I think it was important for me to be able to put in infrastructure that allowed the Dow to get to the point of passing proposals and so thinking about that um just kind of zoom in on this image okay so all of these different kind of components of the social environment of the eni style kind of came to being at different points in the timeline in the last year or so and so um I'll just quickly run through different things or different components of the social environment for ens um and the Dow so there's snapshot uh the governance Forum the Constitution we have Twitter a governance process or proposal flow working groups working group rules and Discord so um basically every community in web3 has a lot of these components if not all of them and um I think potentially a thing that is different about the ens style is that we've been or I guess I've been pretty aggressive in really formalizing a lot of the rules around um some of these different aspects of of the social environment so um I'll just quickly run through in terms of kind of what happened when we launched the Dow um the Enis Constitution the eniso Constitution was a really important part of our airdrop strategy and as part of the claim for the ens token uh people had to sign in and basically approve or reject each of the five articles to the Constitution and this means that so this happened on Snapshot it means that um ens actually has I think the largest snapshot space on Snapshot if you go to snapchat.org and the reason we did that is because we felt it was important to have the legitimacy of as many token holders as possible um in terms of kind of affirming that Constitution the reason that's that's important is because ultimately with this with a social proposal there is nothing um there's nothing kind of uh backing up a social proposal it is really just people choosing essentially like opting in to adhere to that to those rules and so um yeah we actually had over 137 addresses eligible to claim and the Constitution passed with uh 15 million votes out of I think 25 well maybe maybe a bit less than 25 million um approving the Constitution and I would say in terms of kind of the rank of importance of social rules within a dow that a constitution in my opinion is perhaps the single most important kind of social role that you can put in place in not only Adele but particularly even like a community and it essentially provides a North star for every participant engaged in Adele whether that is um the delegates or community members who or token holders who hold um the ens token and are delegating and the core team and participants in working groups so a constitution just means that everyone kind of irrespective of their background their personal interests um and kind of whatever their project interest might be know that when they come to the ensdale what the goal is and so um something that's quite interesting um just in the last actually the last week and week and a half um we have had kind of a lot of discussion within the ens Community um from people like vitalik and nick.eath who is the founder of ens who have kind of raised suggestions that have been discussed on Twitter and um they actually uh kind of if they were to be implemented would be a breach of the Constitution so um I had the Tweet Badger at him at the moment but essentially uh Nick kind of tweeted about donating funds from objectionable.eth names to Charities and the reason that this is this would be kind of unconstitutional if it was implemented and it's the form that it was suggested is because um it states in article three the income funds ens and other public goods and so a donation to a charity outside of the scope of article 3 of The Constitution um is essentially a breach of the Constitution and so that's just like a really tangible example of how um something like a constitution as a document can be used in everyday and practice to I guess like keep the Dow aligned and like Heating in the direction that it was intended [Music] um yeah another example is vitalik uh talking about and fermenting habitual taxes for ens names or ethnames and um again so an article two it says fees are primarily an incentive mechanism and one of the statements that vitalik made was that ens was leaving money on the table and so there might be a better way to kind of capture that value but Article 2 of The Constitution states that you know the intent is not to capture the maximum amount of value it's just a disincentivized squatters and to ensure kind of um that names have a better chance of of being used um and so yeah those are kind of two examples of that we've just had literally in the last week of um how the Constitution has been really important um and I would definitely recommend kind of thinking deeply about the Constitution um if you participate in a down and it doesn't have one um and another another reason a constitution is really important is just because it empowers individuals who uh within the community whether they might be delegates or stewards to kind of make decisions that don't rely on kind of their personal assumptions but objectively they can say you know um based on what this grant is requesting I can see that it is aligned with article 3 of The Constitution therefore the darshan grant um the funds to this project so um yeah that is the Constitution um and then another really kind of uh important part of the ensl uh are the working groups so if I just go back up here so working groups and working group rules and the reason that I guess I kind of uh drafted working group rules for the e s Dow a month after the launch of the Dow was because without some sort of structure ultimately every proposal or vote needs to go to a now wide vote and this is a huge drain on the scarces resource and um crypto at least which is attention um and so creating working groups was a way to allow the Dow to have I guess like these entities through which it could more effectively and efficiently um Carry Out the objective of the Dao but not kind of Burden delegates at the same time and so the working group rules are really extensive um and we actually ended up asking snapshot to increase the word limit of snapshot proposals to accommodate the length of the working group rules but basically within uh ANS there are three working groups meta governance which relates to the Dow in his ecosystem which relates to um the maintenance and development uh of the ens ecosystem and public goods because um it again it's kind of states in the Constitution that funds from um income funds anus and other public goods and so the Constitution specifically states that public goods within web 3 should be funded and so those are the working groups the working group rules were passed as a social proposal and um again just like the Constitution it means that the Dow could you know um move forward and pass proposals without abiding to the social the social proposals which are the working group rules but part of kind of building that culture within a dow is um I guess like people in positions of influence like stewards um and large delegates kind of advocating to adhere to social rules um and if you think about it like a lot of major decisions within a dow kind of come down to whether or not everyone chooses to abide by social rules or not and um so the working groups um were kind of created by um having an election where the entire Dao was able to vote on electing stewards for each of the working groups and then it's this down white election that gives working groups and this their stewards the legitimacy to carry out um and make decisions uh on their own and um yeah so essentially what happened within the first six months is that there was an election stewards were identified and elected and they passed a budget and things kind of got off to a really slow start um but this is like another important aspect of I think managing a dow and the benefit of social rules which is that um wastage is potentially like a really big issue in Dows and so is potentially like uh self-interested extraction of funds um particularly when there is no direction in terms of you know what the Dow should be doing or who was in a position to um to distribute funds and things like that so um I guess a win for the Dow in my opinion is that the difference between the first term which was the first six months of the year and the second term which started in July for the second six months of the year um the funding that the debt the Dow working groups received um increased significantly from I think potentially like um four hundred thousand dollars across three working groups or forward groups in the first um when the first budget was passed to 3.5 million dollars just recently and uh I think the amount of funding that the working groups received recently is kind of a testament to how effectively the working group rules are are working as um like a social structure within the ensl and um I guess along with having rules like an important part of social rules is kind of iterating and experimenting I think the hardest thing about um or something I think about often is that ANS is a protocol that you know we want to exist in 100 years and downs are very new and so balancing I guess like balancing doing the least risky thing possible to ensure the survival and longevity of the protocol while also having kind of some space to experiment and iterate on things that have never been done before and so um with the working group rules we kind of iterated on that and they were repealed and replaced in June and um yeah I think that's the other thing with social rules is that they are more um adaptable than um you know executable rules which well actually rules don't have to be executable but executable proposals once you pass that's kind of done whereas social rules once they're in place they can still be adapted um and so uh and then within the social rules let's go back to the diagram So within the social rules um there are working groups and the working group rules another important aspect of the the Dow is the governance forum and so um the governance Forum I guess is what a lot of people kind of associate with the Dow and um you know it's common for people who participate in a forum to feel like they are members of the Dow um even though that might legally be inaccurate um and for the inner style the governance forum is definitely kind of the heartbeat of the governance activity and um you know there is a code of conduct and uh what's interesting I think about the governance forum is that it is like its own entity and something that I kind of think about as well in terms of what success might look like for the ens Dao is having uh multiple governance forums and so like a diversity of um different social environments which means that you kind of depending on the breadth and like the range of your community you don't have to get every single person um who is a user or involved in your project into the same governance Forum um based on whatever the requirements are of the executable uh votes or for ens there is a requirement that you have a hundred thousand ens to post a vote on chain and um if you have that then you can like completely ignore essentially the social environment and just post a vote on chain um for that vote to pass it needs a million votes to reach forum and um a majority of votes in favor of The Proposal so a lot of people most people don't have a hundred thousand votes and so they then rely on the governance forum and the associated proposal flow to be able to move proposals through um through the Dow and something that is kind of interesting is that um in the piece they actually say that uh like the governance process is something that should be passed as a social role really early on and we didn't do this with Enis and so the governance uh the governance proposal flow was kind of documented in some governance docs but it was never passed um on Snapshot by the Dow as a social proposal and it's actually something I'm working on in the coming weeks and I think uh in hindsight the benefit of um not passing that proposal immediately is that we have had like the experience of putting through many proposals and kind of um iterating on what the requirements and the thresholds are but um like I said earlier the point of social proposals which are um in the nature of off chain because they're not executable they don't relate to the protocol or the treasury um is that you can you can just put forward another proposal and change and iterate things so I'm just gonna quickly get a time check because I don't want to go over just um because I know that the lineup is jam-packed but Okay so so I think um this diagram here kind of shows that um if you think about the Dao in the center of a community and um basically this social environment is is what is currently the state of things for the e s Style um so a lot of these different components of the social environment are run or operated or administered by the core team um but the point of a Dao is that we're kind of moving away from um this idea that there is like a centralized organizational body that um that governs everything and so in my opinion the something that would kind of increase the anti-fragility of the ensl is for whether it's you know competing social environments or you know really Niche and specific social environments to emerge from the community as a whole um that also participate that also view themselves as part of the Dao um kind of as we as we refer to it um in word three which kind of includes all of the social components and um I think that is kind of the the win that I'm working towards with ens personally and yeah I think I guess like the most important thing that I would kind of take away from social rules is that um that social rules endows are more important and more flexible than most people realize and um I would say as well that potentially the format of the social rules matters and so having something like a constitution can kind of feel um almost like you are setting up a legal system and that's kind of how I think about ens which is that it's a state and um you know the social rules similar to legislation um and yeah so I I definitely would encourage people to think about all of the different kind of social environments that could be attached to their Dao and um and then I guess like starting anywhere is a good place and um but with a constitution is probably where I'd start followed by a governance process and then kind of whatever social rules need to be put in place to manage the day-to-day operations um of the Dao and its Mission um but yeah that's kind of been my experience it's still I'm still kind of learning every day and so um hopefully I have something more to report in in a couple of weeks or definitely in a few months but yeah foreign thank you so much Alicia how's that a really insightful kind of overview and hopefully this is one of those things where you get to report this in real time and we get to observe uh your learnings and how do we actually quickly adapt that to uh to other communities so amazing really appreciate this and uh with that we are running a little bit late so we won't be able to do too much questions too many questions and if there are any questions from the audience I'll just relay them directly to uh to Alicia and share the responses with the person who asked them but um I'm super excited to welcome our next talk and that's a panel uh we're going to talk about collect collective funding in web 3 and as for our three amazing panelists when I welcome Simona and James and Steph on uh to the the stage so last call of you to turn your videos on and uh we'll talk about some interesting ways to do funding so welcome everybody excited to have you on board thanks looks like we're yeah yeah awesome um so we have 30 minutes for this which means we'll be able to go into too many questions so we'll try to go uh into some direct topics as early as possible but I want to kind of zoom out first and just maybe start off with a couple of intros I'd love to kind of start with with Simona here um tell us about where you are what you work on and what is kind of the most common thing you end up doing as part of your role and I will kind of then go to Stefan and James cool um hi everybody um great to be here um I tend to um spend very many plates in the ethereum ecosystem um I am a steward of Bitcoin Dao medical governance Steward for ens I also work with element um Finance Dao as well as organized shelling point and liscon so um there's a plethora of things that I get involved in all um aimed at potentially creating or making sure that web free is our new reality and creating space for a lot of people to um you know come into that reality in a nice beautifully beautiful initiation and then a nice kind of path forward um that everybody can benefit from oh thanks uh James if you want to go next yeah sure um so hello everyone I'm James um I'm from fire eyes I'm from New Zealand um really focused on sort of like how we can open up the governance space and make it more approachable and the best of the way that we do that is by working with a series of um open launchers and data launchers we're at the moment at mcon if anyone's listening to em con um Come and catch us to hang out but sort of really like focusing on how these towers can expand so how can bring more people and give out more money how can e s launch you know sort of and launch their token in a meaningful way um and get other people involved awesome and uh Steph here next hey all I'm Steph uh I'm over at Sea Club I am the steward of the media team and yeah I spend my days thinking about and executing and facilitating uh media as a dow strategy and yeah I think I think uh just our uh instigator and co-creator described me as uh someone who thinks about coordination more than most same people and I feel like that that feels pretty accurate it's amazing um this whole day is about coordination and sort of anywhere from our learnings to our complaints so I want to focus on both of those for for the next few minutes um my kind of at first I feel like the first topic we should all dive into is maybe uh talking about what is essentially the the level of coordination we have to do so uh James you talked about working with specific launches uh somebody talked about doing grants for multiple communities stuff you're talking about just kind of a lot of companies that you get to look at and the media aspects of all those opportunities uh there's these are different scales these are different kind of timelines uh you have a lot different set of people that are affected by these decisions uh maybe starting with these staff like on average like what is the level of complexity that you're dealing with in terms of the number of people you have to talk to or coordinate and what are some of these timelines they usually end up working out on I love this question you know we yeah we we're increasingly our coordination is becoming more are more interwoven and complex over at Sea Club as our as as our both as our teams grow in the number of of people that that we're coordinating with and also the depth at which we're coordinating and I think also as we mature as a as a Dao as a community as an organization so yeah you know on any given day or sorry in any given week um I'm in something like 14 plus hours of of meetings that are that are scaled from like either one to ones or like sinks across um multi like multiple working groups or uh within within our specific working groups and yeah and you know we're working we're working on timelines so if I think about with the media team specifically we're working on timelines that are both like 24 hours long right because you're you're engaging in a in a you know the the ever ever on cycle of Twitter of um of of yeah just just social media but but we also work on much longer timelines right so when we're talking about any media that we're putting out from our podcast to any of our editorials that can be timelines that are like you know two months three months six months out um and and yeah and one of the things that we're that we're also uh in in the midst of on the on the media team but then again also at C Club at large is yeah the way in which as we as we grow as we grow our teams as we grow and and and add new new verticals to our work that yeah our coordination and and our need for for clarity and legibility and constantly circusing all assumptions just become so critical oh I can imagine and I feel like uh I want to go to Simona next because uh you seem to be in the the eye of the storm of every Grand data coordination year so uh what's what's the chaos that you get to deal with well so I think just in general um and and how this is potentially evolved we're still dealing with incredibly incredibly um Dorset centralized and gigantic kind of decision-making processes right and we're definitely at that stage where it's very important to become much more agile and to make sure that it is we set ourselves up for collective decision making right and it's very very important to decentralize that decision-making process and it's very important to prioritize um enabling funding beyond what is you know a project that maybe has somebody who is good at marketing that project right so this from the perspective of just an evolution of what it takes every single round for Bitcoin grants the ones that go ahead are the ones that are just very good constantly on Twitter and and doing the usual kind of um pre-juring uh and post Grant uh engagement let's say so I think there's work to be done particularly on that decentralization piece and particularly on that you know Merit base like really really surfacing things in a in a much much more natural way versus again a little bit of that centralization and flavor that we're trying to get away from naturally this actually is a good segue until what I was going to ask next but I also want to give James a quick opportunity to talk about this because uh that is effectively where what we're going to touch on um and how do we actually make that scalable so uh James I'll let you quickly chime in yeah I mean I think like plus one to um what both Stefan Simona said I think like you know what's interesting at the moment in terms of like how that coordination has leveled up is that we're no longer sort of like coordinating 10 people in a room and then even with the Dow right like five years ago there wasn't that many people you know that I mean there was a shitload of ethereum right like 10 15 Cinema ethereum but in terms of humans sitting around the table there wasn't that many and then you know sort of PTA staff for a couple years now we have sort of you know the medical Telemark spin up a few more people come and then now it's like the hot word right it's the buzzword that like literally everyone you know anyone trying to get into seed Club is like Oh I'm a dab an amazing Dad it's awesome you know like I think like we're now at a space where it's a buzzword right which is really good in a lot of ways because it means we have more humans um but it also means we have these coordination challenges and I guess like we're talking about right now so and absolutely so so it seems like there's like one interesting thing here is like we we often end up um you know we're not establishing like which side we're kind of talking about because uh oftentimes like we have to switch context from here we're on the other side of the people we're actually helping and then sometimes like let's talk about uh the work we have to get to those uh outcomes and uh each of you are in that position where you're doing something on the internal side and then you have external facing sort of outcomes um when you kind of look at that what are some of the common challenges that you feel like you've seen or you think are still largely unsolved on on the Eternal side um uh I'll maybe kind of start with you James like you have to kind of work with people on the launch side of things as they kind of think about new tokens how often are those uh uh I don't know how often like what are usually kind of that common things you run into that repeat every time you talk to a new uh set of kind of clients um and then we'll kind of go to simulant about some of the the grants and the Dows you're involved with yeah I mean I think it's interesting I think like one of the most common things is probably like you know not knowing when they should turn into a doubt you know it's like and I think like you know I mean the the coordination of there now being 10 000 people 100 000 people that really care about Dows I think sort of like adds to that complexity you know because like at the beginning it's like oh well we'll just turn into a doubt and no one might you know worry about it for too long but eventually we can sort of build them something more meaningful versus now it's like okay well we we can fit into a doubt right now and there might be 10 000 people you know banging our drum but do we need that you know like should we do that right now and so I think like a common thing we you know end up talking to a lot of a lot of different companies and a lot of them are like okay let's turn into a doubt tomorrow and either they're trying to rush it too much and they need to chill the out sorry I don't know if I swear chill out and you know sort of take it a little bit easier or they're so scared right there's actually a lot of companies that will spend a lot of time working with that you know we all use on a daily basis that we're planning to launch a token years ago you know and didn't and you know went through months or years of work around launching that and then went okay this is here you know there's too much going on and so I think that's you know sort of one of the most common things that we end up finding Sarah go for it so I think that's really really interesting and actually my kind of take on things was around timing as well so I think that is such an important piece that we either and it seems like there's that speed of like rushing in or pulling back and that in between that really nice middle is still something that we're all trying to figure out right it's either super quick let's get all of the Dow tubing immediately even if we don't need it right now and let's figure things out later or let's wait let's see maybe we don't turn into it now maybe we don't launch that token maybe we do this or like think about it a little more and I think the timing piece is really really important both in the workings because you mentioned the internal workings of a Dao establishing those patterns like I've been chatting about like patterns and Cadence and all of these like rhythms of how things evolve of how information flows of how processes get implemented to make sense for that organism if you look at it all it's all each Dao or each structure is an organism within itself everything has to flow in a healthy way everything has to touch the different components and the different parts through the arteries that link everything together and making sure that that functions that's a very very important piece internally on the other side when you're looking at funding when you're looking at how people are coming in and how they're accessing resource being able to do it in a Grassroots way being able to do it in a way that is that has such a better degree of visibility versus the big institutional funders the monolithic institutional funders that dare I say they also follow patterns but that's because they kind of go you know on a surface level sometimes that a Grassroots approach just completely completely um not necessarily goes against but gives you that granularity and gives you that feel for true value for an ecosystem that you may not have insights into and so again micro to macro macro to micro it's not that different from the natural world and plants and all of these beautiful natural things if we just approach it from that perspective a lot of things become a lot clearer uh in timing as well as structure let's just have like uh your day-to-day is a little bit different than than James and Simone as in kind of the role um what are kind of some of the parallels you've seen on the process side of things for for C Club yeah I love I love how you're you're just getting to the heart of the matter right that like what is what is what is the tension between how we're how we're integrating process internally and then how we how that then bleeds out into into external and then also when we're interfacing with um with with projects or with like applicants uh for for the accelerator or alumni and yeah I mean I think I think there's like a lot of a lot of things that feel resonant in in what both um James and Simona said and you know when we when we're when we're thinking about um yeah about about coordination like I think I think there's a a real um a way that we as a space talk about how we how we coordinate a community or how we how we make decisions as a community around a shared Treasury and one of the things I've noticed and I feel like we're we're bringing more attention to at Sea Club as well is like oh actually there's already a really core Community here and and that's your those are your core contributors and so how are we how are we as a contributing team um both both within our specific working groups and also across our working groups how are we coordinating and how are we making decisions and then also how are we memorializing those processes and then how are we you know to Simone's point about Cadence like how are we how are we integrating a sense of cadence and evaluation in retro to all of those processes and and yeah and so I think and you know that's just that stuff's just like not super sexy like you know when I said earlier like yeah I'm I'm in like 13 hours of meetings a week it's like yeah that that's not that's not a super exciting stat but what happens in those meetings is actually really powerful um like the power of a 30-minute one-to-one and what can be accomplished in in terms of like connection and coordination in this off-chain way is actually really critical to to then bringing that coordination to to on chain and then also how we um how we accelerate that coordination for the dials that come through C Club is it so does this mean that you're essentially focused on decentralized decision making but from a process standpoint like what matters is still kind of behaving like uh any coordinated Community would which largely resembles a centralized sort of controlled uh kind of party is that a fair question to either of you yeah I mean I guess I guess I'll I'll you know take the take the first class at that yeah you know I think I think that there is this this you know we think about decentralization I think it's it's very easy for us to say decentralization on the other side of that is centralization and I think that that's actually not a super useful way to think about decentralization right that it's like it can be this like circular Spectrum um with like with like hello gradients and and there's certain things within your within your Dow within your community that are that might be fully decentralized whatever that actually means and there's certain components that that have like higher touch or more sort of like um like quality control or curation or quality assurance or curation that that those processes go through and I don't necessarily see that as like centralization you know so to say but I do see it as a really actually a critical part of having a a fully aligned decentralized community I'm down to I'll go somewhere I was gonna say approach this whole because otherwise we're all gonna leave this and go like why are we not there yet what the hell so being like jumping straight from a way of doing things that works to a decentralized way right like look at Brands right there's a decentralizing the grants protocol right and making that a tool for any Community to use to fund whatever it is that they care about that's the level of like Independence and decentralization that you aim for but there's no way that you're going to be able to do it unless you would have gone through these like whatever 15 grants rounds that Bitcoin has put up to see how it evolves and to see how it grows and to see how people are using it and what gets funded right so it's like that Progressive Way and path that you build it's almost like you know those movies where like the track isn't built yet you're like building it as the train is going is basically what we're doing and that's totally fine and we should be comfortable with that and it's going to take a minute sometimes but it is a progressive effort yeah yeah I agree and I think that like you know in current times with like the whatever the number going down and like Dow's not executing as well as some people you know would like them to I think like there's this massive wave of the moment of people being like oh you know we should just go back these corporate structures are actually really important you know they're being emulated and these committees that are being spun up you know and like some of that stuff is true and it certainly is learning from the corporate world and you know the idea of making a grants committee right and that being a centralizing force you know makes sense but actually that doesn't mean we're taking a step away from the Dow stuff you know and I think like everyone's roasting tokens and roasting cows right now I think should like take a step back and you know have a guess where we're going to be in five years and it's going to be that actually a lot of this corporate structure is being consumed by these towers whether anyone likes it or not and so the current Dow wave yes you know we are centralizing in some ways however you know we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathroom it's amazing there I would point out is adopting these things or making sure that we evolve this in a mindful way like don't just go oh it's not working yet let's just bring whatever it was from the corporate world and just like jam it into the Dao ecosystem do it in a mindful way take what makes sense do not just move it as if you're like navigating I don't know Europe with a map of the states and then you're getting frustrated that you can't find where you're going like it's just don't do that uh no of course I mean it's also one of those things where when you are changing kind of the the recipe but rather actually you have different ingredients but a different recipe that you're trying to get or same recipe trying to get to um you're in a lot of those scenarios where I feel like we yeah the good thing here before I finish it is like seems like all all four of us are aligned on what each of us are saying I don't disagree with anything that's been said so far even though I would like to uh but there are also some benefits of uh of kind of being able to actually cherry pick things that are working and Implement them in any new process and there are a lot of advantages to that there's nothing wrong with having a meeting um there's still a range that you get to sort of realize that there's like a diminishing returns that you kind of get to but um I mean kind of asking Point Blank like are you do you think the Dows are efficients right now to to kind of actually support a fast-paced um development of any kind of outcome like uh obviously you can't generalize that but like for the ones you represent the ones you've seen do a good job or not a great job what do you kind of think how that generally Trends us and uh and what do you think there's room for improvements I mean I'm happy to start I I think they're like you know compared to what I guess it would be my thought you know is that like yes you know they are doing really well and certainly you know all the ones that are you've reached how I'm involved in is perfectly efficient you know but like I mean I think compared to what you know I think compared to you know what we what we were doing on the previous cycle which was Raising tokens and having no Community voice and then the founders just spending the money and then piecing out you know compared to that yes you know much more efficient the Dow treasuries are locked up you know the founder can't run away with the money well there's some of the situations that the community are actually coordinating you know the thing is working and I think like yes there's still a lot to be learned and yes you know coordinating whether it be working groups or whether it be the way we distribute grants or the way that we you know coordinate decision making all those things can be improved but compared to any version you know of reality that's existed in crypto for the past couple of years I think we're like winning massively a hundred percent and I that for me the proof is genuinely in the proverbial pudding because you mentioned ingredients in making recipes but what for instance in Grants like season 14 of get going down there was after because of the market and because of the different kind of um circumstances there was such scrutiny on how much money was coming out of the treasury to fund what work that it went into this like such valuable conversation and at times even disagreements within that Community for the benefit of that doubt and the work that it is doing right and having those conversations like James says in an open Forum in a transparent way in a very very animated way which for me was a pleasure to to be able to be a part of and witness where you genuinely have people for in a community caring about the future of something that can continue funding public goods and can continue its Mission and that opportunity I don't know I have not witnessed it before and just being able to be part of that and then create the processes that come out of that and making sure that you strengthen that and create the space for those conversations to exist and for that pattern of decision making collective decision making to happen is huge like it's it's a milestone as far as I'm concerned in how we're moving them how we're evolving them and how we're getting better and making sure that these things are clear they are very accessible they are very uh you know uh transparent in terms of the flows in terms of Who's involved in terms of what we're doing with with resource I mean yeah I think so yes from me um I wanna maybe ask an adjacent question to uh to Steph kind of compared to what I would say uh a lot of what Simone is in James day today looks like you were investing in companies um or Dows and generally kind of you have a different way of thinking about how do you measure anywhere from success to to uh to track outcomes uh what are kind of some of the perils you've seen from how you work at C Club versus uh what anywhere from like Adventure Capital firm would do or other Dow initiatives you've seen around yeah totally I think I think a I think a critical point there to just to clarify is that you know as C club we don't we don't invest in any in any um any doubt our community I think the thing that we do offer though through the accelerator is isn't you know is an investment of of like social value and then also like you know knowledge acceleration and yeah and so you know I think there's um you know how I think this question of of efficient you know our jobs efficient at outputs I think it's a it's such a fascinating it's such a fascinating question it feels like it's almost a holdover a little bit from from web 2 and from this idea of escape velocity and just like constantly up and to the right that it's true that we do need we do need to um we do need to be able to allocate this this Capital that we have that we're able to to uh pool really quickly because of because of this new technology and I think that the real Innovation actually does lie in in how we uh allocate that Capital right and so at Sea Club um the the value or sort of the investment that we're able to offer is is around that piece of Innovation is like how how are you actually thinking about allocating allocating that Capital to your community and bringing value back to your community and then also how are you what are what are like the most innovative ways to um to to build with your community and to create meaningful work together so and you know I think I think there's you know you know that that's that's like a it's a it's a more like quality level type of investment and it is it is very high touch right um and and it's like a little bit along the lines of like do things that don't scale and do things that are actually gonna to be really aligned and produce something that's that's really of quality and also align with the the ultimate value proposition of web three right which is the Democratic um opportunity for ownership of these of these networks that we're building no amazing um yeah and I guess in that goal everybody is aligned because it kind of compared to the alternative which you kind of talked about something like there are no other avenues where you get the same opportunity and uh not even just the binary notion of having the opportunity or not but also at the scale um which you don't get to sort of pursue and that is definitely unique here and we're kind of figuring out how do we actually behave uh as individuals whether it's representing the values to uh to representing kind of uh the outcomes so um sounds like we need a second second talk sometime in the future to figure out how do we actually actually track if we've been actually progressing or not um I do have a couple of smaller questions um uh I'll kind of kind of start off by uh maybe asking each of you there's about 1500 hackers actually 1700 hackers for this event um they're building a lot of incredible tools um for usually things that they're they're excited about but as you kind of go about your kind of day to days here like what are some of the the missing things you've seen that would really benefit whether it's on the tooling side or processes side or just things that developers can do to help make your lives easier uh what kind of comes to mind I think well maybe some like Alpha from imcon this week um is that like everyone is talking about verified credentials um you know like I think the idea of like and to me that's been a very clear end of governance you know from the beginning as you have this liquid token that anyone can buy and then you have these credentials that are slapped on top based on you know your expertise or how long you've been involved and that gives you more governance weight right as far as I'm concerned that's the end state of all tokens you know across the ecosystem and I think you know like what it's been insane the level of buzzword that verified credentials or whatever else we're going to call them um you know has been this week and I think that any Builder listening or you know hanging out building around that topic I think is a very very interesting space which is basically sold about nfts right they're all the same thing doubt non-transferable doubt shares it doesn't matter you know which way you spin it the day that you're addressed can sort of have some uh reference which can be used inside of governance or other coordination efforts very sick and going to become very important yeah something that we that I I think about all the time especially especially from the media and at Sea Club but it also it infiltrates I think everything we do in in Dao work is how do we actually how can we actually communicate directly with our with our token holders whether that's an ERC uh erc20 or an ESU 721 like what is how how can you actually get that direct connection to those token holders and it just seems like it seems like a very sticky and also slippery area of work right because there's you know you have you then get into this whole Rabbit Hole of yeah of of just like you know data how you capture that data how are you storing it and um what are you doing with it uh but but I think that there is a real Rich opportunity there to figure out how we can directly communicate and add value to the folks who are who hold tokens I actually think that was a project at East New York um cardigan it was one of the finals it's a recurring theme that I would say largely remains unsolved so um that's a really really good point and I think both of those it's really really interesting to you know reflect on how much we've been playing with these things throughout the years and now finally we're getting two stages where potentially the tech is already and the people are already and the ideas are there to actually make them something that does provide value right we've done this so many times like I remember there's so many different experiments that we were doing with like reputation and that gives you this and you can do this with if you have this token that's minted for this project and so on I mean God I was doing this stuff in like 2018 and people are like what but it's very very important um to look at actually what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give a a kind of bit of advice or a prompt for everybody building I would say elevate your intentions about what you're building don't just build something that is I don't know done before or something that is Buzzy or something that is um on Trend build something that you genuinely care about that your community the community that you come out of cares about look at something that can be uh that can generally make things better for whatever it is that you're interested in and Elevate that intention so that it does become something that we like moves us that step further into what we're trying to do here which is dare I say enable access to resource for everybody and redesign the little lines in the sand or in the cement that we have just been forced to live with for so long that would be my kind of prompt for everybody in the very very timely and uh wise um all right last question and we'll uh kick this off to the to the next talk but uh how can people get involved in in your community um well I'll start with Steph with C Club what's the best way for people to find out and look for a plug anything you'd like yeah I mean you know definitely of course like you know follows on all the socials right Twitter follow get into her newsletter um find us on Discord get us get in there introduce yourself um and also if you if you're a dow Builder if you're a community Builder apply to the accelerator you know we we just we're just in the process of finalizing um our our next cohort for SEO five but there will be an SEO six there will be an SEO 7 and and onward and we just we really want to see um excited new Innovative Builders come through so we're at C Club HQ on Twitter uh and you can you can find us all the places from there thanks yeah um I'd say the best way to get involved is to participate in Wildfire um which the best way to do that is go to my Twitter and it's a pin tweet uh blockchain James and that's sort of a governance Collective you know so that's there's a thousand dollar people on the Discord um but sort of four key working groups focused on 12 odd 13 odd different projects um the likes of ens that were speaking earlier optimism seed Club is sort of lightly tied in you know but there's actually a lot of opportunity here and if you're Keen to join you know any of these Dows in any of these communities you know whatever your skill sets are going to the Discord and just Spam them and start adding value and like you will be onboarded um or you know hit me up on Twitter and say hey I'm doing something cool and I'm not getting free tokens and I'll abuse them thanks guys um and kind of same pattern um Twitter has all of the handles of all of the different things I'm just at Sim underscore pop one of the main things that I would say um check out Colonel they have very good cohorts of onboarding into whip three for individuals and teams it's a great great program it's that initiation that kind of leads you through um learning about web 3 but also from a from a very um principles aligned way which because I mentioned Elevate intentions that ensures that you'll learn about things like in a in a very good way um obviously Bitcoin um there's a link there get into the Discord there's so many different working uh work streams there's so many interesting things that those guys are doing um and then yeah everything's in there so yeah good luck thank you for uh thank you Simona James and Steph and I really appreciate you coming over and uh having this amazing conversation with us thanks Karthik Thanks James bye all right we are ready for our next talk and this is going to be an exciting one we're going to talk about some margin calls to actions on how do we think about the evolution of Dallas communities and governance in what three and I want to welcome our speaker Parker um to uh get us started and uh appreciate you waiting welcome hi I'm super happy to be here I have something to screen share today um amazing cool foreign [Music] sorry trying to figure out how to present it's a little hard to see uh I guess if you can just um leave it like this if you guys are able to see her slideshow perfect great um starting off with a quick intro um super happy to be here today I'm Parker I'm very involved in the crypto space across a few different contexts um I'm on the founding team of boys club which is a social club community in Dao working to welcome women in non-binary individuals into web 3. you can check us out on Twitter at boys club crypto um I'm also working as an early stage investor in crypto startups at fintech Collective on their T5 fund and specifically work there with our Founders one-on-one to help them build skill and design their communities so everything from um pre-launch to even like communities and protocols later on abdao is helping them rethink their governance structures Etc um so today what am I going to be talking about I have a lot of thoughts um and feelings and ideas around how we can be doing better um in sort of the Frameworks and assumptions that we um are approaching Taos community and governance around um so this is going to be pretty high level um and where we only have um about 30 minutes here um I don't know if we have a timer but um for the mods definitely let me know um when we get to like 10 minutes if that's okay with you um to kick things off um I wanted to talk about Dao's great things um so Dawes have gotten huge right like we're seeing new doubts spun up every day um we're seeing web two companies want to make doubts at least I'm seeing this in in my work as a VC also um you know a lot of like Founders will will pitch their startup will put your product um and mention um that they're also creating about um this to me is sometimes like a little bit of a a jarring statement because Dows are such a huge project right like they're almost like starting a second um startup I think if you're doing it right um and so Dao is as a concept I've gotten huge even though they're so new but they're still failing massively in several ways right they're failing to get off the ground um we're seeing classic coordination failures um low participation um low engagement um and even when success is found um Dows are imploding right um you know we could point to uh some of maker house recent struggles um with governance I don't think maker is a failure but they are facing struggles so big established now is that are sort of the name of the game even or um encountering like a lot of a lot of issues um and so where are we really going wrong here I think there's a few things that I'd like to draw our attention to here today um I think a lot of uh a lot of Dow building are sort of thinking around doll building that I'm seeing today focus is on outcome um rather than meet or rather than demand um so we're seeing a lot of people um that want to spin up down that have ideas for Taoist um but don't have the actual Community or participants um to start with um we're also seeing a lack of intrinsically motivated participants within does right so we're seeing a lot of dows that have um a lot of members a lot of participants um but not a lot of participation and a lot of Engagement especially long term um and then we're seeing a lot of uh out of the box composition right so um lots of tooling startups um that are just like easily spin up your own doubts um no hit on that but I think there is um a little bit of lack of like Nuance um instead of the in some of the jobs that are being created right so I'm not fully thinking through um all of the design pieces um that that make up it out and that will will uh greatly affect how the doubt operates in the future um or maybe not even knowing what those pieces are really um that that need um that need a lot of thoughtful consideration um so what are some things that we could do or some Frameworks we could use to try to approach um some of these issues that I just mentioned um I think first um validating Demand right startups Auto on product 101 same for guys same for Community Building um I'm I'm a firm believer that Community should come before the Dow um once again we're seeing a lot of people who want to create doubts um and are looking to find the community to fit into the doubt offer I don't think that works I think you need a community that um that a dow will only only bring value to right so um another important thing here right would be asking why are we even creating it out um do we need Adele for this use case or for this community um or is the motivation to create one maybe um motivated by um a bid for relevancy right trying to stay relevant or um trying to follow the buzz this is a hard question to answer and it takes a lot of I don't think you can even answer it like right away like it takes a lot of thoughtful consideration writing um talking to other people to really understand like why do we need a doubt why are we doing this um for boys club um we're creating a doubt uh to enhance what's already working really well within boys club right um which is a lot of participation a lot of different ideas a lot of different segments and pockets of our community that want to spin up different things so the Dow structure which we're still iterating on we're still taking very very slowly um the data structure though allows us to um super efficiently um or at least more efficiently than before a streamline um ideas from the idea stage into actual execution um it allows us to make sure that um there's there's not as much uh imbalance of power or say in the dictation of where the community goes in the future optimizing for sustainability over speed would be a second one again I think we're seeing a lot of out of the box Solutions people that promise you know use this toolkit spin up your dial in a few days in a week we'll get everything set up um I think uh dollars should take a very slow approach um I'm very bullish on experimentation and iteration and also research um so when uh boys club was founded I immediately knew like the Dao aspect is what I wanted to kind of focus on um and it's been like eight or nine months since then the Dow is not done um and I was expecting this to be maybe like a three to four month process um but after three or four months I was not even done with the research phase of like the process of Dow building um and this is because I wanted to really you know there's so much information about how is there's so many different ways to create them we also don't have a current body of literature um formalize the body of literature around Tao is endow building um so there's a lot of like uh like personal initiative research that you'd have to do um and I think like sustainability is really important right so when you think about your community um and how to build a dow that's sustainable for them um you I think it's best to really take it slow right test and iterate these processes before you decide to implement them um and test them and iterate many different processities before you decide to agree uh to implement them um with this comes like a willingness to look Beyond traditional methods um out of the box Solutions and maybe people who um want you to build your doubt with them in a week um might suggest the most traditional or like why it be accepted methods um for um participation uh participation streams for governance design um for token a model or to economic model um I strongly believe that like every Dao is different and needs a different thing just like every person has different preferences in um Personal Taste personal style in um what works best for them and what's best for them in health and in in their diet and in their workout routine um those are similarly different and the communities are similar literally different and need different things um so yeah like I sort of think about Dow building in a very like nerdy way like almost kind of like a science experiment like there's all these different variables um and all these different things that have to fit together in factors that influence each other um to uh to drive the outcome of the of the experiment um and there's many different like things that you have to like sort of fine-tune within that experiment um to make it right um moving on to Dow governments um lots of thoughts here I'm going to give a very high level overview um so I think like the current mental model of governance endows generally in the space today um is token or coin voting so this would be like um when I buy a token um for example I have governance rights is how it works in um to always like maker other dogs where um there's no kind of opt-in to governance it's just like when you have a token you are automatically eligible to participate um I think like we're also seeing a lot of proven failures of this system though right so like even metallic like recently published um a piece against uh token voting and sort of providing some alternative ideas around it but it's still um the most widely accepted and thought of um governance mechanism in this space day at least as I see it um so I'm seeing recently like a lot of project section of doubts and a lot of rejection of um Dow governance you know a lot of people on crypto Twitter are saying dabs don't work doubs don't work as the business model they're a failure it's proven and I'm like no guys like token voting is um maybe not the proven failure but not working right and that's the thing that's the similarity across these doubts that you're pointing to as examples right um so I think we have an urgent call to action to explore other kinds of um governance mechanisms and you know really focus uh more resources on um experimentation research um and just like iteration on alternative and emergent forms of governance um one I'm really excited about is uh conviction voting which is sort of a mechanism of staking your vote gaining more uh gaining more power over time or wait over time um and you know I think we need governance mechanisms that really capture more of the Dynamic nature of humans so like a snapshot voting uh proposal works right but um information new information is revealed over time 10 minutes okay thank you new information is revealed over time human change over time their opinion change over time um so that should be able in my opinion to be reflected within governance decisions um and I'm like where's the disconnect right like there's actually a lot of really great um peer-reviewed research academic research on emergent forms of governance and on some of the um ways in which um current mechanisms of governance uh are failing um but these don't have widespread attention in crypto um so there is this disconnect and I'm wondering like how can we work um to begin to not only continue exploring alternate um mechanisms of governance um but also like begin to change and shift the mental models um of governance um within the crypto Community to see governance as this plethora of options and also has this completely um unexplored and open design space that still exists rather than um accepting governance endow governance as um something that's failing currently um so I could get into Community it's something I talk about a lot I have lots of thoughts here as well but um I guess like I don't know if the child is open I do want to pause and like open to any questions uh so far um is that possible oh we'll uh we'll Source in anything that comes in from uh from the attendees but um in the meantime I kind of continue uh with the rest of the slides awesome great um Community like a very nebulous word um and when there are a lot so um Community is not fluff let's like let's get this straight Community it's crucial especially in crypto right um in a bearer Market in tough times um what is holding your protocol up right if you have a token um you need that price up right and so like your community is going to be the one powering that but I think Community goes Way Beyond just Financial incentive as well like um there's a lot of big green energy and during the uh crypto community space and I think we're really beginning to see um how sticky Community is and like Community if Done Right can be a an absolute leverage um for every aspect of your business in every aspect of what you're building right these are your evangelists these are these are owners these are people that will be contributing in the future and providing you feedback um but I think too many in the space currently missed a community for marketing and I think sometimes Community is marketing and that's great I mean there is some crossover right um but it's not always marketing and I think it's a fatal flaw to to View Community as marketing um here's why I also think it's kind of cringe here's why um marketing is all about uh capturing users right and getting your brand out there and like Community inherently um if it's successful will work as a marketing engine um but if you treat Community like marketing when you're first trying to think about how to build it and how to sustain it it's never going to work because um you're going to need to see kundi as an ecosystem right it's ever evolving um and it's ground up um so you need like a sustainable Foundation um in order to build a community that in turn can be a marketing engine for you um and I think there's like a several sub process here which I'll just briefly sort of walk through and how I think about Community Building both at boys club and when I'm working with some of my portfolio companies have been to Collective so I think the first step is defining what you are like what is your community about and also like what is it not about um what do you stand for what do you not stand for I think getting as niche as possible here is really helpful um once you understand what you're all about what your community is all about um and what you want people to get from it and take away from it and learn from it um you need to attract those members um so like top of funnel awareness right um and once you have sort of like had those first community members trickle in um you want to activate them sorry this should say activate um so start finding ways to get them comfortable get them involved have them injure themselves make sure they have all the resources they need to succeed and be able to navigate the community and all the things that it provides um and then you'll start to see people who like actively want to get more involved maybe a little pigeon with ideas maybe develop feedback maybe they'll come to you one-on-one and you want to like harness that power because that is like magical energy and there's like a special window of time that you need to capture that energy within so then involving them right giving them more responsibility maybe Azure Community skills um they can take notes on Community College they can um jump in um to moderate um finding ways to to give them more responsibility and finally um giving them responsibility and opportunity um for ownership so enabling ownership um and I think like I guess to close out this sort of high level segment here um a lot of uh companies that I work with um when we start working together immediately say like we want to optimize for ownership and building our community um but I think one thing that's too often overlooked is like all the steps um that it takes to set up ownership and it's almost like that Meme of like the guy with the Domino and like the many dominoes um like you need to first um know what your community is about then attract those numbers then activate them then involve them um to enable um sustainable ownership in my experiences in it um so yeah I think that's like pretty much it for me um but and if if there are any questions happy to answer them um I can go deeper into any of these subjects um but yeah I'm at Parker j-a-y-p on Twitter if you want to chat follow me to yummy I'm around um yeah and super happy to be here thank you guys for having me thanks Parker no that was that it was very insightful and uh and also uh a little bit spicy I think uh it's just some uh some good uh direct and actionable things uh that we can talk about uh maybe my kind of first question would be um I I think um or rather how do you differentiate between like knowing what to do and sort of how do we get there um we kind of uh talked about a lot of things that you've seen firsthand not work um as well as uh either people think or or you uh yourself uh thought they would uh is is this largely a mindset thing is this largely a tooling issue is this largely something that we have to kind of instill at the beginning like at what point of the process of a lifetime of a member joining a community do these things need to be addressed and and sort of how would you kind of think about um backtracking and implementing where these things should be uh actually put in yeah that's a great question so obviously I take a very method methodological approach to community building and I I don't think that's like bad and I think like sometimes people are a little bit shy to take like kind of uh almost like strategic approach but I do think you know there are like ways to activate your knee it's not necessarily like extractive um I think just like keeping these things in mind throughout the process I think it is sort of a framework and I wouldn't say mindset but more of a framework um that they can be re-evaluated over time so like at any point in the process right even if you already have a community and you've had one for two years and never even thought about this you can still sort of walk through this and think through this and um look for like the sort of user Journey or pipeline within your community um and I don't think it's a one-size-fits-all approach like the way that um you know certain communities might uh work to attract their members or like Define what they're about might be different from others and that's okay but it's sort of like the general idea and just like hitting those steps making sure they're accounted for um that I think is important does that answer your question uh yeah it definitely does and and maybe um one kind of other uh follow-up would be uh do you think there are not do you think I guess what are some examples that others should uh shamelessly steal from like who do you have have you seen has done a really good job at implementing some of the changes that you proposed uh in addition to obviously kind of a view but uh what are some of like the nice ways to kind of understand if this is working in practice and and kind of contrasting with the alternatives sure that's a great question I think there are a lot of um great communities out there that are each you know doing uh like have strengths in different ways I don't think there's anyone that's nailed this down perfectly and that also is just inherent to the fact that communities are ever changing and their their needs are ever-changing um I I really admire um you know some of the the work actually done by um a woman not in the web three not on the Webster's face um but named Priyanka Parker so I read I read her book The Art of gathering which actually focuses on like in real life events and community building in real life um and I I loved the way that she um broke down almost like the art of the literally the art of gathering and and bringing people together um in a very thoughtful and strategic way and like she almost the way that I talked about Dow building Community Building as an experiment like I saw her view Gathering as an experiment so she like lays out like all these different um almost like experience that she's done about um you know the the amount of people that you bring in and what kind of atmosphere that creates um intention setting explicitly before the event um how to make people feel comfortable like like methodologies literally um that she is that she's like refined and opposed to and put together in different ways um so like that that thinking I really love um and yeah like I mean they're like I'm like so many great communities out there um Moji Moji dog game has done a great job of World building I think that's also that's something I should have put in this presentation but World building is like an essential aspect of community in my mind and um Mochi has done like a beautiful like Illustrated magical job of that um govern the governing Community is great um Aaron Stefan are great they're constantly iterating like we're working with them and they're constantly coming to us with feedback questions like um I love like the thoughtful and like long-term approach that they take um yeah so many Greenies I could I could gosh about but um yeah right now we have another question from the audience uh which is uh what are your thoughts on uh proven corporate structure and kind of do you think if somebody found a way to easily merge those kind of proven ways to uh to behave or operate at scale uh with Canada formations like would that actually make things easier or do you kind of you know we reject some of those existing things that's a great question um okay so I guess to answer that I'll say first of all um I'm taking my own opinion over the grain of salt um there's actually a book that I'm that I just ordered on Amazon to read about this um and it goes over this uh like thing called the teal structure um that I've read about uh uh in Rook protocols um let's see if I can put this in the chat I really loved um the way that I was reading this and I love the way that they were thinking about uh I just put it in the chat um community building so like they they think about it as almost very similar to Orca protocol love Orca love the Orca Community that's by the way as well um but like modular and um delegated decision making but they borrow at least within protocols documentation this corporate kind of uh method of like the teal structure I I need to read more about it which is why I ordered the book that they cited it from but um I think it could work I mean it sounds it actually when I read it I was like this sounds a lot like what we're doing in boys club but I didn't even know that this existed right um so I don't know it could work um I think like like there are proven things that work in corporate structures um I personally have been more involved in like this startup kind of world so I I don't really come from that experience but um I yeah I mean why not I guess but again I think every every Dowling Community is different so like I don't think a corporate structure would be the best for everyone absolutely um and uh our last question which uh interestingly comes from our next speaker um and that is do you think tokens help uh with Community Building no I don't I think it's really concerning um when people think that it does so let me just quickly explain my thinking here um I think it's a fail flaw to to use a community to sorry I think it's a fatal flaw to use a token as a way to try to pull to bolster either marketing um brand awareness relevancy brand exposure or community building and like Community activity um I am of the personal belief not reflective of my organization boys club or like my firm but um personal belief that you should wait as long as you can to launch a token um I think like finding product Market fit really hard building a successful sustainable active Community really hard um launching a token really hard and not you come after you've found product Market fit and after you have a community and like that's because the token relies on those other things as well so like to set the token up for Success like you need to have the most solid foundation possible I mean I think we've seen like across the board also like there's examples of this right like communities and projects and and protocols and companies that launch a token like when they're first starting out or launch a token to help the product um are usually like literally just going coin America Gap and like look through you know um so no I don't think I don't think tokens help community building but I do think like if there is a successful sustainable strong community and a token is launched those should work to reinforce each other as a flywheel so like they can help each other but from like visual incentive yeah yeah awesome uh well um thank you so much for that amazing talk and and going into all those questions um really appreciate you taking the time and uh with that we are ready for our next speaker thank you guys so much um have a great day you too all right next up we have kaido talking about how do we better use tools to measure our large treasury so without further Ado let's welcome kaido hi hi Karthik thank you for inviting me back again it's great to be here but it's going to be hard speaker let me share my screen really quick all right does this look good to you guys everything is good all right perfect so today I'm talking about Treasury and then the general system of sustainability of Dallas specifically from a treasury standpoint I know I'm talking at a hackathon so I want to in the end inspire people to build different things this is a talk I give uh in May before the the crashes happen so I hope you know there's some updates here and then some lessons I've learned definitely along the way and you know some updates as in uh some project I've mentioned in the past I've uh decided to cease their business and go elsewhere so it could be some interesting things to look through their Journeys and see how we can learn from there all right before I begin I want to give a quick tldr about myself why I'm interested in this uh different work and why you should listen to me so right now I work at incentive design lava and get coin and my working Compass you know from governance design tokenomics to liquidity management my goal is to in the end Help Dallas to achieve their Vision in this you know very cyclical crypto market and at llama uh we build economic infrastructure for Dallas and you know here are some projects we've worked in the past previously you know when I first started in crypto I I was with Trader Joe's which is a which is the text on Avalanche uh and I was there working on token incentive to help different projects liquidity and Trader Joe started uh when I was you know when I was like right here so when I first joined Trader Joe had around 40 50 million tvl and when I left we had about 1 billion tvl and also in my free time I started writing different design pieces on how do we think about different token incentives and how can we build sustainable uh business structures with tokens and this you know main interest of me basically Sparrow my time my Trader Joe where I sell numerous projects blow up overnight and then slowly die out very quickly because they didn't have a robust incentive structure or even a product so I hope you know through my my time at Trader Joe law the learning lessons I could share with you guys through this talk and think about how do we build different uh projects that can help Dao sustain further and this is a design I did with FWB to help there with their liquidity design so let's start with the goals you know for for the talk so number one is I'll give you the nuts and bows for you know what is the protocol Treasury and why you know why should I build on top of it I give the talk last May a lot of people have thought about it it was great I want more people to be building on top of it think about sustainable sustainable Dow development second thing is you know what are the current Solutions you know before you build anything you want to look at what other people are doing and how should we innovate on top of it lastly is of course well you should what can you build and in the end I hope this is a fun and actionable talk uh in the end uh after hearing the talk I hope there's some ideas flowing around feel free to reach reach out to me on Twitter I'm always happy to talk different folks and help you on your journey so first what is protocol Treasury and you know what is the problem protocol treasury by definition just assets owned by the protocol for future development the common usage of Treasury assets can be split into three different categories I would this is my definition personal for a personal experience number one instagram programs and the goal of grant program is to incentivize people to build on top of your own protocol because crypto by nature is open source and everyone can view it and becomes possible and build on top of each other grant program is really important to build a strong developer ecosystem or even product Suite around your core protocol second is ecosystem building this is specifically talking about partnership with other protocols this can be achieved through many levels but the main one maybe we have experiment the mode with its token swaps to try to align Financial incentive to further or even deepen a relationship between protocols lastly is very underlooked which is budgets I think the the main use of Treasury nowadays is for budgeting and budgeting by by definition is to cover the cost of operation salaries marketing events and Outreach for protocols to grow and you know what is the problem here so the opportunity spacing in protocol treasury is gigantic currently there's 9.5 billion dollars in protocol Treasury and it has increased more than 10x in the past 10 months and very interesting enough uh what we saw is that uh even though uh my last stack was you know may which is almost four months ago and there's a lot of fluctuation in prices protocol treasury has not decreased that much it stayed around to 10 billion mark and here's a list uh about you know all the different uh protocol tokens that unisoft have and you can see right here unusual is 99 of its own uh Native token and they don't really have much ethereum or even USD which is you know sort of less volatile than uh than unisoft's native token so you know when I when I first saw this I thought oh my God these you know projects have so much money and then you know they they they should be doing great and then I realized most of these Protocols are native token and maybe native tokens are not the best thing because it's not liquid it's hard to sell and you know you introduce a lot of different weird incentives on you know managing your treasury so I was thinking you know is this is the only unit swap or is there a lot of different dials facing the same problem as it turns out it's definitely the the the same the same problem across many Dows so uni has a larger treasury uxd which is a stable coin protocol on uh Solana also has this problem they have 600 million dollars of uh Treasury and you know 99.4 percent of them are in their native tokens and same even you know one of the most established Dallas maker is also having the same problem where most of their treasuries make up uh Native tokens and light off on the other hand is probably the one that has the most ethereum or even just stable quote of stable Assets in strategy and we can see 10 of it seen uh ethereum and another 1.6 percent is in state eth and so I think the the message here is quite clear where uh we we have a big problem we have a big Market in the in the protocol treasury space but we have a big problem at the same time where most of them are in Native tokens and this is another graph from mango talking about uh how much you know they have which is very interesting because not a lot of people know about mango but they actually have you know 5 50 million of usds in their Treasury so you know I talked about why native token is not the greatest thing I want to dive a little bit deeper into it and talk about why High concentration of native token in protocol treasury has big problems and there are two main big problems and the first one is you know crypto is a volatile market so there can be sharp decreases in crypto treasury value for example these treasury values can decrease 50 or even 95 over you know three month period very very fast this is a graph of unit Swap and we can see decrease around 60 percent in the last six months and second is why High concentration of data token Is Not Great is because for any protocol to achieve this Vision it needs to continue to grow and this growth mostly comes from cash but not native token you know in a simplified example below let's say uh we can see you know protocol treasury rewards people who drive the growth of the protocol right so the treasury rewards people and people drive squirrels because they build on top of it where they do different Outreach but the people in the end have to you know pay for their utilities pay for their rents pay for their food so they have to trade with the market to get usdc or eth which is more uh liquid assets for them to offboard and you know a caveat on top of it which you can think of as a third small point which is uh okay yeah this is a this is an example this is an example where if you want to sell one percent of unisoft's Treasury it would cost the unit soil price to decrease 40 just to tell you how in liquid the market is for these native token native assets and you know it's very very hard to to convert them into cash and pay contributors lastly it's probably uh you know a small caviar building on top the second point which is the Huddle versus sustainability uh dilemma because imagine you are you're a protocol you're telling your friends and your family to to join the community to become become a part of the Dao and at the same time you know let's huddle to the to the Moon of a moon opportunity but at the same time you're like oh but we had to sell all the treasury tokens for usdc otherwise we can um we can't function so essentially you're using your your token holders as sort of a semi-form of exit liquidity which has by by Design very hard marketing and Community Management aspect to it so you know one question naturally arrives you know we have this huge amount of money in inside different protocol treasury is there any way we can generate cash from it right whether it's you can be selling tokens very directly or is there any other way we can generate cash so I would love to first you know give the current potential solutions for protocol Treasury and the way I put potential because some projects may not be live or even no they have not gained significant attractions and I divided these you know Solutions into three categories based on their based on sort of difficulty of understanding this categorization is not meant to be you know which layer is better than the others because many times a simpler solution just wins however I do believe without words doing the searching phase in which you know we're trying to find more optimized solutions to handle protocol treasuries and on the bottom uh are the low hanging fruits you can see that uh these Solutions uh are already established and have been utilized by protocols quite extensively in the middle are traditional Finance Solutions these Solutions follow existing ideas from corporate finance Implement them into uh different ideas on chain and lastly on top of it are some sort of like crypto native Solutions or innovative solutions where these Solutions are you know less utilized in the traditional world but with brain promising ideas through the crypto world and you know there's a lot of different names here there's a lot of different projects I can see some some projects being blurred out in black and white the only black and white logo I found for Xerox uh protocol they're still live they're still doing well but for protocol uh Porter finance and fake protocol unfortunately since the last time I made this slide they have you know seized their operation they have not you know uh moved forward as a down decided to stop working on their uh respective uh products however I think there's a lot of interesting ideas in this slide so I'm going to do a quick rapid fire of different ideas people I've been thinking about how do we you know diversify our Treasury the way I want to describe different uh designs is through you know what is the past how people are doing this problem in the past what is the problem here and how is this specific project going to help or trying to uh change on top of it so uma's success token is a way to uh to deal with the OTC that you know OTC deals are buying at uh buying at cheaper prices so normally when protocols sell is treasury one way they do it is through a accredited investor or a fund sometimes where people you know the fund or the person buy uh treasury tokens either lower valuation but at a higher lockup the problem with this design is that it's really hard to generate Community buy-in because people always feel like quote unquote they're going to be on beer they're going to be done they're going to be dumped down so Uma is a way to align those incentives where instead of buying at a lower price you get more upside so as surprise increases you get sort of this like linear bonus of more tokens where you can claim after a specific strike price and I think this is a very interesting idea and we might you know require some data oracles but it normally is not going to be a huge problem for the dials to handle I think it's going to be a very interesting way to see their their design to get more implemented in the dial space to for a protocol treasury diversification second is a log streaming auction so in the past token cells are always with a fixed price so for example Lido the Lido uh Dow treasury diversification is a great example where this they sold a lump sum of Lido for a fixed amount of cash the problem is is generally very hard to agree on a token sale price for a community and we can see it as a from the second proposal from dragonfly where there's a lot of discussions about like what is the correct terms and how should we think about different things so log is a way to essentially do continuous streaming auction where people can commit capital and withdrew unlocked capitals at any time the way is to find a market clearing price for a set of tokens um during each epoch and to sort of uh achieve it in a way where people where this mechanism can absorb different price volatility and form a long-term uh price stability for treasury diversification next one is Phase turbo unfortunately Faye has decided to stop building on top of the products but the the code base is still there I think people can definitely still innovate on top of it and find different ways to uh work on this problem so in the past protocols can you know you can't really collateral collateralize your native token so what I mean by collateralizing it is deposit your token into Ave or any of other uh money markets and borrow USD or usdc on top of it and the reason why you can't do that is that most protocols do not meet the risk parameters because you know for for any assets to be considered a collateral it has to be uh vetted extensively by the Ave Community to make sure you know you don't you don't introduce that debt into the system and what they achieves to do is to uh collateral against your own token and you can earn interest on top of it through turbo so instead of you know borrowing usdc and use usdc whatever way you can you can only use use usdc in different uh um eo-bearing asset standards so you know for example if your token value decrease too fast and you need to be collateral you need to be liquidated you can do it in a much more efficient way or you know quote-unquote you don't really get liquidated because you know uh the protocol controls your collateralized assets at the same time next is ribbon's treasury uh so in the past you know most protocol just do not have a diversification plan right what time shall we sell our tokens how much we sell uh that's going to be a very difficult discussion to have once you're in the bull market but right now we're we're in a bear market so it's much easier for us to agree on how should we diversify yeah ribbons acid is just to cover Cobalt which essentially employment uh playing uh men's term is that we decide on when we're gonna sell stuff let's say right now uh let's say we're in the uni swap fund we're in the unit swap Dao and we think okay we should sell unit swap when unit swap 2X and let's sell you know one million of unit Swap and that's essentially you can you can call that up in a ribbon Vault and then you know sell this option to different people and people can buy it as an option uh as an option to get exposure to the upside you know other than the 2X now you know this is a very very fast rapid fire I hope you you guys are still with me uh there's the whole point of the rapid fire is to give you some ideas people are building and also show you how Innovative people are thinking about how can we build different structures for uh Financial aspect of things on the Dow treasury although some projects are not specifically dial focused but a lot of it going to be used by has been used very extensively for dials for example ribbon where I mentioned at the last a lot of their customers actually are Dallas who are trying to generate yield on a passive manner so now comes to the question you know what can you build right there's a lot of ideas flowing around I talked to a lot about a lot of ideas what can you build so this is a graph you know I showed before you know uh on when I was mentioning these you know Solutions I mentioned you know their only potential a lot of these tools are extremely extremely hard for developers to understand who does not you know especially the other person who does not have a strong Finance background and guess what most Dell developers are like are like that because you know not everyone comes from a finance background so the the trade-off between you know there's a lot a lot of protocols have a lot of uh parameter you can tune and there but it's very hard to visualize how those parameters can have impact on different things and the second is you know the adoption of these system your protocol treasury is still very very low and that could be a very key point where just very hard to talk to developers or even General community members on what does these things do and then uh how can we visualize the effects of different parameters on the end result so what can you build I think the number for the first thing is that it's important to decrease the trust assumptions for different interactions we have I think we're thinking about uh treasury diversification and what I mean by this is you know you can codify different agreements on train sorry so there are two very straightforward ideas that I have not seen a great implementation that has you know a lot of attractions so there are two kinds of contract I think will be you know very suitable for this kind of uh this kind of idea to decrease trust assumption so number one is token swap contract so token swap essentially is a way for protocol to exchange their token treasuries uh with different protocols to build partnership for example unisop can exchange with Ave so they have a sort of like Alliance because they hold each other's token the second one is uh p-i-p-e that's a fancy way of saying a public a private entity won't swinging by investing a public entity sort of like a lighter situation where a lot of different funds wants to buy a large chunk of Lido tokens through the open market and you can do it you know in a one-time thing or you can do it in a streaming kind of uh way where you know these different funds can put money in and out and they'll be very interesting you know dynamic on top of it and I think a lot of these are not you know meant to be uh uh a product per se in the end for the end user because many times the people who interact with these kind of contracts or products are going to be uh developers or very experienced investor who understand you know these different contracts so you know for number one I would say you know a private a public repo would be the ideal solution for this the second is to decrease the coordination friction so basically what I mean by what I mean is basically two kids to manage these you know different contracts or different strategies and this is what I what I meant when I was talking about you know this solutions are really Innovative but really hard for people to understand so how can you decrease the coordination friction between the people who are building the products and the people who are who will be using these Innovative products in the future two very simple ways our number one is simulators for payouts as in how what if things change this much what is our payment what is our gain what is you know what we're missing out can we justify we're missing out on that and second it's probably a lot you know very underrated uh thing which is front ends a lot of people interact with the blockchain through front ends so it's really important for us to build easy to understand front ends to not only educate developers and also even maybe users on how do we understand these different tools and Lastly lastly uh I think it should bring existing Concepts into the crypto world I think we're still very very early in the in the in the in the stage of crypto uh uh speedrunning through history so I think we're still trying to onboard different ideas we have tried in the in the in the world that has worked what has not worked maybe you know some didn't work in the real world it's going to strive in the in the in the crypto world I think amm is a great example of that so it's really important to for for all hackathon participants to think about different ideas that you've seen in your existing industry you know that have worked or didn't work and want to experiment on top of the crypto World me personally I think crypto is a great space to experiment with real Financial value because the code is very public uh there's trustless execution based on the ethereum blockchain so bring those Concepts onto the crypto world and see what we can build and that is the end of my talk uh thank you guys so much for you know hanging around you can follow me as your ex kaido on Twitter my DM is always always open for if anyone any of you wants to chat about different ideas but thank you so much amazing thank you so much kairo this was actually a very informative even uh even for me because I learned a bunch of new things um one question and we we do have to move on to our next speaker up because of a time constraint but uh could you send us these slides we'll make them public to the attendees and also publish them so um if you can get a copy of them that will be that'd be amazing yeah I definitely will definitely will awesome well thank you so much and I hope to get you involved more in the future awesome thank you guys hope to be back soon have a good one you too take care all right that was kaido talking about treasury management and how to do that more efficiently and next up we have our next video Tina she's going to be talking about Community organizing and party planning 101 from Moon birds and BFF so without further Ado let's welcome uh Tina on stage I'll uh I made you turn your video on and uh get started hi hi thank you guys for having me um I'll start off with a bit of an introduction my name is Tina servilla Lindell I'm a sociolinguist and I work in Community Management and marketing like everybody else who works in web3 at better pretty unconventional background I started off as a sociolinguist focusing in comic book scholarship and using Comics to teach refugees English after leaving the non-profit sector I found myself working in healthcare and pharmaceuticals the one thing that medicine has in common with web 3 is it's a highly technical concept and you're dealing with a pretty naive user base so you ask yourself questions like how can we teach someone as much as possible as efficiently as possible in as little time as possible and how do we help the maximum number of people in the middle amount of time so I had an easy transition in the web free with those Concepts um when I got to what three I entered with truth Labs my partner is one of the founders so I had a very interesting experience as a naive user to see a project from behind scenes and how it builds from there um I was a moderator with them and I slowly entered the space I minted crypto coven and the marketing for that was amazing because when I came on the space was largely for men and crypto coven was the first time I felt a product was marketed to me as a woman now when it comes to Community Management before all of those things before I was on web 3 web 2 sociolinguistics helping out with moon Birds ladybirds BFF I was what I call a I am a party person so I grew up moving around a lot my mom is a Filipino immigrant my dad was an American Military so we moved every three to four years something my mom did that I've carried with me throughout my whole life was whenever we got to a new location she would seek out people like her so other Filipinos and then we'd have a party immediately parties allowed us to meet fellow members of our community people we had like interests in common with and after being in a new country for just a couple weeks we'd already had Child Care Study Buddies play dates people to help us out so when I got older I attended parties like every other weekend so parties are very much just part of my life when I got into high school I was at home I was about 15 years old and I decided one day I really wanted ice cream it was a hot day and stay with me I know it sounds kind of silly um but we didn't have any ice cream at home so my mom would not give me funds to get my own ice cream but I did have permission to use your house for a party and what I did was I invited all of my friends to have a big ice cream social now kind of like token gaining in order to attend my party so I could get ice cream and spend time with my friends attendees had to bring their own ice cream so just like token dating people came by party they brought ice cream they brought syrup they brought sprinkles they all brought something we could share and we all had a great time and from that point I had an ice cream social every summer people attended continuously so particular concept I want something how can I get it and then the reality is if you want something other people probably want it too um so when it comes to web3 how does that work what is my ice cream social analogy have to do with organizing communities online when it comes to people people are simple they won't surprise they want the light they want connection they want belonging and so when I think about bringing people together and getting them stay together I think about parties how do we create a medium for connection that facilitates surprise Delight Joy and this is where party time comes at most people why accept that maybe you didn't have a party every weekend like I did as a kid and maybe you haven't hosted large ones you've probably hosted some kind of event where you invited at least one person to your house or maybe a small group of people pretty much everyone has organized a gathering of some sort so I like to take party planning 101 into mine I want to think about community so when we're hosting a party we ask ourselves several questions one what kind of party are we having so whether you are working for a marketing position or you're literally throwing a party parties have a theme so traditional parties maybe it's a costume party a Halloween party when we're talking about Community organizing and web screen usually your product has to deal with maybe making your own Community surrounded around an nft maybe it's focused on education mental health investing Market analytics you have to decide on your party theme and what's going to be what brings people together once you've decided on your party theme you need to ask yourself who am I inviting to my party who's my target audience so with web3 we ask ourselves what is the level of comprehension for the people I'm inviting into my party are we talking to people who are naive about the topic they have a lot to learn but you're going to teach them are we looking at people who are middle level you're going to call curious or skeptic they have some information but not all of the information they want more information or are we looking at people who are very advanced in their knowledge base so it's all about messaging and crafting the right language for whoever you're inviting maybe you want to cast a wide net and diversify you have to keep that in mind when you talk about who am I inviting to my party next we want to talk about venues where are you hosting your party so in web 3 we ask ourselves what platforms am I using are we having our party are we having our community meet on Discord are we having them meet on Twitter or do we use telegram do we use SMS texting or using all of them are we being multimodal with our approach no matter what you're doing though you have to be clear with your attendees where they're going to be able to find the most resources so when you do choose a venue and the difficult thing with web3 communities is they are very decentralized people have to know where are you going to get the consistent message so venues where are we hosting I do want to share a very fun Parable for my friend alsi who is the marketing director of the Ives over at truth Labs who infamously did not create a Discord from Goblin Town because she loved the fact that Goblin Town was centralized so you don't have to do what everyone else is doing when it comes to hosting your own party it could be what's right for you and right for your community now once you've figured out what kind of party you're having who you're inviting to your party and where you're hosting your party you have to actually ask yourself what are we doing here um are we just hanging out are we going to be providing events recurring themes what are we doing at your party the thing with parties is they have to be self-sustaining once people get on the door a good Community manager will set guidelines for the party and whether that's hosting regular games trivia for current resources you need to decide on what are people actually going to do so in Twitter you might see this through weekly events remember it's toast parliaments on Fridays in Discord you're going to have different sub channels or different groups within your community can connect and create together parties are all about lateral connection people can go in any direction they want as long as they stay within the party so you want to decide on different events on what you're doing now with that we're going to talk about what am I giving people at my party like why are they coming here are we providing connection education career advancement and the thing with good parties is you have to keep doing you can't just set it up and leave so we have seen a lot of projects try and do that in web series but you got to give people a reason to get them to learn and stay in the room Community managers are being called Vibe directors in some instances and I love that term their responsibility is to facilitate Joy surprise delight and dispel fear uncertainty and doubt you want to make sure people are connection and make sure that you don't have any Bad actors and that people are not feeling left out so during the minimal amount of work to make sure the party has the most fun now when it comes to parties to me they are the original decentralized Community whether you're launching a new community breathing new life into one of your own I hope that these guidelines what kind of party are you having who are you inviting to your party where are you hosting it what are you doing I hope these can be of help when you're planning your own community and with that I can't open the questions um about my experience you know I have been working with Moon Birds ladybirds which is a not officially proof but they're one of the sub parliaments when we did that I had joined proof and or Moon Birds after minting and I noticed that there was a lot of chatter I truly want to connect with women and some have found my way with Christine Wu and Shirley lozar for ladybirds we started hosting Twitter spaces and that grew into a real life brunch at nft NYC we were able to host hundreds of women together in the birds and facilitating a real life connection at that in real life party from this online community is one of the highlights which cheer Lazar I've also worked with her to bring people together on Twitter spaces with Alpha Mondays and women on web3 Wednesdays where we've had literally thousands of attendance on our spaces just focusing on Joy and education so yeah it was just great yeah looks like there's an echo never mind um thank you so much for kind of going into essentially the the storytelling I love the analogies and also just not even actually there's a really nice parallelism um but uh uh maybe it kind of zooming out a little bit um to actually kind of think about or and see how this actually applies to how we look at managing Community especially in web3 um I'd love for you to kind of talk about what your role is right now in members and sort of how you are helping uh kind of that scale and and kind of if you were to kind of talk about just how that can be used to be clear like I'm not officially an employee of moon Birds they have multiple subparliaments the ladybirds is one of them and so what ladybirds is it's a um they do accumulative it's a Dei Initiative for women in the community to connect with each other the thing about I love about Peru and how supportive they are is that they really approve of their country their Community being decentralized so they have these various apartment some of them are based off traits or mental wellness fitness ladybirds is All About Women connecting and so where that actually started was right after mint like any other NFC project the Discord was full of a lot of chatter and so I saw a hole where I wasn't connecting with anybody and so I said okay what is something that might then be like connect with that I know other people do around for me being a woman's a big one I like to have another woman in the space I like to seek him out and share connection and so from there Stevie who's the community manager uh director of culture over at proof brought the ladybirds Discord to life I worked with the ladybirds Twitter now I'm part of their team and together we're all able to bring the ladybirds brunch together nft NYC so with that we maintain regular connection something exciting that we're doing as of yesterday is we actually created a community neural of all of the pfts for the ladybirds whether they have an lumbered or an oddity and so one big uh nft edition of us partying together in a treehouse assessor remembers or how to be so which is the amazing thing about nfts and website naturally how big is this uh community and and uh how um how frequently are you sort of meeting in person versus kind of obviously collaborating uh online you know it's hard because our first time meeting in real life was at nftnyc um ladybird started it wasn't long after mint so it had to be late April maybe early May and then nft NYC was in June I'll be honest I've tried to host different in real life meetups here at NYC um another woman and I tried to host a women and moon Birds meet up right before the conference and we had five attendees which we saw an amazing time it was a lot of fun but it was very discouraging I was like wow like Bloomberg's is a huge 10K pfp project there's definitely more than five women in New York city so at first I was very upset like not every party goes according to plan and so when proof reached out and they said they wanted to help bring an in real life event to life I was excited but also I was like hey by the way like I had one and only five people came so let's stay humble um but the demand was amazing we both won venue we sold out within minutes like I think it was two three minutes and all the tickets were gone so that was really exciting um we had a moment of freak out like okay wow like there's a lot of people upset they can't come to this event so we actually opened it up to the venue next door and if I'm correct I think we had over 300 women come to the nft NYC brunch of that like the venue was packed we were shoulder to shoulder we were a little still under the sidewalk uh in the outdoor dining so I do think there's definitely hundreds of women in the community I don't know if it exceeds a thousand or maybe more at least as far as active members but that's one of the most wonderful things that experiences even I was surprised at the connections I was hoping to facilitate and I think that's one of the most amazing things about being a community manager I try to keep the bar low for myself I try my best I always give it 100 but I always require myself for maybe it doesn't work out and when things are amazing it makes it all the better and that's one of the joys of working in community you really never know how people will surprise you so you just do your best to keep surprising them I know for these are the good kind of surprises um but uh you also kind of mentioned uh at the beginning that you came from a very kind of different background it was very interesting to uh well what I would say kind of the web three uh kind of tech sort of pipeline looks like a science is kind of a separate uh different realm um what kind of were things that either were you were delighted with or you thought are kind of unique in a good or bad way that I feel like you can maybe talk about and how was that transition so as far as the transition I was working in medicine I started off as a medical assistant and the thing with Healthcare that the parallel with luxury is very uncanny is you really don't have that much time with the people you're working with so you want to be able to teach them absolutely as much as possible in the minimum amount of time so there was a practice I joined it's a small office we had one physician um and we were a petite practice so we only dealt with like celebrities politicians had the church and state very intelligent often intimidating but also delightful people um but when I came in nobody in the office was technology Savvy we were spending way way too long with people we went to the point of their frustration like when you're teaching someone and they're not getting it they're busy and they gotta go it's frustrating for everyone involved so when I came into this practice it was kind of my wheelhouse for sociolinguistics writing and marketing I came in I reworked how we communicate with patients I created protocols that drafted all the education with one click we had some really great software programs used internal analytics to see how much time we were spending with people doing certain things and just by putting in a little work in a little bit more writing a little bit of software help we were able to double the number of patients we helped in a day without really taking away from their experience and letting them continue on their way how that relates to web3 is we have people who are scrolling on their phones most of the time a lot of the time when we have people they're not sitting on their desktop at all times with multiple browsers with like analytics on one screen and Discord on the other sometimes they are but not always so the challenge is how do we capture people how do we get them to come to our party and so the challenge with people who work in community roles in particular is you really do need to be technically minded and understand that the products that you're working with and take that very high level difficult information to make it as easy to understand as possible how can I say the most with the least words How can I teach the most for the least amount of time and so I think she is yeah I was going to say I mean uh do you do you feel like it's the same Playbook that you can apply for building communities offline versus online or like of course they have shared elements but I I guess I I'm noticing uh things that sort of apply largely to a lot of the IRL groups but how do you kind of think about fostering that for web 3 or by by default you have so many people that are largely mostly online in different parts of the world so when it comes to organizing online um I think my first online community I organized I was actually 12 years old 20 years ago um there's this platform called free webs so it was posted and pre Myspace so we're aging ourselves here to all their cool uh Jen's ears but uh the First Community I ever organized so this is pre-web 3D but the concepts are very much the same I had these friends who were in a punk band and I wanted to connect other people who liked their punk band so I made a music fan page and there was a guest book there and I noticed the guest book was getting a little stale um and just like when you're meeting new people in real life sometimes parties die down and no one's talking and it's awkward so whether it's a quiet Discord just quiet guest book on freewebs.com or no one is hanging out at your inner life event the party planner the community man has to come and say okay how do I fix this problem how do we bring life back into this and so I actually went to this guest for like 12 years old 13. and started making fake accounts and um had little comedy bits I was like a crazy fan girl I was like an angry agent and people came to the guest book and this is 2002 we had AOL Instant Messenger that was not a normal activation people experienced and they're like what in the world is this and this is like pretty catfish too so people would come back into this they'd start talking and then they would even bring those conversations like offline when we came to school and performance art what I was doing then with making these big personalities we actually see that a lot in web3 um whether it's people being themselves and activating beams within their Discord or Twitter we see a lot of interactive puzzles from different communities it's something I really love from working alongside truth they're really big into what they call um their lobsters or puzzle solvers or we see a lot of projects who bring characters from their media and have story lines crafted around them and so I think about what three like while a lot of the products are different when it comes to people people like to connect in the same ways no matter where they're at web 2 web 3 online in real life the social psychology of people is largely the same and so I think you're doing yourself a disservice if you're over complicating it if you're like making very wide crazy strategies I think if you approach people with fun Simplicity Joy if you take away all the fun that they're already dealing with especially in a bear Market when our portfolios are bad you got to get something people good to connect over and connect with and I mean that's an interesting point too right because uh my next question was just okay how do you think about actually maintaining that momentum and excitement when it's either the hypest down or there's been some some Market shift like people obviously do react and sometimes strongly to these types of events but uh how do you sort of make them more resilient to this as part of being together as a group so I think especially in these communities where investing is a large reason why people have come to your party quote unquote it's important that Community managers work with the leadership on their team to craft brand aligned messaging that's more of a traditional marketing approach so when it comes to FUD when it comes to markets being down bad that goes into our public relations damage control category when it comes to people being upset Community matters need to be careful and not to Promise Too Much I'm very big into um put my time in medicine legally compliant language like I've spent a lot of time in compliance they are horribly boring meetings like I'm not into them but they are very important that we keep in mind that you are also honest transparent with your users as much as you can be um you can't always be especially when you have surprises coming down the line that you can't communicate publicly but you do want to be honest and transparent as much as you can that's actually a very interesting thing about web3 is I think in web 2 people could slide by with like very like light messaging like yeah we'll have we'll be fine um people who have three they want action items they want them now like if something's going on the market they could have you know their portfolio go down and 20 minutes later before anyone can really do anything actionable they're like what are we doing like and that is a frustration point or everyone is the instant gratification because Solutions do take more than 20 minutes and so that goes back to aligning and messaging with your team and making sure you're communicating fairly honestly transparently as much as you can um maybe uh kind of one last uh question to sort of uh make sure we take the actionable pieces here um what would your advice be to a lot of these communities whether they're trying to grow IRL or online to uh actively figure how do they actually grow and get more people involved my simplest question I ask myself because before we are Community managers we're community members um I asked myself what do I want and this goes back to my ice cream social analogy what do I want and how do I give it to myself and give it to other people and you really need to find the simplest solution to that question so when you want more people to come into the Discord your Twitter you want them to buy your nft give them what you're looking for yourself that's a simple and to the point so uh this is great the hardest things are always the simplest well Tina I really appreciate this insightful conversation and uh thank you so much for talking about kind of your background and sharing those valuable things that you've seen at work um thank you for having me this is a good life amazing all right well I appreciate this and with that we are ready for our next talk we're uh running a couple minutes ahead of schedule so we'll still kind of continue ahead and maybe take a break if uh if we end up uh a little bit more ahead but uh we're definitely doing to welcome Daphne uh from without to talk about how do we actually help more people get onboarded into web3 through down participation so uh welcome and uh excited to have you uh we're at the summit thank you so much for the intro um hello everyone I'm just gonna get my slides shared here and presented and then we're ready to go [Music] so hopefully everyone can see my screen but welcome so I'll be chatting about the web 3 Balancing Act which is pretty common in blockchain and web3 to be balancing a bunch of different projects at once and I just want to talk a little bit more about why you might want to do that and how that can actually benefit you in your career in participating in daos or launching other projects in blockchain so just introducing myself who am I why am I talking about this so I am Daphne and I'm a governor of blue Dao and I'm going to talk a little bit more about blue Dow later but um basically we Empower women web 3 and we love to sponsor talented Builders to attend um hackathons and especially equal hackathons um I'm also the co-founder of black leaders Dao so really passionate about diversity equity and inclusion in the web free space um I'm a startup founder of key week which I actually launched at the East Mexico City hackathon and I'm a senior software engineer a hackathon veteran so good luck to everyone in their hackathon projects I've been there before and I know how stressful it can be but I think East Global does an amazing job with all the speakers and panelists that they're able to share knowledge with you um and yeah just some things like doing on the side is I love to travel and I'm a cat lover so I have a cat named baby he's 12 years old and adorable and yeah so you might be thinking that is a lot going on like how are you doing so many things at once I know it sounds crazy um how do I do this and more importantly on that why am I interested in in doing all these things um and yeah let's dive right into it so I just want to talk about the beauty of dows and participating in Dows so I think most people maybe they've seen kind of the textbook definition of dows um you know decentralized autonomous organizations you know on-chain voting governance all those things it's great that's a great way to to look at things um but I like to visualize daos as being like living pieces of Art and where every member of a Dao is contributing and putting the pieces together to contribute to um to the unity and to the overall mission of that Dao and I think that's a really fun way to to look at it and in pieces of art you have you know all these different colors and textures and materials that went into creating that piece of art and that's how I look at Dows Dao's being a diverse community group where people can come together and rally around you know one specific thing that you know we want to solve in the world one specific problem that we all really care about and that we all really want to see solutions to and so that's how I think of Dao's um and there's a lot of different types of dows out there that you can get involved with um there's Dows more on the technical side of things doing um you know D5 protocols refi things there's media Dows focused on you know news and articles and podcasts which are super fun like bankless um there are social Dows there's you know FWB board ape of course we know these these communities quite well and then there are more dials on the social impact and philanthropy side of things and that is the category that I love and I'm really passionate about making a real impact on people and communities and especially in local communities and so that's the categories that blue Dow and black leader style fall under and so I definitely urge everyone who maybe hasn't already participated in a Dao to to do some research and check out what's available for you I think you know in joining a dow you really kind of have to see what is the best fit for you and you know are the the values of that Dow aligned with yours I think that's a really important part because um I'll talk about this a bit later but when you join a Dao as a member you know maybe you don't have that much responsibility but if you want to move upwards in the in the chain the dial chain as um becoming a contributor or co-lead or core team um then you can really see uh how important having matching values is because um you know sometimes at the bottom level things seem okay but you know further than top level things might get a little bit hectic and a little bit messy so it's really important to find a community that you're passionate about and so that is what I found luckily in blue Dao so diving right into that what is blue Dow so for those of you who are not aware um blueds out is on a mission to empower women in web 3 to Achieve Financial Freedom by building their careers in this space and we're all about making the impossible possible and so we believe if you have a goal an idea a project that you want to launch we believe that it's possible and we want to help you out in any way to get you to that place and we're a all-inclusive and intersectional women focused owl but everyone is welcome to participate in blue so allies are definitely very welcome of course non-binary people and you know however you identify you are welcome at Blue um and with that our three mandates are learn earn and play so these mandates actually tie um quite well with the programs that we're excited to be launching over this year and next year so some highlights of blue Dow just at a glance so you can see how we're currently structured and the things that we're accomplishing so we have over 850 Dow members around the world and growing rapidly which is amazing and we also have 40 core team members and that is a mixture of what we would call contributors and co-leads and we kind of divide our Dao rules up by the number of hours that you can or are willing to contribute to the Dow itself and so co-leads is about you know 10 to 20 hours a week and contributors is around five to ten hours a week um at a glance we have around 4K followers on social media and we've sent over 150 women at this point to hackathons all around the world which we are so ecstatic and proud of um it uh has made a big impact on a lot of women and we've been able to kind of get rid of the stigma that hackathons are only for developers and only for technical technical people and only for certain demographics of people and you know that's simply not true and that's definitely a message that we're trying to push at out there um we've sent over 25 hackathon teams out there um our hackers really love our program and our Hands-On mentorship and coaching that we're able to provide and we are Global so we have uh communities and core team members All Around the World in Latin America Europe Asia Africa and some really cool Street teams in some of the major cities in the USA as well of course and um with our mission we're actually building out one main program which is called our blue Builders program and I'll actually touch on that later towards the end but this is meant to be our end-to-end ecosystem to support an individual's of metamorphosis in web3 so you know blue Dao our our mascot is a butterfly and we essentially want to help people you know grow from this egg phase where they don't really know what they're doing in web 3 on to becoming caterpillar and then into a cocoon and then to a butterfly and we have programs to support each step of that and so yeah we're really excited about that and my participation in blue Dow has honestly been a whirlwind journey and I wanted to share this with you all just so you can kind of see where doubt participation can actually take you and what Dao's can help you with depending on what industry you're in so blue Dell actually we started just in February of this year and we've grown a lot since then um but my particular Journey with blue started in March where I was selected to be a blue Dow hacker at ethereo and this was my first time ever attending and competing into web3 hackathon and I honestly didn't really know what I was doing but the community at Blue kind of welcomed me with open arms and were able to teach and Mentor me along the way and I think what's what's cool is that um you know our dial recognizes that learning happens in in phases right you don't just um you know step by step get to where you're going you might have to backtrack in some places you might you know go forward and then hit a roadblock and that's all okay and uh blue dials really um understanding of that as well um and in March at ethereum Rio I was able to co-found um black leaders Dao along with um a lot of the amazing Brazilian Community there and that was my first time ever co-founding a project in web3 and I learned a lot from that experience and following that in April um I actually decided to join onto the blue dial core team because I saw the work that they were doing and the impact they were having in different communities and I wanted to be a part of that and one thing I did want to highlight is that um what's cool about like participating in dials right now is dowels are so new as an organization type that you can kind of be the leader of your your story the leader of your journey and in that you can start to become a leader in that Dao story as well and change the direction of what that Dao is doing and what that Dao's mission is and I think that's a really cool opportunity that isn't um maybe that well known in terms of dows but um it allows you to become a leader in whatever respect that it looks like for you and in joining the blue dot core team in April um I was given the task to lead our youth Amsterdam trip and that ended with great success and we had one of our hack teams be um a finalist at that event which was crazy and super super exciting um and so every step along in this journey with blue Dao and just individually myself I'm kind of realizing that with every problem that we're solving with every kind of mission that we're accomplishing for our community for women in web 3 a new problem arises so again the journey is not linear the journey is about going back and reiterating and seeing what works seeing how you can improve on that and then going back at it and trying to to solve those problems and we've really been able to do that throughout this year um later in may we had another blue hacks program at activate Wormhole a lot more winning projects there um moved on to nft NYC and East New York in June um a lot of success there with our hackers and then we hit a a little bit of a pause in our in our Dow structure and our Dow roadmap and we were able to kind of have a big core team meeting here in July where we reiterated on our roadmap and redefined what success looks like for our members um because being part of a dial core team is really about learning from your members who you know if we were a product our members would be our users right but our product is our community our product is our Dao and so we want to learn from our members and their Journeys and what challenges they're having and a lot of the things that we learn learned throughout the first couple months of this year is that you know people you know are excited to get into web 3 they want to be on board to web3 but okay now they know a little bit about web3 what are the paths that they can take what are the final destinations that people can arrive at and people needed more clarity in those areas and in discovering that we decided to um build the blue Builders program which I'll talk I'll touch on later so July was a big step to kind of redefine um the path of our Dao um then later in August we moved on to East Mexico City again very successful program we had quite a few teams being finalists and other teams winning multiple bounties and then this is where I personally co-founded my own startup called kiweek and um that has been another Journey all on its own and that has also provided a lot of great teachings and learnings and we discovered that there's you know kind of too clear career paths in in web3 you can kind of be you know more on the technical side developer or just looking for for a job at a webview company right or you could be more on the founders path wanting to launch your own thing or maybe you already have your own business or idea or project in web 2 and you kind of just want to transition that into web3 and so uh me myself I saw those two clear paths defined and I brought that into blue and I said hey this is what I've experienced this is what a lot of other other members in Blue Dot have experienced how can we work this into the roadmap and that is how um our blue Builders program has been accelerated since then um and now that brings us to September so um our blue boot camp which is the second step of our abilities program is forming secretly Under Wraps um we're iterating on that and we're really excited to hopefully launch that by the end of this year and we're also um going to be hosting blue merch parties around the world so in New York in LA in Ottawa Mexico Argentina um maybe a few other cities in there um definitely uh check us out and get involved if you would like uh and then finally next month we are embarking on a journey to eth Bogota and Devcon for another blue hacks program which our applications are actually still open for that program and so with this journey with my Dow journey in in web 3 with blue Dao you know what was the purpose of doing all that what's what was the purpose of you know founding all these projects becoming a startup founding doing this and downs doing that well the purpose is you get all these amazing benefits by participating in Dows and the number one benefit that I want to touch on first is the human capital aspect of dial participation so as being part of a dow because um like I mentioned earlier it's such a new category of business organization um it's still quite small the web3 space is still still quite small and so by becoming a leader in a dow you are carving out your space in the industry and um basically allowing yourself to become industry leader by putting on all these amazing programs that help to support your missions your Dao's Mission um and I have seen firsthand the power of human capital the power of human connection and where that can get you so um you know meeting one person can kind of open so many doors for you in in web 3 and I definitely don't want that to be understated so definitely join whatever Community is calling out to you and see how you can make those connections work towards your personal missions and your personal career goals um second benefit of participating in a dow would be that you get to grow expertise and you actually get to grow expertise in areas that maybe you would never have considered so like me for example you know I'm a software engineer mainly just been doing coding for the entirety of my career but with blue Dow I saw an opportunity to actually lead Partnerships and did I know anything about Partnerships before I decided to do that no but I got to learn along the way and I think that's such a cool thing that you know in your free time you can build expertise in a different role and this is what I love about web 3 endow participation is that you know in more traditional work environments you're kind of siled in in your role in what you do if you're a software engineer you know you're a software engineer maybe you transition to product management or Engineering Management but you don't really really go outside of that that would you know take you know maybe going back to University or getting a certificate in order to transition into a different field but because Dows and the way they're organized are so flexible you're able to take on ownership in areas that maybe you never thought you could and I think that's really really cool so contributing to a dial is a little bit like building a startup because you will wear many different hats and you will work with a lot of different teams and individuals who are trying to contribute to the same Mission you are and you all have to come together and figure that out and I think that coordination is beautiful another benefit of participating in a dow would be token nft and Equity rewards so at Blue Dow we do have our own native token we have our blue OG tokens who for people who are contributing to us early um and I think it's really cool that uh you're able to earn a type of income a type of equity type of stock in an organization that you really are passionate about and you really believe in and so I think that is uh something that is really cool tokenomic certainly as a region you know needs a lot more research but there are experts that can can help in that respect and one cool thing I wanted to mention here is that with blue Dao um as we're taking on new contributors throughout this year we have begun to go open up spots on our co-founding team to anyone who becomes a co-lead by the end of the year and our main goal with that is basically to have blue Dow be owned by everyone who who made it you know not just you know maybe the two people in the beginning who had the idea but the people who were there in the initial stages that really made ardao what it is and so I think that's really cool I think opportunities similar to that also exist in other doubts um yeah and then the last benefit I did want to touch on as well is uh participating in Dows uh can be quite quite crazy quite hectic I will say it's not for everyone but it's definitely worthwhile and to me the thing that makes it the most worthwhile is that you get to make lifelong friends along the way and for me with blue dye I think it's been incredible that now my closest friends are people who don't even live in the same city as me um you know they're people that I work closely with online trying to put together our programs there are people I see maybe you know once every other month when we're putting on our programs in different cities um but I've been able to create really incredible and intimate bonds with people that I haven't experienced in web 2 to be honest and um yeah there's something about web3 that makes people really want to connect on a deeper deeper level with each other and I think that is absolutely fantastic so those are the benefits of contributing to a Dao and the benefits that I've seen throughout my journey with blue Dow and all of this effort all of these benefits have culminated in what I would love to introduce to the crowd as our blue Builders program and this is the program that we are launching over this year and next year to again support an individual's metamorphosis in web3 and because we are so passionate and that we believing that anyone can accomplish whatever they put their mind to and that limiting beliefs should not exist as part of our doll so um the first step in our blue Builders program is our blue hacks program and that is the program that we've been running throughout this um year that's kind of what we're known for is being able to onboard and educate people who have no knowledge of web3 but coach and Mentor them during a web free hackathon and essentially enable them to be winners and finalists and Bounty winners of that said hackathon and so we have programs all around the world mainly following the youth Global hackathon schedule um and we do have applications open for our eth Bogota and Defcon open so definitely check it check that out um you can find that on our Twitter as well now again in building our outer blue hacks program we we felt that you know it was a great program but what's next what is after that you know our members were looking for more Stepping Stones to continue their journey in web 3. and these are the programs that kind of hit all of our members needs and desires and the Second Step which is the caterpillar phase of our blue Builders program is our blue boot camp and this is something we're really excited to be launching by the end of this year it's going to be a four to six week uh cohort based educational program for both non-technical and Technical individuals in web 3 to learn the basics web3 learn the basics of blockchain and on board into web 3 in a more Academic Way and be able to earn certificates and nft badges that serve as their proof of skill proof of knowledge um identifiers then after that we are launching our blue incubator program which is where we really want to help support uh local communities who you know maybe they already have an idea that works in web 2 and they're now exploring how blockchain Technologies and how cryptocurrency can integrate with their webview idea or it's an individual that you know maybe is just starting out in web 3 and wants to launch something in web 3 be a web 3 native project and our incubator program aims to turn those ideas into Venture scalable products and companies because it's one thing to be passionate about um you know web 3 passionate about your idea but it's another thing to actually turn that into a product an idea that is attractive to the VC industry and investors and that is what the incubator program is aimed at and that is the little cocoon phase then our last phase of our program is our blue accelerator program and this is where blue aims to be uh the provider of talented Builders first check we want to highlight and uplift underrepresented Builders and give them the capital that they need to keep building their projects and to also start putting together um the details that would give them that um really great opportunity to get investment so helping put putting together pitch tags cap tables incorporating as a startup all of those things we want to be the helping hand with that and that is our blue Builders program so definitely very excited to be launching this program this year and next year and yeah with that I kind of just wanted to highlight a few things so one like I mentioned throughout this talk our applications are all open if you would like to become a blue hacker and attend East Bogota with us and Devcon with us so you can go to Blue dial on Twitter to check that out all the links are actually in this QR code if you want to check it out um and blue dial is also live on bitcoin so if you want to support a lot of great communities in web 3 who are doing you know diversity Equity inclusion work you can go to gitcoin and support blue dial you can go and get coin and support women in web 3 surge women metagamma Delta minority programmers 40 acres now there's just so many incredible projects that are looking for the funding to be able to put on programs that help uh underrepresented underrepresented Builders similar to what blue dot does with our blue Builders program so definitely contribute if you can even a dollar five dollars ten dollars helps it's all about the power of community and how many people actually are backing your mission rather than the amount of the donation so definitely check out get coin and learn more about quadratic voting and yeah I am on Twitter at davichar if you want to talk more if you're interested in blue if you're interested in contributing to Blue feel free to send me a DM and reach out I'd be more than happy to talk to you and yes they rode to Devcon is in full effect so definitely join us in our journey to there where we have a lot of exciting events planned so that's all I have for you today thank you all so much for having me awesome well thank you for that amazing talk um we had a couple questions um I think we have a little bit time for and then we can start with the next talk but um kind of speaking of coordination can you talk about how decisions are made at uh kind of your Dao and sort of what the process is how it's structured how has it changed um we'll be just good to get a few more insights in there yeah absolutely I think this is something that is continuing to change and evolve at Blue um but we do vote both off chain and on chain we vote off chain with snapshot and we vote on chain with Aragon and the structure of voting in our Dow right now is uh for major decisions it's for uh Governors and core teams and our wider contributor team um but we are hoping to put public votes out to our entire Community um quite soon that's just something we haven't figured out on how to scale and definitely open to to any tips there but it's something that's evolving and we're excited to to bring governance to The Wider community that's uh how uh maybe a little bit digging a little bit more how big is the the team that is usually voting on these things relative to kind of I think you said about 900 um I may have Miss hard but 900 were the members uh usually kind of how often are you doing uh votes and how often are uh it's more like what's the the complexity of a decision that requires a vote versus people just kind of leading something yeah we honestly put things to votes when we can clearly see in our like core contributor chats that there is some um you know disconnect where people aren't agreeing and we're just like hey you know we're a Dao instead of this back and forth let's just put it to a vote let's just see what everyone thinks what is the consensus of this decision and so our core team like I mentioned on a slide earlier we have about um 40 Main Quark contributors that are making bigger decisions for our wider community and we're definitely hoping to um open up voting and governance to everyone else soon awesome and then uh last question what are kind of some of the challenges that you're running into in terms of kind of growing uh the the community and uh you kind of talked about some of the things that you are doing but overall like how do you how do you count what successful growth is like is is a number to get to like 10 000 and that's what you would call good or is it like consistently growing or the quality like what do you actually measure um as you think about this community yeah that's a really interesting question because um I think at the Inception of our Dao we were thinking that you know we had this goal of sending a hundred a thousand hackers to web3 hackathons and then our mission would be complete and then maybe our Dao wouldn't need to exist anymore that's honestly what we were thinking in the beginning um but now as we've kind of dived deeper into providing these programs for our members we've realized that we would like the blue Builders program to be a program that lives on and uh with that that program has a lot of moving parts and so we do require um you know a large core team to be able to pull those things off and so we're not trying to grow our Dao to like thousands and thousands of members but we are mainly trying to grow our core team and more people who are really passionate about leading our mission and uh the main challenge with that is getting keeping people engaged after our in-person events because people love our blue hacks program they love coming in person to hackathons but then after that maybe they fall off the wagon and they're busy and you know maybe the online method doesn't really work for them yeah absolutely um awesome well thank you so much again and that was an amazing talk and uh if you're able to share the slide type will also make that available for our attendees and uh yeah I really appreciate this see you in Bogota um all right next up we are ready for our next speaker and I'd like to welcome rayon to talk about Dao's culture and marketing so from FWB please uh welcome right on hi hi how's it going things are going great how are you amazing doing all right awesome I'll let you take over from here and I decided to uh hear the talk for sure so my Talk's gonna be kind of Gestalt about a couple oops different things that I've been thinking about lately and primarily I've really been considering what it means for Dallas to really consider Community Building from a marketing standpoint as well as from a decision-making standpoint and a lot of similar to the previous speaker I really want to talk about kind of who we are at FWB how we make decisions and how a lot of our decision-making processes have bifurcated as a result of the Dow structure um initially we were just a group chat um where it's just me and maybe about 20 of us chatting joking about crypto and at some point people started seeing the growth of the community saying hey how can I help what can I do so you know you call ourselves a cultural membership a lot of uh amazing web 3 artists thinkers really considerate folks and we really use on-chan metrics of holding the token as a means of joining events but also submitting your own ideas your own creativity and finding people to work on projects alongside you so you know some of our larger success stories have been folks like Eric who who is a phenomenal designer X Nike a few other things and you know he was like I have no idea how on chain art Works can I find folks to really take my creative practice and make it on chain and within I want to say a three-month time span he spun up an amazing project called monarchs that was 888 procedurally generated butterflies in his very own unique style and he found all his coding and Dev help that way and as part of that mint process he actually gave I believe five five percent of the mint back to FWB as a thou so we're always thinking about kind of what does it mean to take opportunities externally share those within the community for FWB and then share those within the wider web 3 community at large mostly because so much of what we do is you know we're hot as I say um and we want to share that with everyone because all of us kind of are in this together that you know on my ends the one other thing I really like talking about is the fact that like a lot of people ask me oh how do I get involved in web3 and for me a little bit bragging why not but also a little bit kind of sharing how a bunch of experiences have led up to really building a community a lot of folks are kind of web 3 Centric for the sake of being in web3 and I think that that is a little bit of a missed opportunity for so many folks you know my little tweet on the right where it's just like Vibes are Vibes are kind of King because we don't want to look solely at someone's resume someone's experience and say this is who you are so even for a lot of unchain credentialing the question of you know who are you is is fascinating because and my end just Bullet by Bullet I recently finished my MBA USC that gives me this weird strategy macro how to talk to Suits strategy on you know previous professional lives I've been a coffee geek which is you know worked in retail worked in kind of e-commerce strategy and that's been a lot of soft skills in fact for anyone who wants to work in Dallas that might be the best thing which is like go go work a retail job for a little bit if you haven't I recommend it run your own business deal with people uh deal with people who are cranky and tired and exhausted and like oh I really I can't talk till I've had my coffee because then you will get really good at Dow governance and people wondering why you have don't have a road map and all of that um from there you know a record label operator the business of soft skills really thinking about P L's thinking about how creative can be operationalized and utilized in a way that you haven't thought of before right so oftentimes for so many people who are saying oh if we just do a Twitter space people will come well so what you know if you're an artist and you put out a tick tock or something what does that mean for your sales what does that mean for touring and how can we take that back to Dallas right in addition to that all the crystal shop and fragrance shop with my mom which again if you haven't worked with your folks that's another cool learning experience but also that's in the middle of skid row in downtown and one thing that's fascinating there is just thinking about the socioeconomics of running a business and how on the one hand you might have people who are really into chakras and going to arawan and spending 20 on a juice and on the other hand you have people who are you know unhoused who are saying hey can I get this for free can I take this whatever and you have to balance a lot of that you know I've had a lot of large conversations with even you know Fortune 50 companies where they're like you know we launched the nft and you know you have people who really want to build community but you also have people who are mad at us because the product isn't pumping and you know there isn't really A playbook for that other than going out and being in the world but I guess the last thing is like I will plug my Twitter where it's I'm at Rayhan underscore and this is actually kind of a huge one for anyone who is on this call obviously you spend time on crypto Twitter but you also might be in a 100 to 200 discords or something and it's really fascinating to think about Discord as kind of the coordination model for Dao's and how oftentimes that isn't where the real work happens a lot of it is still you know as decentralized as we want to be it's still one-to-one and seeing you know where are the coordinated kind of group think conversations happening but then outside of that where are kind of your external flyaways for thinking that who are the quiet folks who may not want to necessarily put themselves out there and then how do you tease that out of them oftentimes we see a lot of projects even at FWB we have new member hangs I've seen people like rainbow do office hours ens shout out to Alicia doing office hours for people who may have questions and are kind of too afraid to ask and again powerful soft skills super power there in terms of coordination and really building and getting Outsiders into your system you know and that kind of leads into kind of the Crux of something I've been thinking about for a while lately which is it feels that a lot of dowels do not think about Community Management as internal versus external processes and this is really what I want to stress on here today that what does it mean for internal Community Management to empower folks to go from being tourists in your down to being elected officials right and how does that contrast with external that when we really want to define the idea of kind of tourism in a Dao or in a Discord it's people checking out your Twitter or checking your IG or even reading a pitch that's saying okay so what do you do what's interesting how much of this is is fun in games right whether it's like FWB Fest which was a three-day Extravaganza in in Idlewild outside of La we had you know James Blake waste blood jpeg Mafia it was huge all funded and paid for by the Dow all attended by Dao members or even small things like a weekly coffee time chat or wallet safety courses Etc it's that's the internal pulse that how do we make sure that people are kind of understood heard and that their action their their wishes are actioned upon in a way that's directional for the doubt so if you go back again real quick I'm sorry I'll put it all over the place that to the idea of FW being a cultural membership you got to think about the membership task right and some of that is always going to be a very kind of functional bureaucratic role right if you lose your library card YMCA card you don't want to go to someone who is necessarily how do you say um financialized to help you all the time right they might just be a bureaucrat right they're just someone who's like this is my job my job is to make sure you jerk right so that is that first touch point of getting someone into the community making sure that their credentials and everything are taken care of and that from there they are best served in how to make the best use of your doubt because every Dao is going to have a variety of different touch points of participation you know everyone can attend not everyone wants to princess a day even for Fest we saw them say in Cleveland a lot of folks who joyfully and excitedly bought tickets were like this is the best experience I've had I never want to touch snapshot I never want to vote you know I trust you guys and that's super special and super interesting for us and for I think a lot of jobs moving forward as well that you're going to see a lot of bifurcation between what the core team does what the core team acts on and then what the wider Community wants to work on and I think a lot of that is that second bullet point of really building those rails for participation in the next slide I will show you guys kind of the overview a little older but an older overview of how our Dow is organized but the one thing I want to highlight here is that you're always going to have rails for participation whether that is someone understanding that work in a dial could just be hanging out in Discord hanging out on Twitter spreading the good word creating memes posting whatever or it could be you know folks like Emma Emerson Kirk and our Dow who is really thinking about governance structures what does it mean for us to have soft votes versus hard votes on chain on Snapshot what does it mean for us to create new snapshot strategies what does it mean for us to build out kind of Dow treasury management whether that's you know Aja consensus or a few other folks and saying you know what does it mean for us to thrive not just season to season but year to year and Beyond how much of this is our mandate and all of that that I just said contrast so heavily with this idea of external Community Management where you might be having folks whose sole mandate is like I want to spend time in Discord I want to see how it changes message to message I want to see how it changes day to day hour to hour and then I want to float outside of that I want to spend time on Twitter or Reddit or you know in The Wider art World Etc because again all of those experiences are so fundamentally valid for the way a dow can and should work and one way that we've seen that kind of manifest itself is really checking the community pulse for kind of key issues with snapshot we have a team member Drew Kaufman who's kind of our our nft general shout out to Drew and he spent so much time trolling Twitter other discords other projects and seeing what the best practices are what the best questions are and where kind of there are points of friction for potential governance processes as you know before we commit something to Snapchat so for every process that we have or every snapshot vote that we have we have about a two-week kind of pre -votes system where people chat out ideas discuss Pros discuss cons and really get stuff going in a way that feels healthy for them and only when it is good to go and approved by a governance committee do we have a third party who's saying okay we've reviewed this this is agreed upon by the community now it goes up to vote and even post vote right it's is this a token Wade vote is this something where Wales can come in change the outcome or is it somewhere you know it's one person one vote very strict about it and that's so interesting to kind of think about which votes are your soft votes which votes are your medium votes which votes are like changing the future of the doubt and then that gets into kind of our structure right so I've mentioned all of the Hat the whys now this is kind of the how of it that structurally speaking I would say FWE is kind of riding the line between traditional Corporation and this new format of a doubt that we have editorial protocol actually I'll go clockwise we have product we have editorial we have marketing and comms Partnerships events cities and membership and then at the core we have Ops and all of the kind of external facing you know the outside rim of the circle if you will are the ones that are dealing with the wider web 3 world and figuring out how do we best kind of interface whether it is building products for ourselves like our gatekeeper ticketing app member directory for our members how do we build out editorial which is kind of highlighting the best of web3 and how that interfaces with kind of non-crypto worlds whether that is in government in Food Service in you know politics in the Fine Art world or even highlighting nft projects from established artists marketing and comms is like a very valuable one where again you have folks who Focus solely on internal marketing and comps and you have people who are looking at the wider outside world of how to look on socials how to look when we get press you know what is our goal for this you know similar to a previous speaker I think a lot of our goal is not kind of growth at all costs we're not a hyper growth kind of concern we really want to think that for each project each minute how are we uplifting community members and then how are those community members having the permission to uplift FWB as adult it's really a two-way street that doesn't just start with someone holding a token it really starts with someone saying I see you I hear you I get what you're about and this is how I want to help you know one great example actually is with joy Howard who runs a company called early majority and joy actually came to our marketing and comms team said hey I have a clothing company called early majority I would love to do a badge like on clothing or FWB and do it around the time of FWB Fest how can we best kind of promote this both as an nft on the digital side how can promote it as a story for Works in progress and then how can we offer this to The Wider community and kind of show early majority as a leader in the space as a creator of best practices for kind of the interface of web3 and traditional kind of clothing and go from there you know that also touches into the next category of Partnerships where Partnerships almost I would say 100 of the time come from within our community these are folks who are again interested in helping us and also you know helping themselves right you know the idea of this is my phone Squad wealth doesn't just come from nowhere that that we understand that people are in this to enrich themselves and enrich like The Wider Community but that folks are stronger together so oftentimes Partnerships can come in a variety of different ways the web 2 way of thinking of Partnerships is like how can we extract money out of folks you know how can we make sure that we get in-kind support or like a fat check and for us it's been really inspiring to think about it the other way around which is oh how can these Partners best help us and sometimes it's true like if you're emerging down if you're just starting out you're wondering all right what does it mean for us to look at Runway what does it mean for us to look at a burn rate and how can we help kind of how can external Partners help us ameliorate that and that may not always be the case I've always learned sometimes the hard way that slower is better in a lot of different ways and kind of finding the story and the communications between the Partnerships and the marketing and is the hard stuff how do we sell this again internally and then how do we make this hit externally that if you go and check out all I wish I put this in the slides that our partnership with taika where taika is a beverage company based in San Francisco and they were like we want to work with the Dow and basically have all you know 1000 plus of you help us make a beverage together and we decided on like a sparkling mate we help them build out the site built out the smart contract infrastructure and do so in a way that was honoring their product and honoring a product's values towards the community that there's so much of thinking about that back and forth beyond that you know events and cities are probably the closest thing that most people are familiar with with Dallas where if you have like a youth Global conference shout out to eat Global that how do we best get involved if you're doing something at the city's level how can we apply for either a light key which is just the FW branding in name or how can we apply for an event key which is something more tangible you get funding from the Dow to like book a venue or spend it as you will you submit a p l to us and we say all right this worked this is great you can keep it going or hey this is room for improvement we're going to bump you down to a like right and all of that actually feeds into the last one which is membership right that membership is such a core kind of kpi for lack of a better term for a dow like ours where we kind of live and die by the fact that like we want amazing people joining us we want to make sure that excuse me that folks who are joining us by purchasing the token are treated well but also that we're able to kind of go into the the flock of War if you will and find the people doing the craziest most interesting stuff in web 3 and get them involved with you know fellowships uh grants you know we did a garage grants program recently where we had I think two or three hundred folks apply and it was everything from mango tastings in Miami to creating uh digital event streaming platform that was token gated for artists in Southeast Asia and that was kind of like an aha very beautiful moment where all of a sudden we're really putting the decentralized endow that for something that is so kind of eurocentric us-centric we all of a sudden saw a ton of influence and energy from folks who are like I'm not awake when you guys are how do we get best get involved and that was really a combination of membership working with events and cities to make sure this was hitting as well as it did and you know all of that kind of is the periphery and then Ops is kind of thinking about the long term this is the working with other Dows working with other events uh working with other strategists and seeing like all right what do we think this looks like in a season what do we think this looks like in a year Etc and how can we kind of address blockers or issues and the Ops rules are all kind of truth be told a little more bureaucratic they are a little more um you know buttoned up by the numbers and thinking about the harder more tangible goals of a doubt and all of that kind of is a back and forth that I think a lot of folks don't discuss which is how much of this is internal facing how much of the external facing how much is sales how much of this like marketing to your people and marketing to others I think for us and FWB I always kind of am the anti-marketer where I joke that like we're the anti-crypto crypto Club we're the folks who are like we don't really care about crypto we think about it mostly as a tool and by treating it as a vessel we've allowed folks creativity and their own kind of energy to shine through in a very beautiful way um I think that is actually what I have so far card Tech I mean is it can we open this up actually there's a little more but you know just real quick I want to end it here that like our community is everywhere from kind of you know High big Tech folks like EV Williams from Twitter all the way to Jeff Carvalho at Heist Nevada if anyone's a sneaker or person you know who Jeff is to you know DJs like Richie hodden who basically invented techno to folks like Eric who again that awesome designer I mentioned earlier and across the board one thing that I've been thinking about as I look at this list of members is how do we kind of create the best interfaces for these folks to to have vessels for their creativity and that have that kind of feedback into FWB as adult so when we do an event in New York or something around Art Basel in Miami that who can we tap into and who's raising their hands but then also who do we kind of want to pick and choose from so with for example FWB Fest we were able to have talks with Ezra Miller and Eric who and artists like Khalif Mall back to back we had Malcolm Demers who's talking about Colts and web3 which is such a great phrasing uh that is past the weeds of being in a smart contract it's really allowing folks to kind of stretch out their minds and think of like what's next where do we go from here and you know thankfully it was a success and we're going to do more of it moving forward you know and that is what I got so far that was uh it was absolutely incredible um I I personally learned so much that uh I kind of want to rewind this after this uh this whole thing ends and just kind of go through that again um I so I think there's like a my kind of sentence of this is that there's a lot of super interesting things that you brought up and uh so much of that is directly visible uh as you can look at how that WB works as a community and kind of how thoughtful you are in kind of executing the next next kind of uh anywhere from events two seasons to just uh what you kind of broadcast on even on products um my kind of reverse question to you would be how do you make this more prescriptive to others so they can shamelessly steal and also improve what they're doing and uh and then how do we how do we do that and how do we make that a lot more easy to you know replicate and what was your advice be there for uh for those communities heck yeah of course I think um one thing right off the bat that I love is I always tell people to build selfishly like build for yourselves build for your doubt think about it almost like a brand or actually not a brand like a band almost like you're jamming with your friends and you're building that you're building for needs that you have so even gatekeeper Works in progress or any of our kind of cities events were stuff that we did for ourselves initially we really didn't have uh how do you say a mandate to like oh you have to do this well you also were the first ones to figure it out so uh you kind of had a different premise too because remember FWB as a community has been up for a few years and there there weren't anybody to to copy from yeah absolutely you know and I think it's really fun and interesting for us because you know my I highlighted my background and the same thing for all the folks I work with that all of us came from very disparate backgrounds I think maybe it took us five or six months to get the first person who's like a hardcore solidity nerd in FWB right they were like and they came in because they were interested in music and art and all this other stuff right so I think lesson one that's huge is like built selfishly and see where you can build together that so much of our work even for stuff like gatekeeper we go back and forth with the folks from token proof we go back and forth with you know so many other folks who are building kind of on-chain identity Solutions we want to think which of this is applicable for us which is applicable at The Wider level and as we kind of grow and scale how much of this can be open source for the greater good right um and again I think some of that's going to be that external Community Management role Karthik where you're just out there outside and seeing what other people are doing outside your bubble right and how you can best rope people in because other than that like you're gonna have uh 20 to 25 people who DM me every week are like yo we're building Dell tooling and it's like uh that's cool but like to what end right that how can you build Dow tooling if you're not in a dow how can you think that okay I'm building I don't know web3 Salesforce right if if you haven't really seen how you know 10 or 15 dollars work you know and that's something that's always super fun where what I'm talking like just from seed club or Marty at pool Suite you name it right but we have so many kind of shared goals in building it out so I think that's kind of the huge actionable thing which is a just because something's done already doesn't mean you can't do it better but B just because it's done doesn't mean like or just because you don't see it doesn't mean it hasn't been done yet so like do a little bit of research and kind of dig and put your own spin on it no that's that's great advice and maybe uh one um so the same question but from uh different lens which is uh General kind of thinking around how should they structure decision making and kind of actually on the leadership side how do we actually make that scalable or not even just scalable effective in decision making I could think about that totally so you know uh Masters in public policy which is kind of geeky um and I think about that a lot like what does it mean for someone again that I mentioned this on on the talk that what does it mean for someone to go from a tourist to a citizen to elected official to like the upper echelons of that right and hey citizens make decisions too you don't have to be an elected official to do that the way that the roads in a dow work are equally as valuable for you as someone who's in that core team and I think this is actually the message I always get to core team members which is I really behoove them all of us who are in that kind of upper echelon to think about how do I decentralize and how do I make sure that I'm really going with the will of the populace not necessarily thinking about like the bubble and fight for your ideas right if you're really like oh no and this has this snapshot has to work this way get out there have a town hall be in conversation with folks and encourage your haters to to be very vocal and loud and deal with it right this is kind of the thing that differentiates Dallas from C corpse and traditional corpse anyways right that you have to be able to roll with a company that has the energy of like an old school message board yeah and and sometimes uh there are good critics right like so uh you get to actually have a voice yeah 100 that's so special right that we you know and I think the way we kind of operationalize that to answer your question is some of these are soft votes on even Twitter or Discord right like a yes or no react with this Emoji some of them are going to be a little harder again we have a whole governance Forum in Discord where people argue about stuff and like really bring their best selves to it in good faith and then we have that final snapshot which is bam is on chain we see what you did and then for us as we move forward that's going to codify on the member directory as well amazing uh well thank you so much for uh for this amazing talk and uh as a request from uh from us if you can share the slides with us we'll make them public but uh they'll be appreciated and uh thanks again this was great for sure thank you so much I'll clean them up and then we'll take it from there and all you guys have will Packer coming up next amazing hi Will well joining us again for uh our second talk to this year and uh I'm excited for this topic too because I want to get a history lesson and how things have maybe gotten better asterisks so I'll we'll take over from here and uh welcome yep I didn't I didn't intentionally uh scale the talk from uh that was my interpretation but I think I think it'll go in that direction I hope we'll see um I'm in a hotel so lighting's not excellent but uh well we'll work with what we have um so I'll uh screen share some um slides and then we can dive in from there excellent thank you okay great um so I'm going to talk about a history of dial coordination um from science fiction Origins to today um I personally I'm well I'm a co-founder of Syndicate we help set up investment as we have over 25 000 investment devs created on our platform um and I've personally been in the crypto space since 2013. um I got into ethereum in 2014 I took the ten dollars I got for freaking coinbase and put it in the ethereum pre-sale um I invested in the Dow in 2016. and I want to share some of the insights of seeing all this crypto history and how it how it's changed as today um and um this is going to start with um the fact that dials for science fiction actually relatively recently um and uh go to where we are right now as a crypto community so um pre-2016 was before there were um before Dallas um again people will debate what a dow is um I personally demarcated as 2016. um uh and uh we actually have the starting point for the idea of doubts um it came from a book called Damon by Daniel Suarez that's referenced in the ethereum white paper so Damon was written in 2006 before Bitcoin was created um and Damon focused very heavily on how this kind of autonomous system could um run so there was this computer code that essentially um would replicate itself and run itself and coordinate people and Damon being written prior to bitcoin focused very heavily on how this code stayed online how this code operated because in 2006 the science fiction interpretation was that keeping code online in a decentralized way was an extremely difficult task um one that was nearly impossible um and the book um uh talks about how essentially uh difficult it was for this kind of decentralized network to remain online um and Damon interestingly it's a very heavily automated autonomous automated definition of dows where Dao's and Damon were essentially coordinated by this one Central entity using automatic computer code and everything was pre-programmed into branches so there was not um any governance there was not any voting there was not a concept of subdials in a significant way people had very little autonomy in these systems and it's a very pessimistic mission of gas um which is interesting it didn't use the word doubs it used the word Damon to refer to them um but um it was it directly inspired Dao's in the ethereum white um the second book uh was Freedom which was written in 2010 and freedom is very interesting because uh you can see in real time um 2006 the ideas described in Damon were science fiction 2008 to that slash Tucson 2009 Bitcoin started to emerge and um the idea started to become reality and then 2010 Freedom um the things that were impossible in 2006 were suddenly not only possible but easy in 2010 so freedom is a much more optimistic mission of doubts um and it focuses heavily on these uh semi-autonomous groups essentially having really broad goals set by the Damon the computer program that coordinates everything um but all of these groups operate pretty independently um there is some lightweight version of governance but it's not heavily focused on it's much more these highly autonomous sub-dials that have their own internal economies and can coordinate um and or or operate independently um so one thing that's really fascinating is that indignant Freedom governance was not a main focus of Daz um uh it becomes a main focus later on um but uh the science fiction that inspired Dao's does not cover governance a lot it covers it a bit um but the core feature was the autonomous nature of these computer programs that Define Taos not the ability to vote um so that was um that was essentially where we were in 2010 um we have some kind of sketch of dows they look kind of viable still science fiction but um starting to look more and more possible um 2013 was when Dows were defined in the ethereum white paper um and um that was this is where the definition was laid out formally for the first time um so um Dao's as many of you likely know here um stand for decentralized autonomous organizations um decentralized being there's no Central party there's no Central actor autonomous being um that it can run without needing human intervention and organizations pretty straightforward people coordinating around some shared goal um the ethereum white paper specified what a dow could do um it said that a dial can vote a dow can spend funds and it out can modify its own code often via governance this is very interesting um because when you take this interpretation you realize that a lot of things that we call those might not be Dows under a strict definition of etherium white paper but definitions evolve over time and that's perfectly fine and some of the things that we don't view as does actually meet the textbook definition of does um so the one example is um uh uniswap as a protocol not talking about unisop Dao and DNA token but unislav the protocol which can execute automatic swaps that's an automated Market maker um that looks like the vision that the ethereum white paper laid out of a decentralized autonomous Corporation essentially a structure where one token equals one vote and it's a entity that is not necessarily profit seeking but um structured similar more similar to a corporation that might otherwise see profits um and um the very interesting part about this definition of a decentralized autonomous corporation that the ethereum white paper had is that the inner swap protocol Itself by this definition is a doubt um uh it is a it is um something that can operate autonomously um the unit swap protocol can modify its own code by choosing to flip a fee switch or not um it can choose to spend funds if it does this I did um flip that fee switch and it can vote users can vote um to turn the feed switch on or off so that's one very interesting example where a lot of protocols um in meet this 2013 definition of dials and most people today would not refer to them as Dallas um likewise a lot of um uh groups today um their dials can't necessarily for example modify their own code um or maybe they don't have voting um maybe they don't even necessarily spend funds maybe there's no Treasury and some of those things are called thousand today so I highlight those because definitions evolve and if someone says like there's a real dial there's a faked out there's a true doubt there's a like false doubt um a lot of the things that people don't view as does are Dows under the white paper definition a lot of the things that people view as doubts are not doubts under the white paper definition so um definitions evolve over time that's great if anyone tries to draw a really hard about in the definition um uh remember that most protocols fall into this definition um yet we don't call them guys today um that ethereum white paper in addition to laying out decentralized autonomous corporations where one share equals one vote and they look kind of like businesses they can possibly make profits um there's also decentralized autonomous communities which is laid out in the ethereum white paper where one member equals one vote um and this is very interesting because um ethereum white paper um didn't really cover how these decent sized autonomous communities can be formed because of the risk of civil attacks um a civil attack is when you essentially create a lot of fake identities and then like if it's one member equals one vote you can overwhelm anything with your fake identity um and that's very easy to do in the crypto space if an identity is a wallet address because it can generate Millions upon Millions upon millions of all addresses um it's harder to do with things like um with with various systems that become identity systems that try to prove your Humanity in various ways or try to create verifiable track records verifiable credentials the very interesting thing is that the ethereum white paper um essentially said the centralized autonomous communities are one member equals one vote and you can enforce membership somehow via I'm sorry that everyone is human in a kind of uh left the implementation details out for that um and that's still an unsolved problem today um nearly a decade later but there is something that's really fascinating about this definition of decent Choice autonomous communities which is that um the decentralized autonomous communities one member equals one vote looks kind of like nft projects today um nft projects are not London verticals one vote because we have not solved the problem of civil resistance um and fake identities but instead it's often One n of T equals one vote so that's another really fascinating example where some nft projects um you know don't uh have treasuries that are accountable to communities um some do um and those nft projects that are accountable to communities or those treasuries um can be uh can be can be voted on um by the members of it um those also look kind of like a pretty traditional white paper definition of doubts um not exactly we haven't solved civil resistance um maybe in another decade we will um but this is just all to highlight that this history is very interesting because all of these Concepts evolve our time what we view as thousand 2013 is different than what reviewers does today um what reviewers does today will also be different a decade later um so uh a lot of people have different definitions of doubts that's okay those definitions change over time um and I think this is a really fascinating dive into this part of the history um because um the definitions don't align with what we call as today um even though it is the truest definition of cat I don't believe that there are true or false definitions but some people do um and uh and these definitions are are what stood in the white paper so 2016 um was the doubt um it uh was um the first Dao on top of ethereum um depending on how you define um uh a Dao um uh one of one of the earliest ones um uh and the Dow is super interesting because it was an investment down on top of um on top of the ethereum network and it essentially um was structured to fund projects in the ethereum ecosystem every time a project would come up for a vote um you could say yes if you wanted to allocate your funds to it you could say no if you didn't um and projects would be funded via VIA this community um and it was super exciting at the time um it attracted 14 of all ether in existence 150 million in 2016 prices it was 32 billion in pre-grass dollars I pulled these stats a little while ago so they might be a little outdated um but it was like 32 billion um and uh in in pre-crashed East prices um uh so um that was an absolutely fascinating time and the thing that was very interesting about the Dow um was that it was really seen as this um incredible bottom-up initiative um where like it just captured Everett's imagination of wow we can all fun things together we can all make these decisions together we can all create this ecosystem together um and that's part of the reason why it attracted 48 of all Ethan existence um another reason that's under discussed um but relevant um for the time is that the Dao uh also was one of the only things you could really do on the ethereum network back in 2016. um there really wasn't much um that you could do um and like the Dow was cool you just set ether to the address you got some data tokens back um and uh there wasn't much to do so a lot of people were like oh an opportunity to use my ether with smart contracts that's cool um so um I think that's also an under discussed aspect of the Dell history like did it attract 14 of all Ethan existence because people were incredibly excited by the idea of funding the ethereum ecosystem together in such an early stage yes did it also attract 14 of all ethereum existence because nothing else was really going on um yes um that's also true um so if we replicated the Dow today I very much see what we do at Syndicate as a spiritual successor to The Tao um in in many ways um uh probably wouldn't attract 14 of all you can existence but hopefully uh hopefully hopefully quite a bit um and uh the Dow is very interesting because um the Dao um was the first time the ethereum community as a whole was faced with a massive coordination problem um so um some of you may know this um the Dao was hacked um the 14 of ether was drained by some blackout hackers who were stealing the money some white hat hackers who um were saving the money for other people um and uh that was hacked before it even got off the ground um it was hacked due to a bug um that is now uh well known today a known as a re-entrancy attack um but um security best practices were not as developed at the time so um re-emption see bugs were um well something that existed back then um not something that was in as common knowledge as today um and the ethereum community had a choice uh they had to coordinate and decide do we want to um do we want to essentially undo this hack and give back ether to the people who originally put it in or do we want to keep the hack in place um and uh 14 of all ether is now in the hands of mostly hackers and you know like that that that that could like drastically affect the network down the road but um maybe maybe it is what it is the code a bug and uh the bug was exploited and covered his law so um so so that bug should stand and this was the center of a very significant ideological debate in the ethereum community at the time which is that there was the code AS law debate so um essentially uh some of the community thought um that uh anything that was in a smart contract was essentially like what people should be bound to um if the smart contract is written correctly then everything operates correctly the smart contract has a bug that's still what people chose to put money into that's what people agree to so they agreed to the bug as well code is law um and therefore it shouldn't be changed the other part of the community thought that um the intention of the creators mattered and that a bug is not an intended functionality um a bug as an accident and the bug should be um essentially um undone because it wasn't what we meant to happen um so that was a very significant um split um the people who thought that uh code is law did not agree to Fork the chain they chose to stay on the old version of the chain um now known as ethereum classic would still exists today and the people who thought that the bug should be undone um thought that um the uh agreed with the new version of the fork and undid the hack and that's ethereum that's what you say so there are two versions of ethereum in existence one where they believe in this code in law CODIS law principle one the one that pretty much all of us sees today where we do not and we believe that bugs are accidents and not not not what people are are are are signing up for so to speak um and this is very timely to discuss because um there's another debate in the ethereum community right now about a chain Fork between ethereum proof of stake a new Terrier proof of work um and that will also lead to a fork in the chain um and um it could play out like ethereum ethereum classic where ethereum ends up getting all the usage and all the value in ethereum classic um it's you know mostly uh mostly not used very much um or it could play out where um there is some significant uh group of people who agree to adopt the ethereum proof of work I personally think it looks more like an ethereum and ethereum classic situation um where most people will move to ethereum purple steak and that will be the first new ethereum we all use um and that ethereum proof of work um won't um won't uh what be likely to be significant but that's just my own personal opinion and we'll know in a week um how it plays out and this is interesting because um there's both like the um high level like what the fork did for the ethereum community which was um helped people um settle the debate over coda's law that is a very important piece but then there's also a personal and practical aspect which is a lot of the people who um were who put money in um were also people who had significant um uh significant adoption of a network as minors for example um and some of the people who put money in um lost money and wanted to get that money back so like when people talk about 2016 solve the code AS law debate um because we all use ethereum and educator in class today is that true yes it is also true that a bunch of people chose to use ethereum instead of ethereum classic because they got their hacked money back in full on ethereum and they got only a portion of the hack money back the amount of money that was returned by white hats on ethereum classic so just like how the Dow getting in 14 either in existence was partially function of the excitement and partially functional the fact that there just wasn't much to do back in the days um us using ethereum over ethereum classic today it's partially a functioning of this belief in uh that code is not long and that bugs are not bugs are not um part of agreements um but also it was people who lost money and won their back so there's always this uh this like in the moment is very different than how people look back retrospectively um in the moment there's usually a lot more motivations at play than just one high level principle and that's very important to keep in mind when thinking about the history of crypto because um it's not all a smooth Journey um and there's uh there's lots of like personal factors that can influence people at various points of time 2017 to 2020 um it was like the next phase of essentially doubt coordination um uh so just like how um we went from science fiction where um Dao started out as uh these like sub-door looking kind of entities without much governance to the white paper which focused heavily on voting to the Dow Fork where there wasn't even any voting you just decided whether it's fork or not Fork um the next stage of Doubt coordination is generalizable Dow tools started to merge 2017 to 2020 is how I demarcate the era um Aragon was uh was was was started in 2016. um so so it's not it's not a perfect definition but um it's a it's it it it's it's when these generalizable doubt tools started to come to Providence um many of you likely use gnosis um it's a multi-signature wallet and it's typically used for off-chain governance so you have a small number of signers who are essentially uh um the ones who've been execute transactions to move funds or upgrade the Taos code and a large number of people who can vote about how those uh funds should be spent um some people will tell you that gnosis safes are not real does but they're faked as um one thing that's interesting is like I know so safe does meet the definition of a dow in the ethereum white paper it can vote it can spend funds it could modify its own code the votes are being done by the multi-succiders not being done by all of the token holders um so um under some definitions of doubts uh no safe and I'm always sick as a doubt under some definitions of doubts um if you view it as it must be on chain token voting it's not viewed as a doubt so um these definitions are always um a bit tricky um and uh and that's something that um you'll definitely see occur throughout the history of dial coordination um that these definitions and ideas change over time um uh in my opinion no safes our dials can be considered as um and that on-chain governance is not a critical feature of doubts but other people disagree um moloch and Aragon are two solutions of this era for um uh on-chain governance um moloch um is uh is used by um the modern framework has used um was was set up to fund public goods in the ethereum ecosystem um and to help solve coordination problems uh mola comes from the idea of moloch the god of coordination failure and um everyone tries to get together to slay moloch to essentially solve coordination problems um and that is um that's uh moloch uh Dows are used today in metacarto and similar groups um and they rely on unchain governance and voting via Temple holders um Aragon also is a tool more focused on you know communities and discussions um and it also uses on-chain governance um in addition not exactly in addition to this is also parent-based governance compound Governor Alpha and Bravo which is a voting framework as well and that tends to um that that that tends to be used alongside other systems for example like tally for Unchained voting um so these were very generalizable Dow tools they tried they they didn't try to take an opinion on a new one use case they tried to be um be very broad um and um for gnosis Content governance was not a critical feature and it was broader than just a bad tool a multi-signature wallet could be used for all sorts of things um more than just those it can be used to also scare your own funds scare your friends funds um and and and there's a lot of things um that you can do with gnosis that um are Beyond dance and then molok and Aragon um specifically um we're focused on on gals in particular um and this era um uh ran through 2020 pretty much to the end of D5 summer um 2021 saw the rise of vertical specific doubt tools um so instead of um one generalizable framework um there started to be tools for specific types of dows um so Syndicate for example for investment does um juice box and mirror for crowdfunds party ground coop for group buying nfts code shifted parcel treasury management Utopia Peril llama accounting Lobby Knowledge Management um this list could easily be double triple quadruple the size um 2021 saw this huge explosion of tools um and it was because people viewed um people realized that specific Dow use cases were best served by specific tools um built for them um and um people began to migrate to those tools for example at Syndicate we focus a lot on flexibility for investment Dows some investment Dows want to have a fixed price for their Investments some of them want to be able to change the price some them want to have membership based entirely on deposits some of them want to be able to select their members in advance and um and allow in members I think are really helpful and kick out members who are who are problematic um and and maybe unhelpful or disruptive um and uh and the investment down Frameworks that we're building at Syndicate are built with a particular use case in mind likewise Juicebox for example um has uh is built for essentially like uh they call it transparent treasuries where um you can uh put money into a juice box fundraise you can also get refunds back from that fundraise um if the Dow has more Capital than it needs um that was uh can also um those can also uh make excess funds redeemable for end users um at any point but this refund functionality as well party now operates on top of um the uh protocol formerly known as fractional um and um it like directly fractionizes the nfts on a protocol layer um so that they're held uh by a specific smart contract that can handle auctions with those nfts so these vertical specific dial tools um started to rise up in 2021 and that is where we are today so that is the history of dial coordination um from science fiction to today probably of time for one or two questions um if there are any in the chat yeah um maybe uh this is a question for me and uh I'm gonna apologize for being you know getting for putting on the spot but did you notice any kind of Trends as you were looking at this evolution in terms of like why some of these things didn't take off like is there something common here or is it just that we change the bill post and we had to then adapt to how the tools would get us to accomplishing a different goal yeah yeah um I think that um as the ethereum network uh gains more users what those users look for and what they care about and uh and and don't uh and care less about starts to uh starts to change pretty dramatically so for example in 2016 um gas fees were very low um on-chain governance cost barely anything there was no reason not to use it everything was on chain and they weren't browser-based wallets so um you had to use desktop wallets uh with um with uh direct smart contract interactions um so um having everything on chain made sense because you couldn't have like off-chain interfaces easily it was just didn't exist at the time um and then 2017 to 2020 um those were um those were really where they're there were very few dials um before then um maker uh was the most um prominent pre-2017 though um and 2017-2020 was um an era of essentially um trying to Define what doubts are and what they look like and using the concepts that we know from before um and uh and and very much trying to be unopinionated because who knows what does it look like um 2021 these tools can start to be more opinionated because we know it does look like more clearly they have now gone from um gone from uh pure science fiction to a few experimental examples to lots and lots of examples um and um that uh that setup allows us to start to build tools that meet those specific needs that we know about it so I think it's as knowledge increases in the space um that NS users change in the space and as gas speeds change and prices change these Dow tools naturally adapt because Z Theory Network's not static either the people who use it the cost to use it um how you use it whether that's from browsers or direct smart content interactions all changed over this time period as well now that's that's totally fair um another question uh we'll just make this the last one obviously as you can at the last slide talked about all the tools that are available right now for Dallas to can operate and we're going to seeing specialization here as well gu believe that these things remain unbundled or do you kind of believe that eventually this will be bundled together and sort of had to compare contrast that too things going on syndicate yeah yeah I mean of course I have my own bias my bias is that I believe these will remain unbundled um uh um and that's that's what we're building towards we're building towards investment does specifically um my my own broadly speaking um my belief is that Dows are a structure as transformative as corporations but likewise um the idea of a generic Corporation is really hard to serve um like the industry it's in matters a lot the types of people who run it matter a lot the goals that they have matter a lot like in the likewise just like how the needs of a small business of a single person Consulting business to a small business in a local area to a fortunate envirology company like they're all corporations but they all look very different at very different needs and would not be served by the same tools I think guys are the same way um investment Dows um of a few members look very different than investment dials of dozens of members and those look very different than investment thousand thousands of members yeah those in addition look very different the community does which might not be trying to make a profit but might instead be trying to uh seek out a specific goal and bring out some bring about um some some kind of thing they want to create um so I uh is it possible that there's some kind of Dao super app that handles all these use cases um 10 20 years from now I don't view it as likely because um there's no Corporation super app either um uh um the needs vary so widely between companies that I think that would be the same way I guess like for tooling to like help operate do you kind of believe that's more likely I mean this would be your analogy of kind of HR services and accounting and largely like the corporate account management as a as an industry exists for generalized organizations but the weekend I still believe that treasury management and financing and payouts and payroll and all that will be offered more and more in a bundled form yeah I think that um I think that um uh uh we it's a little hard to say because um there's also this like metal level question of do we even need Dao specific tools at all um I think the answer is yes I build in I build I'm building them I invest in them um like I I have a significant portion of my like career my time and my assets tied up in these days yes so I mean but uh but but it's also because I truly believe it um uh yeah um uh I I I I I I have the belief first and then and then I uh and then I execute up I believe rather than uh you know the other way around um so uh so I think that um uh Dallas specific tools do need to exist and will exist I think that um uh there's a kind of like a a big question mark which is the regulatory situation for Dallas right now Dao's from a regulatory perspective um look either like companies or non-profits um and a lot of what Dallas can do have to like contort to fit into these definitions um and if they're forced to fit in these definitions well if Adele looks like a non-profit and it's regulated as a non-profit then maybe it's just these non-profit cooling maybe it doesn't need doubt tooling for non-profits when you know it's forced to act like a non-profit but I think that the more crypto native experimental end of the spectrum is where doubt tools will likely survive first um uh that's only a weekly held belief um said we're kind of on both aspects of some groups that are super experimental and totally Untamed in some groups that are um using corporate entities and uh and and and uh and um manage a lot off chain um so it it I I don't I don't leave a weekly held belief on that I would have said like I I formed a particularly strong opinion either way um but if Dallas are allowed to act like truly crypto native dials I think we'll also see more innovation in where two thousands are forced to look like companies well then maybe Dallas won't look that different from companies so like the regulatory situation right now I think that's hindered Innovation um in a significant way um uh and I think that if that Embraces the truly Cutting Edge autonomous features of those um that we'll start to see um the Dows be able to like really like roam free and experiment more I think that's a perfect match to end this on so uh really appreciate this full and uh thanks again for taking the time today and if you can share the the slide deck we'll also make that available for the attendees thanks so much anyone can email me at Willet syndicate.io um or find me on Twitter at willpaper um definitely happy to chat about our new list amazing thank you so much thanks so much talk to you soon all right that was our last hack of the coordination Summit I want to thank all of our speakers uh for sharing really valuable insights from how their world is basically evolving and how they're helping us get better at coordination so uh with that I want to thank everybody for tuning in and watching all these amazing talks and asking all these questions and engaging with our speakers uh for all the hackers we will see you on our Discord and uh two weeks before submissions are due so looking forward to seeing what everybody builds in the meantime uh in the original five beats and we'll see you next week for our next Summit take care everybody goodbye
