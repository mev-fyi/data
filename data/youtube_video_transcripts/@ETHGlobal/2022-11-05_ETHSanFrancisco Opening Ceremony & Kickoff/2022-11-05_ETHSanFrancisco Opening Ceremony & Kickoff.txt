[Music] yeah maybe one more time are you all excited there we go welcome everybody Welcome to eat San Francisco my name is kartig one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the city of San Francisco now let's start with something really important this is not a conference these events are organized by eth global and Eve Global is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and Summits and this makes this event a hackathon what differentiates all this is that our focus is on Builders We Believe showing is more important than telling and this is a place for all of you to learn explore get help and grow as developers and learn the skills that you all excited to gain and that brings us to all the things that we're going to talk about today the most important piece is that this is the biggest eat Global event we've done in person in our five-year history over 1700 people in the building from 46 different countries and 38 of them are brand new to what three this is absolutely incredible we put all of them on a map to see where everybody was coming in from and I am so excited to see so many familiar faces and so many new faces and I can't wait to can't wait to meet all of you not only that we have 27 workshops a lot of them have happened already as you kind of came in in the afternoon 265 ecosystem partners and 18 mentors who are here 24 7 to help you with anything technical that you need and to top it all off three hundred thousand dollars in prizes are being given away and we're going to talk about all those things on what the details are for each of these prizes shortly in the next uh hour I also want to give a special shout out to our 39 incredible Partners so I want to give them a big round of applause please join me in thanking ipfs and falcoin openc optimism polygon scale World coin cartesi ens lens uniswa Foundation Uma xmtp the graph hyperlane ey me now push protocol live pure aluo zero X if coin near samudai fuel tenderly teller Dune unlock quick note noses chain empiric Network avmas findora midpoint triangle covalent Samsung next and Pull and swing all these incredible companies are here this weekend and they're going to be talking about why they're excited to be part of this event and all the prizes you can win by using their sdks and protocols all right so I want to make sure I make the best use of the next 60 Minutes I want to talk about what this weekend is all about I want to cover what the venue and all the activities that we're doing how you can get help when I talk about all the prizes and the workshops how judging and project submission is going to work and if you're still looking for a team how all of that is set up so let's go into all of that but before let's talk about a little bit of security everyone must have their wristband which you would have gotten with your event badge at on you at all times The Wristband is required to be in the building and if you end up cutting it and uh or losing it or somehow misplacing it we will not be issuing a second one so please make sure that you do not get rid of or cut your wristbands these are the things that are going to be preventing you from going back into the building and the security is going to make sure that we don't let anybody in without a wristband so just to sum it up no wristband no entry do not lose your wristband if you've been already put one on on your wrists on top of that please do not leave your belongings unattended the doors are going to be open this is a 24 7 event people could come in at any time whether it's 2 A.M or 2 p.m in the next two days and we want to make sure that you don't leave your stuff unattended so please keep an eye out on your stuff at all times there is no official storage that we are offering for this weekend and of course you've already been here for quite some time so just want to make sure I also take a second to remind everybody on the floor plan this is the main floor where most of the things are happening we are on the main stage on my left the middle spot is all of the hacking area the workshop rooms are in the middle at the end and at the end of uh this Hall and if you need any help there's going to be a 24 7 help desk right where registration was so you can find anybody on the youth Global team at any given time a quick note here is that the doors that you came in from today are going to be closing at 10 pm so when you're trying to exit tonight after 10 pm you're gonna have to go to the end of the hallway and request your ride or your Uber at the end and not the doors you came in from and then there's also a mezzanine floor that's on the area on top and that's all of hacking space and a chill room where you can just kind of hang out and get some snacks and just chill and of course you've already kind of had dinner but make sure that you do not lose your meal tickets uh there are six of them for six meals they are what the food trucks are going to request if you lose them we're also not going to be giving you a new one and you will need them to get the food for the rest of the weekend so enjoy some variety of food options that you have here and give them a meal ticket when you want to eat something from any of the trucks and we have a lot of other fun things going on this weekend so there's an nft exhibition by noun style that's all the way at the end of this Hall uh there's a Relaxation Station powered by cartesi you can get some massage chairs and hammocks in there there's also a photo booth you want to get some photos about being in San Francisco uh you get them digitally delivered to your email and we're going to do an activity which is dyeing a scarf that's a very local thing from San Francisco's if you're interested in this this is happening here tomorrow afternoon from 3 to 5 p.m in one of the workshop rooms all right let's go right into a lot of the logistics of this weekend communication everything that we're going to be doing here is going to happen on Discord if you rsvp'd as a hacker you would have seen a prompt to connect your Discord to get all the right permissions the Discord is only open and accessible to people who are participating at the hackathon so these are all private channels and if you do not see each San Francisco on your sidebar that means you didn't connect it properly or something went wrong so you can find us and we'll help you debug that Discord is also the place where we have all the channels for getting support so you can ping any protocol that's offering a prize you can ping any of our mentors there you can also physically go to the mentor help station and get any help and of course remember that you are in person everybody that you're going to be talking to is also here in person you can just walk up to them and chat and get help also all the official announcements will be posted on Discord so if you miss anything if we're running behind or if we're running ahead of schedule or something change we'll be announcing all of that on Discord as well as updating the website and whatever the website says is going to be the source of Truth so if something is different on the website then what's been communicated it's the website that remains what we're going to follow and just to remind everybody the website is sf.eth global.com all right so the most common questions we get is how do the saxophone work and what do I need to do to prep for tonight we'll keep this very simple you can officially start hacking on your projects and you can work on a project with up to five members on your team you all have 36 hours to hack so submissions are due at 9am on the Sunday and we're going to talk about what all of that means in terms of submissions but before we talk about the submission there are a few simple rules that we want to follow for all the projects that are going to be submitted everything that you're going to do must be done from scratch which means you cannot continue to work on a project that you already started before everything that you're doing must begin today starting right now and you cannot extend a project otherwise you'll be disqualified you are allowed to use open source projects of course if something is already open source and you're either forking that repo or you're building on top or if you actually use the code from any other existing projects that is still totally fine but not something that you've done yourself before and you're adding a feature to it and only people who have been confirmed on the hacker dashboard are eligible to win prizes which means if your team members are not listed on your team section or they do not show up or they do not physically attend this event in person have not checked in they will automatically be kicked out tomorrow afternoon by a script and if you win a prize we will not be on honoring anybody who was not listed at the time of submission as a team member so really really really make sure that all of your team members individually show up as you're submitting a project and of course if you have any questions you can find me you can find anybody on the global team we're going to be there 24 7 on a help test there to answer any questions and a lot of the workshops that are happening are designed for people from all different skill sets whether you're a beginner you're an intermediate or expert in this space and all that information is also available on your dashboard and all of our website and everything including this speech right now and me being on stage is being live streamed so you can catch up all of that instantly on if global.tv or going to youtube.com youth Global watch everything at your own pace you get to pause stuff and you get to look at code and everybody who gave a talk today is here in person so you can just walk up to those speakers and ask them any follow-up questions that you had and for those of you who are still looking to join a team we are going to be running a team formation Workshop right after I stop talking in an hour and that's going to be in Workshop room 4 which is all the way at the end of the hallway so that's going to happen at the at 9 30 for about an hour hour and a half and that means if you are still looking for teammates if you are looking to join a team or you want somebody to join your team with a different specific sales cat skill sets uh you can be in that room and find each other and potentially work together on a project and of course if you have not already checked this out there's also a tool on your hacker dashboards to find other team members who are also looking for a team this requires both sides to be opt-in and you can search people for different skill sets what they're looking for and what you're looking for and find them and message them directly on Discord and connect them asynchronously all right submissions are due at 9am on Sunday and let's talk about that but before I go into this just a quick note Daylight Saving Time kicks in this Sunday so while you can start hacking at 8pm and somebody shows a due at 9am you still have 36 and not 37 hours to hack so keep that in mind your clock should automatically change but things will be slightly different by an hour on Sunday all right let's talk about judging main judging and partner judges there's going to be two tracks for what judging means you can opt in for either of these processes and what that means is if you're going to be working on a project and you want to win a prize from one of our partners you have to select those prizes on your submission project page view and the partners will be notified that you are applying for that prize in that time you have to go to their tables and their boots and present what you did to them individually which means if you are trying to win prizes from five different sponsors you're gonna have to go to all five of those teams and present your projects to them in that same window there's also the main judging which is going to help us determine the top 10 teams which is entirely separate from the partner judging and this is going to be happening at the end of the hallway on the other side of this room and we'll be assigning an order for each of the teams to go present to our main judges whom you can find on our website and they'll be deciding who the overall projects are that are interesting for the rest of the hackathon you if you want to be part of the main judging and top 10 projects and also win prizes you're going to have to present to both sides so make sure that you are optimizing for your time and making sure that you have enough time on Sunday morning to look at all these things and go to everybody that you want to present to how does judging act exactly work you will have four minutes to demo your projects in seven minutes in total to present everything that you did which includes three additional minutes for questions we usually recommend that you record a four minute video of what you did in case something goes wrong or if you are relying on some transaction happening on mainnet and that may take more time or something goes wrong it just helps you recover and not be in a situation where at the final moment you are not able to demo what you built and we really recommend the do not do this last minute you need at least 30 minutes to submit everything because you will be asked to show proof of how you're using different protocols if you're applying for prizes and you're going to have to actually spend time writing different things about what you did and how it works so really don't prepare for this last minute and all that happens on your hacker dashboards you'll start seeing a form tomorrow afternoon immediately on how all of it is set up and kind of what uh similar to what I talked about already the partner judging is part of the same process so as you're submitting you get to choose these are all the prizes that you're applying for and once you do that the partners will be notified that you are expected at their Booth which means that if you do not select a prize they have no way of knowing that you wanted to win or participate or qualify for those prizes and there's no way for us to control that so you're going to have to make sure that you select it the right price and you can do this thing in parallel which means that if you want to present to all the partners before and then go to the main judging you can or you can do it right after you present it to the main judges and then find the partners you get to decide what you want to optimize for and of course I want to talk about our code of conduct the rules and the code of conduct for being at this event are outlined on need global.com rules but in summary it's fairly straightforward everything that you build here is your own intellectual property nobody neither eighth Global or your team members or any of our partners own anything that comes out of it whoever is part of that project is the owner of that work and please be respectful for everybody to to everybody in this building harassment in any form is not going to be tolerated so if you feel like you're being treated in a way that shouldn't be the case please come find us and we'll take immediate action and whether you're not comfortable com finding us in person you're more than welcome to Ping us on Discord or email or if you don't want to do that and just actually talk to us in person please come find anybody wearing a neat Global shirt and with that we are done with most of the logistics what I want to do next is bring on some of our amazing partners and there are some of our amazing Partners who are excited to be here this weekend they're going giving some amazing prizes they're going to talk about why they're here and what they're doing and I want to kick us off by showing a video from Papillon to talk about what ipfs and fall coin is up to so while we're ready our best of our partners please watch this intro from ipfs and falcoin ipfs and filecoin that's why we're here ipfs is a peer-to-peer content address protocol that makes the web upgradable resilient and more open and filecoin is the largest decentralized storage Network that ensures content persistence over time filecoin's total capacity makes up about one percent of total cloud storage and we're growing fast increasing storage capacity and developing multiple exciting Solutions like a recently launched filecoin virtual machine fully evm compatible smart contracts will enable co-locating storage and computation now there's twenty thousand dollars in the offering make sure to check the website for submission qualifications you can also find these great learning resources like nft.storage and web3. storage to get you started if you need to reach out you can find us on the Discord Channel or at our sponsor booth hackathons are a great place to experiment to get your hands dirty and to build projects the possibilities are endless we wish you the best of luck happy hacking awesome please give papion a big round of applause and next up I want to bring on Benji from optimism to talk about everything optimism enough to please welcome Benji on stage yo hey everybody um before I start I just want to say like this is my first time speaking at youth Global so I hired a public speaking expert to help me with the slides unfortunately I couldn't pay them on time so they just left their like notes over here if I was you I'd just ignore anything written in yellow just like you know just don't look at it um okay so how to win an optimism prize we have a bunch of cool prizes guys it's gonna be really exciting so again don't read the yellow a show of hands so could you raise your hand if you're hacking today let's go nice uh can you raise your hand if you don't have an idea yet okay I see a few hands in there okay cool cool our our area is right around there so hit me up and we'll talk a little bit about various things you can do a bunch of ideas for you to try out as well so you know one nfds or digital Collectibles we have prize for two teams two thousand five hundred dollars each you can make an nft collection you can make something to make someone else make an nft collection you can make something to let someone else making something that makes an nft collection a bunch of stuff um or maybe build some games we have we released the op stack recently so you know lattice made opcraft and that was exciting so you guys can do the same crypto is all about human coordination so you know ethereum lets you program money money lets you program incentives incentives let you program societies and novel structures um damn all right we already have the collective on optimism thousands of active governance participants and we need some tech we need something to help that be organized so if you guys are interested in gov Tech anything you can create for Dows we have prizes for those three teams two and a half thousand dollars each for the winners and um I missed this slide we do a little Dev tooling as well so anyone who wants to do anything that can help a developer build anything at all we have three team prizes for two and a half thousand dollars for the winners uh this could be Discord infra and for in general or automation uh we do a little devtooling and lastly if you guys are interested in even more content please uh scan this I'm going to leave it on for like a couple seconds and there's a bunch of other prizes as well so you can look into thank you amazing [Applause] awesome well thank you so much and next up I want to bring on Ryan from openc to talk about everything open C please welcome Ryan on stage hello everyone my name is Ryan I work on the protocol team at openc on the engineering team uh I'll be here this weekend I'll be wearing a bright open sea shirt I'll be sitting and hacking away if anyone wants to build on Seaport which is our new Marketplace protocol that we launched this summer uh it's an ownerless uh based protocol that has no inherent fees to any parties so anyone can build orders and hack on it and combine orders from different marketplaces and be able to execute them uh in a very gas efficient manner there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with that you can build contracts that can validate orders on chain that people can fulfill you can create multi-cigs that hold nfts that lists them uh on the openc website and cool things like that so it's great to be here uh if anyone would needs open C Keys find me and I can help uh create API keys for you guys so thank you thank you next up I want to bring on Steph from polygon please welcome Steph hi I'm Steph I'm from polygon GM eth SF uh Jacob taught me that San Francisco has eight bridges and the one over there is the Golden Gate Bridge I got that wrong today and I'm not going to get that wrong the rest of the week but I'm from polygon I love working for polygon because polygon believes in web 3 for all so that's you your mom your grandma kids in kindergarten their teacher literally every single person in the world and we love that our Builders feel that way too so I challenge you this week to build things for anyone and everyone get in Builders were hacking all weekend uh we have three different solutions you can build on for the hackathon the first one is polygon POS which is our proof of stake side chain I love building on POS because the transactions are super fast and the gas is low it's very scalable and it's also evm compatible we also have our ZK evm testnet that went live a few weeks ago publicly so you can build on ZK evm if you scan this QR code you'll get the RPC URL and have all of the information you need to build and then we also have polygon ID which is our decentralized ID solution my co-worker Rahat did a really great workshop at 6 pm today so check that out on the eth global YouTube channel and you'll have everything you need to build with polygon ID we also have twenty thousand dollars this weekend in prizes um our prizes are for best use of polygon ID best public goods or refi metaverse or gaming project best ux and then my personal favorite best developer tool or Dow tooling project so tons of different options for building and really excited to see what you all build thank you so much thank you next up I want to bring on Jack from scale please welcome Jack hello all right pleasure to be here who's hacking all right awesome okay um first off we have 20 000 in hacker Awards all right you can see the awards up here first and foremost I just want to talk about the the pool award so anybody who deploys any team who is successfully deploys to scale will share in the the pool award so our team will be here all weekend here to support you um and let's have some fun so really quickly what is scale scale is a modular multi-chain blockchain Network designed to help scale ethereum all right it's ethereum native meaning it's built into ethereum one of the coolest pieces about skill is it's actually a zero gas fee Network in a sustainable decentralized manner I'll get into that in a second so we've been around for a long time we actually sponsored this event 2018 it was awesome it was a blast we're all gonna have a good time um now we've been around for a while but just this last June the network went through a major upgrade and today we just had the 15 million 15 millionth transaction since June over 77 active users a lot of action on the chain and just excited to see what's happening in scale so getting a little deeper of skill skill is actually a network of app specific blockchains it's not a single chain whereas most blockchains are one shared database scale has a system of pooled security blockchain so these are in many ways shards or pooled pool chains that share a collective validator set but then have their own individual blockchain that all and they work as an active group for collusion resistance and redundancy okay and they're all emboldened by the ethereum mainnet and really controlled by the ethereum made it work in Synergy with the ethereum mainnet and help bring fees and revenue back to the ethereum mainnet um I now hey I've got a lot of pictures here about the containerization of the network the technical architecture I have two minutes so I'm not going to go through this but if you're interested in learning more you want to learn about how the network functions if you're into containerization if you're in a threshold encryption uh come by the booth and talk to us we'd love to talk to you about how scale functions and works and operates um I also would love to talk about how the there's a hub and dap chain model we already have 18 chains in the evm chains and the scale Network each one can do over 100 transactions per second in terms of throughput that can get pretty messy in terms of coordination without hubs so there's a hub model would love to talk to you about that too okay last thing we have an announcement my our comms team wouldn't let me you know announce this yet so I'm giving a little sneak peek but keep your eyes open next week it starts with a z and there's gonna be some cool stuff coming out on sale soon all right uh come come check us out on the uh Discord if you have questions skill.chat all right let's have some fun thanks thank you and our last partner on stage please welcome Thiago from worldcoin hello what's up [Applause] all right I do have a few slides that the team sent me probably too long so we're gonna skip through a bunch of them but yeah so I'm telling worldcoin and we're building a bunch of stuff at worldcoin uh we're building a token that anyone in the world can claim except if they're in the US for free just for being a person we're also building a wallet for normal people it's super easy to use and then lastly and most importantly we're building what we call a proof of personhood protocol and that's what we're here to talk about today and so there's this really pesky problem that we all have to deal with which is Bots or people abusing systems right this is called civil attacks and the idea is that when you're online you don't know if someone if 20 accounts or 20 people with individual accounts or one person with 20 accounts and so we build uh a protocol that helped us solve it for a problem that we had and now we're opening up so that any of you can build applications that leverage the same civil resistance and so in essence with our protocol what you can do is people can anonymously prove to you that they're a real person that have never done something before right and so for example if you're building an app that lets people claim nfts people can prove that they're a real person that has never claimed this nft before without revealing who they are or they can prove that they've never joined this Discord or that they've never redeemed an airdrop right whatever it is uh it's all Anonymous and people can prove that they've never done it before yeah so this is with World ID very exciting this is our protocol but what I want to get to is how we do this we do this with this device it's called the orb it's a little Beauty And The Ore basically does three things it makes sure you're a real person with a bunch of sensors then it looks at your iris it generates a unique code it destroys the other images that has taken of you and using zero knowledge proofs you can verify that you've never been to an orb before and so this is exactly the type of Serial knowledge proof that you can integrate into your project uh to reduce the signal that the orb gives you now it's super easy to implement all you need to do is embed a widget like this on your website which looks like a captcha but instead of having to select images people just click on this they scan a QR code that generates a zero knowledge proof and then we do everything magically for you we have Integrations that can be done either on chain or through a web API so you can really build anything on any chain and if you want to do it on chain it's on polygon there's a bunch of things you can build with this I will now get into the specific use cases but if you're curious about resources this link is actually wrong I'll show you the right link at the end but uh there's a whole bunch of things we have documentation a developer portal the widget the underlying protocol and a bunch of examples most importantly to help you build this this is what that looks like we have a bunch of prizes a lot of really cool categories uh people have built really interesting things in the past so go have fun and then this is the right link if you want to build on worldcoin this weekend go to welcome.org ifsf22 and anything that you need to know the rules uh the documentation fun facts about the orb interesting things you can check it out there all right have fun hacking thank you all right well there's two things left before we go back to hacking I do want to get to the prizes but before that I want to bring on somebody special and we have a really interesting talk prepared for interview prepared for our next speaker I want to bring on Dylan field who is the CEO of figma figma if you don't already know is a design tool that has taken Silicon Valley by the storm it has fundamentally changed how we think about collaboration and just doing design at scale and we're going to talk about how do we make good products how do we think about building more consumer friendly applications and all things web 3. so please join me in welcoming Dylan field from figma on stage that's right this one yeah hey Dylan hi Karthik how's it going it's good I've been trying to get uh carti uh tea to catch on it's not working yet Special K t well let's stick with KT that works KT hey KT I'll go with KT that's my Starbucks name um well there's a lot of things we want to talk about and I want to figure out how do we not figure I want to actually blend in a lot of things about good products and web3 but for a lot of the people that are not familiar in the audience I'd love to kind of learn about how you got into web three what got you excited and just kind of what background you have in this base and everything from that beginning yeah I mean slow Journey unfortunately uh I started getting emails about crypto uh gosh I mean even 2009 I was uh on a uh mailing list 2008 2009 about hash functions uh I think Zuko rather than mailing list about this Bitcoin thing it was a while ago uh and then um I I had this like lecture online about md5 and someone reached out and said hey there's this Bitcoin paper can you please read it and tell me what you think and I was just like these crazy people with their crazy internet money uh and then you know I was in the teal fellowship and uh vitalik famously was part of that uh he emailed the listserv and said hey can anyone please read my white paper no one replied um uh I lived with uh uh Juan from file coin for collabs uh he was my roommates he wrote the ipfs white paper on our table uh I still managed to ignore crypto but eventually I started dating my now wife her name is Elena notalinsky uh founder of iron fish um and and she uh you know was starting to get really excited about ethereum and that made me dive deep in the tour of 2017 time frame uh and I started getting really excited and started to learn the vocabulary more and I was like wow there's a whole world here and this is extremely exciting there's so much going on absolutely and Elena was that the very first youth Global event five years ago and that's how I know her and it's been absolutely incredible yeah she said uh we were actually with Juan and a bunch of protocol House people and uh we're they're all talking about ethereum they're like oh my God it might cross a hundred dollars uh and and she's like why were they all so excited and uh we went home that night on the ride home she starts just like frantically Googling everything ethereum and I said well there's this like thing uh you know in in uh you know um in Canada and like I think there's some people are going to be there and uh it's just he went to eat Waterloo and Heath Waterloo that was when cryptokitties came out uh at that first event and it ended up being a historic event in lots of ways absolutely um and that's how I know you too well so that was a lot on the theory on how you kind of got more and more into the space um what have you kind of done directly I know you've you're involved in a lot of nmt projects uh just as a collector and also kind of an advisor would love to kind of hear back around what what kind of gets you excited there yeah I mean so uh I was actually pretty thrilled because three of the six sponsors I'm like well I was an investor in those um and I I started to get really excited about start a 2017 time frame by the way I don't know how many of you um are uh have entered the ecosystem sort of in the last year versus the last three five ten years um it only takes one cycle to be an OG in crypto which is pretty cool uh and so um you know I started to invest some more projects um the I actually saw the project that probably um got me any street cred into space with scripture punks uh and I saw that in 2017 on uh on Reddit of all places it was like I had no special knowledge uh and I was like this is cool this seems like legit uh art pieces uh potentially uh for ethereum I got excited about this idea of a crypto collectible we didn't have the term nfts yet uh and started to dive into it um spent all my winter break that year in 2017 2018 just like basically learning about every crypto collectible project there was uh ended up buying this Punk 7804 tell us more about that sure uh I bought it for fourteen thousand dollars in January 2018. uh I remember at that time was absurd uh completely absurd I mean it was like 12 eighth uh Eve was almost as high as it was today so peak of the Bubble at that time period And I remember turning to Elena um you know we're getting really serious and I'm like is this the stupidest thing I've ever done and she's like probably probably but Dylan you won't shut up about it so please just do it and get over with it and we'll move on we can enjoy our vacation because I was just like basically talking uh Non-Stop about crypto punks for like a week um and she for what's worse she was talking about zero knowledge stuff for like a week she was going is there some way that you could like play Battleship on the blockchain without like both people knowing you know where their things are and those were interesting times so we had we had a fun conversations for sure and tell us how that story ends about 7804 so 7804 as christian punk started gain steam uh I I ended up selling it um I miss it a lot somebody Anonymous on the internet bought it for 4 200 each so it was quite a increase uh which at that time was seven and a half million yeah it was the second highest day all the time that's right and then people beat it really fast um well that was about a year and a half ago how do you think about nfts now are you still excited about them are you still kind of thinking of them as this kind of Collectibles so that what gets you interested in in that category yeah so I think um nfts are a mixed bag uh I think that on one side there is real art that's happening in the nft space and I am uh I'm super excited about on chain art super excited about anything that's like the smart contract is part of the art piece um I've never really been a believer of you have some files somewhere in the internet and the URL isn't a token and that's like an nft it just feels like not that Innovative to me uh I love seeing ours get paid so if people are artists and they're getting money from that all the power to them it's just not what I am that interested in myself uh I think over the last year as more people have gotten excited about that Mt space there's been more people coming into it uh that money also Drew people that were scamming people uh that were not respecting copyright um and I mean like in a tc08 I mean like you know like I reply um and that those are some really disturbing things to see to be honest and so uh I I also started to see that like if you're somebody who had had success in nfts before there were a certain class of people who were watching your every move in your wallet and would basically um do some really shady stuff to hike up the prices of collections uh and so I started to be afraid of like Trading for a bit and um you know I think that nfts do have some characteristic as is crypto of the more people that enter a system the higher the price of a collection can go uh and the more people that leave the lower it might go it's a little more nuanced than that but but that's that is the basic characteristic of collectible uh art is collectible as well and you know so I think overall I am excited to spend nfts I think that they're the future of media in a lot of ways probably uh and I think there's so much more to explore for nfts but I also am glad that the volume is going down a bit so we can get back to building and we can also make sure that we understand how to guard against these behaviors that are less constructive absolutely thanks for that and and I guess maybe one thing I wanted to see how you think about this is that over the last couple of months we've definitely seen a lot of generative art kind of come in uh Dolly gpg3 githubs Code Pilot mid-journey a lot more experiments that are just kind of making easier for us to kind of think about art that would just either not be possible or just is Way Beyond what we think is human capable uh do you think that sort of changes how we think about that entering in web 3 or just overall in this space how do you think that affects this ecosystem yeah I mean uh I I think first of all the idea of like an art Dao that's actually autonomous is really cool um if you had a sort of AI system uh that's emitting art and that art is then being sold uh and there's sort of something that's self-perpetuating truly without any human the loop I think that's a really cool idea um I I think that um the some of the general models are probably not that relevant to crypto right now unless you're using it uh to create more work um or maybe it helping in this way have our artists earn more money because this is fundamentally a way for them to also make some income from from their work yeah I I think that um if there was a way to for example Trace back to artists that are maybe part of the train data uh and somehow you know create a crypto scheme to make it so those artists are pay that could be really cool uh I think that there's probably a lot more the story to be written about AI art and crypto but I think it's kind of amusing that uh up until the recent major proof of stake you know we had sort of these like three warring camps uh we had crypto we had people that liked Ai and people like gaming and they're all like er we want gpus uh so I feel like it was kind of an adversarial relationship for a while but maybe starting to cool a little bit I think that's definitely happened with with Provence taken the last two months and uh I also think it perfectly coincides with all the the generative art kind of becoming popular because you just have thousands of gpus now um all right enough about some of the web 3 themes that we're excited about let's kind of switch gears on thinking about making good products kind of I'll keep this vague but kind of From perspective what what makes a good product or maybe a good consumer product well I think a good product is uh one that solves a problem uh something that is uh designed with empathy uh is straightforward and on the consumer side I think uh people have even less tolerance for that they really care if you're making a consumer product uh to have no friction and so I think for something like figma where sometimes it takes quite a while to ramp up as a new user uh we try to make it as simple as possible I think about a staircase metaphor where that first step should be very easy to take and over time you can gain Mastery as you progress up those stairs uh and as a metaphor that I think Rasmus originally made but I think for Consumer it's like those steps have to be tiny at first uh otherwise it just never takes off and that's specifically for Consumer you mean or or just is it specifically for a consumer product or any product that you that you yeah I think you want the onboarding and the ease of use for any product to be really straightforward but I think for Consumer especially that's the case uh and if not trying to make it really easy to onboard into uh then you can't reach the The Kindergartners and their kindergarten teachers yeah or the the classic if your mom can use it it's it's not mainstream yet um kind of on a similar theme I think a common criticism that web3 gets is that there's it's a solution looking for a problem or we're not really sure these are mass scale problems do you kind of how do you think about do you have any Frameworks for evaluating product Market fit or what do you think kind of constitutes to use this this is actually solving a problem or a need yeah I think that um there's a little bit too much emphasis sometimes in crypto on price going up right it makes sense because that's like the metric that everyone gets and it's really easy to keep track of um but at the end of the day if you're not solving a problem for someone it doesn't matter right and so I think that usage is undervalued in crypto and price is probably overvalued um and so I I hope to see uh more products that are really focusing on making something that's useful for people and I think that we're starting to see that I think that people are really getting the message and I also think that this is a unique time where we have a chance to to hunker down when prices are deflated a bit uh and really focus on the building and making sure that we're solving core problems and uh I I'm really excited to see what's going to come out of this period there there are 1700 people in this building um and we're going to see a few hundred of these things come out on Sunday so I I am sure we're going to see initial waves of what can happen so that's definitely going to be exciting uh maybe kind of going back in time a little bit I think when when you started figma uh it was fundamentally changing how people think about design uh collaborative on web was not really as a common kind of practice and you kind of had to figure this out over a few years how did you kind of think about those moments where you were not sure there's uncertainty on will people want this or you really believe this is how everything should work but people were really not sold uh how do you think about kind of balling through those moments or kind of how do you think about just powering through this and where do you get the will and what's a good way of thinking about this thing as Founders think about building companies yeah I think um you had to form a hypothesis of where you think the world's going you have to then uh validate that hypothesis as much as possible and the hard part is when you're trying to validate the hypothesis and the validation is not coming but you really believe it's true and I think that's like the the part that no one can teach for us what was that for figma yeah yeah for us like multiplayer editing was that way Webb was that way so we asked people do you want a design to on the web and they're like huh uh you know do you want to work with multiple people like in a Google doc on designs and everyone basically said no uh they're like one or two people that we found that were interested in that but otherwise people thought this makes no sense but as we built it and we tried ourselves we saw There's real value and we also saw that it didn't work if you didn't have uh some way to actually have that multiplayer collaboration and so our own experience led us to believe this is very important and we went all in on it and I think it ended up being you know the main differentiator of figma and eventually people came around but there was some Faith there and I think that um if you have that faith if you feel that strongly and you can do that over a long period of time uh then sometimes there's rewards and sometimes you are ahead of the curve though and I think the hard part is knowing the timing sometimes you are far too early so we were talking about Dows earlier the sponsors you know Aragon right amazing projects uh and and still going but I think um you know somewhat ahead of its time uh absolutely and and there's plenty of projects in crypto that are are similar um in terms of their started so early and it took a while for the rest of the ecosystem to catch up and go wow this is actually a problem that we need to solve right now uh I'm sure you could rattle off like 12 on top of your head at least yes uh you know and um you know we'll remember those well we don't remember the ones that came too late right uh but it ends up being that like if you're just on time that's really important for figma we were on time because webgl was a new technology that existed uh with interaction webgl made it so we could actually build this in the browser use the GPU and the browser and make it very efficient whereas E4 people had to use flash it was too slow and you couldn't make a professional grade tool online at that time and I think the the thing to comment here is that um what you said is definitely true for the product side and I think we kind of already see this Behavior work really well in web 2 and web3 which is everything in the infrastructure side follows the same pattern like things must be I mean the webgl argument here like it had to be there for you to actually build something that would Delight the end user and sometimes these things take time or they're just not performant yet and we're kind of seeing that happen especially as we're going to see how the L2 ecosystem has evolved in web 3 and now set on their stable coins and stable coins just kind of getting massive production markets I mean you name it there's so much that is evolving in ethereum ecosystem that's now these building blocks that are made possible and you can come to hackathon like ESF it's just and you can just go hacks two days whereas before it was like not possible to build some of these things at all yeah and and that's a good measure of a growing developer platform because if things just become pluggable and and componentized that's when you get to a point where you just don't have to think about how something's going to work it just works and you build on the actual problem that you want to solve and I want don't I know you want to do it yourself so I'll brag for you um so much that is due to the work of the youth Global team so I think we can maybe give the round Global team around Applause thank you and it's support of everybody here because um we pulled out the event but they do all the work so I feel uh slightly uncomfortable taking the credit but the rest of the team definitely deserves a big round of applause um a couple other things well one thing we've definitely seen in the last two years is a lot of companies in web 2 are getting more and more interested in web3 whether it's Integrations coming up with their own Solutions or their own competition um and a lot of them are starting to integrate and launch things at scale for hundreds of millions to billions of users do you believe that's kind of the only way to think about Mass adoption or do you believe that more companies in this space are going to become category leaders and kind of actually displace them because they're what three native I I think it's a combination of both I think we'll see web 3 companies take uh that that main stage and and make it so they're able to um some cases disrupt incumbents some cases probably more cases create new areas that hadn't ever existed before uh I think that web 2 entrance should be welcome though uh and I think that when you have these entrants that are going to make it set more people know about ethereum about crypto in general uh and they'll be onboarding all sorts of new customers uh and users in the space and developers I think that's a good thing and so you know I think it's sometimes tough because oftentimes in order to make the user experience really good there's some element of centralization that happens and obviously decentralized uh Computing is such a part of the value set of web3 uh and of this ecosystem and the correlation between centralization and distribution is also very strongly tied exactly and so also use your experience though and I I think though that uh even when that tension exists I think it's worth calling out but ultimately it's important to welcome those players I kind of want to so well this is this is extremely helpful and yeah I don't think it's a bad thing at all like if if we see big tech companies integrate anywhere from webto Primitives to just direct protocols in their application flow I think that's a win for our space because it gets more people excited it gets more people in improving those platforms and fundamentally we we win at the end of the day all of us um I also they think it's amazing like five years ago could you even imagine having this conversation like that would be just wild I mean to just name them directly Facebook launched a billion plus users getting access to nfts on Instagram and that's still insane it's it's an actual announcement you can buy these things on Instagram and I would have never assumed this would be a reality and you you can't they didn't even have the term nft five years ago we we definitely did not so just the momentum is absolutely insane and uh these things kind of come out of events like these um I want to end off by asking something a little bit more serious which I I think you're in the perfect position to to give advice on um we've kind of seen just elephant in the room the the economy is not doing that great we're seeing interest rates hiked up there's an energy crisis people are they're anywhere from Mass layoffs so people are just worried about what the next couple years would look like if you're entering in this market as a founder or as a developer how would you think about structuring the next couple of years especially when you're starting a company are there any advice you can give on how do you think about building successful companies what should people be mindful of uh yeah the main advice I'd give anyone who's starting a company right now is I would say make sure you have enough time to do it right uh and to actually go all the way and uh and really test your vision for figma we were super lucky and privileged to have the success the support of the teal Fellowship uh and that was basically two years of capital so a hundred thousand dollars over two years amazing um I I think that what ended up happening was that you know six months in if we had said okay six months is our our checkpoint and if we're doing well we'll keep going if not I'll go back to school uh I would have gone back to school um you know kind of like head to my legs because fall back no not bad but but um I think we wouldn't be here because six months in we were still figuring it out and it wasn't you know even a year and we were still figuring out we didn't start charging it took more money until five years in right could we done it earlier sure but like maybe four years not five years this stuff just takes time and I think that especially when you have the dynamic in web 3 in uh in crypto of having to build a community as well the good news is that you're surrounded by this amazing community and they're so receptive and so willing to help the hard news is that you have competition too uh in terms of Mind share and it doesn't happen overnight it requires so much effort so much energy in order to build that ecosystem those networks those communities um and so my main advice would be to persevere but also to plan ahead financially and make sure you've got some time I think that's a perfect note to end this on I want to thank you for taking the time tonight and I really appreciate you being here please still in a big round of applause good luck everybody [Applause] all right now the stuff that I
