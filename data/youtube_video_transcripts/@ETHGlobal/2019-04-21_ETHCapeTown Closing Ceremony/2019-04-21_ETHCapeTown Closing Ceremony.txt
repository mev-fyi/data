one um I'm Devin so I've been your emcee for the whole weekend I just want to thank you all so much for coming through for this weekend I hope you all had a good weekend awesome I'm so glad to hear yeah so this has been an incredible week and I think for everyone we've had some really great weather today which is been amazing I mean this venue it's like sitting in a glass box next to the ocean coating all day you couldn't probably ask for a more aesthetic hacker venue which is great the first day was so much so fold of so much excitement everyone was in such a vibe this is really the kind of atmosphere that we wanted to create with this hackathon and make it really inclusive and make it really happy and powerful and I think everyone really got together with getting into the vibe of things making a lot of friends we've had a few surprises along the way we had that incredible musical act last night we've had a couple of musical sessions in between it's actually been quite a musical event very creative and the meditation session as well yesterday was was amazing thank you to nicole organizing that but yeah so now I'm gonna just kick off a little bit with a recap of how the how the hackathon went down we had 190 attendees 144 hack is 69% of which were actually from South Africa so there's a really really cool numbers well done it's been incredible to see the the levels of participation especially from all of the the local Cape Toni ins and Johannesburg Ian's drove workers and and everyone else here assuming everyone as well that traveled far and wide to get here we really really appreciate you taking the time to come down 42% of all of the hackers were in brand-new to ethereum like bran brand new all of the concepts that they saw here today they've actually learned taken and implemented in the in the period of this weekend so some of the hackathon projects that did come out of this has being even more impressive because of that and 15% of the hackers were beginners so had some maybe prior knowledge but we're still very new to ethereum blockchain so it's been really incredible in total we had 33 projects 33 projects is an incredibly high number to get out of a hackathon like this so also Rana pulls all of you again [Applause] cool um so I'd like to just it's been a really intense kind of process judging all of these projects because there were some really really incredible projects and the level was very high and I think you've all done very well but I know the judges have now we've decided on our top four projects so the top four projects in no particular order if you could please maybe come to the stage and they're gonna give now a quick demo of their projects to you guys and just show you what they've done and there's some special mentions as well that we'd like to just say before before as well the presentation demo has come on because there were so many incredible projects we couldn't put them all into the top four but you guys did really really well and you did impress the judges so the top four finalists in our particular order are wild cards okay snap Dee talk and sipping zai cool I think they're all already here cool so the top the top special mentions are us SD for all willow the wisp ulti markets and doll versus doll yeah you guys all did very very well so I'd like to just bring up to the stage now the first project to dama for you and that is the wild cards while cards I want you to all imagine we are on a safari wild cards is an always for sale tokenization of endangered Evita lek black rhino endangered animals like black rhinos are critical to have funding in order to conserve these species so what exactly have we built we have used a harbinger tax system to build non fungible collectible endangered species Rhino cards so what you see over here is a collection of black rhinos that are most importantly always for sale so how does this whole Harbinger tax system work when you see a rhino that you want which is always on sale and scarce you buy it for the current price that it exists at and whenever you buy it you have to set the price which you will sell it at right but if you set a really really high price which you will sell it at guess what has to happen you have to pay tax you have to pay 5% tax per annum on the price you sit to sell it and where does this tax go it goes directly to the Rhino Conservation Fund and this is how we raise money for critically endangered species and right on the back end there our chief engineer is busy making some block train transactions and buying the different rhinos there's Gruff who currently costs to eeth incredible rhino right there or going Biograph and this is the basis of our application and what we plan to do is extend this to many more endangered species such that snow leopards sloths and a myriad of other endangered species can all stand in line to receive funding as people clamor to buy these scarce cards that represent these individual animals and you can also click and see more information on them and if we go right to the end let's go right to the end you'll notice that we get to the end pretty quickly and why do we get to the end pretty quickly because there's not many of these people left these are scarce guys and we really need to look after them so we implore you the community to buy your favorite reiner and start paying your Harbhajan tax to one of these amazing foundations thank you so much guys bye Oh rhinos [Applause] thank you cool thank you so much wildcards um the next project to the stage could please be snap hi hi everyone we're snap so there's there's a bit of a problem and that is if you want to be a responsible investor and you've got a portfolio it's probably in your best interest to rebalance every once in a while and this is actually a bit of a problem when it comes to managing your portfolio in a decentralized manner and as our good friend Theo says fun isn't something one considers when balancing their portfolio but this is again in reference to this particular product but this does put a smile on my face so in order to counter rate this problem we built what are known as snap funds that operate on these snap Oh double double click operate on these snap protocols so yeah what we do is we allow a user to select a basket of ERC 20 tokens select a rebalancing period top it up with some ether and then where it goes it'll automatically rebalance whenever that period rolls around so I can think of no better way to show this functionality than with the demo so you X in decentralized apps is really hard so we try to make it friendly and sort of guide the user through this process by explaining what's going on what you need to do and the whole way along telling every step of the way what needs to happen so we're gonna create a little funkier specify how often we want the fun to rebalance and what we want the starting value to be in ether definitely shouldn't be negative that wouldn't make sense and we're gonna make a name for the fund and now we can go and add some tokens so we can filter by price by symbol market cap sounds like a good thing to do so let's filter by some bitcoins some eath we got to add some dye in this mix as well and we got the latest prices here for each of these tokens and we can go and say like what ratios you want for each of these tokens and we can see obviously like the outstanding balance as shown in this little gray bar here and we can go and like build up the fund based on on what we what we really feel is an important ratios to have in this fund maybe we don't want GNT tokens and then we can go and actually create a fund and deploy it to the blockchain and at this point this fund will be created and we can at any point in time choose to top it up we can add new funds to it take funds out of it afterwards we can modify the ratios the rebalancing period I can switch across your Inc be if we want to deploy it I'm on the main right now because they have more tokens so it makes the UX a little bit better but I do have one fund that is deployed that we can take a look at so we can see some information about that the name of it what assets are in it when the next rebalancing period is and what the current value of that fund is but this wouldn't really make sense unless we can really rationalize this kind of system and this design decision so to this end we made a back-testing utility as well which is open in this tab and where we can actually quantify and justify why this kind of process makes sense so I hand over to the man who made it so yeah thanks for pointing out that I made it because as you see the UX of this is much much worse than the stuff that these guys built but yeah it was very important for us to deep dive into the data and to actually validate that what we were building here and those actually makes sense so we went and fetched price data for the almost a year of aetherium and roughly 10-year C 20 tokens and we deep dived into some serious data science what we wanted to see is how these rebalancing methods actually perform in a back-testing method and this also got this all got translated into this small Python application that you see here that we intend to actually integrate with the much nicer looking web app that just saw so the idea here is that you essentially have you know portfolio of potential tokens that you can choose from at this point because this is a prototype these are all located all uniformly with the fund across the fund that you add there is this tab that lets you choose two different rebalancing methods that we actually tried one is the one that is already implemented in a smart contracts that we did they just mentioned which is essentially just periodically so you can you should go and say I want this to be balanced daily or weekly or monthly or whatever you actually want and the second one is actually rebalancing by threshold that is if you have let's say for assets allocated in your portfolio and one of those is actually a deviates largely from it then this gets rebalance so we snap it and we can have a look at how this performs with the huddle method and we made a we dive that dive deep even even further and to see you know what recommendations we can give of allocations of funds we're in a simulation of fifty thousand random portfolios and these are the uh turns for the maximum Sharpe ratio and the minimum volatility thank you very much [Applause] thanks so much team snap next up is D talk hi so I don't know if you guys know but two days ago 500 million people lost access to a live streaming app in India called Tik Tok and so we set about to make a decentralized live-streaming system that nobody could shut down so we used live pure to handle the decentralized transcoding you can see here and then we used burner wallet for the for the UI to make it very accessible and you could pre-fund some some token in order to access the stream and then we used Raiden to handle the actual payments and tipping so as you can see here you can interact with the UI and tip-in die and that's handled through Raiden and then it continues to give you access to the to the stream and then if you stop paying then the the bar is is reduced and you will lose access to the stream so yesterday we actually ran a like proof of concept of it I don't know if you were here but at the at the back there we had a electronic music artist who was here and he streamed like worldwide through the through the platform and then people were able to pay and tip through the burner wallet system at that time it was through X dye we switched to Raiden yesterday and he raised I think more than $200 actually in people paying to access the stream so yeah that's that's the system thank you [Applause] well thank you so much team D talk the next team to please come to the stage is Sabine's I prepare hello everyone we're team Saban's I this weekend was the first time we pulled anything with ethereum and Sebenza means work in Xhosa and Zulu and basically we're building a mobile platform that enables people in South Africa to make money on their phones and earn a sort of public resume that's been verified by doing data labeling tasks to train machine learning models and suppose you want to do a voice to text system you know maybe it's an audio medical chat system where someone can speak to a doctor but it's actually AI there is no voice to text model for is it pasa Swahili and this long tail of African languages and so we're hoping that Saban's I can help give Africa voice and voice is just one example type but it's what we built this weekend so basically you could take an hour of audio and because there's no model you could have a person listen to it and transcribe it and it would take them an hour and you'd have to trust them with that audio because it might be private data in it and they're going to hear it so you have to trust them and so instead one thing we can do is and I'll show you what a work or signup looks like quickly and we'll do that in the background and then we'll create the the job to do the transcription so the worker would normally do this on their phone but we're going to do this here so what we'll do is we'll upload an audio and we'll digitally shred it into small pieces so that no one piece is longer than five seconds and and then there's no context so you don't have to worry about some private data and each piece will be shown to several workers because we can't trust one worker to give us the right answer and the workers skill is stored on if area so we do that by first giving them a test so here's a closer test Ziva nam sang translates into how are you feeling today in English can you repeat that after me who's even signing I'm Sanjay diya pilla and goes the appeal Engels that's the response to the previous one I'm good thanks in English good Nandini born no no I believe no one came come man the open you born I don't know Billy knowing K which translates to it's nice to see you all happy and and so the worker does this test and we know the right answers so we can calculate their skill and we store their skill on ethereum well go into a little bit more detail on that later but one thing about it is we're verifying their skill and so as they do tasks they that skill goes up and down because we show each task to several workers and we do a sort of skill weighted consensus to get the right answer we do quadratic voting on the skill but we'll go into some more detail what's happening here is we've uploaded an audio file so the 10-second audio file is going to be digitally shredded into maximum five-second pieces and the audio file says psilocybin zis Abu Klea jenga seqable so Putin wound which translates to we can use technology as a tool to uplift humanity in English and so the the the demo spirits are not as kind to us this time is the first time so we'll pull out the video from earlier we spun everything down and we're like yes we could finally go to sleep but apparently we have to do this again so just go to the part of the audio after the video after the you can meet me to sound so basically the ten-second audio gets broken up into color the color codes or the sections allocated to workers and initially no workers have completed it and then on their phones people in the crowd when we did this earlier are typing in the arts like listening to the audio typing in the answer once we get all the answers for a little snippet we run this skill way to consensus to calculate skill and we store that skill on a token and once they've competed all the sections first works the end so I'll tell you what the the theorem piece the way we store their skill but once we have the confirmations and consensus we didn't have the answer for that piece and we put it all together again but from lack of sleep so what you can see is basically we've implemented several lightweight creatable skill token that stores the the basically of the reputation of the author the worker on a blockchain ideally in future we'd like to you know replace that with maybe like a here's he 39 token or something something else but you can see as the you know as a as a blockchain state state suggests you can see artists the skills yeah before skilled off the skill of the of the work Internet of CFX is you know the dropsy gates in is these authority on what what makes a concert something I should I just give it a quick Charlotte also to opens a plan guys you know we're coming from really little variants ability background and having their templates and building blocks and examples have been an amazingly useful tool to do bootstrap and and and help us get up to speed quickly you'll also see some some dye transfer events it's firing from a from the state changes on on a chain that was meant to be our Treasury contract we had some issues of that this morning I think is partly what a diamond op now broke see ideally I mean we would love to give our workers like a stable coin to protect him from the volatility on the mini crypto spice because if this can become quite a quite a valuable income for for for them yeah and I mean some of the other teams mentioned that there's twenty four percent unemployment in South Africa and so we can create jobs where people can use their phones - and bits of money and so far we've been thing with ideas like paying them in airtime but I think Dai would be much better we just need a little bit more than a weekend to get everything working but yeah I mean hopefully you could all sign up and and help us give Africa voice and create jobs while building machine learning systems thank you thank you Sebenza yeah and it's another all-around special congratulations and are really well done - the top four teams you guys have done really really incredible week this work the work this weekend and yeah we're on applause you all again so coming up next our sponsors would also like to come up and give out some special mention Awards with some special awards based on teams that built on their products so I was hoping I could call up now a new cipher to the stage if justin cool getting get another musical interlude test check so sometimes when at a hackathon when there is not a particular submission with a first order of privacy focus or a first order focus on developing cryptographic primitives into a useable application in line with our mission statement of privacy as a human right we decide instead to distribute our awards among projects that have sort of a generally interesting cryptology which i think is the right thing to do for layer 2 applications so if you are working on a layer 2 application you find yourself sponsoring a neat global event in the future and you're in a similar scenario I think that that's the best way to support the community so I have chosen eight such submissions and our $3,000 prize will be divided equally among these eight and I will just run down them really quick and for some of them give the sort of weird little angle that I thought new cipher or more generally cryptological development might be an interesting fit so these are D vote of course with Devo we may want deliberation or a private voting in some sense or batch private voting wildcards you know maybe we have like if you own the card that the animal belongs to only you can see its GPS location so you could like defend your animal although I almost didn't pick wild cards because they cast me as a baby rhinoceros which I thought was odd but then I realized that means I have a lifetime of rhinoceri ahead of me which sounds kind of fun Dowell versus Dow you know although all the weird little in-game components there can be interestingly shared among their participants in secret D talk most cuz it was just awesome the groovy but you could imagine comment section discussion section there snap see folks are so friendly and I love that thing Sebenza I've used cases there I think are probably pretty obvious once you get around to it Lee Co X this thing was awesome and you all were like working on implementing new cipher until the last second but I'm sure you'll get there we've always wanted some cool way to do like a decentralized secure drop and and then last but not least snake nation colony mostly because I think it's pretty gutsy to demo a colony but in each global event thanks so much this has been of course a wonderful event look forward to seeing you at future eath global and other future Etha vents we will be at East New York and we will also be offering a prize there we also have ongoing remote hackathons I it's easy to lose track of them but we have at least one remote hackathon that's going on right now and I believe there's another one starting pretty soon like mid May like in three weeks or something so again discord new cipher comm we do have a channel just dedicated to hackathon logistics you can go in there if you want to continue hacking look forward to seeing you all later today I hope you all have a beautiful day a beautiful evening a good amount of hydration and a beautiful time hacking on whatever me hack you may have next thank you so much Dustin no thank you - thank you - new cipher again for being one of the sponsors for the event I'd like to bring up to the stage now the the maker team [Applause] everyone we saw a lot of great hacks I think 13 teams integrated died or attempted integrate die and I thought for them did a really excellent job two of them were already up in the stage D talk and sub ends I just really quality hacks and you guys did awesome integrating diet and the two ussd projects we thought have a lot of potential in growing dye usage around Africa and so USD USSD for all and lit bits ussd will also split all the most split the three thousand I prize equally thank you that's all Cheers thank you um and yeah thank you as well to maker for being a wonderful sponsor of this event as well next to the stage I'd like to call up Jacob from Raiden hi everyone this has been an amazing weekend and for rate and I think we've had seven or eight teams hacking on Raiden and some other teams showing interest which is awesome for us but three projects were really really amazing and really utilized Raiden in a very cool way and of these three projects the winner will be new tube because they had an amazing demo and came a very far away in very short time so they're the winners but since we like the two other projects so much we wrote back to the mothership mothership in Europe and are currently working on seeing if we can find some other prize for the two other projects which is first part and also detox not detox detox so yeah thank you very much for an awesome week thank you so much Jacob um all right so I'd like to just call to the stage now um Karthik and Andrew to the stage if you guys would like to just come up for each level thank you I'll take that so everybody thank you so much for kind of being patient with all all of us that we tried a lot of new formats and a lot of new things at this event and we're super grateful that we're all here and and about to sort of wrap the weekend I wanted to start off by thanking our sponsors who kind of make the event possible without their support and and kind of everything that they bring from mentors to kind of being there late night to feeding us stuff last minute and making everybody's nights this would not be possible without their support so I want to start off by thanking new cypher thank you so much for being a sponsor to you Cape Town thanks again to maker and Raiden ENS EQ brain bot Taurus and UNICEF thank you so much for supporting this event this would not be possible without you also want to kind of give a special shout out to some of our seasoned partners who have kind of supported us throughout the year for all the events if global is going to do and these were companies like scale zero acts UNICEF again thunder core and consensus and especially for this weekend of Cape Town our event partners if they're in Foundation and Linum laps without their support we would definitely not have been able to make this weekend work and make it a fun weekend for all of you thank you so much [Applause] I'm gonna hand this off to Andrew for a handful of more thanks before we kind of wrap up evening Thank You Karthik yeah I just want to run through on behalf of the entire eighth global team some special acknowledgments for putting this event together you know there's a million different details that go into putting this event together and we started planning with the Linum labs team gosh I think the first calls were last year almost a year ago there's so many late-night calls and so many details to take care of to make an event like this happen and every step of the way Linum labs team has just been awesome to work with they made so much of this happen so it's a huge thanks I want to thank each of them individually Devon Emily McHale Nicole Meghan Wayne Paul Veronica Ben Michael Kent Milani fluorine Lisa Orion and Tyler and of course Paul thank you so much if you see them after the event please thank them because they really made this happen and then also we want to acknowledge all the volunteers there are over 30 volunteers who came and I actually have some special thanks to Craig shabby air Maloof it's on e o Sita and FanDuel a they volunteered for the event did an awesome job so please a round of applause and then of course for everyone who was involved the speakers the mentors the sponsors the judges and the venue staff and the AV team and the event the food vendors and of course all of the hackers let's give ourselves a huge round of applause thank you everyone and just to kind of wrap up what just happened this this evening or this afternoon we had 33 amazing submissions and our six judges in Andy Devon Griff Simon and metallic can saw all these projects and we presented them live to everybody else in the audience too and they did the the hard task of figuring out who the top four teams are and you can us all those four teams go up on stage but the question is what do these finalists win if you kind of been to Annie global event before you would know that this is these events are not competition the goal is to actually encourage people to kind of try out the web 3 stacking and kind of play with a lot of what's out there and actually build something and continue building it after these weekends so as a result we want them to be very collaborative in nature we want them to be very educational and they're intentionally directed towards a lot of newcomers we saw four amazing teams come up on stage and kind of demo what they've done and as they kind of mentioned in their own demos so many of them had not worked on a lot of these technologies two days ago so just being able to see what they did over the past 36 hours is been amazing so instead of kind of having a first second third winner we actually want to say all four of these teams are our finalists and in our winners and as a result the way we're gonna do this is every team will be given every team member will be given 250 dollars worth of eath or die as being part of the finalists so all these team members win $250 USD worth of ether die and I want to congratulate all of them for making it throughout the weekend thank you so much and on top of that we'll also reach out to you with a special kudos NFT token so you can actually brag about the special achievement as a as a winner and finalists for this event and we'll kind of coordinate the the delivery of this token vak coin to you after this event and the same thing for all the other prizes for sponsors as well as our our main prizes and I kind of want to just summarize again like eath global itself is an organization that helps run all these events around the world to encourage more people to get into this ecosystem last year alone we ran six events and attracted a little bit over 4000 developers into into our events out of which a thousand of them had never done any smart contractor what they work and they were kind of entered into the system as beginners and newcomers so our goal is to actually increase the number of developers who are working on this stack and this is how we kind of see our own progress and we do events around different places so I want to kind of just talk about two other events that are upcoming next on our on our schedule the first is in New York which is on May 17th the weekend of 72 19th so about four weeks from now if you're going to be around or if you are nearby or live in the city or would you like to travel please do apply to the event as a hacker or a speaker or a sponsor and go to each New York comm to find out more and this is in May and the next event after that is going to be India which is our going which is going to be our biggest event in Asia for this year and that's on the 2nd of August and to find out more about India uh please go to India that Co to apply or kind of do the same thing for the rest of our events and to find out what else is going on this week this this year for each global there's four more events that we have planned for the rest of the year you can find out about all those on 8th Global CEO where we have everything from the talks that we recorded this weekend to our mailing list where you can find out about what else is going on and also ways to get involved in being able to be part of these events and finally I know you've all just been waiting for me to stop talking and so you can enjoy an intake anywhere from an app to a food break I want to just remind everybody that 3 minutes from now or we're gonna wrap it up and we have our after-party proudly sponsored by e kuu at the grant Africa Cafe and Beach which is just down the street so if you exit from this venue and take a right you'll see it in front of you and we'll be kind of heading over there right after this so there's free drinks and food and we're gonna go on later than the evening and with that I want to wrap up eat Cape Town for the weekend thank you so much woo and before we all leave I got one quick request for all of us we're all we're gonna do is we're gonna clear these tables and we're gonna invite everybody on stage and also on the the first kind of here and we'll just take a group shot from a photo of all of us that attended this event so just kind of everybody make your way out to the stage as well as kind of here and we'll just take a massive happy photo of all of us thank you so much you
