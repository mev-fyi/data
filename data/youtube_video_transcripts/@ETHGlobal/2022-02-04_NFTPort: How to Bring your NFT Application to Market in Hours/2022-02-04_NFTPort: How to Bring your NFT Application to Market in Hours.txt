great so welcome to our nft port workshop and you'll learn how to bring your nft to market in hours we have tyvo here who will be leading the workshop feel free to pop your questions in the chat as we go and typo will take them towards the end taiwan let you take the lead thanks so uh welcome everyone let me first give a really brief introduction to myself so i'm a vp product at nft port and myself and actually many of the other team members i come from an ai background into word 3 and i've been it's been fascinating to me what people are building in this space um it's funny that i actually started my own webster journey also with a hackathon and i i knew the the founder of nfc port from before i asked him for access to the apis and during this hackathon i tried creating my first nfts use the product and eventually i actually ended up working at nft port we do see a lot of hackers or different projects uh in different hackathons or uh trying out uh new projects on their own so i'm excited to see what you're going to build in this hackathon so let me first share my screen and give you an overview of what nfd port is our goal is to be the stripe for nfts that means that nft creation we think should be as easy as making a simple rest api call there are times and places where you might want to spend a lot of effort and put in the the work to to write custom smart contracts but there are also times and i think most of the time you actually don't want to do it you don't want to do that work you just want to get started creating your nfts and we are here to enable that so our goal is to get your application deployed as quickly as possible and not worry about about all the infrastructure behind it and we take care of that for you so the the three main things the three main products that we have that we offer you are uh anyway i'm at nftpart.xyz that's our website so with us you can mint 10 of these uh we have simple apis to deploy contracts and maintenance into these contracts and all of the surrounding things like uploading data i'll go into more detail later uh you can also get nfd data that we have built the infrastructure to index for you so you can get the entity data from multiple chains including polygon which is the focus of this hackathon and in-house apis which are let's say more give you a bit more power on top of this data for example search recommendation engines and counterfeit detection which might be useful to build into your application so the easiest way to get started is to click the big button on our website get free ap key once you fill in this form you will get the api key to your email immediately uh there's no nothing else you need to do uh and then you can just pop into the documentation docs.nfcpart.xml and there are like the the documentation there's a an introduction you can go through it later but the main main flash of it is the tutorials and the api api spec in the tutorials so let me do a brief walkthrough of those you can see how to start consuming the data about nfts without running your own node so how to fetch data from about nfts about collections contracts ownership transactions there are several tutorial meetings so how like what's the easiest way to make with one api call you can start uh minting your nfts uh or if you want more power more flexibility you can deploy your own contracts and mean collections you can create dynamic nfts which where you update the contents of the nfd over time for example an image that changes depending on the time of day and one interesting tutorial how to use nfc is inside unity if you're into building games so we also support these kinds of use cases and with the enhanced apis uh there's a quick start here but uh and i'll later give you a like a live demo of uh of how to search recommendation etc uh and if you if you need support then we have the api status link linked to your knowledge base and also in the in our discord and in the uh is global discord you can get support during this whole hackathon so we'll try to be there for you and solve your problems so let me jump into introduction apis our multi-chain data and apis so um let's say you're an openc and you look at the four-day yacht club collection you can get all of the nfts in there and the contact information from from an api endpoint that we have so for example let me find the contract contact address so this is contract letters and when you go to retrieve contract nfds you can put in the contract others uh this is a interactive demo so it's just in the background it makes the api call for me uh it's on it and let me fire the request so i get back all the tokens but there isn't very much data right now as you can see there's the the chain contract address and token id that's not very interesting we probably want more so i'll also put the optional metadata inclusion parameter and we can see that now we also get the metadata so you can see that token id 1 in that contract if we go to oh token id 1 we get the attributes we get the image link etc you can also get the metadata url which is the link to the original metadata as it is as part of the token so let me show it to you on ipfs this tends to happen so ipfs can take a long time to load and this actually happens with images as well which is a good segue to another thing that we provide for you is you don't have to fetch the the nfd images or nfd files that are attached from from some storage that might be out of date or take a long time to load so we give you in the response that we give you about the nfts you also get cached file urls which is basically we fetch the image so that you don't have to do that we serve sort of as a cdn so that you can easily get the images without going and doing the tedious process of fetching them from ipss or wherever they live so that's one uh that's uh one of the first endpoints you might want to look at when you uh when you look at our data apis um let's look look at the different use case so let's say there's a there's an account and you want to know which nfts this account owns so let's for example take openc chris dixon if you don't know him you can google one a pretty well-known guy in the web free space and let's get these headers you can see all of the nfts on openc we can also get that through this api endpoint so retrieve nfd is owned by an account i have the account address here and you can see we are we have here a list of all the other nfcs owned by discount so this might be useful for example if there is a you're trying to show to the user what nfds they own uh this endpoint would be probably for you uh some other endpoints under under the data apis as well getting all nfts you can iterate through through any of these although there are very many so you probably don't want to get all of them um you can also get nfts created by an account and essentially the difference between owned by an account and created by an account created by means that the nfd when it was first minted it was meant to chew this account to this address so we can use the same encounters and see which entities were created by discount and we get the list list back again and there's tons so some other interesting things you can get with the data api are transaction and sales data so if we take a contract we can get high level statistics on on the sales or in all the transactions surrounding this this contract so if we again take the board contact address and let me put it in here let's see what we get so we got things like uh one day volume uh when they change seven day volume so different time periods uh average prices uh market cap etcetera for floor price uh which you might find useful and you can also get more detailed data so you could get all transactions done with this contract sorry uh i'll put in all and the you can you can also filter down based on what transaction you want so you might only look for transfers or mints or sales um right now i ask for all of them um some of the transact we also return some of chain transactions so the openc and variable order book data are also in here for that contract and it it might be useful for you because not all of the the interesting transactions or interesting um interesting information especially if you're looking into the price are are going to be on chain so some of them will also be off chain request request is taking uh quite long to load for some reason but let me continue with the demo uh you can also get transactions by a particular account again if you have a user then you can you can show them what transactions happened with their account or one other use case that you might be interested in is if you find someone who is you think they're really good at picking nfts you might want to follow um what they are buying what they're selling and based on this maybe come up with a trading strategy or find out which one of these are more popular or there are probably other use cases you can get for a particular nft the transactions uh and uh yeah together these with these endpoints uh you should be able to get most of the most of the interesting transaction data you need for an nft or a contract so moving on to minting this is possibly uh the most exciting part of what the nfd part provides so the the first step if you want to start building your application is probably to deploy a contract um there are for example if you if you upload or if you create 10 of these on openc you create them into their common contract so the openc contract which is probably not not what you want you probably want your own contract for your application you can we also provide something called easy minting where which is basically that you don't have your own contract if you want to get started really really quickly you could just take the url of an image let me find some fireworks and let me teach you my own address and with a single api call i should be able to mint uh yeah here it is so i'm into the nfd with a single api call um that's the easiest way to meet and you can get started with that in you know five ten seconds like i did right now uh however like i said if you're building an application you probably want your own contract so the flow for uh for starting deploying your own contract would start with the endpoint called deploy an nfd contract there are two options you have here so we support erc 721 and drc1155 contacts it's up to you which one you choose 1155 is is more powerful but may be considered by some people uh you know inferior in terms of collectible quality if that's what you're going for so all of the all of the code the smart contract code is open source so if you click on the on the links here you can see the smart contract behind the behind that we will deploy for you yes 1155 exactly the same not the same contract but you can see the contact as well so let me deploy a contract let's call it hackathon contract and again let's mention my address and let's use the standard erc721 okay and since it takes a little bit of time to sync then we don't get back the contract addressing either immediately we get back the transaction hash and we have to retrieve the contact address with the retrieve deploy contract endpoint so when i put it in here uh it's not it's not yet gone through so it will take a little bit of time uh to sync i can see the transaction here as well so it's been included into a block and it will be uh i will get the address soon see if i have it ready okay got it so this is the contract address and let me so let me just say put it down here somewhere uh now i have my contract and now i can start minting nfts into that contract so to do that we have an endpoint called uh customizable maintenance where the chain is polygon uh because that's where a deployment contract contract address is uh this is what i copied here and i'll go into details of the before i actually meet i have to create the metadata of the nft so that's what constitutes most of the the interesting parts of the nft and before that let me let me show you a few of the arguments actually on the contract deployment so um this is the deploy and nft contract endpoint the name symbol loaner address and type this is what we actually specified already one more thing if you want to keep the metadata updatable so it can it can be changed changed after the nft is meet that you have to specify true here if you if you want them to be frozen immediately when minted then you have to set it as false uh you can read more in our documentation later about the details about deploying a contract so jim internative uh what do we actually need we need two things uh we need metadata but the metadata has to point to an image that that is uploaded somewhere so we have to take two steps first we upload an image so under storage we have upload the file to ipfs um so this is really easy and let me pick an image and it will be uploaded ipfs in a second uh it will be backed by file coin using nfd storage so um you will not load it so you don't have to take care of pinning it and let me see if i can fetch it immediately from ipfs again might take a little bit of time let's see maybe another complaint works better okay it will it will take a little bit of time um but i can already create the metadata because i know the uh the hash of the file so i have uploaded a file let me upload metadata so this is where we name in the metadata is where we actually give the name to the nft let me call it test abstract nfd abstract nft and the file url will be on ipfs okay so it loaded now this is the image that i used and it leaves an ipfs and i should be let me update file url yep and the metadata should be uploaded to your ipfs any second now okay got it the metadata lives under this url and now i'm actually ready to meet so back to the customizable meeting same polygon contract address at this start 4b83 it is correct the metadata uri i have updated here now and maintain my address so should be done and the transaction should go through any moment now and soon we should be able to see the uh the nfd on openc as well and other platforms depending on how quickly they index the end of these so let's see let me try to find my contract yeah it's it seems that it's not uh not yet updated so anyway uh after a brief delay of indexing you should be able to see your nfd on any platform or any other provider as well but we should also be able to see it on polygon scan already right so this is my nft living on polygon scan okay and once you have minted you are done your your entities are on chain and you can mint uh using this end point you know keep adding into the contract or you can create a new contract and mean more into that uh the default limits on the free accounts are 100 minutes and five contracts but if you go to our discord channel our sponsor nft port discord channel there's a link to an type form that i posted if you fill that in we will bump your limits to 1000 nfts that you can meet for free okay and let me quickly give you a demo of some more interesting things as well so on nfd port home home page there's this thing called thinkable and this actually is a demo of our of our more advanced endpoints so you can find let me let me see if i can find nfts where the text description contains vitalik and you know here's here are a bunch of responses um this this search it relies on an endpoint that we have called multi-chain nft search and you can see that the arguments the parameters yourself again this helps you avoid the effort of building a full index of of the whole blockchain and you can use the search to fetch and of these um based on the text description uh one more cool thing you can do reverse image search uh either with an image or with text for example i can do with text um smoking with a hat and yeah you can see images where someone is smoking and they have a hat so uh this is i think also pretty cool that you can integrate these sorts of smart or seemingly clever intelligent searches into your application and you can also get recommendations so so oh let me show you the uh the endpoint behind this so multichain nft search when i search for um yeah in the insertion point you can see that and there's a recommendation endpoint which i'm not going to go deep into uh but you can also do duplicate protection so one problem that you might have is that um that some you want your research to be sure that the the nfd they're seeing is actually genuine or that it come it is not a duplicate of something that they have seen elsewhere um and they don't get deforded so for this we have a duplicate detection endpoint where you can put in a url or token id or file upload they all work pretty much the same but basically you put in the url to an image you can see a crypto punk url is here and you get back all nfcs or as many entities as possible that are very close to this but not the right one so uh this is uh useful for adding trust or creating more user tasks in your in your application uh i'll stop it here you can go through all the endpoints yourself and uh i'll take some questions that i see in the in the zoom chat now uh so i was sorry so one question was how can you maintain a teacher contract uh i did show that uh erc3664 uh i don't think i've heard of that uh is that um an extension or is this a new new uh nft token standard oh no uh right we don't support that we only support 719.55 and adding additional data in addition so question is it possible to add additional data in addition to the ipf ipfs image during the meeting yes i'm glad you asked i actually skipped over this part but when you are doing the um uploading metadata before you you meet then these are the you know the minimum fields that you have to add but you also can add in custom fields you can add anything that you want it's basically a key value key value store or a custom object json that you can put in here for example youtube url or background color color or whatever key you want you can store this in the metadata and it will be part of the nft is it possible to batch mint yes it is um so batch printing is possible only if uh if you use an 1155 contact contract so when deploying contract you have to specify type as erc 1155 and then you can use the batch customizable renting endpoints where you can do you know you can see here in the uh call that you specify multiple tokens and you can also have like more than one of each token so you can set the quantity uh json will the json be available when we query the nfd metadata so are the custom fields available when you get the metadata back they should be yes so when you ask for the multi-chain and ft data here you should get them as part of the metadata or if you want you can they will also go into ipfs under the ipfs storage uh another question can you get the metadata and the owner of an nft upload that you open see using lazymint so i as far as i can tell uh openc does lazy minting off chain and i think we do not don't currently fetch those so we only show nfts once they are on chain which are often some of the transaction data as well but we don't show off chain nfts another question from luis can we upload 3d objects you can so with the storage with the storage endpoint where is it upload the file to ipfs so this supports all file types up to 20 megabytes so as long as you stay under 20 megabytes you can deploy or you can upload your 3d object file and then you would reference it in the metadata either in the file url if this is what you want or in the in one of the custom fields uh luis also asks uh how how do you pay for meeting the nft uh the first 1 000 are free if you use the if you fill in the form on our discord so for the first 1000 you don't have to pay and if you need to go above that in the future you can you have two options one you can apply for the community package which is selective so we take a few of the uh the projects that apply and we support them with 10 000 free mints or if you don't get selected which is it's quite competitive if you don't get selected then you can upgrade to the growth package where you get 500 means for free or we included in the price and the extra rates are 0.125 so a bit over 10 cent dollar cents and we are actually working on bringing the price down so that you can like deploy and mint as cheaply as possible but right now to cover the gas costs uh this is the pricing uh we there was other questions or there were a few more questions but i think uh we probably have to end here we're out of time thanks taivo for the great workshop and yeah we'll take the questions over the discord on sponsor nft port and yes you there and hope that you join the next workshop thanks again bye
