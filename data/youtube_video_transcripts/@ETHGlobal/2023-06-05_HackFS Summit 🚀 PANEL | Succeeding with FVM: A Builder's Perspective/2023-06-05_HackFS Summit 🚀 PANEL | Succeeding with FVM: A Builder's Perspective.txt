foreign [Music] so up next when I invite four amazing people here we're going to be talking about everything on fem from a builder's perspective so we have Channel Natalie and Kate talking about all the things that they're doing and uh Nikki from protocol Labs will be moderating this conversation and we're going to cover all the things that all of you can look forward to as you're building with fvm so Nikki Sean and Natalie and Kate welcome hi all right I'll let you kick it off and I'll take it from here I'm really excited to be here uh listening to all the talks since the summit started and there's been a lot of talks about all the different Technologies people can build on so we're going to switch gears a little bit with this panel and uh I hope uh you know the standard depends and inspiring uh session for you guys to go and build out projects so hackathons are a great place to learn um and try out different things and hack on ideas and build them out uh but then there are also places where you know bigger stories start um and this panel is to share some of these success stories so I won't keep talking and I will let all of you introduce yourself maybe and briefly share what your projects are about and what they do what problems they solve so maybe let's start with Kate sure um hi I'm Kate Wong from Acid field protocol so as the view is the first liquid sticking protocol button at the end where life now since 12th of April so what we're doing is to connect our coin token holder and storage Provider by offering a decentralized sticking experience and also like fresh farming so if you are still storage for butter you can only work your note on our platform and then we'll provide higher profitability and if your token holder you do not have a login period but you can stack your money in our protocol so our apis ranging from 10 to 12 20 now based on the market driven interest rate so the interest is compound that every second so it's solving the efficiency problem in power company so that um for within just six weeks we are more than 200 000 power class today already and now 160 for a drastic already and now we're joining the online Adventures ipfs space camp goal and that's why we are here and also so are really glad that I have this opportunity to talk with you guys and please try our protocol sdfile.io thank you awesome um yeah Natalie maybe you can go next absolutely yeah so um I would rather say actually that we we don't just have a one project or just a project yeah basically I would I would say we are Phil Fox team so I'm pretty sure since you guys are you know you guys are building on fbm or you are protocol apps and stuff yeah you know what that Phil Fox Explorer itself yeah it's basically the most popular data service in the Falcon ecosystem right and even if you go to the to the actual website the first option would be Phil fox actually which I'm very proud of um and yeah basically we provide the One-Stop on-chain data display and aggregation services for the filecoin users uh the fixable uh fill Fox Explorer um now fully supports uh fevm which can analyze data for example like contracts and event Vlogs right and also opens the contract verification functions to the community so foxworld has oh sorry Foxwell oh my gosh filmfox is just announced a roadmap actually and we just sent it out to all our partners as well as uh on our Twitter so you're more than welcome to have a look at it um and stuff so we're going to be kind of like we'll try to actively work on filmfox because it's been I think almost four years of existence right but now we're going to be trying to kind of work very um much as well on the social side there you know kind of try to let our partners as well as falcoin understand what we are doing there as well yeah you know try to evolve as well in in a lot of of ways and yeah as you might know we also have other projects that we built as a Field Box team so one of them is a finesse space or fnsdale which is basically a DOT fill domain name which is not only a domain name you know because you can actually control or I would say I like to say control though it's more like you know you can kind of register or give your Dodge field domain name to your miners as well through the fill Fox so that's a pretty cool thing you know considering it's a domain name yeah the other domains that don't really have this kind of function so it's pretty cool and I believe it's a very good thing for the file coin itself yeah ecosystem uh and also uh yeah so FNS has actually been integrated by um sft St Phil Kate shout out there um as well as Phil far oh sorry Phil fox fox wallet and other partners as well and as you might know we also uh taking a big part in uh developing Fox wallet itself which has reached pretty good numbers as of now so yeah go Fox team here thank you so much nice um yeah maybe Channel you can go next yeah super excited so I'm uh co-founder and CTO at link and at link we are building GameFly infrastructure allowing game developers to build their web free games in just a couple of minutes uh integrating the web three aspects inside the game so we are making blockchain gaming accessible for everyone allowing game developers to ship fast build fast and even fail faster as well without worrying about any blockchain complexities cool cool stuff and um yeah maybe let's uh segue into your Journeys on building out products using fcm or in the filecoin ecosystem because I'm sure it's been a journey where if you've been curious maybe excited then you started building something then oh and then you were like stuck at some point and then there's like you know you're looking for support looking out everywhere maybe being part of hackathons or other Builder programs and then you know finally like you had the oh yes it look it worked moment right so maybe let's let's walk through your Journeys and um yeah and if you please yes um I guess the Builder journey is like super excited um I think that few things that critical resources that can help us is like um the familiarity with the focal ecosystem because some of our team members working around the Falcon system for like two years and then that makes us familiar with the fbm the superpower system and the second thing is like a close communication with the protocol apps and also falcoin or slack because our slack is a good stuff that you can ask any question and you can get from reply easily and the last thing is the cohesive and experienced and that we bought together and then to work for something good and also well one thing to thank you is the online Adventures FaceCam that really helped a lot all right let me dive in then I I do uh I would like to just say like absolutely agree with everything Kate has just mentioned and probably I would add that for Phil Fox team it was a bit sort of easier at least recently yeah because we already had a big experience in in building on Falco India so we're kind of like when we were already very familiar and understood all the like technical details you know file coin very deep um but so for example building FNS was kind of like sort of easy in this way so once we for example we participated in the hackathon in I think it was December 2022 right so so it was kind of like probably easier in the way but at the same time you know as a like I am not I'm personally a BD member right so I do business development so there's a certain part of my job you know that where I kind of like Get it involved right but when it comes to building of course I don't know as much but what I do know and what the feedback that I got from the team was basically is the most important thing is the obviously official documents you know there's always a white paper there is always the the docs there that you have to look at you know and as it was mentioned by Kate like slack you know so you have to always keep uh communicating as well as networking as well as understanding what's happening all the updates and stuff right and you know so this way you can understand basically all the you know compatibility differences of the fem in the quickest way possible race um and stuff and you know and generally like like at least from our experience the fem team as well as the youth Global team that was super helpful as well throughout the whole like let's say building hackathon building period as well so it was pretty cool you know and and obviously the whole team has to kind like sink in together and when one person is freaking out the other one has got to be like okay I gotta put this in my hands and then the opposite so that's how it was yeah um I'll go next so uh we like I have been a game developer I'm a builder so I am a developer I love to build and I'm the uh like I I love building I love coding so what I do is I have been running a game studio for more than five years I'm a game developer and uh this entire Journey started because in 2020 uh like we have already built more than 60 plus games cyber casual casual games and in 2020 when we created our first web free game we uh we stuck upon a problem that a infrastructure side of the web 3 stack is completely broken and that's when uh it all started because we created that again a web 2 game in just one week but just to convert that web 2 game to web3 it took us almost two months and that's when we figured out that a lot of resources are not available in the space at the moment the complete infrastructure is completely broken there is nothing uh no information as such which is available in the market and we had zero dollars in our bank account and uh when we started link so uh that's when we we figured out the problem we started working on the infrastructure side we started fixing the problem we started simplifying the blockchain stack for any game developer to create a web 3 game and we have also participated in multiple hackathons because I believe that hackathon is something that brings the best out of a a team a building team a developer or anything because you have a deadline you have uh only 48 hours you have only seven days to build a product and ship it out and I also created a product till the last two minutes uh before I have to push it and the deadline is about to end so it brings the best out of a developer it brings them out of a comfort zone and it increases that hunger to build out uh the stuff that you you wanted to build since a very long time right and like the last hackathon that we participated was speron dapathon and we won in the mantle uh pool prize and we created the nft deployer uh working on top of man till then we have also been leveraging fried coin ecosystem since a very long time I think since more than a year now because that stack is completely decentralized so every in-game asset that is stored on ipfs is spinned with file coin and when if evm came we have been leveraging fpvm as well with all our capacity and how we can Leverage The the power of every VM and file coin at all the possible ways and we have also created the dynamic nft standards in a file coin hackathon which happened I think six months back so uh like hackathon has been a great game changer for us as well and I believe that any uh Builder out there must participate in hackathons awesome cool maybe I can ask you the next question shanu so you continue along the same line so say when you go to hackathons uh and then and you see like these 20 different projects and all of them look like fun and exciting right and you know like which one do I pick now like how do I start like what's that process like and how what advice would you give to the hackers at hack FS on you know how how to find their way like what to pick also I've also seen multiple companies just built out of hackathon they have just created a poc in the hackathon and later on they have become a multi-million dollar company because that POC was something that was solving the real issues of the people so I believe that once you're participating in hackathon you have the hunger to solve a problem now that if I have an option to choose among 20 other projects that which one I should build the first thing will be how many problems will I be able to solve with the product uh whichever I go with so if I'm going with one product that doesn't solve the problem but it is super exciting to just like show it off with other people then I would rather remove that out of my to-do list and choose something that actually solves the problem for multi-billion people not even multi-billion people even if I'm solving the problem of thousand members 1000 people I would be happy to do that because right now we have like for example when we started uh we don't had any game developers building on top of us because we were just trying to solve the entire Tech stack for everybody out there but now we have more than 100 plus game projects for building on top of link and when I look at those projects it feels like okay now we have done something uh grateful for them that they are able to leverage our Tech and they are able to integrate them with three elements that took us almost two months to do and they are able to do that in just two minutes so that's one thing that I would look for that if you are building something look out for the problem that you are solving for the people and hackathon is one of the best opportunities to do that out there nice um yeah maybe Kate and uh Natalie you can go next and just like what's the advice you would give to hackers to attack us yeah um I'll say maybe two keywords that one is pivots and nonetheless confidence um because from what at the beginning um we are learning the fem open hack day that uh we're not using acid build as the product because we put out a bit at that time I still feels a large product but like you know hacker points like a super short period of time so that we just pivot and because um extra crucial part this is called wfo the raffle and then that part will be easier for us to do and we're more confident in do that and with that part um we like submitting that line This approaching the next Monday then our team confirmed the plan on Tuesday and interface on Wednesday document on first day and then video on Friday and then submitted over the weekend so it's super packed and then let's require a lot of um strong execution skills and also early planning and also all complete 10 so um for a little bit advice or maybe a little bit further floor I'll suggest that um hackers can go to visit fbm.thaucoin.io that a part called what does Appian unlock because um fvn is like a completely open playing field with unlimited opportunities there's so many things that can think about and also um at the workshop that we are having like today and that will be helped a lot cool um of course I would totally agree and totally sign up for with everything that shanu and Kate said yeah so first of all yeah you gotta bring the value second you gotta have the arrangement the right Arrangement you know how the team works and I guess it also proves a lot of like what kind of team you are and how I wouldn't say maybe reliable UI in general right because it's pretty important right so yeah in terms of value for example what what is important for us yeah because uh we built FNS which is a DOT field domain name right so we were thinking well domain name apart from like because first of all at that time which was December 2022 right it was the you know the the time when the domain names in general for like different chains and networks they were like thriving right it was crazy everybody's super like hyped up and stuff so it kind of like marketing wise and stuff like it made a lot of sense second generally domain names they give you this branding so this would give the file coin itself or fbm yeah the big big branding itself right because because the more projects integrate.fill domain name you know the more kind of visibility it brings to to filecoin itself right so that's that's one of the uh values that we we saw and the second one obviously was the fact that we also created the minor domain Services while through the filmfox so it was like a whole kind of inter kind of connection there so that that's what you know we saw in that and so it was like a perfect combination there and of course the arrangement as I mentioned yeah like one person freaks out another one it goes like okay we gotta we gotta take over this and then and then because what happened for example to us I was I'm the BD right but I was also kind of like like I was taking care of the making video and the uh presentation and stuff you know and there was like 300 recordings and stuff you know and I just only took care of that and then when it came to actual presentation which was at 3am I mean for me and I remember Stephen who was a main developer he was like I think I think I cannot do it so I was like okay I'm gonna take care of this you know so it was like a whole you know you gotta take care of each other and that's that's what is the beauty of it but at the same time it's important for the teams to understand okay if so what we have each other's back yeah we know how to you know help each other in a certain situation because it you know somebody is very good at I don't know building somebody's good at speaking somebody is good at whatever you you know because it could it's it's a difficult kind of thing to do right you can be you can have a fantastic project but a lot of things also depends on like depend on how you kind of present it as well you know it's all you know it's it's the world this is how Humanity works but anyway that's what I would say yeah super agree with everything Kate and channel has have mentioned so I kind of sum it up sum it all up yeah no I think uh you touch upon like a couple of really important uh points that uh hackers often either don't think about or at least in my conversations that I've had every time I've gone to an end Plus in hackathon it's like even if you are an already existing big team you can still go to a hackathon and build something out from scr up from scratch and then you never know like you know it becomes a part of your product later or it gives you ideas and you get to explore tools that you might end up using in in very different ways and I think the second part that I really like is that you know you you don't uh I mean yes hackathons are great for developers but then you also need a lot of other people to you know turn your projects into actual companies later uh so hackathons are also a great place to find such people uh so no matter whether you are not a developer you will meet developers at the hackathon or if you are a developer you will meet other you know storytellers that you might need at some point uh as as you continue building out your project um so yeah this was awesome I love hearing your stories I hope hackers sound inspiration uh in it too and yeah hope to see you guys again on some other panel someday likewise thank you for having us thank you okay thank you so much for that amazing discussion and it was really good insights and I think the takeaway is that uh can you do something that you enjoy doing and uh it's better to solve a problem for 100 people who really have something than a thousand people that may have probably a a problem so focus on that especially as you have limited time and Nikki thank you so much for facilitating that amazing conversation take care everybody
