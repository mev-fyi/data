welcome everybody good morning good afternoon and good evening to a lot of you uh thank you so much for staying with us for this entire weekend i am kartzik one of the co-founders of beef global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to the closing ceremony in the finale for what three weekend so for those of you who are joining us again on as first timers we're watching all this thing on eatglobal.tv and this is the interface we use to chat with everybody and and relay everything that's happening on the live stream back to our speakers so if you have any comments or questions as as the event comes up whether it's about the prizes or the sponsors or any follow-ups you can ask them on this chat and uh and for everybody who signs in and engages with us we'll also be giving out nft tokens for participating and being part of this event so um with that said let's quickly get started so this event is brought to you by eth global and the goal of eve global is is very straightforward we want to get as many developers into the web 3 ecosystem as possible and we do this thing by running hackathons and summits and this weekend was one different we ran a summit called y web 3 where we did a lot of interesting talks on interesting topics like what's happening with nfts and dows and d5 and also interesting problems that are still left to be solved in this space for us to get to mass consumer adoption for the hackathon specifically we had over 275 hackers participate for the last two days i mean where 500 people watch our summit uh the hackers participate from 35 different countries uh and stayed up uh super late and super early across 14 different time zones and they worked on so many incredible projects and we're going to see a lot of that today on top of just the hackers we also had 40 mentors who are there to help all these attendees really get unblocked on any of the projects and we have participation from 10 different companies in this ecosystem and throughout all of that we are giving away over 50 000 this weekend in prizes for doing various things and we'll kind of go into a lot of that very soon on especially thank protocol labs for being our partner for this event they have been amazing to work with and such an incredible number of people are super excited to build on decentralized storage uh solutions like ipfs and biocoin so um i can't wait to have some of you also look at what amazing things came out from this hackathon that also use pl we also want to especially thank live pier who were actually using for this live stream uh hotties textile lithium foundation the graph chain link ocean protocol unlock protocol and ens for being our supporters for this event and all of them are giving out prizes for various things for using their protocols and they'll be talking about who won um what prizes uh very soon so this event has been absolutely incredible we we never expected the number of engagement we'll get the amount of engagement we'll get for this weekend especially as we ran this in on a very short notice but the number of amazing projects we saw totally blew us away what's even more interesting too to me is that this event targeted specifically people who were on the web 2 side and wanted to learn more about what's happening in web3 and after we crunched all the stats about this uh the sign ups and the participants 47 of people who are participating at this hackathon are brand new to ethereum this is incredible and even more mind-blowing to me when you get to see some of these projects in a few minutes and throughout all of that in the last 48 hours we saw like 94 projects come out of it we were not expecting this so we had some delays and just making sure we can get basically 2x number of projects to be judged and uh and i'm super glad that everything went through and we have now selected what happens next so before we tell you what's what's uh what some of our top favorite teams are i want to quickly thank the 12 judges that spent the last few hours really going through all these projects they asked them the questions they looked at everything that the teams were doing they were getting and giving their feedback and without the hard work and sort of the the tough choice without their um actual uh decision making we would not have where we are now so we really want to thank everybody that made this event possible from our judge's side and and for doing all the the hard work um for really kind of pointing out what's super interesting for us to surface up and throughout all of that we have 12 finalists that were super proud to announce so in no particular order i want to congratulate all 12 of these teams so we have zero fee exchange crosston wallet dashboard open signs data wallet nft me the ultrasound music project we have dbs the decentralized broadcasting stream we have convo space me meta artwaltz youtube nft drop nft factory factory and canva nft mentor a lot of obvious themes here and i'm sure we'll we'll see some super cool demos so what's going to happen is we're going to invite these projects one to one back to back and they'll they'll come on and demo you uh what they built over this weekend uh they'll have uh four to five minutes to present what they've done uh whether it's a live demo or some of them ended up recording a video uh to keep everything in in time um and then we'll move on to uh the next team there will be a q a unlike our previous events so we'll just going to be doing 12 back-to-back presentations before we jump into these demos i kind of want to take a a moment here and really think the other 82 projects that are not on this list but are still amazing projects that spent the entire weekend working with us learning new things trying out different products and experimenting with what's possible just because you were not one of these 12 teams does not mean that you were not good enough or it's uh there's something that was missing this event is about showcasing some interesting and cool projects that we like from our judges and our goal is to really encourage everybody to keep working and continue working in this space so um please don't be discouraged we really want you to keep working on this and as you continue to build on your projects starting tomorrow please rely on leave global to be a resource to help you anywhere from getting unstuck from a technical standpoint to getting you connected with the people you want to get in touch with to anything else that we can offer we really want people to continue building in the space and uh and that's one of the reasons why we organize a lot of hackathons and also a lot of our summits and those are just the 12 teams but there's so many projects that you can check out live from our website so to to see the whole list of every project and and anything from what they did to their source code to who built uh those amazing things and what they were technologies they use you can head over to what3.8 global.com showcase so it's just the event website slash showcase and you'll be redirected to all the 94 projects so all that said i think we are ready for our first demo so without further ado i'd like to call up canva nft mentor as our first team who's going to demo their project so we have garage from canva and ft mentor and whenever you're ready please feel free to share your screen for the web 3 weekend hackathon i worked on canva nft winter canva is a popular graphic designs tool which is used by people all over the world it includes a good collection of default templates also people can import their own custom designs too hence i thought that it would be a good idea if i could build an extension for canva which would allow designers to upload their designs to ipfs and filecoin and then they would be redirected to a page where they could publish the nft now let me quickly show you a demo for the same so on the home page of canva you can see that there are various default templates and also there are various categories of templates now i'll go to a particular design which i've created now let me publish this to ipfs and filecoin for this i'll search nft environmenter and then i'll give a name and then i'll click on save so at this step it will try to contact the backend which i have built and that would in turn try to upload the image to ipfs and filecoin yes now you can see that it has been uploaded to ipfs and filecoin now i'll click on view in canva and lft mentor yeah now i'm already logged in okay now i'll uh select an address say for example ens and you'll enter and if i was not logged in right then i could log in using google so in this way designers could use the same google login for canva as well as for the channel nfc mentor and here also users could also send the nfts to uh various google accounts uh for this it uses the taurus reverse lookup api now let and you can see that the ipfs metadata is already present over here let me click on mint nft now as you can see that the nft is successfully minted and below i can see the collections of all the nfts that i own here you can see that it has a particular token id and a contract address this concludes the demo for canva nft mentor thanks amazing thank you so much garage um a lot of cool things i feel like one thing i'm just seeing from the names uh from all the projects is that uh they're all designed to be ready for everyday consumers to to use and interact with so this is super cool um there are a lot of questions that i want to ask and i'm sure they're coming in so uh sadly we don't have uh the setup and the time for that so we're gonna have to do a lot of back-to-back demos so really appreciate you working super hard this weekend and also you staying up super late to demo this so thanks again and uh we'll move on to our next team um so next up we have zero fee exchange and we have scott from zero xerophy exchange to demo take it away hi everyone welcome to zero phase change we are making a zero field limit order interface on unisof v3 so the way that it works is that we are able to create a limit order that is similar to centralized exchange but on a decentralized exchange more specifically being on the unit swap v3 the reason why you would want to have like a limit order on the centralized exchange for example is maybe you want to avoid the price impact for instance like when you are creating swaps on like the central exchange you will experience through like a price impact and then like even if you use some sort of mechanism to like simulate the limit order you will still get that price impact when you execute the swap function the way that we're doing this actually helps you avoid not only the price impact but it also helps you execute the trade without paying any trade fees and as a matter of fact you will actually be making fees out of the uniswap lp compensation fee which essentially means that you will be making money when you're trading at the same time so what happens in the background the limit order is essentially constructed using a single tick out of range lp position on unizofv3 this allows you to have maximum capital efficiency and liquidity positioning while also maintaining a price execution that is somewhat similar to an order book limit order this is like one of those hidden features of unisoft v3 range position that i think a lot a lot of people are aware about and hopefully this hack will provide an easier access to this feature as you can see here i'm connected on zero of exchange that is currently fetching data and interacting with the units of retrieval of eat dye on robsten so for instance here i can create like amounts of you don't want to buy like for instance one or maybe like what's the price of like the e that i want to like create this limit order add so for instance i can just put 300 and then i can just like create the order and then interact with the metamask and so on and so forth so for simplicity sake we will just like see one of the current active limit order that we already have so if you see here we can already see several of my old positions and so like in here you can see this current out of range positions that have actually been executed this starts with 100 die and now it's fully converted to 100 eat as the price goes uh down it's like a eat purchase so from here you can actually collect the fees from the lp fees that you're generating while creating this trade and of the same time you can withdraw the full liquidity which means you're closing this trade so essentially using this kind of trick you're able to create this limit order on a decentralized exchange without any fancy requirement like using a keeper network for instance so yeah this is our hack and i hope you enjoy it that was incredible i didn't know you could you could do it you can do that uh thank you so much scott that was super cool is uh you you mentioned that it was on coven is uh are you plans for this to be on mainnet or uh what's next yeah i think we'll try to launch it like you know in the next few weeks to come once this is like more cleaner and production ready but like yeah thanks for having me that's awesome can't wait to play with this well thank you so much um our project number three is cross chain wallet dashboard so um max whenever you're ready we can uh give you a demo sure so we are adrian phillip and max from germany and we built the cross chain wallet dashboard we are actively using all the new layer 2 solutions and came across the problem that it's quite difficult to keep track of your liquidity across these chains because you have multiple wallets you have wallets on the different chains and it's not that easy to see which coins do you have where metamasks not showing all the coins um in your wallet sometimes so we thought it's a good idea to build the overview of all these chains and how much liquidity you have on the chains so what you see here is our dashboard i connect my wallet and it shows me how much coins i have on which of these change aggregates them for me so i can really easily see where all my liquidity is coming from a web 2 world with a sus background we had to check unlock in this web in this hackathon to build in a premium feature in our app so you can add one wallet for free but if you want to add more wallets you have to unlock them i did this here so i now can add a new wallet for example i just used a cns name and add an additional wallet here to make this feature more appealing to users we added a little social proof feature down here which uses the graph to check if other users bought this signups these premium features and shows people live how many people bought the feature in the last 24 hours different to normal e-commerce solutions where they have features like this as well we link to etherscan so you can really check which people bought stuff and it's not like fake like in the normal web too moreover um we host our website on different platforms like this is a github page we also have a decentralized solution using textile um it's a bucket we deployed and then uh linked to cloudflare to have a nice domain name and uh cdn integrated so it's uh quick for users to use also we tried we tried also fleek which is an alternative and works quite well as too um to onboard new users we also built in features like showing which gas is required on which chain and give me them some hints where they can get some for free to get started because getting started in these chains is quite difficult because you need all the tokens and stuff that's actually what we are planning to build next um so we're looking forward for next hackathon because we want to integrate ways to move funds between the chains exchange them automatically and i'm looking forward to building a great solution for that amazing that was super cool and uh i think i have some good news for you the next event is entirely focused on d5 so i'm sure we know it's perfect for that that's really cool i i like the social aspect of this and uh again i'm just constantly impressed and i feel like i'm gonna say this eight more times but uh seems like things are ready to be used by everybody and they're just not on local hosts so this is always great to see and uh congrats again and uh thanks for doing this thing late in berlin so thanks everybody um we're gonna move on to our fourth project for for today and that is project nft me so we have the dark chester and cole promoted whenever you're ready feel free to share your demo hi um thank you very much for organizing the event um so what we've got here is our project which is taking a step back from nfts and thinking about the supply chain aspect of nfts and how you get to actually produce these and where they're going to be used so what we're doing is in the demo we are now creating let's say a scarce resource that is a hublot super rare watch we're going to give it a symbol and we're only going to mint two of these our contract is now creating a 721 erc token and we're going to now create production stages for this creation of this watch what this will do is it will give us a way for us to visibly track how we are producing this for the consumer and if we were doing something like um fair trade organizations wanting to be able to see how you're sourcing your materials we can do this so we've created a resource stage a building stage and now a customization stage what we then do is we will create suppliers that can sign for this particular stage we're just using local addresses here but you can create as many as you like and just choose from the collection you also create a signatory which would then be either a manager or somebody part of your quality control or even your customer if you're doing let's say a design stage or some contracting work so they'll approve and sign that work so we're creating all of these for the independent stages so we've got one for every single one now and now we're minting a token or an instance of the product that you're creating in this case it would be the hublot watches we've created now two instances instances you'll see and because we are enforcing our scarcity in here we can't mint anymore and that's locked into the contract and so what we'll do now is we go into the actual production stages where now you're saying who is supplying it who is signing for it resetting fees in this case it's zero fees because it's internal to our organization but you could very well put anything you wanted in there what you're seeing here now is we are uploading as the supplier some corroborating documentation around where we're getting our materials from in this case is just an image which is uploaded to ipfs and i'm just jumping into ipfs here just to show you that it's actually gone on to ipfs this was uploaded earlier so the hash is the same and now we're moving on to the build stage and you'll see what's going to happen is the next stage will you'll choose the approver and the supplier i mean the signer and that in turn closes the last stage signs it and if there was a payment pays for it we're uploading the invoice in this case for the building stage and you'll see it now uploaded on the side there as i said we're just using images for that but it could be pdfs or other documentation and now we're getting the last stage of customization where you might be putting tweaks on there for your customer like little tags and things on that they particularly would want and we're uploading that and this will be the pictures of the final product which is a hublot watch and finalize will then close it off saying the work has now been complete and now and only now can the nft be transferred the contract internally is blocking everything off we spent a lot of time focusing on the testing aspect because we wanted to make sure it was tested and it actually provided us insight on where things were going wrong and gave us ideas on improvements and that is pretty much our presentation thank you very much amazing i uh this is super cool yeah it's a amazing real world application and uh you've kind of done so much thinking here so maybe i have just one question for for you um was this your first time building on web3 or solidity i saw you use each scaffold and i'm curious to hear what got you into this so the team and i we did the consensus boot camp at the end of last year so this is really other than the bootcamp project this is for me is one of the second project that we've actually built so it's still fairly new to us well this is great congrats this was really well thought out and uh and congrats on being a finalist thank you very much um next up we have me mera so we have ollie and the team already here so whenever you're ready feel free to demo hi we'll be splitting our presentation into two parts we'll do a market and product walkthrough and then we'll do our data walkthrough as well sounds great hi we're me meta and we built a digital lan aggregation tool with analytical insights at its core blockchain has enabled a powerful new class of user controlled decentralized experiences metaverses are emerging as central hubs for community free expression and investment already there's more than one million monthly active users across these metaverses they've spent more than 300 million dollars and by 2025 it's predicted that the ceiling will increase to 189 billion dollars so what can you do in the metaverse you can create art you can invest in land you can generate passive income on this land by building games and experiences and of course you can build communities so what's the problem right now there is no central optimized hub for nft land of the places that offer an experience many of them do so in a sub-par way sometimes even using stock images of the land of the data that's available it's not enough to make an accurate determination on the value of your land land recently sold for 300 ether we want to know why of course this is a problem which exists in the real real estate market as well where data is notoriously difficult to acquire we've broken down the problems of three main areas a lack of data a lack of insights and a lack of accessibility so why web 3.0 well web 3.0 is open and trustless the data is trusted available and decentralized anyone can verify what we're doing aggregation and scale are also critically important it'd be impossible for us to operate without web 3.0 tools like graph and ocean in return we feed new key insights back at the dfi ecosystem and create new subgraphs in the process of course no middlemen are needed no cuts are taken our analysis is automated and agnostic our mission is to source analyze and make accessible deep automated insights on blockchain real estate in terms of our model we look at four main areas proximity to value historical behavior foot traffic and adjacency and predictive analytics so we can ascertain where the value of your land might be going welcome to mimeta right away we can connect our wallet we can control which metaverses are displayed on this page we can get access to our heat map data from ocean we can connect to different metaverses and see their listings all of the maps are interactive within a given metaverse we can look at the details we can even pull in events we can also filter listings by what's on sale or by foot traffic each listing is active and we've created a deep details page for every listing including information about the price history the proximity score and various offers over time there is a growing universe of partnerships within this growing metaphors hotels malls businesses and celebrities are all already building a presence in the metaverse partnerships with atari htc and digital currency group are just the tip of the iceberg already large-scale investment firms are looking at nft land republic realm has opened up a nft land division and greyscale has opened up a 15.2 million dollar trust for mana which is the currency of decentraland so what's next for us we want to look at land ownership and management we know that right now wallets are not designed to manage land we want to continue providing analytics for everyone from empowering professionals to aspiring investors lastly we want to correct direct buy links to the metaverse again cutting out that middleman wherever we can we've got a great team with a lot of real estate experience distributed across our members and we had a great weekend thank you for your time and we're excited for the steps ahead amazing that was such an impressive demo and uh i'm seeing the same comments on our chat everybody's trying to understand how to do all this thing in the weekend so this was uh this was awesome just i feel like the metaverse is inevitable and uh this is such a cool way to interface with digital in and what's happening physically in events so congrats sorry not to cut you off uh we do have a short very short uh i mean that's the second part guys it's all right yeah it's over right yes so this is just a notebook uh that i threw up last night uh i come from a data science background so a lot of this the data is uh difficult to access sometimes for us you know who are less advanced in the in the web department and so we're just throwing it all into uh csv format so that you can come in here and build simple visualizations like this this is estate bids open canceled sold but another one i liked a lot was the relationships between bidders and sellers this is a tool i like called graph the street but it's all we're looking at here is successful sales right it's these big circles are going to be your big hitters who are buying properties successfully over time and you can see how they're interacting uh with the rest of the ecosystem and so for me from a data science standpoint as well as a little bit of real estate experience having access to this data it's just amazing so i want to thank the graph for that and that's that's all my part wow well that's definitely very amazing to see and visualize so this is super cool i hope you actually keep working on this and uh you know one day we get to use this all together um so congrats and we are ready to move on to our next demo so next up we have convo space and we have another presenting from the team hey everyone today i'm presenting the combo space the decentralized conversation layer of internet space aims to attack two problems at hand a fragmented ecosystem that is conversations about a topic can only be accessed from one side like conversations on twitter are only on twitter each platform has a sort of a different way and place for interacting with users control and ownership of data centralized platforms have the ability to decide whatever is removed what stays up and each conversation is essentially motivated by likes and shares and the goal is to serve ads converse space solves these problems by creating a decentralized conversation layer with which you can start instant conversations on any website in a decentralized and unstoppable manner it has an extensible architecture which allows people to create independent interfaces and the custom interfaces can be extended using the api to make interactions possible in a multitude of ways potential use cases are tons so it could be these conversations could be embedded in nft you could comment on either scan and have that comment show up on your wallet it can help to raise awareness with conversations on let's say a treasury can show up in other websites for transparency so let's jump right into a quick demonstration using convo is incredibly simple you can try it out on the home page also here all you have to do is scroll down and view the embedded iframe messaging on convo is also as simple as writing a new message logging in which connects to your meta mask and just hit send that's all you need jumping right back into the dashboard we can see all of the features of conver connect your wallet and it will open up your meta mask fetch all the content connected to the combo space on your dashboard here you can view all the comments that you've made across the internet on various websites here you can see i've made one on the home page and one on the docs page you can view all your identities here you can see that i'm not verified on proof of humanity but i'm quite identified you can view your own data download your own data nuke your own data and even monetize your own data all you have to do is simply hit make a data token give it a name set a cap and hit create what this does is that it downloads your data from ipfs in textile stores it on filecoin and ipss sends it off to the ocean protocol contract and fires up a transaction wherein you can approve your data and approve the transaction and boom you've got your own data let's hit confirm and that's all it takes to make your own data token on the combo space now in the developer toolkit you'll find your api key wherein you can view the docs and integrate your own converse space the transaction is confirmed and now we'll be able to find our new twitter token here you can find the conversations on other websites jumping right back here let's if we open up the docs website now here we'll find the conversations that have been made so let's say if i go down to the docs website i should have a comment that i made a while back yep here it is convo is powered by ems so anywhere you go you'll see your ens usernames and your decentralized identities and using convo is incredibly simple to create a link simply scroll down enter the link of the website a unique id and simply copy the code and put it in your blog it's as simple as that combo ships has an alternative for distance and using just one line of code anybody can replace their discus widget with conver this opens up a wide avenue for integrations conversations in convo help reduce interaction and conversation cost and becomes a substrate that connects conversations across the internet independent of the interface and always owned by the users thank you wow um that was really cool and uh i didn't realize you i ended up deploying that to production um that's that's amazing um yeah this is i don't know what else is this is super cool i like the i like how much thought you put into the design here and how pretty everything looks this is great uh congrats on doing all that 24 hours or 48 hours um thank you hopefully you can get some sleep now um so congrats um and uh we'll uh for any questions that come in we'll uh we'll follow them up uh with uh all the teams and ask them on discord directly um but next up i wanna move on to our our seventh project uh today and that is dbs decentralized broadcast and stream so um adrian now puts yeah adrian vinay and team whenever you are ready you can share your demo so this is our platform we just tried to create a decentralized streaming platform where the creators can stream their content directly to our decentralized platform over the blockchain here we are fetching all the trending tracks from audience the streamer can fetch play all the track directly here he will see a beautiful visualizer on the page it is dynamically generated if he wants to stream this screen he'll choose connect server once the server is connected successfully he will see a green button stating start stream once i click the star stream button the user will be shown up the number of screen he is currently connected to he'll just choose share audio and the screen which he wants to share so i want to share my screen this screen one boom so i'm live now i'm live over the live peer network over the decentralized live peer network everything is currently being streamed in 1920 by 1080p 60 fps everything over the blockchain so if my subscribers want to view my stream they can just go to the page on text style there they will be presented with an on unlock demo which is the unlock stream it is protected by the unlocked protocol the user can just click on the unlock button connect their meter mask wallet the amount of two venus tokens once the transaction goes through the gas piece yeah so here is the stream which is currently being streamed by me it is everything being stream over the blockchain i can demonstrate the same on the localhost i'll show it once i'll make a payment of two venus so here is the live stream which i was streaming this can be a great way of streaming the content over the blockchain where services like youtube or twitch can't penetrate into and so that's it for our demonstration thank you guys thank you so much that was uh super cool i was also super meta because we're streaming this on life like pier and then you're appearing two more levels deep this is great now yeah we finally have we finally have live streams that are unstoppable and transcoded yeah totally transported in cpu that is wonderful um this was this is really cool and not only that you can do thanks a lot well hopefully we get to see this as an interface as a self-serve service and that we all can use and i'm also super excited to see that you were able to demo all this thing in a single shot on localhost live yeah we've got anything going wrong so that's that's even it's even better yeah yeah definitely yeah welcome [Music] ready to move on to our eighth team for today and that is our fault so i hope we have colin thomas here and whenever you're ready feel free to demo your project in case uh you're talking you are on mute if there's no video or we're not getting the audio so you may have to quickly uh quickly we share hey guys over the past two days we've been building vaults dot art we're seeing web3 app that provides um colby we got the the wrong screen here so you may want to try that one more time and we didn't get the window that you wanted to share hey guys over the past two days we've been building vaults.art a web3 app that provides decentralized storage for exclusive nft content using the application is super simple as a user you first connect your ethereum wallet using metamask for example from there you can upload the files that you want to bundle as an nft and your files are then bundled and stored in a secure storage vault this vault can then be sold as an nft and you can whitelist specific ethereum addresses that can preview the vault for example if a potential buyer wants to take a peek at what is available in the nft we offer a number of improvements relative to the standard user experience for nfts at the moment exclusive nft content like higher resolution files are usually stored using centralized services like google drive and this usually requires the original nft creator to maintain that file and if they stop paying for their subscription accidentally delete or modify the file or the centralized service goes down the file is no longer accessible and can be lost forever on top of that nfts are only linked to a single file and they can't be an entire series of artworks or files what vaults.art does is that it stores nfts immutably on filecoin storage meaning that the files can't be modified and there's no risk of downtime the storage that holds these files can be transferred in ownership from the seller to the buyer meaning that the owner of the nft at any given time is the sole person responsible for paying for that storage and on top of that you can bundle more complex collections of files as an nft so how does all of this work behind the scenes so when you connect your ethereum wallet to our react front end using metamask your ethereum username is automatically loaded from the ethereum naming service to prepare a vault the react app makes a http request to a mile node which is a type of hot storage nerd we've developed which uses ipfs and ipld to store the files associated with the nft such that the bundle of files gets a unique cid and when you're ready you can mint this unique cid as an nft long-term storage of the nft files is paid for by the way of wrapped fill which is then unwrapped to pay a file coin storage miner via a mile node when creating a share link for the vault this link is authenticated for a specific ethereum address and anyone who has the key to that address can open the vault so i'm going to show you all of this in action so i just connect my wallet using metamask and my username from ens is immediately loaded to create a vault all i need to do is upload a few files and it's as simple as dragging and dropping a few files once i'm ready to create the vault i just click submit and i can select one of the files as a preview image for the vault once i'm ready i can mint an nft from this vault i just need to pay a standard network fee and a fee to pay for the storage of the files in the vault and once the files are stored on filecoin and i've minted in nft i can share the vault with other ethereum addresses and i can quickly manage who has access to this vault if someone else shares a link with me i just copy paste this link they've sent in the browser i connect my wallet and if my address is the one they shared the vault with i can view this vault that was really great thomas um just want to make sure that i we didn't get interrupted it was you're actually fully finished yep all good thanks um wow and and is this sorry would you mind clarifying if this is a live on on maintenance or is it still intestines with the rap it's currently accessible um it's on storage on platform live but uh the uh nft part is uh on testnet got it this is this is really cool just being able to do that and also do that directly through uh through metamask is going to be a game changer congrats thanks next up we have youtube nft drop so alex whenever you're ready hey thank you for having us i'm going to start showing my screen and there we go this team youtube nft drop and we're applying for the protocol labs as well as the graph prices the thing we built is a tool that as a youtube channel creator allows you to quickly create nfts and reward them to your subscribers rewarding them if they're early and as a subscriber it allows to connect collect these nfts and flex to show how early you were i'm alex the entrepreneur i worked with dylan i worked on the ui in the in the integration with the youtube api as well as the backend and the subgraph while dylan work also in the ui as well as the smart contract and the sub graph the way the tool works is that you can log in with youtube or off and we use magic link which also issues ethereum address the second you log in with youtube you can then create a drop which will be attached to your youtube channel and you can specify a subscription deadline so that you can reword subscriber based on how early they subscribe you can then upload an image that will be uploaded to ipfs and that will be the image that will be used for the nft you'll then get a link that allows your subscribers to redeem the drop uh in order to redeem it as a subscriber you're gonna log in uh with youtube again and we're gonna verify that your subscription actually was there and now we're gonna issue the nft that will be sent to the address that is associated with that youtube account a demo i'll show you you can also check it out that youtube drop dot xyz white is dropped or xyz i'm gonna go here you can see that we have a way to show all of the previous drops which are tracked through the sub graph and uh in order to create a new one i can go here on create i'm gonna have to log in as a creator i have an account called alex the entrepreneur so i'm gonna log in with that and the off will give us a string that allows us to verify the ownership of the account and allow us to basically fetch that account metadata i can then set the subscription deadline to tomorrow and then upload an image that is uh let's say related to the project i made called my yield a project that i uh submitted and now uh the image will be uploaded via pinata to ipfs and now i have a link that allows other uh accounts to redeem it i'm gonna uh for the purpose of showing you i'm gonna go in the redding page and i'm gonna log in with my um let's say known professional account which is called alex squash and uh i'm gonna then um try to claim the uh drop in the nft you see here i just have to log in and then i'm gonna click a button down here with verify subscription which will allow to verify the subscription for this account that tv takes a few seconds and then i can also flex and show it on twitter i also will have my collection here a page that shows unfortunately we get 429 by the uh gateway that's uh it can happen sometimes but that said uh we can track uh the collections and i can even given my address we also have a page called collections that will allow to flex on the uh and show and share the uh the collection around so that you can um show it to others and that's done through the sub graph so in terms of how this is done we have a monorepo we've hard at uh uh basically there's three packages one color that which allows us to write the smart contract and unit test it then we have an xjs for the front end and then we have subref to track drops and claims there's also a back end to us to store the new drops with their condition to whether to mint or not as well as minting the actual nft uh we use ipfs uh in such a way that when we mint the nft we attach the token uri to it and that's why we also use pinata to upload images as for the graph we use that to track drops and claims which allows us to have a page that shows all the stats on which drops were claimed as well as a leaderboard and a collections page in terms of further improvement i if you have more time and more days honestly we would have used chain link for oauth verification we would have added metamask integration and ideally also allow further improvement of the nft creation you can go and check it out at ytdrop.xyz thank you for your time and i want to emphasize that now it actually does work so you can actually show your collections and they do show properly we fix that all experienced our 421 429 errors every now and then okay oh this is super cool another amazing project that's live and not only that i think you've now given us a bunch of cool ideas for for each global.tv to do nfd drops live so this is this is going to be fun it's live if you guys want to try it out the servers are there so you can check it out right now congrats again alex and dylan thank you so much for doing this and uh with this we have three more projects to demo and then we'll get into some of the prizes so next up we have nft factory factory and uh in chicken team whenever you're ready feel free to share oh i think i may have misspoke uh the next project is open science data wallet i i was off by one um so can you continue whenever you're ready hi hi that's us hi i'm kinship um yeah we're gonna share our screen now um okay hi i'm sarah and i'm introducing you to our web free weekend project our team are part of an open science style called accenture we're a mix of web3 engineers and neuroscientists what we're focusing on is neuroscience data so these are large important data sets often collected over many years from hundreds of participants it's not an exaggeration to say that this is some of the most valuable data that exists in humanity today but cutting this data is siloed in centralized databases such as universities and hospitals all over the world and in some cases on people's hard drives participants don't retain ownership over their data and revoking consent is difficult and full of friction scientists are also not incentivized to share their data with their peers nor are participants incentivized to take part in studies in the first place absentia's vision is to use web3 tools to make it easy for scientists to securely share their neuroscience data with their peers and to be rewarded for doing so also to reward citizens for taking part in studies and sharing their data in this way and to ensure that citizens retain ownership over this personal data whilst easily changing permissions now we can't build all that in one weekend so what we've decided to focus on is a secure peer-to-peer sharing of neuroscience data on web3 let's take a look at what we've uh hi welcome to our open science forum as you can see i'm going to need to log in via my metamask so let me just do that okay so now now um the application is fetching my bucket keys so what this means is it's just going to go into the back end in textile.io and fetch all my data we're now logged in so now i can drag and drop or select um by clicking so i'm going to click and select this i'm going to give it a title um and the tags are logo um center i'm going to submit that and by submitting this i'm going to send this data to textile.io to get posted on ifgs ah and because i've contributed to data this month i get power um which is thanking me for contributing to open science this month um as you can see i've already cleaned mine um and this is a bit like scientific kudos cool so now it's pushing the file to the bucket for the purposes of this demo we are actually using dummy data due to some issues with connecting to text on our io at the front end but the data is there as you can see we have the title of the bids data the authors and the tagging and also the ability to download the data we also have public data so this is data that's um being made public to everyone and you don't actually need to log in to access this data overall the aim of this project is to go further to also host it on ocean protocol and um make the data the ability to permission the data to different users um this has been a really interesting experience for me and all the other people in the open science world team and we can't wait to continue building this for um the purposes of opening science up to everyone cool i said on a short show awesome okay done that was great uh well congratulations on on doing this especially over the weekend and uh this is this is awesome this is something we absolutely need in this space um well maybe one question we'll ask is that did you all know each other before the hackathon or how did that project or the idea come about um we did know each other briefly um we're doing cardinal block three together um well i hope that you continue building this uh and uh launch this out and uh can't wait to have others publish some data sets here thank you thank you thank you so much congrats again next up with two more projects to go next up we have the ultrasound music project and uh let's see cameron yeah hey there i'll just uh share my screen and start a video sounds perfect [Music] this camera and i'm part of the ultrasound music project my teammates gabriel and vijay are getting some well-needed rest after being up all night and yeah let me let me present you our project so our uh our project name is the ultrasound music project and we we like to say that we're uh the music for the ultrasound music revolution um what we're trying to work on is that the current current music industry um music is made by musicians we're generating music uh with the blockchain and and the kind of uh debris emitted from the blockchain um currently anyone can make music this fly is infinite we're creating verifiably scarce music currently if you have a track it plays the same thing over and over again our tracks are actually nfts that play something new every time with a proper player and our music is composable all right so um how does this work uh we have a we create an app where users can create artists there are only ever 80 artists um each artist has a unique sound artist can join bands um bands require four members to join them before they can create tracks and after uh each member of the band has created a track the band is burnt and gone forever forced into retirement how did we build this the backbone of the system was built with an erc 1155 multi-token contract from there we kind of manage the relationship between an artist token um a band token and a track token uh the token metadata is stored on ipfs via fleeq and then in the react client we allow users to obviously create all these token types and play play the music that they generate alright so how does this all work um i'll show you so let's go to the app all right here we are um we have uh you can you can come here and create an artist uh as you can see we already have three artists on the platform vitalik the rock star uh kane the synthman playing the synths to keep keep you through the help you get through the crypto winter and sound money jay drake who's been creating the sound money anthems since forever so we're gonna go ahead and create an artist first we can hear what the artist sounds like so let's try that yeah sounds great i want to mint that that artist so i'm cameron the jam man trying to be cool as the rest of the band all right let's see if create an artist should work okay here we go so now my artist was minted and i can join vitalik's unicorn band great join the band and now i can publish a track to vitalik's unicorn band so let's do that okay one last transaction here and there we go here's our first anthem let's play it now you can see there's a composition of all four uh band members it sounds great it's the anthem of the sound money revolution stop that and just real quick we have some the learnings and what's next for us uh the erc 1155 contract that was the first time we worked with the standard um it's pretty hard to distinguish between nft types there so we think that that could improve we'll take a look at that um two of the engineers on the team went from being complete ethereum noobs to pros within 48 hours um and what we'd like to do next we like to be able to stream a platform erc20 token to holders of artists band and track tokens um and then we'd like to spec out uh ways that other other players can consume our nfts and play the sounds anyway thanks for your time this has been an amazing weekend thanks for all the organization i hope you enjoyed the project that was so cool um wow uh and even more impressive uh when you pointed out that uh you uh did not know much about solidity two days ago um this is so great i think generative music is so awesome and uh i can't wait for you to uh to take this to uh just a different compositions from just here and you can innovate so many cool things i would uh maybe play with the the mempool and see if we can get a constant beat going um this is super cool well uh cameron and team thank you so much for uh for demoing um the ultrasound music project and uh with that i am super happy to announce that our last team of today and the weekend is nft factory factory so let's uh get ken to share what they built hey everybody i'm to turn it over to morgan cool i'm morgan uh my teammate ken and i built the nft factory factory here over the last couple days it is a proof-of-work nft vending machine factory so it is a tool to allow artists to create their own nft minting contracts where it's not limited to just a single image they upload it goes through a generative process where they can upload several different layers of assets as i'll do here with some of the sample assets i've made and those i'll get posted up to ipfs as part of a bundle that we're calling the genome data so the genome data is defined by the artist and it includes um all of the image layers that they uh that they provided as well as any other uh settings that they want for their minting contract as far as the cost to purchase nfts um if they want incremental pricing and if they want to share a commission with the uh with the factory factory that's up to them so here i've posted all of those assets up to ipfs and i can take a look and see that we've got the immutable asset blob right there with its cid that we can reference so from there we can see what kinds of products we can produce with all of that uh genetic data so different dna fed through the genome will produce different artistic results here we can just get a preview of the types of results that a user might get and if it looks good the artist goes ahead and deploys the nft mentor got the decimals a little weird on my test net so that's why the contract looks so expensive but once that's deployed it will become available for any user who wants to come along and mine for those nfts so we're using a proof-of-work algorithm that runs in the web browser in javascript and it's going to discover seeds unique seeds that are specific to the user and each seed will produce a particular a single dna that co that fed through the genome will then produce an nft so you give it a little bit of time and it'll start finding more and more seeds let's see speed it up just a little bit for demo purposes see if that'll work but at any rate so in the background it's running through its algorithm and discovering these seeds and each seed can be fed into the minting contract and those will give the user an opportunity to purchase the individual nft it'll not get minted until they actually purchase it i'm not sure why it's not pumping them out a little bit faster but there we go there we go so you can see some of the possibilities and basically the longer you spend the more likely you are to find some unique or rare combinations and you can pick which one you actually want to mint on chain to make it uh permanent these ones are just ephemeral until you actually met them on chain but once they're minted on chain you can view them in the token viewer and here's one of my favorites um and there we go this is about how far we got in the two-day period we're really close to being ready to launch it on mainnet not quite there but if you keep an eye on our github repository um we'll hopefully have that pretty soon um yeah thank you very much thank you morgan this was a really nice um yeah just being able to do this generative claims later on is just it's just an awesome game that you can keep playing in i feel like the permutations or combinations are so so many that i don't think you'll ever get bored so i hope there's a factory factory factory generator that lets you get get all the more made up yes all the way down this is great well congrats again and uh for everybody watching this was our 12th demo for for the the weekend and i want to congratulate all 12 teams for uh showcasing what they did uh and also doing it live and also on a super short notice and also on uh not a lot of sleep so um i'm just checking all the comments everybody's super impressed with all the things that we've seen in just the last hour and that's just 10 of everything so um for everybody else who's interested in seeing whatever what other projects are i came out of this weekend please head over to showcase.global.com and you get to see the full list of projects from web3 weekend as well as all of our previous events so enough of me talking i want to quickly invite a few others to the stage um so we've saw we've seen 12 teams here and we've talked about what they built and we saw some of those amazing demos next up i want to talk about a little bit on the prices especially the prices some of our sponsors are giving out and uh we'll cover that and we'll kick it off uh first by bringing on protocol lab so we have dietrich from protocol labs and he's going to just quickly comment on how the experience was for protocol labs here and anything else you'd like to add thanks kartik uh thanks to the whole team at global it's been a fantastic weekend talked to a whole bunch of people building uh in both in the channels over the weekend and also to a whole bunch of folks who presented today uh fix all the projects that joined for the weekend uh this was a really cool event because the idea was to bring folks who might be new to the space and it seems like the numbers really proved that that that worked out and uh you know hundreds of people joining to learn and build is really exciting for us to see and also super gratifying we're really appreciative of all of you that used ipfs and filecoin and the technologies that that we're building working so hard to build uh it's really gratifying to see how you all are putting those technologies to use to build amazing things that couldn't be built otherwise in the in the web 2 world it's very very inspiring to see the types of challenges that you're all accepting uh i really wanted to thank also a number of people both from protocol labs and the our you know close collaborators that came and spoke and did workshops uh one of the side effects of these types of events is there's a whole bunch of material for people who are coming and following in your footsteps to try to build and learn so thanks to everybody that put in the time for that we uh did kick in uh 20 thousand dollars worth of file coin evenly divided in prize pool between all of you that chose to use ipfs and filecoin technologies in your projects so thank you very much for doing that uh you've probably heard about some of the other programs that we have uh throughout throughout the event um so both in the opening ceremony and then uh you know from some of the speakers as well happy to answer any questions uh about any of those programs and also the technologies in our sponsor channel so feel free to join there and keep the conversation going and we're here to keep helping you build cool and amazing things thank you so much for everybody that showed up and everybody that spent so much time coding talking judging speaking super exciting thanks thanks dietrich and i also want to just say while you're at it i want to thank you and the rest of the protocol last team for being available and doing honestly uh 48 hour coverage of helping unblock everybody who is trying to understand how you can use ipfs or falcon in their projects and you've been an incredible partner to work with so you definitely want to make sure that we we recognize all the work and effort you put in this weekend to getting hundreds of people uh where they are today so um as dietrich talked about [Music] protocol labs will be splitting the price evenly with every team that participated and used ipfs or falcoin and there are 67 projects that are going to win this price so we'll be in touch with every person who is on those teams and uh we'll get you started with how do we split this and the process we're collecting all the information we need to receive the prize so congrats to all 67 teams here um we'll be giving away and even split up twenty thousand dollars in fall coin next up we have life here and i'll let eric from live pier talk about who won their prizes all right thank you card tech um and and thank you for all the participants and hackers who have uh presented uh and especially thank you for everybody who used the live pure um the life api to to build your uh hacks so we've selected three uh uh like three um you know the top three hacks uh the first one is content stream uh so um for the uh for the amount of two thousand dollars um i think content contest stream was a great um example of uh kind of an end-to-end application that allows anybody to create an nft uh from from a previous live stream and be able to kind of commemorate that uh it's really it's a really powerful tool uh because a lot of these live streams kind of have these magical moments uh that then you can um and combining um decentralized live streaming with uh nft minting uh you can kind of create this really cool ecosystem and economy around around live streaming so congratulations to chris um the second uh the second place winner is live streaming nft minting this is another team of five people uh working on working on this project is fifteen hundred dollars um will split amongst them um the this this is another project that um that that allows allows people to kind of mint nfts through their live streams uh i think the uh i what i really appreciate about this project is that they actually dug in to the open source part of of life here and and actually hacked down the live peer node um and and they were able to kind of get the video segments and they were they created uh the nft minting um you know come in in combination with ipfs uh so that's all really cool um the third place we actually picked two projects uh because they were equally amazing then it was hard it was hard to for us to just pick one um so those two projects are decentralized broadcast stream uh which i think we saw a little bit earlier during the finalized presentation this is a really great example of kind of combining music and live streaming uh to create this decentralized um decentralized live streaming platform that allows creatives to kind of stream music sets i can see just a whole lot of interesting uh features that they can continue to build on top of that to make it a truly unique uh platform that you know that doesn't exist in the in the web 2 world and the other project that we picked is huddle huddle01 so i've i've known this team for a little while now because they have pretty kind of worked on their um education component of that project but it's so great to see that over the weekend they're adding kind of a live streaming component and i think this really represents um a lot of interesting opportunities especially just for the education market in general when people can come together form a kind of a classroom lecture style experience but also allow that lecture to be broadcasted to a much brighter audience so this is uh imagine you know all of the universities are able to kind of have a classroom experience but also uh broadcasting the lack of the lectures um really really cool uh concept and so for each of those projects uh it's going to be a 750 um price i'm gonna kick it back to you karthik amazing thank you so much eric and um in case uh you didn't catch all the team names i'll repeat them for you uh content stream won the first place uh two thousand dollars that live stream nft minting um it takes a second for 1500 usd and then the third place is going to have two winners which is dbs and huddle zero one both of you get 750 each um so it was awesome to see so many people work on live streaming uh decentralized live streaming and uh and i'm still super impressed with how we're doing this thing live through live here and this is still just the most awesome thing from this weekend for me so thanks again eric and then we have a few more prizes and i'll i'll just announce all the team names that are going to be uh there we go i okay so next up we have textiles so the the teams that have won the textile prizes are open signs data wallet uh convo space and ethunes so um the first two teams get 1500 each from textile and eight two millions get a thousand dollars then we have unlock so we have block food that is going to win five udt tokens we have content stream with three udt tokens as their prize and we also have cross chain wallet dashboard that are going to be receiving three udt tokens as part of their prize next up we have ens so we have open pid sock explorer by pentacle combo space one moment canva nft mentor as dns recipients for best use of integrations for ens and all of you are going to be winning 150 dollars in each then we have ocean protocol and the winners of ocean protocols are me meta with 2500 as your prize convo space with 1500 usdc and ocean cli with a thousand dollars in usdc tokens then we have the graph and then we also have my computer's lag the two winners for the graph um prices are eight tunes with a thousand die and cross chain wallet dashboard also receiving a thousand died and then chain link so we have the archive that's one thousand dollars perpetuals platform pro that has one thousand dollars and then we have booster and crypto emblems that have also won a thousand dollars from chain link and i believe last we have poe app and one moment has is going to receive 3000 usdc as the best integrations of the lab tokens so those are our prizes and before we end this uh and wrap it up i want to say a quick few thank yous to everybody that made this event possible and for those of you who are wondering what happens next if you won one of those prizes from our sponsors we will be putting you in touch over email in the next couple of days so just stay tuned we'll put this on discord as well for everybody but if you're one of these teams you will be put in touch and we'll get you started on all the information we need to send you your prizes so in terms of wrapping this up i'll i'll try to say everything super quickly so everybody can relax and sleep i want to thank so many people that made this event possible first we have our judges and our mentors all these people were here not only just today from talking to 90 different projects but also throughout the week and helping them helping a lot of our attendees on slack or sorry on discord um really answering questions and supporting them with all the technical help that they needed then we have so many speakers who uh not only did workshops and in tech talks throughout the weekend but also uh for our summit there there are so many interesting perspectives we saw throughout uh the past three days and i want to thank everybody who made it possible with with their time and also want to thank everybody from the sponsor side who was there to help address all the questions that all the attendees had about anywhere from simple things that they want to do or understand what they should do or really brainstorm what ideas they could work on and use some of the protocols that are out there to make their lives easier so many people make this possible to to see all these cool hacks that we saw uh just an hour ago but also the 90 plus projects that are going to be um that they came out of this hackathon so thank you so much to all of our sponsors and without your time we would not have the event that we uh we're hosting right now there's it takes so many people to get all this in in momentum and keep the momentum going and we need the help that we get from everybody here is just phenomenal i want to thank everybody for that and we also have our support staff you saw a lot of our our volunteers and staff on the the judging panel and they made sure that everything is help running on smoothly and on track because we do so much of this in parallel without the help from everybody on this on this page uh we would not have the ability to run this event as smoothly as we do and lastly i want to give a quick shout out to the members on the youth global team we have shangen who just joined us on the support side and you saw him running all around on discord helping address all the questions whether it's on the chat or or any questions that you had as tech mentors or sponsors and also i think all the work that luke's done on the team from the marketing side we've uh we've done a really great job in promoting everything from talks to the attendee uh projects to all the the summit talks related content and also what's happening with with this live stream and all this requires including all the emails and communications from from our prizes to to our sponsors to what's happening this entire weekend um so thank you luke for uh for being part of the team i also want to thank catherine who's managed all of our relationships with our sponsors and making sure that everything is in line with uh not only the sponsors connecting with all of you but also us knowing how the experiences and how we can improve this uh this whole event to really align all of our incentives to offer the best outcomes for everybody involved i want to thank emily who has been incredible at making sure that everybody whether it's the teams from having problems on discord to questions that we want to address for for everybody having difficulty in what to do for this event just the logistics and the support that emily provides for all of our community is absolutely incredible and i want to thank her and make sure that we recognize that next we have andrew everything you're seeing on this this live stream uh and how we did judging to how we do all of our our online transition uh is because of andrew and keeping that intact is is kind of what made us be seamlessly transitioning to an online and offline world as of last year and thank you andrew for making all that possible then we have jacob jacob is our head of partnerships uh everything we design is designed for an experience where all the hackers uh really get to meet super interesting projects and protocols and they get to learn and experiment what's actually happening at the cutting edge of web3 and uh and jacob and catherine work together to make that possible for everybody and and uh that's kind of what keeps all the global events up and up and going and we get to play with some interesting themes like nfts and d5 and scaling and this is because of all because of jacob the next up we have heather everything that we plan and we do is all managed and run and dictated by heather the whole plan for how each global organizes all of our events and everything that we have to do up to leading up to the event is because of all the work and and effort and time that heather puts in and making sure that we have to plan that we plan everything in order um is uh is because of her so thank you heather for making sure that we ran another successful event and lastly i want to thank liam um who manages all of our our tech and platforms so everything from our dashboard to a lot of our interfaces here whether it's the auth to the staking to uh how you do judging and submissions all that is through all the work that liam's put in and it's a small team that gets all this done so thank you so much to the global team for really putting in a really long 24-hour shift for the last two days and making this event super successful so thank everybody here and we saw 12 teams show up um and and uh i'm really going to stop talking in a few minutes but um we had 12 teams come up and and we called them finalists and we say that because um that's the best word we have for how we think about all the teams and all the participants at this at this hackathon the event is designed to really bring in more people to experiment with what's possible so we don't really try to encourage people to make this as super competitive or really give them a motive to do something beyond just do something that they enjoy and work on something that they think is interesting and cool and uh this gets us the ability to highlight some super cool and interesting projects but uh we don't design this thing as a competition so as part of a neat global event in the spirit of keeping everything the way we've done um each of the finalists are our winners we don't have first second and third uh places for our teams so every member that presented today um on this ch on this live stream will receive 500 die and i want to congratulate every single person who uh who not only took the time this weekend but also stayed up in different time zones and hot hours to really not only build what they were super passionate about but also uh showcasing it to all of us here and hundreds of you that are watching this on on the live stream so congratulations to every single person on those 12 teams we'll be giving you 500 dive each and we'll be in touch with you um about the delivery of this along with the sponsor prices in the next day or two and lastly before i close i want to just quickly remind everybody that if you are interested in working on your project uh especially if you are one of those 67 teams that are using ipfs or filecoin or any decentralized storage um as a as a feature or a premise in your hack uh you have the the ability to apply for a grant from protocol labs where you can get anywhere from 5 000 to 30 thousand dollars to continue building your project and really take that to the next level so it's an open process you can head over to the github url below and you have two deadlines to apply for whether it's june 1st which is in the next day or two and then june 15 two weeks from now you can apply for these grants and really get non-diluted funding to continue building uh what you're interested in without any other motives relating your motives so uh take a look at the micro grants from protocol labs and uh hope that you continue building things after tonight so that concludes our our weekend uh web3 weekend is officially over and uh just like every other global event we would love to tell you what's up and coming in next for us so i'm super proud to announce that our next hackathon is going to be hack money which is a d5 focused event that we're going to be starting in about two and a half weeks so if you're interested in building something and playing with what's possible with t5 uh be sure to check out hack money uh we're going to share a lot more details on how we're making this uh super interesting and unique compared to our previous events so uh head over to d5.eglobal.com and uh and hope to see all of you at our next hackathon so with that i want to say good evening and uh good morning and good night to all of you and i hope you have a great rest of your weekend thanks everybody bye-bye enjoy some low-fi beats you
