foreign [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of each Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to hack Fest 2023 let's get started all of you are watching this on eat global.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is what we'll be using for the rest of this event to talk about all the things that we're doing whether it's the kickoff the closing to do all the Demos in all of our summits in case you don't know what if Global is or an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to get thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and Summits both in person and online and hack FS is no different this is going to be our third one for from in the past few years and today in this time around we also have a summit that we'll be doing immediately after we cover Logistics the summit will take place today let's kind of talk about all the interesting things that are happening in the protocol Network and before we get to all of the summit stuff I want to cover all the things that you need to know for the hackathon so let's get right into it sweet this is already shipping up to be a massive event we have over 700 hackers who are coming in from 72 different countries spraying 23 different time zones there's going to be so many creative ideas that are going to be built over the next few weeks and kind of looking at what people are coming from it still impresses me every time to see all the countries and six different continents being represented in where developers are excited to build on top of ethereum protocol lab networks of all coin and ipfs and all things in between that help make us a better decentralized future on top of all the hackers we also have 29 ecosystem partners and 12 dedicate mentors who are going to be here with us throughout the event to really offer you the best experience in helping your project go from start to finish and to top it all off we're going to be giving away a hundred fifty thousand dollars in prizes and and I cover all the specifics on what these prizes are how you can win them and all the things that you need to know about the best way to go that participating at this event so the most common question we've gone from everybody is what can I build here uh this is a very open-ended event which means that you're not solving a particular problem our goal is to help you build anything that you're excited about as long as you are using interesting and new web 3 Technologies and some of the ideas that you want to bring up is that there's so much you can do with decentralized compute especially with the Falcon Virtual Machine there's a lot of room to experiment with data dials and different ways to manage stories and storage derivatives of course the second you have decentralized storage you can do so much more with nfts whether it's in the art or music side or anything else in the social category and because all this ecosystem is still currently growing there is even more opportunity in making better developer experiences better tools and utilities so the next thousand people can do anything that you wanted to do even faster because they have better abstractions to make their lives a lot easier this is just a very high level overview there's a lot more we have covered today especially in our Summits we're going to talk about what you actually can build in terms of bigger opportunities there's a lot of things you can do with just talk to our mentors and get more ideas we also are working on a list of potential brainstorming ideas for the hackathon if you are still looking for an idea to uh to go off of and experiment and kind of tweak around and make a URL and I also want to give a special shout out to some of our amazing Partners there's so many different protocols and companies in this space that are here excited to support this event you can also get some inspiration for ideas or how you can not reinvent the Wheel by using some of these amazing Protocols of course we have filecoin we also have eight coin lit P2P acalao ceramic Lighthouse tableland poly base live pure Auto one Barracks push protocol ens nfts storage spiron and lit protocol dran dataverse OS Vision Mona chainsafe ipfs altcoin data tools consensus lab Saturn secured Finance scrap paper Capital live ranchers and Falcon foundation so on top of all the other ideas you have so much you can do in terms of leveraging anywhere from decentra is a real-time live streaming to push notifications to anything else in between to help make your creative ideas come to reality you check out all these companies and protocols and learn about what they do and how you can simplify a lot of these things and they're also giving away a lot of prizes I'm going to cover how you can win specific prizes for different protocols by using their sdks so let's talk about what the next three weeks look like my goal here is to cover a handful of logistical things that you all need to know and especially kind of how a judging works and then we're going to go into all the prizes and then end off by kicking the summit off with all the things that are happening in the protocol Labs Network so I want to cover how team formation Works how you can get help all the prizes of course all the talks and workshops and judging so let's go into the first thing which is communication the most important thing to note here is that everything is happening over Discord for this event which means that only hackers who have rsvp'd will be able to see these channels you'll see a hack FS 2020 degree header on your left sidebar on Discord which will show all of these amazing channels to you you can get that confirmed by also going to your dashboard on youthgold.com and clicking on sync with Discord to see all the right permissions you need to get to see all these things these are all the activities are happening for this event this is also where our mentors and our partners are hanging out you can ask direct questions to different protocols and ask any questions that you have on the technical side or non-technical side and a mentor will be there to help address these requests okay on top of all of that we are also going to be sending calendar invites for all the talks and workshops that are happening that spans today in the next couple weeks including all feedback sessions and some of these things will be repeated multiple times to account for different time zones we really want this thing to be asynchronous and as part of that everything is going to be recorded and everything is also published on the website which means that anything you see on the website is the source of Truth and that is going to be the record of kind of primary way of us getting track of everything that's happening if something changes they'll be first reflected on the website and that is how we're going to be communicating everything and all the invites or anything else we'll update and nothing should change but in case it happens you know that the website is the only place where you need to look one is a website I will you can go to hackfs.com and see everything about this event there and they'll also let you in to your dashboard directly from that same page where you can see your internal progress your own projects so how does the hackathon actually work effectively you can start working on your projects now you can work on a project with up to a five-member team you can also work on them individually and you have the next two and a half weeks to to hack and work on your projects submissions are due on the 18th of June just Sunday at 12 pm Eastern which is noon and we're going to talk about what this means and all the things that you need to be mindful of as you approach June 18th so the rules and criteria of this event are fairly straightforward everything that you are doing must be done from scratch which means that you cannot extend or work on a previously started personal project you cannot add features to something you've already done before you cannot continue something from a previous Global hackathon if you are coming in again everything should be done from scratch to keep this fair for everybody else and all submissions must leverage ipfs or falcoin or any related technology which is in the evm ecosystem as part of your submission to qualify for any prizes this also means that if you win any prizes only RSVP hackers are eligible to win which means if your team members are not listed on your dashboard or if your team members did not RSVP then winning a prize will only entitle just the people that are listed at the time of submission to those prizes so please make sure that all of you web team members are listed and they show up on on their dashboards and everybody is confirmed and also has Discord access also another quick clarification there is that although all work must be done from scratch you can use boilerplate code which means anything like scaffold eat or react boilerplate all that is allowed you can use an existing open source project if you feel like you want to add something to a existing decentralized protocol and you want to use their open source code those things are allowed if something is already in the public domain as a well-known open source project you can use that you can use all the sdks in different bowler plates you don't have to do everything from scratch but you specifically cannot extend your own project or use your own project again for this hackathon and of course there could be some match cases that we haven't covered here because we want to keep this very quick so if you have any other questions or any other clarifications that you'd like to know please helping us whether it's on Discord or the youth Global TV chat or hello addictglobal.com on email we'll be happy to assist you with any of those cases now is the most important stuff which is judging this is a lot of stuff that you need to know about for judging submissions are due at 12 pm noon on Sunday June 18th and the next few days are the most important after that and I'm going to cover what what submitting means and what happens immediately after to submit your project you will have to make a four minute demo video of what you built this is a required video submission this helps us ensure that everything is concise everybody gets the same amount of time and you have the ability to focus on the key things that you want to do which you may not be able to do in a live demo video submissions are required and please uh trust me when I say this it will take you more than four minutes to record a four minute demo so don't prepare this last minute because a lot of things that you realize so you could have focused on you should have focused on or the time you want to spend on introduction versus the actual demo of what you built all these things will take some iteration and we really want you to get a head start on this so please get started on this as you near the deadline and set up the day of to some of your project it will take you at least one hour to submit your projects because we will require you to explain a lot of stuff around how you build things you have to reference code in your submission to tell us exactly how you're using what sdks and what apis and how everything else Works under the hood on the back end or the front end or everything Beyond just the basic information of your project including a few screenshots and of course this video demo so please bucket in enough time to be ready to submit your project and don't do this thing last minute all of this thing will be done through your dashboard and if early next week you'll be able to see what all these steps are as we open up submissions and this will let you see all the multiple steps and Fields that you need to think about and be ready for and we also have a lot of reference videos and demos and submissions from the past events that we really like for you to use as guidance for what it could submission and a good video looks like so you can draw inspiration from all of those previously done projects and make sure that you are ready to submit on the 18th after you submit you will have the option to go through the main judging process or just the partner price strategy process now what does this mean this means that you can only submit to your work and qualify for some of our partner sponsor prizes or if you want to be eligible for the top 10 teams you get to click the main judging process if you click on the main judging process you are also automatically going to be eligible for partner price charging but if you select the partner prize judging only then you will not be able to go back and submit yourself for the main judging process if you are interested in just being reviewed by our partners and not the main judging or you want to apply for different prices in both of those scenarios that process will be judged in parallel by our partners they will not specifically be doing a one-on-one call with all of you we expect a few hundred projects here so all the partners will be looking at everything asynchronously and they will reach out to the teams and message you whether it's on email or Discord if they have questions about your video or your code all of that will remain asynchronous however on the main judging side this will be a synchronous process you'll be presenting to a main judging panel and they will be talking to you live you'll be showing where you built their live as well and there'll be questions there and that'll be a synchronous process where you will have to come on a zoom call now the part of price judging is a very obvious thing which is the submit your project the partners will get a notification and they will start looking at what you built and ask any questions if they have them let's focus on the main judging which is broken into two rounds so on Sunday when you submit your project some of our judges will be on watch to review every project that was submitted and they will watch and look at all their submissions for round one what round one is doing is going through every submission and evaluating the Prototype the quality of the project checking if it was indeed built or in the course of the hackathon which was born and verified the git history and we're going to look at what you built and is it creative interesting or art project if our judges like your project you will be then selected to move to round two and you'll be notified in the club hours within the 12 hours of submitting your project so that's midnight Eastern on Sunday and you'll be notified to go to round two and that's the day after where you will be selected to come on a zoom call so what does round two mean so round two lets you go and present what you built to our other panel judges in a live call where you will get seven minutes where four minutes of it is for your demo and three minutes for a q a from our judges in the projects that are going to qualify for round two will be the ones that will be selected to be potentially part of our top 10 teams that'll be our finalists for this hackathon the round two and then live judging takes place on Monday at noon which is exactly 24 hours after submissions are due and you'll be notified if you made it to round two within 12 hours of submitting your project and as I kind of mentioned already the partners will be reviewing your projects asynchronously based on all the things that you specify which also means that if you are trying to go for a prize from any of our partners you have to select it in your submission process on your dashboard because if you don't tell us that you want to go for this prize we have no way of knowing you to do our partners so don't forget to select I am looking to qualify for this prize on your submission process and then as soon as you select a protocol that protocol will be notified on their end to review what you built so make sure you keep all of that in mind and of course I'm looking at questions from the live stream uh this is going to be made available immediately after this video stops but you can also rewind so you can simply just go back in this video and review everything that I've said in the short description of all this thing for judging is that make the video good it's what shares the best story of what you built who you are why you care about that problem and you have four minutes to really tell us why everybody should be excited about what you built this will be the best thing you can do to qualify for round two on the main judging to win a prize or really kind of get people excited about the potential of what you're trying to build and what could be possible what create decentralized software and of course we recognize that there's a lot of you who are trying to understand what's possible here before and you are trying to learn what you can do here and it's totally okay if you are brand new this is your first time doing any what three hackathon there's a lot of stuff that we have planned for everybody here no matter what your skill level is whether it's a beginner or an expert so there's a lot of talks and panels and workshops especially today we're going to cover so many things from beginners to experts level ways of getting involved in this ecosystem which is this Summit there's so much more resources documentation on your info center which you can see as a tab on your hacker dashboard and on top of all the workshops and talks everything is recorded because we want to make sure this is an asynchronous event that is global so immediately after something ends it will be instantly available on our YouTube which is youtube.com Global and you can go watch rewind it and pause at any time at your own pace and really keep up with what's actually happening for any of these Technologies and of course everybody who gave a talk and workshop is on Discord so you can individually message any of our speakers here to ask any follow-up questions especially from any of the technical content that we cover and of course a lot of you are still looking for potentially an idea or a team you can go to this channel on Discord to reach out to others who are also in a similar position there's a lot of people who are looking for different team members there's a lot of people who are looking to join a team and they can contribute different skills you can do all of that directly on this channel and we'll also be posting another live call later today and some of them already have happened yesterday and today to uh brainstorm and get to meet other team members who are looking for different teams and all that is also happening on Discord so let's check out the hack 20 hack fs2023 chat Channel or say hi tell us who you are and let us know what you can how what you're excited to build and also we'd love to say hi and meet all of you from all different parts of the world and of course it's not required that you work on a team it just makes things a lot easier if you have a team so it is totally okay to hack solo and use this as a way to challenge yourself and learn something in the next over the next two to three weeks let's quickly talk about check-ins so checkings is something we'll be implementing for this hackathon which is a check-in is something that happens once a week it allows us to get the help give you the help you need to really make sure that you're not blocked on anything this will be a simple form that just appears on your hacker dashboard they just ask how are things going if you have an idea are you stuck somewhere or do you need help or did you need help but you didn't get any it helps us really prioritize and get you unblocked on anything that you are looking to get uh check-ins are going to be required for everybody here as a team so only one person on the team has to fill out that checking and they'll be couple of them over the next two weeks and all this thing is going to happen through your dashboard we're going to really want to make sure that you're getting the help you need especially as we do this thing for hundreds of people across so many different cities and countries and similarly there's also going to be two live feedback sessions for getting direct comments from the lower mentors potential judges and other partners of this community you can join these calls to get direct feedback that's live and get up and get ideas to kind of make what you're doing better by uh just showing up and telling everybody else about what you're building and and if there's anything that you can do to improve and before we go into prizes I also want to cover some of our code of conduct everything that we're going to cover is written on ecobo.com rules it has our privacy policy it has our policies on the events the rules anything around what it means to participate in any of our events whether it's in person or online but the short

is a good submission look like and how you can get started on any of these so there's a massive random for all these things for you but that is all of the logistics for the hackathon that you need to know and before we go on to the summit I want to just remind everybody to really pace yourself we really want this to be a fun and exciting experience for you the reason this event is a couple of weeks long is because we know it takes time to learn something that's happening that could change and have so much high potential so we really want you to take the time and really understand how things work before you jump right into building something and we don't want this name exhausting for you we've done everything we can to make this thing as asynchronous and easy to catch up and follow so you get a chance to really learn with everybody else and get all of your questions answered before you jump right into building anything so this is very much about experimentation and we want to make sure that you get a chance to better yourself and learn something super cool so with that I want to wish all of you happy hacking we'll see all of you on Discord and we are ready to kick off with our Summit for today so this is the Haka Fest 2023 Summit and what's on schedule today is as follows our first speaker is going to be Molly who's going to be talking about the pln ecosystem and all the things that are happening and you can build of course a big part of the next few weeks is going to be the Falcon Virtual Machine so you'll get a high level overview from Sarah on what is it how it works and what's coming on at VM then ADI and Matt are going to talk about all the other opportunities that you have for different tracks that are here for this event and all the things that you can do as the FM ecosystem evolves and because the FM has been around for a few months now uh we're gonna do a panel with Nikki Sean and Natalie and Kate to talk about how things have been over the past few months from people who are building products and leveraging tobacco first machine over uh what they're building for other companies then Reuben is going to talk about what the pln is and the Builder's tunnel we really want to also give you an opportunity for people to take their projects to the next level whether it's from hackathon or just anybody else interested in startups and James will be talking about the accelerator program after uh and what the plxor program is how you can get involved what it means to be part of that and all the things that you get from being in that Network and then Gabriel from GPC will come and share anywhere from experiences to advice on how accelerators can help really get your projects to where you want to be and take something from an idea to something that everybody uses on a day-to-day basis
