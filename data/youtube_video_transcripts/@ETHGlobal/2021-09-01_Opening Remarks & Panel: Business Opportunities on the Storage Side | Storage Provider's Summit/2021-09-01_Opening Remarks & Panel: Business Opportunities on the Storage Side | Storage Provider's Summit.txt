welcome everybody my name is kartik and i'm luke and we're going to be your mcs today for the storage providers summit we couldn't be happier to have all you with us in attendance today so we're watching all this at on equable.tv and for those of you who are joining us for the first time uh this is what we're going to be using for all of today's talks and we encourage all of you to log in and engage with all of our speakers you'll be able to ask any questions here and we'll be able to relate those questions directly to all of our talks uh for everybody who also logs in and engages we're also giving out a pull up nft token so be sure to say hi to us the speakers and the global team so this summit is part of hackfest and hackfest is a month-long event which is a hackathon and a few summits for the hackathon we have over 650 developers from 61 different countries spending 18 different time zones building the latest and the greatest on ipfs and falcoin and just whatever creative things that are possible now with web3 and also part of this hackathon we're doing two summits highlighting the incredible things happening in the protocol labs ecosystem last friday the sixth we did our builders day summit and today we're going to be focusing on storage providers and talking about that side of the ecosystem so let's get into what today is all about we have some amazing talks for the next few hours and we're super excited to share what we're going to cover we're going to kick the day off by talking about what the business opportunities are on the storage side and we're going to do a panel covering different different aspects of being a storage provider then we're going to have another panel about what does it mean to invest in 203 startups and what do investors think about when they are looking to build and fund companies then we'll have zx talk about what does it mean to bridge with falcoin and all the new things that are possible with that three then we'll have michelle cover how you can actually take advantage of the grants opportunities in the ipfsn falcon ecosystem and further along your projects uh in a non-dilutive way and lastly we'll have deep and gail and talk about fall coin plus uh they have some amazing announcements planned for for you today um and i can't wait for everybody to share the amazing things that they want so with that let's jump right into our very first talk uh this panel is designed to or just is titled business opportunities and storage site and we have charles stewart kevin and neo as our panelists and moderating this chat will be stefan and uh i'll let stefan and all of our panelists introduce themselves now so without further ado please welcome all of our panelists so i'll ask all of you to turn your videos on and we'll go right into our talk perfect thank you so much cardi uh before we start today first of all welcome i'm very excited to discuss a little bit more in detail of the business opportunities on the storage provider side i want to talk about like how i look at the falcon ecosystem two weeks ago um i had the opportunity to look at the sky with one of my friends who's an astronomer and you know when you live in a city like myself here in san francisco can be foggy it can be really hard because of light pollution to actually see the stars in the sky we were kind of wandering through the sky with this new telescope and uh we kind of landed on this really cool region called omega nebula and as i'm trying to explain to him what falcone is and what we do here every day day in day out and he's trying to explain to me all the different galaxies and the cool stuff that he's working on as an astronomer we kind of landed on omega nebulas being like that you know that place where we connected because if you look at this region it's one of the most brightest and massive star-forming regions uh closest to our galaxy that we that we are that we know of today and it creates all these new stars and so when it's looking at it and i was like hey what what is this called he's like well it's omega nebula it's a nursery of stars and i'm like wow that's exactly how i look at falcon right what we're doing here at hackafast what we're doing with the whole ecosystem is exactly this we're building new companies uh we're building new stars and you know i thought it was really cool uh and also we had a long conversation on how he should be storing all these images because actually this is a real image from that telescope here in my backyard uh two weeks ago how he should be storing it on falcon of course so that's uh the next conversation we'll have with his engineers so uh today what do we want to focus on as innovation happens across the universe within fall coin not just on the front side by creating new applications we also look at the storage provider side there's a lot of opportunity there the storage provider we have now more than 2 700 storage providers and growing every single day they thought it would be interesting to to bring a couple of providers to the table and have a a conversation around where innovation can happen there as well and so you know as you can look at this universe uh we'll talk a little bit more about infrastructure as a service onboarding of data uh data protection etc as we onboard more customers to our platform so uh let me uh welcome uh neo charles kevin and stuart uh to our panel session today and uh very happy to have you here so let's uh kick it off but a first question for uh neo um neo you're part of ipfs maine um you have a ton of falcon power uh you've been adding a lot of falcon power to the network um what's interesting to me is like you know you've kind of started in china but can you tell us a little bit more about how pfs maine has reinvented itself since the start of mainnet and where do you see opportunities for some of these newer startups yeah absolutely uh thank you so much stefan for the great introduction uh actually fun fact about myself when i was a little kid my dream job is to be in an astronaut flying spaceship among the stars and that's very beautiful galaxies you're sharing there yeah um so just about myself just a brief intro and neil g from ipfs main we are one of the sponsors of hack fs 2021 and we sponsored this same hackathon last year as well the reason we like so much about haccfs is that we find it's a really great place to find new business opportunities of cyberspace both ipfs maine and myself invested projects from the hacker fest last year and we're planning to do the same thing this year as well well as a storage provider we used to call it miner we started all the way from the beginning of five network and currently we are bearing over 300 petabyte capacity and looking to expand globally now we have over 90 of the capacity located in china and if you send from the client's point of view it's not very good practice to have such centralized storage even though they are distributed between different data centers but it's still within one continent well most storage clients focus on availability and durability so we built a full set of customized lotus seating algorithm optimization and storage solution to ensure that clients data is available when needed and protected against failures and errors but more importantly is that we start to shift our focus to support other regions like north america and europe and in spite of you know different crypto friendly or unfriendly policies i believe global expansion of fico storage providing service is inevitable in long term so we are happy and looking forward to working with local fico and storage provider groups in different continents with our expertise of bicoin storage providing services great thanks so that's fantastic to hear and i think you brought up a really good point is that it's a very strong community right um so you know multiple storage providers work together across multiple regions so when you design products or when you design solutions you have to keep that in mind because as you mentioned clients are looking at protecting their data across multiple regions multiple countries etc the other thing you mentioned which i want to comment to is that we call this the storage provider panel session because as you mentioned uh we prepared a proposal the community put a proposal together to rebrand the miners terminology to storage provider again to be closer to the end customer because that's really what all of you are doing which is providing a storage service and and then some cool next to the next i want to bring charles thank you so much ania charles the next question is for you um your company has been you know sort of evolved right from being a storage provider also to a solutions provider uh you know when you're working with enterprise companies you you kind of figured out that onboarding data you know is not always that easy so you found ways to innovate and help your customers to bring data on board faster can you give us an example of what challenges you have seen to deliver a good storage service and what applications have you built um please please educate us because you have some great stuff there yeah like uh first one is based in montreal canada we have well we were a storage provided before we provided about 10 nodes in north america for three different data for our clients so earlier this year we found that there are so many clients have big interest in frequent storage science with verified data frequent can provide almost free for all the clients they know this news and they feel excited about it but however that was barrier for them because those industrial customers during the time for example the big data processing or machine learning they have a large demand of data but however the existing structure was building on the centralized cloud platform like amazon google cloud what does they want is that they their engineers wanted to migrate to frequent efforts so which means that they need some framework tools or platform to help during migration giving example of a local ai company for the clinton standard a train site ai they're doing algorithm they have a huge amount of data labeling on their network company storage on the aws spends about thousands of dollars per month and for street but when they migrated to frypan the first question is that their data scientists have been getting used to using s3 as the framework so they upload download and then there are lots of dual development based on i3 now the question comes to us that if they cannot doing this migration easily with a turnkey solution for example one day we were being so afraid of doing that so what we do is that we're building the entire solution for them we're building the cache layer for them to upload to the to access and read the data access from the storage computing we're building the s3 compatible interface to us called the fs3 it is a gateway to make to migrate your existing data from aws to api-based then through the bracket backup to fractal network without much human direction but also building the aging environment for them to secure data in a caching environment during encryption before they upload with private networks with those they also provide them the api access because developers is getting used to api access is not like the normal under customers like they were using web interface so they want to have those kind of an awesome permission based access for some specific data so without all those help they'll be able to start migrating then we also help them to building some uh apply for some backgrounds while they are building the tools so they get support from the frederick foundation another interesting thing is that they have a company currently located in china which is using alicloud as a bridge to send the data from china to canada which is a great lot of cars when they're using that protocol for transfer because i cloud charge a large amount um a lot amount of money when you're doing the transportation across candidates with the freight one we have so many nodes over 3 000 storage providers across the world and we have so much power in china so all of them most of them willing to provide those stories for free so this is this advantage they'll be able to downgrade their costs by 70 percent without uh impact over their business so that's why we see that this frank one and ffs they're created to us but we really need us as solution providers to give them great tools to accelerate their development excellent i i like you you brought up a ton of good points here one is that you know what i'm hearing is that storage providers like yourself are also innovating right by bringing more interfaces and make it easier for customers to onboard so you know also um secondly is that you know the ingest of the sorry the egress right from existing cloud providers is expensive and anything that we can help with that making that easier um you know so that you know more data can be ingested in even different formats because one of the unique items of falcon here is that you have that you know unique id and you know it doesn't really matter if it came in through an s3 interface or of a virtual file system or or a custom sdk cool um thank you thank you for that charles so kevin uh kevin you're at picnic um you know one of the things that you kind of mentioned already is that the provider community is very strong right very interconnected uh one thing that keeps me impressing is how you know how collaborative everyone is also for this panel session was so easy to like have the support from everyone to to communicate and sit on this panel um you for sure have been engaged with with onboarding and and data movement of some large customer data sets and petabyte scale can you give us some examples and uh educate the team on what you've seen there yeah certainly so um i wanted to acknowledge that over my years of participating in the blockchain space the falcon ecosystem is uh definitely one of the most collaborative open source communities so first thanks to you stefan protocol and hack fest for inviting the picnic team to today's panel quick intro so picnic is a san diego headquartered cloud storage venture and our mission is to set the enterprise standard for web3 infrastructure so that you know all the blockchains of today they're not spinning up nodes and validating off of amazon web services and using centralized infrastructure so uh to your point you know picnic we are really lucky to be a part of numerous teams throughout the falcon ecosystem helping some of the coolest pioneers on board their data sets on to filecoin so the first example that comes to mind is starling lab which is a joint venture between the university of southern california showa foundation and the stanford department of engineering um and they aim to protect human history by leveraging filecoin as the archival layer to their data stack so my team and i have been supporting them and preparing among you know many various things the movement of their data sets the egress from where they are today you know starting from tape storage right when you have petabytes of data it's not easy to go digital especially if you're talking at that scale it's not easy to source the data of that scale it's not easy to get it to the multiple storage providers when we say 3000 on falcon how do you get it to them right across a blockchain network so that starling is able to enjoy decentralization and redundancy of copies but it's going to happen it's been happening it's it's been brilliant so it's been a really exciting time for all of us in the falcon community i can think of so many other other projects we're working on but i'll cut it there so that we can share some time with other folks on the panel yeah great great kevin so basically data management like you said right and and data onboarding just like another cloud cloud offerings today when you're moving petabytes in capacity you want to move it fast sometimes sneakernet is the fastest way to do it um but you know the whole management the data management aspect around that is where you know we see a lot of opportunity um i think you know that will sort of uh get disrupted as well all the traditional tools today by the way charge a ton of money like you know if you go to some of the traditional i don't want to make call out any names but um so i think there's a ton of opportunity there as well stu thank you so much kevin stu um you have been an early adopter of falcon right and have extensive security networking experience what recommend what recommendations do you have for the team here for the audience when it comes to security networking in this space i think your own needs too somebody had to do that so hopefully everyone's heard that yesterday there was a large uh break-in to poly networks it's a d5 provider and they there were 600 million dollars worth of their stuff taken and most of it's been returned it's an interesting story so the security stuff is always uh you know in the news lately um i do want to break it down to some of the pieces uh first of all if we start with the actual blockchain and filecoin that's been well proven it's been wholly tested uh we don't see a security issue there uh so we don't worry about that but then we look at the different components such as uh storage providers like a picnic you know we have to be concerned about the physical security of the hardware we have to be concerned about all the things that a normal provider be concerned about denial of service attacks protecting that inbound p2p uh connections into the network through some kind of firewall uh of course you know your hardware os is you know you protect all the systems that you're running so that uh you know your your system secured then the other component is on the client side and in our uh ecosystem the client is the one sending data into the filecoin network to the storage provider so that has to be protected uh one of the big concerns we have and i think the poly uh network breach uh tells you about you know protecting your wallets so you have to do everything from making sure others can't access it proper use of the wallets where you store them and of course protect the keys and not losing the keys so everything like you would expect from a normal operation uh you know backups backup of those keys the um the wallets and then on the network side as kevin mentioned you know we're talking large volumes of data so if we just look at having to transfer a pip of data a pebbite of data if you have a 10 gigabit connection to the internet that takes about nine days to move uh a pip and on the internal side the uh network requires even higher you know we're typically looking at 40 to 100 gigabits per second internal connections because of the massive amounts of data so hopefully that's a good overview thank you yeah no great student i think you know what you're highlighting is you know in every single stack every single layer every single step of uh implementing a a systems or a storage provider infrastructure you you see opportunity for um for improvement um let's let's go back to uh neo so neo um what are where do you think you know the web three future you know leads uh or leaders should be focusing on and building out new businesses abroad and maybe like what's your view from ipfs means perspective um well technically there are two types of tools um application and uh infrastructure i believe both of them are are equally important to web3 ecosystem and on the current fico network there are a lot more capacity than storage so it means that there is a huge amount of capacity basically for free for hackers to use if they choose to use a web 3 power network with the free storage or you know even potentially negatively priced storage uh well it's a fit proposal that allows storage providers to set negative prices for verified storage deals and that will unlock lots of innovative applications or smart contracts that built directly on top of filecoin network after you know pls evm or other vms into fico um as for the infrastructure aside from the data management kevin mentioned earlier i believe as more and more storage providers start to take real storage deals contract management tooling will become super handy especially for large scale storage providers content content filtering system would be essential as well people will start to realize how important this is when the data is against local legislation you know lots of storage providers in china have this hesitation when they couldn't verify the data so they just don't take sort deals at all uh also like one mentioned earlier on the composal detail could take market orders like a bids deals asks and leverage the dex decentralized exchange to to see how the market really values these orders and with this sort of ability the ecosystem will be able to begin come up with hardware features you can do futures on hard drives sscs and gpus and so on or even space time futures which is wild as you can actually do features on the storage contracts themselves i'm super excited to see what happens when that majors very cool yeah i know i think you brought up some really good points like filtering data qualifying data in an automated scalable way um you know guaranteeing that certain data is legit etc and then optimization all the way on the back end stack as well like you know tuning for hardware definitely um lots of opportunity chipsets right customized chipsets all of that um will eventually help us get um ahead right and and provide more compute capabilities as well uh down the road um thank you so let's go back to uh charles so charles i mean one of the things that you know we kind of you you're a big you know uh proponent of this is um how you're building right this stack of services and and are able to compete against hyperscalers so any suggestions and opportunities and where startups should focus on in helping you know that the falcon ecosystem and competing against the hyperscalers that you have some very specific you know talking tracks there let's uh let's go through it yeah like we are very exciting to [Music] working with fragrant network because we see that there are few opportunities in the fractal network uh my opening practical network for now is not just as one of the biggest or even the biggest security network that also has numerous of computing resource as well memory gpu and the cpu that all hyper performance servers so with those other resources we're actually not just building uh one of the largest storage network we are also we have become one of the largest computing network across the world which means that potentially like uh fracking error competing with all the existing cloud systems like aws google and uh azure whatever there are so many limitations about those centralized cloud system processors their source code is all closed physical which means that you don't really know what they perform behind the scenes do they take your data if they're using your privacy for business purpose it is the is your data really belongs to yourself we want to [Music] retrieve your data where you get it all those questions you don't know right but the referral everything open source you have any doubts you can trigger the code if you want to edit something you can write your own code and keep it on the network so with this one like uh also we have as we said we currently have almost 700 nodes which is active on the network you can reach and the more than 200 nodes accepting data we imagine how many data centers aws and google has just the 20 data centers across the world how many regions pregnant we which if you check the fs by today we cross the 18 time zone we have more than 600 teams and we have so many providers across the world we can build the largest decentralized storage and computer network so for the lots of startups who want to join this great network you can think about how can we change all the service current classes provided are doing to our network for example live here they are doing the video live stream and transcoding right they can use the fragment network doing the your mining is ongoing like us we're doing the storage providers with the fx3 trying to replace the current s3 storage and we're also building the age computing framework to replace the aws snowboard snow family services and there are still thousands of opportunities there becomes the city and services the cloud from services cloud monitoring services and other services like uh uh and balancer service all those opportunities which is currently provided by the at the blast or other cloud services we can do it on frequent ones which is even better we have so many storage providers with verified data you get storage free can we get computing free as well in the future i would assist that as possible we need a good economic model we have more potential beauty think about the decentralized which is driven by the community economic model compared to those four profit only companies there's a huge advantage and also trust will have more trust than them because we are open source code everybody the storage is really beyond you did is yeah so those are the opportunities and the focus i think starts working on and growing the entire community under the network thank you thank you charles and one thing that i know you and i talked about this but um and you mentioned it already is the the infrastructure as a service that you're you know you're looking to build right over time as a storage provider so it's not just what we're seeing right now in the storage provided world is you're not just a falcon storage provider you're actually building extra services with other blockchains and so you could look at all of our storage providers as the future managed service providers of of the next decade that will have multiple stacks of blockchains collaboratively working in the same data center offering you know all sorts of services but it all starts with getting that data first because that's where all the magic happens right so bringing them the compute close to the data like you said um is quite interesting um the next question is for thank you thank you charles um very excited to see what your you know your team is working on and what you come up with what you will come out with next uh let's go to uh to kevin so what are some of the problems you're seeing kevin and what are some of the business opportunities that you would uh recommend teams to focus on yeah that's that's a really great question so i think like charles is saying with the panelists before me um it's about better integrations and architecting solutions that make sense to the market as it stands today i mean he fired off a lot of the big keywords that a lot of the big players the hyper scalers i mean as part of the web 3 trend thotlin is decentralized it has different technological requirements to work but there's this gap it's this void where here's here's your web 2 user today the folks who are used to using hyperscalers and then they're the web 3 technologies like filecoin and you have to traverse them if you're one of those data generators or storage users when we we ourselves all of us in this call are used to these de facto cloud tools like s3 from amazon or from the view of today's i don't know thousands tens of thousands of storage architects this admins everywhere whether you're academic whether you're government or private i mean we all use the same data movers over and over the same few names you've got veeam backup restore you've got rclone rubric net backup and it's that's it right there's so much business opportunity if an entrepreneur like one of you in the audience can bridge that gap that i mentioned so you can build the arsenal of tools that allow web 2 users to not even notice that they've migrated to web3 they've gotten over that void because they're now on falcon it's just that seamless also on that note um another thing is knowing how to use or interface with following and upgrading technology if you're used to web 2 they're proprietary but you're used to them it's you i mean the msps have gone out there the trainers the different big hyperscalers put out business development training sessions for the the different segments but with web3 with fileclone you have to understand wallet management token economics etc the list goes on an entrepreneurial idea would be to just aggregate those new knowledge requirements into a new system role so that again the web 2 user doesn't even notice that they've migrated to web3 they just know their data is decentralized they can pay us dollars fiat to the five point storage provider or et cetera to charles team uh who integrates many different things for fox um and that's an entirely separate role in the web3 ecosystem um and then i think the last thing i wanted to mention when you said the word opportunity uh i think it's just tremendous i want to take a step back and really paint how big the cloud storage is sorry kevin kevin sorry sergeant rob you hear a lot of static noise from the microphone not sure if uh you were on a roll there i love that by the way that's it i hate i hate to interrupt you because it's such a you're making such a uh great um you're making such pretty great topics there wait so can you check your microphone quickly and then we'll we'll try again yeah how's that how's this oh perfect awesome okay yes my apologies um i just wanted to make sure i made that point for all of you in the audience one of the most incredible opportunities just disaggregating into a new role the ability to put all the new knowledge requirements and supporting folks who go from web to web through seamlessly i think that was the last point hopefully i made that clear and then just step on i think my last point was um uh you mentioned the word opportunity coming from the traditional wall street world management consulting private equity i always think about market opportunity take just a really quick step back and really paint how big cloud storage of an opportunity that is okay so today's public government private clouds it's approximately 100 000 exabytes stored that's insane uh in four years that number's at least gonna double to two hundred thousand according to some of the key research groups like cyber security ventures allied market markets and markets i mean the estimates like in 2027 2028 cloud storage is gonna a three it's gonna pass the 300 billion dollar mark that's like a keger on the order of something 22 23 just think about that folks even if web 3 is slow to take off which it's not right you've heard neo i mean his team's been around for what a little over a year two years that since test net to main net they're at two three hundred petabytes the growth is incredible but even if it's slow to take off which it's not falcoid is just a small fraction of that which it's not the addressable market will still be a massive 100 billion opportunity for entrepreneurs who help web 2 move to web3 so i implore all of you just take a bite of that opportunity and seriously just pack away at it very cool very cool thank you thank you kevin couldn't agree more um next question uh is for stu uh people ask sometimes why you know does falcon not have built-in encryption in the stack what's your response to that because i'm sure you have an opinion on that yeah absolutely so i think the question's a little more complicated than people know when i hear the question like why don't you encrypt data well there's really four actors in this ecosystem you know there's the protocol itself right the file coin protocol and when you look at the purpose the purpose is you can store data in a decentralized manner around the world and then people can decentralize storage platform the other two actors though are the client and what i'll call the customer so the client is that uh that piece that accepts the customer data and then processes it and sends it to the storage provider and there's an opportunity there's a business opportunity in terms of managing those client relationships and expectations and so if you want to encrypt there that could be encrypted and sent to the storage miner is an encrypted blob right that we simply store and then they can manage their permissions in terms of uh you know who can access this who gets the key how do they get the key and finally the customer the ones that we've spoken to actually don't want to use encryption even though they do have sensitive data that they don't want to be publicly exposed because they're afraid of a single point of failure when something happens that key all of a sudden uh where's our data you know who's got the key oh you know it has to be managed properly so they don't want to take that chance so it's really up to the customer and the client to decide how to um how to negotiate those uh those requirements and then wear that uh encryption if it's to happen where it happens and how it gets managed yeah really cool yeah i think you know it's it's like you said right every every um there's an opportunity again in every stage and um even in you know different encryption technologies can be added on the front or in the back and i think you know again it's it's an example of how we think about the ecosystem how we believe you know innovation will happen over time and will change over time um across the ecosystem great unfortunately we're um we're at time here but you know i wanted to make sure if there's any questions in the chat do i have a couple more questions lined up too but we're gonna get ready for the next panel session the meantime i'm going to pass it on to cardig who's going to look at some other questions that came in through the chat and i will be back with you in two minutes uh in the meantime cardiff take it away uh thanks everyone for joining uh at least on the final session and i'll i'll be back in two minutes oh that was a an incredible talk and so many amazing points here uh we'll we'll give anybody who has any questions on the chat feel free to uh kind of type them in we'll relay those questions to our speakers and i saw some really interesting points here and um i was going to still ask you to kind of keep all your video on uh so maybe one question for for everybody until we receive a few more questions here are just in terms of you kind of talked about you covered a lot of opportunities that are here whether it's on the opportunity of the space itself on storage or it can ancillary tools around it but uh what uh what specifically i guess keeps you up at night and what do you worry about and uh and maybe i'll start this with that with charles and then we can go to kevin but what what kind of are things that you're concerned about as this ecosystem grows and and what matters on that side yeah well me like with the private network currently like uh uh let let's remember that the price point is mainland online just one one year not even one year yet so there was there are lots of two hours like infrastructure protocol layers are still lost it keep on involving so when startups start their design and linear to can count about long term we kind of like we start project we expect it to perfect then it will like make it uh looks as useful so that's who i would like to see that for some young developers youngsters the coming here because ideas and said oh this is not really the place though this status that you can express so what i see is that if you think something is not there you can do two things one thing is that you have buildings open sources building libraries from the core operators and uh open source to the others so we can make the network and the tools evolve fast another thing that always thinking about long term like the way you're writing code or you're doing this thing how about others with this is this a real need or this is just because i like it i think it will be great but where's grannies always do some research before you start now this is something like i'm thinking another part is about security like when we're doing those applications we are aiming at uh for industry usage right industrial user accepts those solutions about security side i see there's a lot of competition is great but they don't think about security for example how to protect our customer data how about some legal things those kevin i see is an active engagement going on in the chat here with you and then a few of our attendees so maybe uh i'll ask you here as well for the live stream what keeps you up at night yeah i don't know if you were reading the live stream and then asked the question so perfect the first one that comes to mind i mean just to make it clear for all of us who don't understand that saying it's generally a negative connotation what's keeping you up at night um we're all working so hard in the hacking community and so hard on the web3 community to make decentralization work for cloud storage or even more more aggressive goals cloud compute etc the existing infrastructure today when we colloquially call it web 2. that has had so much maturity from different legal jurisdictions from security and just it's not just about ethics or legislation there's also been so much work to functionally technically keep systems going in ways that provide the security and comfort to its users um in the chat i mean uh i think vibe thanks for being so active uh i've mentioned role based access management i mean our backs control that doesn't really exist today because we're packing so quickly we're building so quickly at least getting the capacity up but we also have to make sure that we're covering our bases it's not just a liability thing but to encourage users you have to protect them in their data and so what keeps me up at night and this a better spin on it would be what's the opportunity here would be for hackers in the community to see that there's a need to bring the same professionalism the same security standards um but somehow be creative and allow it to work on a decentralized platform like filecoin so i think that's my answer and that's that's a huge opportunity not my expertise but i'm sure someone in the audience uh would will be great for it if not is already working at it absolutely and i think this sort of overlaps with what you just commented on stuart with an encryption in this space so maybe i'll let you a comment as well and we'll go to neo and wrap it up sure uh comment on encryption or security it's music my ears everyone's talking about security either or uh the question still stays what keeps you up yeah so it's um i always try to understand the risks and balance them right so it's really about managing the risk so trying to understand what those risks are right now i'd say a lot of our attention is turning toward government regulations some of the hearings in the senate and the new amendments being proposed or passed those present of course the kind of risks that we need to be concerned about and how that affects us as opposed to you know kind of a traditional infrastructure and application type of risks uh that you know we always have to worry about so that would be my answers just uh you know what's out there what's coming and how's the environment uh constantly changing uh as somebody's worked a lot in the enterprise space you know i continue to uh evangelize the fact that the blockchain technology offers us far more security than you know the web two way of doing things uh i spend millions of dollars trying to protect what is in some ways unpredictable there's just so many rooms for uh for you to get hacked uh often at a social level not just a code level so uh you know seeing a protocol like file coin or other blockchains where the security is built into the protocol and you don't you don't count on people you can trust right it's it's really a trustless system so um now we're looking outside the protocol right off chain problems absolutely and neo uh maybe close this off i'd love to hear your thoughts as well yes yes i i think you guys got almost everything covered um what keeps him up at night uh well that's that's actually a classic interview question uh one of the proper answer is aside from you know uh occasional nightmares about interviewing uh i worked so hard that i rarely have a difficult time speaking but when you ask that question to executives you might get answers like team dynamics talent issue corporate culture and and people related issues but for me the real answer is is how to achieve effective communication when our team is distributed in different regions with different time zones i i personally started uh working remotely uh from four years ago and way before the cope dynamic but still try to you know improve on high effective communication i think protocol lab seems really good at this and and ethereum global uh stephen or uh do do you have any tricks to share neo that's not me yes that's you yes uh jumping in tricks i think you know keep building the community as strong as possible i'm strong believer that you know innovation comes through you know throwing ideas um at each other and collaboratively working on and brainstorming on doing things in a new way and i feel like some of the greatest ideas just come by drinking a beer or you know just you know when you're not really focused on brainstorming but when you're just like trying to make something work and and by really solving a problem i think you know that's why we're so huge on hackathons that's why we're so huge on accelerated programs um and and huge on building this together with the ecosystem so i want to thank you all for coming great conversation um again we should do more of these i hope this was helpful to the community
