um i'm joined by our friend julian from the unlock protocol he's going to be doing a crazy cool presentation today about everything you need to know um we'll be taking questions throughout so if you want to pop your questions down in the zoom chat below uh he'll be taking them during the presentation so be a nice little conversation in here afterwards i highly recommend connecting with him in discord there are the the partner team channels a great way to continue the conversation and learn more but julian a man who needs no introduction i'll give you the floor all right thank you very much for having me here luke uh sorry everyone for being late uh i was on a previous call that took forever i'm really really excited to be here i won't tell you about unlock obviously uh what it is what it's for and maybe kind of tell you a bit of an application in the dao space because i do think that's uh most of what you guys are going to hack on is indeed dowse um so what is unlock well it's pretty simple unlock is a protocol from memberships it is if you want kind of an abstraction layer for people to build memberships any kind of membership you can pay a membership to a media site like you'd say spotify or netflix or memberships it could be a membership to e-commerce sites like amazon prime is a good example of this but if you think about like a lot of loyalty programs for brands are memberships but it could also be a membership to a dao it could be also a place where a bunch of people all share an attribute and we'll talk about what that attribute is in their wallets basically to prove that they belong to the dao and then can easily uh you know join the dao's decision process join some of the dows you know private spaces etc etc so what i'm going to do today because i know some of you are developers is show you how you can deploy a lock which is a membership contract how you can easily airdrop keys which are these membership cards as well as how you can maybe use that to token gate content on a wordpress site or maybe if we have time to use that as a as a snapshot uh decision process where you allow people to vote based on the fact that they own a special membership nft does that make sense for everyone all right so let's get started so i'm going to start showing my screen first this is the place so here i am on the uh on the unlock website uh which you all can see uh and that's basically a market a little website where we have some a little bit of marketing that shows people uh how to uh what unlock is for and it really is about these membership that i just told you about what's interesting is like each membership is a non-fungible token so it's a crypto asset that proves that my wallet at least uh is a member of some kind of community uh so what i'm gonna do here i mean i'm scrolling slowly so you can see things but uh pretty pretty simple and basic things so i would definitely ask you to uh if you can spend the time uh to look at these at some point you'll see we have a little developer section i'll i'll send you the docs afterwards but what i'm going to do first actually click on that button at the top called dashboard the dashboard is uh and if you connect my my wallet here the dashboard is uh should excuse me one second i'm going to stop sharing as i type my password and the dashboard is the place where you as a creator uh as the organizer of the dao if you want can deploy your own membership contract in practice you could actually deploy these contracts uh through code as well we actually have a bunch of script to do that a bunch of libraries to do that but here i'm just going to use a ui to make it easy for you all to uh to do that so let me actually go back to to my screen sharing thing here screen share screen share screen share go cool so you see that here i'm on the on the unlock dashboard and obviously i've got i've deployed a lot of membership contracts already so you can see them all here um i'm gonna debug another one if you were to join that website right now you would not really have that many um smart contract link there uh but let's actually get started so i'm gonna create a lock and i'm gonna fill that uh uh my dao uh members i don't know if that's a a good one uh but let's do that um and what's interesting here is like contrary to other dials so if you think about dao's oftentimes the um you know membership is actually based on a currency an erc20 an amount of token that you own with nfts with unlock it's actually not so much based on how many tokens you own but the fact that you own one so kind of everybody is on the same foot of equality so think of it as a club where it's not so much like how rich you are that matters but just uh you know the fact that you have a member's membership card so here i'm going to create this name the smart contract mydao members i'm going to decide what is the duration of the membership i can start from you know one second in practice you see here i've done a demo with three minutes which doesn't make any sense for dao to unlimited i think a good a good a good number for that would be a year so you say hey my members are going to be members of the dow for about a year oh and i see maybe i have a question in the chat uh oh it's it's it's luke yes you can actually revoke membership if the members own the erc721 i'll show you this afterwards uh javier give me a couple minutes here i'm going to deploy this and then show you that so basically i could create a membership for a year i can decide how many members my dao was going to have i can say you know what maybe 100 or maybe 10 or it might be unlimited here we'll let's pick unlimited because make a dough that's pretty inclusive that everybody can access to and i can set the price of the membership which is kind of interesting you say hey every time there's a a member they need to pay you know some amount of tokens and i'm trying to play with the windows here just to see everyone but i don't think that works but anyway so they're gonna have to pay a certain amount of tokens to join the dow what's interesting in the context of that is like these tokens could become some kind of treasury that the whole uh you know that the whole uh dao manages so let's let's go ahead and you can use uh the native currency of the chain here i'm on the wrinkly network but you see we support ethereum optimism uh binance smart chain xl which is now called uh gnosis chain polygon and even localhost if you want to deploy things locally um i'm more than happy to show you how to do that in the docs so again setting a price of 0.1 east actually let me see if i got enough in my wallet yeah actually you know let's actually uh set a larger amount 0.81 eth and i'm going to submit this uh oh we have a bug here uh let's say oh weird okay um and so to submit this i'm going to click on the on the on the button to deploy uh that's my contract and here here i'm actually deploying a contract um and i'm paying a little bit of guests for this and that contract is going to be just for my dial member so let's actually wait for that transaction to go through uh you're pretty familiar with this but obviously you can use the block explorer uh here all of the unlocked contracts are verified so you're more than welcome to look at this i'm actually going to show you not only the verified but we actually have a pretty extensive documentation uh at docs.unlockdashprotocol.com smartcontract we can see all of the uh all of the specification all of the addresses across multiple networks uh as well as details of how these things work we have multiple versions you can actually see the the different the different contracts and you'll see that they are verified so here i can actually go see on optimism the verified contract and see all of the code here so let's go back hopefully this has been mined by now uh yes this has been mined so let's uh refresh here oh where was i at the dashboard here oh let me press the wrong button but anyway i'm refreshing here so you see my dough members now is deployed i can actually go check it out on the block explorer and see that the contract is verified what's interesting is like we deploy proxy contracts so you want pretty to verify to pick this little uh step to verify the actual implementation of the contract um so this is done and you can see a bunch of functions here that are accessible so i can see uh what is the balance of an address like how many nfts that address own i can see you know if um what the price of the membership is and this is obviously expressed in the full uh digit version of this i can see the name of the contract which is basically my daughter members here i can see the maximum number of keys which we set to 100. um i mean there's a bunch of characteristics here i can also modify some of the behavior straight from here so for example i can change the base look on ui because these are nfts they all have a visual aspect um i can set hooks and again i would invite you to look at the docks for this which alter the behavior of the of the smart contract um on the fly when something is purchased or something is sold or something like this so let's go back to the dashboard here um javier we're asking how to uh cancel some of these memberships so actually let me show you something really cool here uh i'm gonna connect here and you see that this uh at this point this lock doesn't have any uh any member uh and i'm gonna just connect to this site so you're gonna see a different version but i can easily now uh list the members but i can easily air drop a membership to anyone so let's say i don't know what looks ens is but like let's say look that eth uh and it doesn't exist uh so i'm gonna use chris uh one of our colleagues at eth and that's gonna resolve to his address now and i can oh yep look bakeman okay cool okay let me actually try this look uh luke bakeman yes that's you cool so i'm gonna give you a membership to uh the members dial here i can set a specific expiration for that custom one but i'm gonna give you a forever one and i'm gonna click on grand key um now i'm gonna set a transaction and technically what i'm doing here is air dropping and then ft to you so you'll be a member of the dao here what's interesting here is like as soon as it's gonna get mine we're gonna have to wait uh i mean a couple seconds uh as always but once this gets mined uh i got it today this is awesome yes absolutely uh and so hopefully this gets mine quickly now yes uh what's interesting now is i can actually uh i can um refresh the page actually to see uh all of the memberships and i will see luke's membership here so you see that uh mydar members the token number one belongs to luke uh he has not set the reverse uh resolution of the on the zns which is probably fine and you see that it never expires uh javier i'm coming to your question now you can actually easily cancel some of these memberships so i'm going to click that button expire and refund and i'm going to say you know what i want to refund you know how much do i refund to you um zero uh luke uh so i can click here and now i'm basically gonna uh expire that membership uh which means that you're not gonna have it anymore it was kind of short-lived um uh in one click and that was kind of uh to answer javier's question um i want to go back to uh it means that luke was never the yeah he was but basically the contract itself the membership contract has a way to uh withdraw uh somebody's nft so the nft was in lux actually we can actually go check it out contract and in practice actually he still has an nft but this nft is marked as expired on chain uh uh standard i don't know what that mean uh no i don't yes so it's ec721 standard but uh we add a bunch of capabilities to this so yes 71 as a contract has a lot of different uh um uh things and so you can add more things to that and yes we've added this as you can see now there's actually no more active membership and i can click here and i'll see now luke's membership is marked as expired uh and is not a member anymore so when lux tries to log in on a website he would not be able to prove that the owner he owns a valid membership because obviously that membership is expired uh let me show you maybe uh the contract to deploy and other the contract deploy and other methods are available yes absolutely everything is available through to the we say apis it's basically the abi it's directly available on the smart contracts uh on the docs again like docs.unlockdashprotocol.com smartcontract let me actually post a link here so you can actually check this oh nope i'm just sending this to luke here everybody can see that uh in there so that's one of the small things what i want to show you now is kind of an interesting um example if you want to if you guys want to airdrop your ens i think that's going to be uh that's going to be interesting but um go ahead so i'm going to i'm going to basically show you that you can actually now easily uh token gate uh some content on a wordpress site for example uh just so that you're a member so uh don't know so i'm gonna i'm gonna do that to you in a second uh so i'm gonna log in on this wordpress site i'm sure some of you are familiar with wordpress this is uh pretty much um the most common uh you know um [Music] what sorry if you say this cms uh and i'm going to publish a new story here so i'm going to click on a new post here you know say uh dow charter and say okay so i'm going to say this is this page has the charter for the dao but you can only see it only see it if if you are one of the members so i'm going to do that and here i'm going to basically to add a new block which is kind of interesting it's an unlock block and i'm going to say okay cool i'm going to have to configure this so i'm going to you see on the right here there's a little uh configuration box i'm going to click here this is on the rinkeby network that i deployed my lock and i think the address might be yeah cool so i've pasted the address of the lock here uh that was actually in my um in my clipboard and now i can actually add content so uh rule one oops uh rule one uh you only uh talk about the tao with other dao members i don't know uh rule two uh sorry i can't type ah well two we are here to have fun cool and so now you'll see that uh uh i don't know if i'm doing things right here uh there's something going on in the ui i hope nothing is bad i looked like i was not able to put that into the box but okay do this again uh yes this time this worked okay cool this is in the box okay cool and this um thanks for reading us cool and so i'm going to publish that immediately publish it and so now if i click on view post you'll see that i'm going to be able to but since i'm logged in actually see the content but if i once i log out from that from that page and go back to the home page obviously the dow charter you'll see that well yep this page uh as a starter uh as the charter for the remember you cannot see if you remember and indeed the content is hidden in the middle so i'm gonna post the link here uh if any of you want to click on this you'll see that you'll be able to access this uh what i'm going to do now is actually airdrop this membership on uh on on you javier so i'm going to do that uh that turnoso.eth uh ah come type uh call that was resolved so i'm gonna give you a membership you know so i'm gonna uh sorry uh javier i'm gonna give you a membership that's gonna expire in uh you know in uh in i'll give you 25 minutes i can't type for uh 20 you know 30 minutes uh at 4 00 at 4 30 is going to expire and so i'm going to grant you that key and so you'll be able to access that content for about eight minutes uh after the minutes mine so let's actually give it a second here um and so what's really cool about that is like obviously as soon as it's minted uh javier you can actually click on that page connect your what and you'll be able to read the charter in the meantime i'm gonna purchase a membership myself so i'm gonna connect my wallet here um basically metamask is popping up say hey uh do you wanna sign this message i'm gonna sign this i'm going to redirect it back and now you see that i'm logged in but i actually don't have the membership away so this time actually i'm logged in here as julian this is my address i need to this time purchase the membership which i'm doing here and it's point zero one east as i said earlier oh this website actually needs to collect my email address uh so i'm just typing that here uh saving my email address and then now i'm gonna purchase the membership by clicking that wallet button and so i'm gonna spend 0.1 eth to purchase the membership and we'll actually now wait for this membership to be uh to be minted uh javier i don't know tell us uh i'm sure now where is the members page yes you probably have a membership now javier i'm going to refresh here if you want to tell us that you've been able to access the content that is your address indeed uh javier it's gonna expire uh very soon uh and as soon as yep mine was minted here you can actually refresh here uh my once when sorry my membership was minted i can actually close and go back to the website and you see that now yeah i can read uh the charter of the dao so really what's interesting about unlock here as a protocol for membership is like it allows you to create a dial like you would do any normal dial except that the dao is based oh yes you need to uh change to bring kobe uh javier uh that was that's what we used um uh yes and uh zero x is uh xerox arrived is pointing uh to the page the contractor has to be used as one of the published network for the specific absolutely right so you can use any of the contracts that you that you need so you can create memberships uh for daos and then you can easily lock content we have integration in telegram and discord in web flow uh in decentralance you can even create a you know a private space uh inside of decentralized just for your dao members so that they can hang out and have uh you know have discussions about what needs to be done uh i didn't show you a bunch of other things but basically the contract is verified as i said earlier let's actually go back to the dashboard uh well we'll see now that uh we have uh oh i clicked the one button here uh oh i see then also has the membership and oh of course i've got the other one a membership uh so my daughter member now has three members uh i mean luke is still a member but his membership is expired uh the price of keys and so the balance of the lock uh the membership contract is now 0.18 the one that i paid which i can easily withdraw if i want to i'm going to do that and so this is going to come back to my wallet because i'm the owner of the dao in that scenario it could go to a treasury as i said earlier into a multisig we have a bunch of other features uh like a way to enable credit cards which is actually a pretty powerful system and as i said we have mainly integration a very powerful one is the cloudflare one you can easily create um using cloudflare you can uh uh tokengate tokengate the content and javier is posting something yeah it works perfectly yes awesome uh glad to hear uh but yeah so cloudflare allows you to easily token gate any kind of website you can say hey i'm building an application and i want to make sure that only the members of the dao can actually access this you would use the cloud integration we have one in firebase which is a pretty popular development platform we have a discourse plugin as well which i think could be very powerful and of course in the docs you can see all of the possible integration i wanted to show an integration in snapshot i don't think we have enough time here but you can easily create something where you require uh people to vote only if they have a special nft in their wallet uh you know actually do that see if i can find the time and so here we actually i'm gonna use one of the spaces that we have uh here i'll show you how that works but i can create a new proposal um here and what i can do here is actually no that's not the i would have to create a new uh a whole new a whole new space uh which i'm not gonna be able to do here because i don't have is running out but basically you would create a space here and you can actually when you create the the proposal you can set the uh when you create the space sorry uh the the the space in snapchat you can set the rules to be people need to own a valid membership to the dao for them to be able to vote on things and so that's uh that's a pretty powerful uh mechanism that i think we uh you'll uh you all uh could actually build on uh what else um i mentioned about the fact that the contract is verified obviously you can click on ether scan link uh to uh so that's the last the last little thing uh to see uh everything that's in the contract i mentioned earlier you can do a bunch of things like modify the expiration date the number of keys uh the metadata so you can actually easily change the visual aspect so you see here as this icon i can also upload a file which uh and then i would use my dials you know the dials picture i don't know if this is yeah that's a good a good picture for the nfks and i say this and now on openc you would see all of the membership cards have the same uh have the same icon as the one that i just just set i think that's going to wrap it up um i'd love to hear of any question that you guys have i'm going to check javier's link here just to make sure that it works yep javier was able to read the membership the the dao's charter so that's pretty uh pretty cool if you have any question regarding unlock feel free to ask them on discord uh there's as you know as you all know by now there's a shared uh discord space actually one fun thing i've got my online membership on my site uh all of these little icons that you can see here at the bottom uh i don't know if you see them are my blog's members so that's actually an easy way you can say hey when we create a membership contract uh for the dao all of the dao members are going to be visible on some websites or are going to be displayed on some you know virtual webcam like i do here if we have to create different types of members do we create different locks absolutely so one of the ways to do that is you need to create multiple locks so you can say hey there's the gold members that's only 10 people and it's 0.1 ether and then there's the silver members it's 100 people and it's 0.001 east or the you know whatever bronze is the next metal i guess uh so you can create as many locks as you want and you can easily combine them we even have so on the smart contracts themselves and again you'll see that in the docs but a bunch of hooks that allow you to alter as i said earlier the behavior of the lock so you can say hey when somebody is checking whether they have a valid membership to a lock you can actually call back to another lock to retrieve this so you can say hey my all of my members they're either i have the gold or silver or bronze and then make it something that you only have to do one check to check that somebody has any of these three memberships i hope i didn't uh speak too fast or too much too fast obviously this is recorded so you're more than welcome to go back to anything that i said and again ask questions i'm here to help i'd love to uh i'd love to uh i'd love to hear from you all well thank you so much julian that was an incredible presentation and i know everyone learned a lot from it really glad to have you here of course excited to be a part of the hacker and really excited to see what you all end up building yeah this is going to be a killer event i think we're going to see a lot of really cool projects especially with unlock uh thanks again to everyone for joining us here for me closing this session we have another session starting in well now it's starting right now so head on over there check for some details in the general chat and as julian said
