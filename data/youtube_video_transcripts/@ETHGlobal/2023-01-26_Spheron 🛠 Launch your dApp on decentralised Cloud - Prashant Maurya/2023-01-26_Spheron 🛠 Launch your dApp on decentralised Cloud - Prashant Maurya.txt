foreign [Applause] [Music] who just joined us I just want to say a quick thank you for joining us I know you guys are hacking right now we've got a really great Workshop lined up for you I'm joined by Prashant from siron protocol uh Prashant I'm sure you can give yourself a better introduction than I can uh but I wanted to kick it off by saying we will be taking questions throughout the uh Workshop please put your questions into the chat uh using Zoom below and we'll try and take them throughout the throughout the session uh Prashant floor is yours thank you so much I look for the warm introduction hey guys thank you so much for joining in and showing interesting to stron as such like goes to going and hosting your web application on a decentralized ecosystem um I just don't I I did not wanted to like waste uh most of your time in making you understand why uh uses sphere on but rather I would love to go and directly jump into like showing exactly in how many steps you can start launching your the apps on a decent eyes ecosystem which is nothing but a ipfs and filecoin and how you can basically help yourself in accelerating your web applications today uh whatever you might be building today you might be building nfts you might be having uh multiple use cases around D5 data dials or whatever you are planning to build um most likely you are going to be using a web application to interact with the user interface like with the user if so then most likely siron will come into the picture and and we are we will be more than happy to support you in taking your the app to a truly decentralized World which is nothing but ipfs and file point and uh and how you can basically make that happen so at espiron we the day when we like I'm also a builder and um I believe my journey also started from each Global as well um like initial days of Bitcoin and then after that it Global um so most of you who are sitting here most likely um all the very best going forward also like who's whatever way about these you guys are participating in just just participate and also keep uh your motivations up this is what I also wanted to just share uh before I dive into there are a few things which uh you have to understand how you are going to use this viron um the first thing is like it's very straightforward you might have been into web 2 and you if you have used any anything apart from Inspiron earlier in web 2 like Versa liplified digital ocean you know whatever you are going to have the same experience here as well there won't be any experience differences the only difference which you are going to see instead of we inst instead of using aw AWS your data will be sitting on a like on file coin on ipfs or S3 object it would be on ipfs or filecoin uh if you are using the compute for any reasons you can also uh you you most likely will be uh making your compute launch on a cache Network rather than on AWS so these are the common uh things which you are going to look into but yeah I'll directly dive into the demo now uh Luke just confirmed me if my screen is visible if so then I'll I'll forward I'll go ahead with the demo um anyone can confirm like is if if my skin is visible yes okay yes it is all right thank you um so basically to log into resperon it's it's very straightforward just go to it's around the network uh once you are not displayed on the network uh there will be a page called deploy app deploy now you can click on that or you can directly go to app.ron.network uh midrashes if you are here you can just paste those link here so that people can easily find us out um and then go and click on GitHub so most likely you might be using GitHub or you might be using gitlab or bitbucket whatever is your favorite you can go ahead and do that so let's say I want to go with GitHub continue logging with the GitHub once you log in with the GitHub there is uh straightforward there will be dashboard which you are going to see this dashboard has couple of things which I just wanted to work you guys through so that you have a clear understanding what this dashboard basically means and how exactly you can utilize it at a full potential the first and the foremost thing you have to do is is go and build your own project you don't even have to do anything like you you don't even need to connect your wallet as well uh the reason because we want to give you the feel of web 2 first to understand okay everything is like looking smooth and everything then you go and start connecting your wallet and then you start moving forward from there so the first thing which you can do is like go to the new project uh go to your GitHub and connect your once you connect your GitHub most likely if you have not installed Esperance app into your GitHub it will ask you to install you just have to install that app give the specific access of your repository which you are looking forward to give it and once you are done with that you will be able to see these repositories if by any chance you are not getting uh your repository here we all are building the product sometimes we also face some bucks so that is that is not an issue you can do one thing is like come over here there's a refresh icon you can hit on this refresh icon and most likely most likely you will get your repositories here even in that case you're not but I'm just assuming most of all the cases so that you guys should not panic like hey you know what uh this is not working hard it will work for sure 100 should work what are what I'm saying here but sometimes it might happen because of the bandwidth and multiple issues um so what you can do is to do that and then let's say if I have to launch my uh let's say view app today if I'm building a new app so I could go and click on that particular app now for me if you see there are three uh storage providers are open are we filecoin and ipfs uh most likely for you if you'll be in a free tier you will not be getting RV but if you want please feel free to DM us we'll be more than happy to give you that but we would highly recommend to go and use ipfs and file at this point of time because that will be more than enough for you guys to take a deeper dive so go and click on file coin here once you have created the click the file coin what it does it basically pre-select your framework for me all of these commands are something which I have already configured and it's going to be the same for you guys you can also use the same command you don't have like whatever command you use for building your repositories you can go ahead and use that those commands and then once you are done with that please make sure you select the your node engine properly because what we have seen during our previous experiences is like most of the times developers like people who are going for deployment they forget to select the right node uh module so please make sure like whatever you are using if it is not 12 14 16 please make sure you select that and once you are selected you don't have to do anything and uh if you have any environment variables please feel free to go ahead and add environment very best by clicking on new variables and then passing on the variables into here uh once you are done with that there is nothing else you have to do you just have to click on deploy and this is how easy it is to go ahead use sphere on 2D and what it does it basically it starts deploying your web application now till the time it is getting deployed it hardly takes depending on your size of application and all of those things it totally depends how much time it takes but generally our average time duration of any app uh let's say to build which is like good app uh it it lies between one minute to three minutes this is what hardly it takes and if let's say if it is a very big user interface like uni swap or something then it might take seven to eight minutes but even if if lower end it is it can do in one to three minutes max sometimes even faster if it is a pure GS application once you are done doing this there are few things which I also wanted to point you guys out uh like to show you there are a few things which you have to do in order to uh in order to like make sure you are also participating in the Bounty and you're not you are not just using this straight on for your deployment only so what you can do is uh you have to come here if you have a domain most likely we'll be looking forward um like how like you should be a CS Builder who want to take the entire things forward and that is where you want to come and provide you the support in whatever way it is possible uh so the first thing which you have to do is to attach your domain um you can go here you can enter let's say I want to attachment xyz.com I'll go that go there I have to basically provide in which environment we want to attach so generally at sphere on we have two environments which we give by default to developers to start working on we call one as a production and the development so let's safe if my environment is developing I'll select development and then I can go to select to domain point to where exactly my demand domain was to which particular transaction has my domain has to be get pointed to and this is how I have to do it and this point will only happen only if we go and click on ADD and verify out of it once the domains are verified then you can add your transaction as which you want to point to so this is uh what you can do at this point of a time so let's say if I want to add both production development this is what you can do apart from that let's say if you have a ens uh with you and you want to use um you want to and you want to use uh Brave like for example we currently support e dotling and e dot limo with us so you can go and find your ens domain here and basically Point your whatever hash you have uh deployed so far and it just resolves it and it just maps that particular thing to that ens domain whichever you have so it's that easy and it's it's that simple you don't even have to now worry about doing and doing a lot of multiple transactions just to make that happen it is very straightforward now once you are done with all of those things there are few things also let's say uh if if you see here it is still showing me printing but it is three minutes ago by his rate now what happens like as I said uh we have we are not maintaining the real time State rather it is a asynchronous state which means like you have to you have to async every time uh you are out so if you see this particular application is deployed once it is deployed you will get two functions here the one function is called cids uh this is a transaction hat like you guys must be knowing it it is the CID which which is been generated after the build uh and it took around 1 minute 33 seconds which is much more laser for me um now go and preview deployment most likely you're able to see my deployed version of ipfs uh deployment here you can use this hash to pin whatever you want to this is these are the couple of things which you have done with like what uh like access the application apart from that there are a few more things which you can also uh like start seeing at Sprint on uh which is called the domain like by default they give you two things the one which is called transition hash like hash for uh your CID and then we also bind that CID hash with our domain which is spheron.app um so what happens is like we have spheron.app which is using our own CDN which we have built over the time and it serves your application much much more faster than dotted Gateway call so if you are looking to let's say go and give this domain to your stakeholders who are sitting into different images I would highly recommend to go and give it to them this particular link rather than the direct database link because the direct Gateway link don't have a Serial into attached to it which might be little slow but it will be like faster only in terms of any other Gateway out there so uh these are the uh things which you have to just keep in mind and uh yeah so apart from that if let's say you have some team members you want to go ahead and invite uh one of the one of the coolest feature of sphere on is feel free to go ahead and invite the team members um if you guys need any help or like you need uh to upgrade your subscription uh please ping us on a Discord in our uh Global Channel itself and we'll make sure like we'll allocate you certain coupon code which you can use to uh like open up your uh in in team University feature here now just to give you certain more uh outputs around like how exactly you can upgrade to the pro once you ask for us with the coupon code you can go to the billing there is a coupon section here if you can see like I have already attached these coupons so you just have to go and attach the coupon code here and the moment you will do that you will be able to see like you are good to go and start inviting your team members so this is the straightforwardly straight like like this like you can just go in and do it immediately it will be much more easier apart from that if you are a company and if you are willing to like ticket uh things move forward we have a lot of other things into it which is our built-in features like if you are an optimism Arbiter even in the future if you want to take this front forward with your whole journey you can you don't even have to off-ramp your money from crypto to Fiat you can still go ahead and use any chain like polygon ethereum uh we once fem is also live we'll also be there all of these things you can still you can go ahead today and uh start paying from there you don't even have to like go and off-ramp your any of the cryptocurrencies there um so these are the couple of high level features which I wanted to point it out but um I'll pause here for two to three limits just to hear if you guys have any questions if not then I'll also show you one more part of it which is also very interesting um most of the people who are who might be running mongodb series or any kind of ipfs note on Twitter and your own personal ipfs gateways and everything you can use this feature um but yeah if you guys have any questions I'd love to um here here this out thanks okay um I believe um you are already taking the questions there uh any anyone has any questions till now any concerns any questions we'll be more than happy to take it forward now I got a question yeah please um yeah about the CDN uh is that like your own sting that from a from quite a cloud player or something or how is that working like how is that again Yeah so basically what we actually have done is like instead of going and using because we have been building the shop like this particular baby for a very long time so what we have done is like instead of going and relying on any of the cloudflare we have our own in-house series which we have built which we are also planning to open source it soon for everyone to start because there are a lot of security testing which we are currently going through but once that is done like most probably will most likely will also open it up for Community to start running it up so that is what that CDN is it is in-house no cloudflare nothing thank you yeah and then it is it is Battle tested you can even I can also like you guys can go and start doing your DDOS attack or whatever attack you want to it is it is very well battery tested security tested and everything um but the only thing which we are looking for going forward is like once the Syrian is kind of going live into the market or these notes once we make it live most likely we'll come back again in the global and most likely who knows next time you guys will be using the Syrian to build something else um so that is last words yeah so looking forward to that and uh yeah uh guys any other questions hope that answered my like answer answer your question no all right which means I'm I'm kind of uh good at explaining people like what what we are building um any plans on support of our DNS link uh you can answer that it is very yeah um any we have our DNS connect yeah we already have actually so we don't need DNS link or any but yeah in the future let's say if the if our committee comes and says hey you know what why can't we have multiple gateways at one place we'll be more than happy to do that because we are ultimately we are the aggregator uh we'll be more than happy to aggregate them as well at one place and expose them via our our user interface um yeah now coming back to uh demo again um let's say if you guys have compute need then you can go to this particular switch here the moment you log in basically it just pops it up out here but again if you forgot like you can always go to this compute the moment you get into this compute you are going to find this like for me this is a dashboard but let's say you want to launch your own ipfs cluster or you want to want to launch your own ipfs Gateway for yourself what you can do is you can go to instead of going you can you have multiple options either you go and uh use the ipfs docker container and and basically customize it and then launch it or you can go to our compute template Marketplace and what you can do is like uh let me go and see if I Professor yeah it is here right so which means like you can go to and click on this ipfs and what you can do is like depending on what you are looking for just go and select whatever you want uh let's say if I want to select the this package I'll go and do that and then I'll just have to only click on deploy and I'll not do the deploy or else My Equity will be gone from my wallet so but let me just do that but let's let's say if you want to reply you can just go ahead and click on deploy the moment you deploy it what will happen is like again just to give you guys an information here um since we are the infra web3 infra aggregation layer we try not to use any underlying so when I say underlying it is basically means like we might use our middle layer in somewhere in a centralized ecosystem but all the end in the code offers goes to decentralized ecosystem um and that is where Akash comes into the picture so if you want to spin up your ipfs phone Gateway um You by default get certain a kitties from our sides which means like you don't even have to worry about carrying a cash token on Cosmos or any such sort of a thing you can just directly go to Instagram today and and yeah see I I've just applied my ipfs node like it is it it should work uh once the links once once the link is available um so you can go to this ipfs and then we can if it takes couple of minutes our time or you can say little bit of a time to warm it up because it's a Docker image which takes some time to uh up and then you can use that word the UI port to basically start accessing your ipfs Gateway itself so that is how exactly you can do it uh is my screen is visible which which window is visible okay so if you see here you can use any of these ports to basically uh go and open your GUI and that that is how easy it is now second thing is like let's say I my ipfs node is like not working out I I want to see certain logs I want to see what happens if the deployment worked or not you can always go and check it out here uh what we do is like we create a lease on Akash there is nothing which we hide it here it is very open if any activity is there all these activities and all those things can be checked now let's imagine you want to close this node because you just spin it up by mistake okay so UJ can click here and go to close instance and say continue the moment you do it what happens is the akt which was deducted from your account will be reverted back to you so which you can go and take a look now since I said like it is a asynchronous system either you can wait here till the closing instance thing comes back or you can go back as well it's up to you but you have to just keep an eye on a notification which comes here which says your instance is closed the till the time you are not receiving that notification your instance might be in learning so please make sure you take a look into that because we query the blockchain on Cosmos to get the status and then give it back to you so it it might take certain delay and time uh to make that happen so that is how exactly it works so for example for me it is not yet coming up but once it is closed I will able to see my uh close notification here so these are the couple of things and then let's say if you want to go ahead and and uh attach your domain you can go and do that that domain attachment is also possible today um and then a lot more things like so we'll be here to support you guys in whatever you know in whatever uh way we can uh we'll be more than happy to provide and even today right so today only we have we started the support of many different nodes wherever you are building so for example uh we are also working on the providing the fvm support soon once that's comes into the picture you will also be able to spin up that as well so this is what the sphere on is all about at this point over time and um yeah I'll I'll pause myself here and uh if you guys have any further question you can unmute your mic and we'll be more than happy Tuesday take it forward your question um all right so there's a question we have are you running on all your infrastructure or are you using Azure to host and spin up these resources so there are two things which we are doing currently uh we are using the mixer of the hybrid system the hybrid system it was both our own as well as the centralized versions the intention here is to uh let's say if I want to run an ipfs today how exactly so there are a lot of things which are still not available in um decentralized ecosystem so for example uh messaging queue right so if you have to build a Kafka q and all those things it is not yet available and that is the reason you have to use uh centralized system at certain points to make sure like that queues and everything is right in the place so if you see like so my instance just got close successfully and I have received my notification so yeah uh Patrick just to answer answer your question this is this is the answer but ultimately if you are running any kind of a node um once it is pinned up it it does not spin up in AWS and gcp it spin up on Akash uh in the compute side and for the web hosting side it goes to file point and ipfs directly so there is no mediator so at the end you will get the decentralized version of it I hope that answered uh your question if not you can you can ask furthermore um yeah so I believe that is it from my side just to give you guys I'll stop sharing my screen um I believe I'm on time I have five minutes left so I'll try to cover it that as well Point uh which is very very cool Point around the Bounty so on the Bounty side what we are looking for it's very straightforward um we are looking for anyone who has a web application if you are using domain if you are using computer if you're using anything around this Veyron but the but the thing which we are looking forward is like um you are using your own domain to procs like access any of the resources rather than the uh just submitting the spherence domain which we give or using this firon Gateway that is the I have I have clearly mentioned out our prices on the price Channel but uh feel free to yeah in this and Unstoppable anything will work like whatever you have you can do the reason we wanted to put it Forward because um a lot of times what happens is like people just try to exploit the system by not putting their domains and and we end up in not choosing the right people who have been like building the product for the right reasons so this is how we came up with the filtration process is to put that filter and we have top 10 projects right so most likely uh like quarter of like one by third of you will be the winners most likely are like how many people have joined here um so we'll be more than happy to provide whatever support you guys need uh our Discord is always open uh once you yeah one more thing I have not shown you guys there is also support channel in the app in inside the app itself which means like if you face any issues fingers there directly most likely it will get resolved within next six to seven or eight hours max if it is because our most other teams are India and uh Asia other click we are in Serbia and in India and uh Dubai base so most likely there will be certain issues for the ET time zone people uh we might resolve it in the next five to six hours but for anyone closer to our time zone it will get resolved immediately and if it is not then you can always come to our Discord Channel which is already on our eat Global as well and then we also have our own personal you can come over create a ticket and we'll be more than happy to like resolve those issues so uh yeah Luke I I believe I have covered most of the things um we'll be looking forward like most of these projects accelerating their domain accelerating their web application via file coin and IPL thank you that was an incredible Workshop I think everyone had a really great time in here today and I know we have some workshops coming up next so we're gonna probably keep it real quick um but if everyone can move their conversations over to their Discord now would be a great time to do so
