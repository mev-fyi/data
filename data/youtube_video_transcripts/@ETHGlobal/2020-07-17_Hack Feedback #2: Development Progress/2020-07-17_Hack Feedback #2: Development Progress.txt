just gonna start the recording we're taking notes again this week and by for the stream setup good yeah we're good streams up well I'll work you but I just said welcome everybody to the end of week two and this second half feedback session if you can believe it you've already been working on your project for two weeks which is incredible and I've already seen a ton of progress from people who are just starting with ideas or crazy concepts from the first sessions that we had so again this is incredible and you should all be commended for sticking it out this far so I just dropped in the chat the Google Doc where we're gonna be taking notes last week this was really helpful for putting links if you have something that you want to share with somebody who's presenting or you know just keeping track of who this specific project should reach out to so if you want to help contribute to that for free I believe the edit permissions to be correct people can't access it just let me know and I'll I'll get the correct link all right so this week was a little different we do have a sign-up order and so I will be going by that sign up for presentations let me just pull it up and then we can get started and the final note is we do have an hour and a half scheduled for this but one is only able to stay for the first hour so we are gonna be enforcing some time limits so make sure to keep your description short concise to the point because we want to make sure that there's enough time for everybody to get a little bit of time alright so the first team that we had register was James pork James if you're here I'm going to unmute and tell us about what you've been working on scribe your project oh yeah I definitely wasn't expecting to go first to everyone my name's James we can put you in the if you need more time to prep no no no it's fine I mean we we didn't participate last week so kind of figuring this out and actually Steven Matisse in and seeing our also on our team so they're the more technical folks so I'm glad to have them here to our project is still named TBD we're calling it p3 for right now we're focused on D centralizing sorry monetizing decentralized stored content as a use case we're focusing on you know something simple like mixed media journalism this has been done before obviously like people have tried you know AEI PE one three three seven trying to figure out subscription models for aetherium we believe that this needs to go one step further beyond just the pay wall and also authenticate content and manage the distribution of that content better so specifically we I guess looking at the three different components for the paywall we want to set up we're working on setting up three different methylate where the new streams so your traditional subscription model a secondary model which you know hopefully using meta transactions be able to set up a budget for a monthly consumption of content so it's a better seamless UI experience I can spend ten dollars a month and read all my premium news articles etc and then the third would to be able to take a subsidy from a third party for example I can add base you know an ad agency so shifting that relationship from the content producer to the actual content consumer and saying I will provide you access to my browsing history to the articles and the content that I am consuming in exchange for you paying for me going through the web and consuming all of this content right removing that relationship from the content producer and shifting it directly to the content consumer allowing journalism news folks to go ahead and focus on what they really want to do which is produce content and build their websites and design around content instead of on advertisement so that's the concept for the paywall the second bit is the distribution we are looking to do a server less storage side encryption so receiving encrypted content from ipfs file coin right very likely using textile putting that back into plain text re encrypting with a session layer keep like a session key like so like a TLS equivalent and then using that for distribution so that the original content is always encrypted on storage and only when it's distributed is it re encrypted with a temporary key that then expires at a certain point so the obviously one of the trickier things that we're working on is using trusted execution environments like SGX to facilitate that in a server Louis way we're trying to not use you know not use a gateway or not used some kind of a node to handle that encryption decryption and then the third bit if we have time is to use some kind of hash based methods message authentication codes to verify the authenticity of that content from when it's uploaded and have that follow almost like a root certificate throughout its lifetime to the end consumer so we believe that by fixing distribution and fixing the authenticity the citation bit of it we can really enable the subscriptions to work better but you know haven't really socialized it beyond our group and so kind of wanted to get some feedback on you know if if we're we're going down the right path or you know if there's a better way to structure this thing technically I know it's kind of vague and a lot to consume you know in five minutes Stephen or Singh would you guys like to add anything else or if anyone in the hall wants to hi this is saying another thing that we looking at as a concept wise that would like to see how we can you know make it more scalable by now featuring Lippe to be as the backend surface so instead of a traditional you know you know HTTP pasted you know per answer for that you know just totally matter would not to see if we can you know put this into a deep to be on a p2p in faster just tell you we can you know scare it because it's pleased about our content distribution right so if we approach you you know spin up or the stand up and know into in a more cost to the consumer physically and that would be a not smoother for all this kind of medium and data consumptions yeah I think the idea is a really good in general and I think the just the ability to you know distribute and and monetizing content that way I think in some sense I think what when you describe in terms of doing the encryption and the model and kind of then doing the decryption and showing it in industry X or something can can work they own a bug their hurdled areas that I'm you know I see X has been broken a few times and they might have said but you know who knows definitely causes the bar right like it most of securities about increasing bars to some extent anyway so might be fine you might consider identity based encryption as well that this is a different option instead of using us jacks for this kind of model where you were where you're encrypting content to to disseminating with a lot of parties and another thing you can do is but but I think sorry the most of it though is you probably have a lot of challenges along the way and so building all those pieces getting the encryption to work right working with us Jack's right or some other mechanism and do the payments and so on like that might be a lot to do in a short time so what do we do oh you I would I would like hack the impossible thing first like have the page where you can can view the content whatever that is it could be a document it could be video it could be like other stuff right so so have the page that's kind of like do the decryption and so on and get the flows working with pulling the content and decrypting it just in the page it's okay they leave the key for now and it's fine and get the payment flow to work just get that working and I think you're gonna end up with a pretty good MVP and then you can worry about then making the decryption and the key harder to take away and so on harder as a second a second thing but just getting like the dot to work in a page either just in the browser or through an extension for potentially that that might be pretty good the other option is like if you really want to go you could go native as well right like if you you could you could make a make an app with either the space even from plate sleek or slate or other things like that where where you can go a full native app kind of flow that might be easier for for some of the content you want to store especially video might be easier that way it's supposed to because if you have to pull it and decrypt it and then show it that might be easier to do natively then then on the web if you do it on the web you you can't use most of the normal video traffic stuff because this stuff is encrypted right I think you might be fine they might they might have already figured that out but anyway it might be a little tricky so I don't I would imagine like that a lot of those pieces are there's some technical risk all over the place and just getting the getting the basics of it working before you expand out is gonna sort be well but cool idea don't fantastic thanks for the feedback there's actually really awful we'll discuss it in our next group call thank you anybody else have a quick comment on the project all right let's keep moving next step was Enoch here on the call don't see your name all right we're gonna move on Cindy with pony sure there's Cindy any takers okay keep going Lee you with ipfs scholar all these people registered but you lucky people will get to take their place all right next up we had cushy wah wah with building blocks Tek a rule sing same team are you here hey Shan woo there's somebody yeah finally so I thought I would be like I would be later but yeah then the second so hi everyone we are team as making a protest as censorship resistant web annotation service so the idea is coming from that we thought like nowadays anyone can comment on the web but most of the data is stored in a centralized way so it could easily be manipulated so our project currently is called public annotations Network so a provisions pen we'd like to solve this issue by so the current idea is that we would like to have a Chrome extension but maybe also other for all of browsing the future that allows users to annotate counter on the web so any web pages but for now we focus only on the Twitter to keep a focus so you just criticize annotations with their easier in address and publish them to the network under the back our back end or is directly on the network and the annotation content will be stored I pee Elvis reference to annotation content authors of the annotation will be storing in experience my contract registry so the content cannot be censored the future like more complete version will be like of course we want to build out the product for arbitrary web content of annotations also include an incentive Association system around publisher services so more like there will be publishers they would they can batch annotations and make submissions Scheepers for the users and we would like to hear feedbacks on general impression of the project also about the interface because now we want to use Twitter as the demo kicks and we like to hear like how do you think about this type this demo case also for the incentivize incentivizing systems we want to have two-way so users could either say cars and something annotation directly or and then we say now we have publishers where to use the badge but this is like the current design and we also are open for better ideal as well and a third point would be we currently we have basic API and web extension going so we would like to hear more suggestions about how we could deal with identity management so it's easier for us to unboard users yeah in short but if you have any questions yes one thing hi this is this is Dominic I'm also with a with a pan team so specifically regarding identity management and the system overall we're building on the verifiable claims standard by the w3c and specifically the extension of that for web annotations and I mean there's a lot of systems out there that are already building annotation systems but the only thing they really do well is polishing their product they don't really care about decentralizing storage and of building a censorship resistant solution so yeah it's a it's a free-for-all of potentially censoring researchers journalists or surfacing the content once it pops up we really want to remove that trust but as we build out the Chrome extension and kind of hijack the Twitter page to sneakily infiltrate their community we've noticed that we've gotten very used to using meta mask as an etherium focused developer team but meta mask is not really the peak of UX that you can achieve and we were wondering whether there's beyond meta mask any easier solution services such as three parts to kind of attach an identity to an annotation and and and basically sign it in a very easy straightforward way without having to worry about no generating and storing your public/private key pair and managing that and dealing with all the popups around that so any feedback of how any of you guys on the call would hypothetically want to use this or whether you have any ideas on how it would be a cool way to display that on Twitter would be greatly appreciated so just so we can polish this thing and make it as easy to use as possible because after all yeah yeah this yeah why don't we uh sorry it's already cut off stomach but we want to keep the pace going Jana you wanted to go first and then we'll have one yeah so I think you're on a great track sounds like a really fun project and I'm a big fan of the stuff that the three box team is working on for identity you might have also heard about ceramic which they're working on and that's adding a lot of features to what they kind of started with my identity around three IDs and you know it's I think programs in the state of the art there but still kind of using some skander's so so I think you're on the right track there and I think it would be great to get to a point where we really kind of have Network effects around these like decentralized identities we're kind of like Gravatar you know just every app just kind of pulls from that global pool of you know you already have a profile and it's a very kind of social web and I think the work they're doing there is great for that so I would take a look at that also I you know with the project called the graph not sure if you've heard of us but I could be a good fit for what you're building also since its using aetherium and ipfs and you're using like a registry model so you can build a subgraph which allows you to index all of that data from your registry and the data from ipfs and make all of that available over graph QL and that makes it really easy to query that data from the client so you might want to take a look at that we've got some bounties for the hackathon yeah I was gonna say a really really great a project idea the connotations are a really key part of the web that's that's been missing for a long time I think a lot of what do you mention makes makes a lot of sense a couple of comments one is you may want to you may want to try a hack with hypothesis where you replace kind of like the data store part and make that a thread or a bucket or three box there's like a three way to use I think three box threads that's kind of a couple identity with with within like you can store all the annotations there or something like that there's some question around like a shared shared group thing or kind of having a public you'd have to figure out like some way of doing kind of a public group because a lot of imitations you probably want to also share publicly but if you do that then the hypothesis part can handle a lot of the UX of how do you hook into all kinds of content and so on that's a huge problem and that team has been working on that for a long time and so maybe you know experiment with that and the and they kind of like really focus on hey it's really about putting the annotations in a different distribution model and tying them to to this decentralized identity set of things and I think that might be that might be pretty pretty promising it would also kind of give you a community right away to to to work with so but who knows maybe this money too too difficult to kind of wrap all together so maybe do it like a fast determination whether that makes sense or not ya know do my suggestion anybody else have any feedback for the team think enter oh yeah I do spell hypothesis it's like hypothesis is yeah I just want to say something here actually maybe not quite feedback on exactly what you're doing but this point of confusion I think that happens a lot around identity specifically and I have a thread I'll share a link to where I was sharing some I hear a lot of people going through the same motion so I thought maybe this would be a good venue to share this if a lot of people are approaching this problem and one way to understand it is that identity take secrets and if you have us if you want to own your identity you have to own a secret and secrets you can't store on a network there's no network in the world that stores secrets there's only two ways to store secrets that I know of one is you store well there's actually only one way to store secrets that I know of is you store them on real metal which means that you store a secret on your computer or you store a secret on your device and some really good solutions for that or wallets so local wallets do that for you they they let you put it in a place that has it on your device and some sort of sandbox way that that they're doing that so meta mask when it's storing things in your browser is essentially doing that you building a browser extension is cool because you can actually leverage some of the same abilities that you can't do if you just have a web app to keep secrets away from the rest of the browser sort of app space so that's a really good resource but the only other way to do that really is with api's so anything that's not storing your identity on on your own metal is actually just asking somebody else to store it on metal and you trust them to give you your secrets or sign something for you when you request it there's the only two ways that I know of to manage identity and there's a lot of really cool wrappers around that you need to point it to a couple of them things like magic and tourists have other cool ways of linking with OAuth and things like that too but just go with that framework when you're think nina budd identities identities take secrets secrets have to be on metal you have only a couple ways to get secrets on metal and it'll help you kind of think through what the restrictions are when you're building adapt to be decentralized and how you're gonna get users in there so anyway I just had to provide to vocalize that for people so that you don't get trapped in these sort of like dead ends I think anyway that's all very insightful I wrote it I wrote up a summary of what you had said feel free to add to it in the Google Doc cool up next we have Jose if you [Music] go ahead remember to keep it concise right sure yeah no first place thank you very much for the opportunity to to obtain feedback I think well my my project my question is kind of a recurrent topic I I have here different similar topics so I think it's also about identities so basically the project we are building is it's an application where every owner of every wallet every wallet ID can have an identity in ipfs right so the idea is that you you authenticate with your with your wallet and then you store your data in ipfs so that data will be encrypted in principle private it would be private so we want to generate a contract the provider governments to that to that data in the sense that if someone want to access to to the data of a different user they have to pay a small fee to obtain that that information so so basically it will be that is you you keep your profile in ipfs and everybody who want to access your profile they have to pay you a small fee so you are monetizing your data somehow so we would like to create a smart contract that applies to governance basically the governor the the contract will be will store a list of a mapping between bullet IDs and ipfs hashes I guess the the probably know the point I would like to get a bus is we want this a smart contract to be able to in create at the create that data obviously we thought the other uses being able to to access that data so so what we're going to do is enable this contract so either the data in the ipfs file is encrypted a candle can only be the clip by the contract or the ipfs has is itself is encrypted in when we store in the Indus mail contact do you understand where I am is that clear so I was wondering obviously we want to deploy this we were to produce this application in inflict hosting to have a full decentralized so I guess the question is how do you recommend to a store let's say the private key of the of the contract will be juice to in create and create all this data without with some level of security this is the kind of funny idea if you if you if you want to if your main question is about kind of how to model holding on to the key and so on I would probably use so in this key is a key theorem key that governs a smart contract and so on then I would follow the right the same rules for how to how to deal with those keys which is usually have an API for for meta masks or for other other while it's like that and then enable have the website just delegate the con the kind of decryption of stuff out of that key but but I think what you what you want to do is it's not quite have that key do it you want to generate a different key to do the encryption decryption and then take that key encrypt that but if with with own well the keys that you use for signing you probably shouldn't be using for encryption so there's a whole there might be something there around you may not actually be one wanted to use the same keys I think I understand what you're saying of mapping and identity to that but but I think there's a there's a different way of doing it which is you can generate a set of keys that can the maintain control to the information and then you update a mapping a pointer on on on the blockchain so for example you could do this with ENS today so you could say take all your content and put it on a bucket or in a thread or something like that and then take the root key of that and Mack ENS to that to that value and once you do that then whoever has the that account on e and whoever has that ENS name would then now be immediately able to access that data right and so you can for example polish your website to two ENS this way and then in terms of the public sorry there's a private data and so on that allows you to keep a different set of keys that that maintain that that infrastructure and so you would probably have to think about how you want to keep those keys and how you want to recover them and so on and kind of think about where to put that there might be that might fit in a wallet like for example you could think about you know hacking this for now and then saying hey maybe madam asked or things like that could extend to include data wallet decryption keys which are different from your from your from like your money wallet or you could think of other models for for storing certain keys I think Andrew might have other autochrome answer on this but ok no thanks thanks very much that makes a lot of sense I guess is yes kind of a chicken and egg problem no too heavily everything decentralized but at the same time keep the security appropriate level of security but yeah ok we can approach in that way for sure yeah go ahead Andrew yeah I just thought just because one tagged me a little bit there I'll just explain really quick in threads the way that does happen is more or less what one explained where you have an identity that signs all the transactions but the actual individual transactions themselves are encrypted by single-use symmetric keys so then when they're on IVFs they're secure the you know there are quantum quantum proof secure essentially but but then then they're peer-to-peer they're not because that key itself is encrypted you know it and that key is and that encryption is shared they're the key sorry that's then a key pair so the key plus the hash are encrypted with a key pair and that's shared with other people that have the read key and so that other people can read that content so it has a bit of that hierarchy built in to get around some of that mm-hmm okay thanks thanks very much for the feedback any final comments all right let's keep it moving real quick before we move on to the next one we just want to get a let's get a group photo it's not really gonna be a photo but we did this last week and it's a good way to mark the end of everything see Carson's already on top that he knows so throw on your videos for just half a second if you can and hit me with the two for week two and then we'll grab a screen shot tweet this out later throw up to week twos if you want I don't know whatever you want to do there we go we almost got a full screen all right that fireflies day I is taking up some real estate but this is good enough I'll take it awesome that's it picture taken Thanks okay next up Thomas I think I saw his name TJ TJ here not will keep going to submit Lavanya it is nice so basically from in Cadbury and I have a use dungeon with me on gold with the team he is also presently in the meeting so in what we are building is that we are actually trying to decentralized Google meeting or the zoom weekend so at the end of the hackathon we envision that we are we all are having this same meeting on our own decentralized platform so the way that we are approaching this problem is that so what we will do is that we will set up a demon in the browser that would be powered by life p2p life b2b web RTC and we would be having to access that is back camera and the audio now these output needs to be converted into HLS format so basically what we are doing is that we would be using FF m ez to convert into HLS format so basically a chalice format has lot of advantages so that it because of the pic traits and it was developed by id Apple so since F F MZ is bit computationally meant it's a bit it consume a bit computational power so we are thinking it to take it like a decentralized transcoding mechanism that we are thinking of and on the client side so this all of this information would be progress on the ipfs and all of the pinning and all of those IP NS system would be going under this amount and then on the client side we would be this IP NS has to be there and it would be rendered in that video via HLS player so this is the basic mechanism that we have come up for our decentralized Google meeting that we call as Cadbury meat now the blocker that we are trying to have is that the problem that we are facing is that the FF MZ output is not deterministic which means for the same video if two parties are processing the same video output would be different so this is the one of the problem that we are facing and the second is that how do we actually achieve decentralized transcoders so we realized that he for this actual to put this in place we would be requiring three layers also and we would be required account kind of decentralized transporters also and all of this business logic would be coded on the Italian smartphone trail so the transporters and all of them would actually list themselves on the Italian smart contracts and all of the business logic would authorize Jason authentication that would be handled by etherium smart contracts so the end the other thing that we have is the analytics so we cannot put Google Analytics in the website because it it does not go with the web 3 solution so we need to somehow come up so we will require the footprints that we are getting on the website so kind of any web 3 analytics that we have any decent less transcoding and the fmg path like how do we approach this computational task which is non deterministic in nature yeah so have you taken a look at the lot the live pure protocol yes we had looked into the life yet protocols so we had gained some inspiration from them also but we have some appears from the life care protocol also like we are considering their Olympia server also but we want to keep things simple istic so basically FF M G is something that we want to convert FF M G from to HLS format okay because I remember they did have to deal with the same determinism issues that you mentioned I forget how they actually got around it but in general I'm a fan of leveraging you know as much of other people's work as possible and you know I know they've got a really talented team they've been working on it for years it's built on top of PDP they released their streamflow version of their protocol recently which makes things a lot more scalable they now have these like orchestrators and already like a pretty big network of these transcoders so I think you know as much as possible this sounds like an amazing application that would be awesome you know I think we're spending so much more of our time on zoom and hangouts these days and you know there's definitely this like thing in the back here of mine it's like you know where are these videos ending up and you know who's who's got control over you know this data and you know would be a wonderful thing to have you know really more decentralized but I wonder if there is a way that you can you know leverage the existing work that's been done there yeah yeah I was gonna say the same thing I think that like your folks have done a phenomenal job with a ton of the sack there and so I would say yeah if you can if you can use the infrastructure they already have even though even though you might think about you know other things that could be improved and so on consider consider making extensions to their systems or adding pull requests and contributing to life here as an alternative because replicating that level of functionality and so on is non-trivial and they've also now a pretty significant you know they have like a pretty significant time potential in the in the in the network of parties that they've they can do that transcoding and so on right and all that's that's ready so I think definitely consider consider doing that and then could really focusing that your hack around around then okay great so if you use those systems as building blocks and tools then how do you get like the the UI and you make that a web app or something and you plug into the screen and then focus on all the challenges that come from actually doing the now you have these streams great now how do you how do you make that into a call right so I would I would probably do a couple dos and and I think you'll get more out of the out of the hack of actually making the product part of it then making the underlying infrastructure part of it because the the product part of it part of it is what's gonna what's gonna be like what's gonna give the whole thing legs and get it give it the ability to kind of start to use that application and so on and no question you could probably you know figure out improvements and so on and tuned to in the use and and went out but that can always come later right so like it you could either improve like spent spend you know the next few weeks replicating a lot of the stuff with life here folks have done or you can spend them using like here building something building that into a really good product and then and then deciding later whether you contribute improvements five here or or move off and build your own thing right right so John actually if we see we are actually complementing live protocol only so we had taken in consideration to use their lmps server and and all of those mechanics so we have some inspiration from like so Jiwon as we have mentioned it there could be some question that that might become blocker so can we connect over slack with you or the other team member that could help us out in the process yeah you should definitely leverage like there's a number of office hours and and you can just ask questions on SPAC about how to stuff with either Liberty P or with with any of the other other tools so yeah definitely ask your questions there and people should help unblock you and their number of us are kind of hosting office hours this weekend next week so you can you can check out those awesome awesome and one we already have our lending website up so it's all hosted on fleek and currently or basic UI is done the other thing that I wanted to ask is the how do we actually achieve a kind of web 3 analytics like the three google analytics yeah we say um that's a very interesting hard problem I would say that requires a whole kind of product product team focused on on making that a really good solution it is non-trivial it I definitely like would would very much support a group trying to go and tack that problem and building that that out because there are no good solutions out there there are some analytic systems that get better at this and they're approaching this but but not quite to the degree that I think everybody wants and so that's I would say like for now don't do that don't have analytics for now and then like leave it to a to a problem layer if you really need view counts and run up and consider do it consider having like a like a thread associated with do you have the streams and so on and then you take all the minute data and put it on a thread and and do that there right so you might run your own your own kind of view counts and whatnot associated with that with that piece of data that are your recommendation I think I probably have to move on to the next one but but really cool cool stuff and drop a link to to what you're building on the on the document and people will check it out more demos sure so thanks a lot thank you I think so Smith and the rest of your team is here it's in general I want to echo what one said this your first your first instinct should be if you ever have a problem put it into which ever slack channel you think is the best that's gonna be your first place to get resources get help from any other hackers or mentors or sponsors then if you still can't solve it like one mentioned off servers are the next best thing that's where you can really get technically deep into some of these problems with people so make sure to check them out we have a bunch more scheduled I'll be putting them up on the calendar tonight or tomorrow so keep an eye out for those next up is Rafael you his name is bold but he is not here all right guv I think Rafael is here but maybe maybe they look that way for a while it was good I had that connection shoo okay go ahead Rafael sorry and so I'm developing and the app and the infrastructure which interacts with ipfs for publishers and independent publishers and and they it intends to use linked data I was thinking of modeling ontology when you fetch data on ipfs it will help the rheumatologist away I'm kind of thinking if that would be a nice path or if I used I should try to use some tomorrow thing and the idea is basically that you could fetch data it would index data and you know to try to give power to people to search their interests and not be you know you have some search independence like some searching autonomy and one of the ideas is to keep uploading the ontology and make it public like mapping how this data is on ipfs and another thing that I'm why I've been developing that I thought is that is to use pub/sub from my PFS as a sort of RSS feed you see because I don't know it's kind of this way of sharing information lost some popularity and I don't know I thought that would be interesting to always that some some data's fans in this application it can I thought looks like your audio cut out I don't know if you're done talking we want to give feedback now or wait till it comes back maybe wait because you may not be able to listen yeah alright does do you want to present quick and then go back yeah I don't have too much to say so okay just to remind you guys my ideas building any recording layer on top of IP FS specifically IP LD now as of this week yeah so I have just a quick update and also some feedback I'd like so the first thing is I think maybe I'll share my screen it might be worth it without going too deep into it there's just we're gonna try to use the format dag service and then build on top of it that's what we're thinking as an approach so just add an encode and decode method which is going to add more nodes into the dag that's kind of what our ideas so first okay which one's thumbs up I think that's that answers my first question the second question which is perhaps a little bit more problematic is that so for reach Allman you have the standard kind of like various different paths of which like there are many serial paths of which like you know there's going to be like you're either gonna get the data blocks or not and if you're gonna if you get the data block if you don't get enough data blocks for path you can choose a different one you know that's kind of how it works but with alpha entanglements you have this kind of very cool dynamic structure where you know you can you can take a path and see how long it gets you and if you if you lose any blocks and then you can try two different paths and then kind of go there so the important like sort of problem that happens here is that you start you're gonna have to like go back a few steps if you if you get if you follow a path a certain length like to a certain degree and then you find that you're missing a block and then you if you're not able to reconstruct you gonna have to try a different path so you're gonna need some kind of history right like you're gonna know what your parent nodes are which is not something a dag by definition is supposed to do so our workaround for this right now is a known cache which is just like while you're going down these paths it's it's like just keeping a node of what nodes you you previous encounter in this path and it falls back to the previous one to try to find a different path in case you've gotta make counter a hitch um so I want to know if that is the best approach this is a kind of technical question and I learned that maybe this is a more office hour requesting like just like five minutes ago oh you know maybe that's something I should think about but I'm happy to think here you guys his thoughts gentle feedback in and on you know whether this is the right approach it sounds fine to me I think there's a difference between data structures and algorithms so I think you want to maintain the you know one directional you know a cichlid you know a cyclical nature of the dag but I think it's totally fine for an algorithm operating on the dag to maintain like history awesome yeah one thing that uh that ends up happening a lot with this kind of stuff is is think of also what you imagine imagine if you have just a web of documents that link to each other right and you're trying to model them in a in a in a hash linked graph in reality you have two graphs you have 1 graph which is the graph of documents talking to each other linking each other and then the other thing is the the projection of that graph into into into a version history right of of how things kind of came to be in that if you hash like everything you're probably gonna have versions of these documents at different points in time linking to each other right and then and then the links might include kind of like a mutable link that that where you ideally I'm trying to link one page to another page and and link to the latest version of the page and you might take a snapshot as well in in that link you might have a reference that points to both the mutable name and the and an immutable copy so you so the whole thing always works right and so similar to that model of saying hey here's how you kind of implement a mutable graph on top of an immutable graph here where the racial coding you might want to you might want to consider something like that where you think about the links between the wheaty and the objects being had about potentially outside of the object so you have the actual encodings and so on and then you have many other nodes that are the nose that are linking them together right so instead of putting the link within that one object pointing to the next one and so that way you can model your pathways in another set of objects that are very small because they're just links and then the the so I'm just carrying the data are the larger ones that have the yeah how different is that from my current approach which is just adding this into like a special modified dag I didn't quite understand that um sorry it probably depends on sorry can you repeat the have the modified dag maybe it may miss the Akito there could you repeat the exact like the in structure that you're thinking of Pacific links like what what object will link to one so it's a dag service sorry yes so it takes a dag service and then it adds an encode and decode method and the encode method takes all the links in your in your in your dag and then it creates redundancies for all those links oh yeah so I think it's more sorry got more the UH blah blah question which is okay given given that you are adding redundant links to other other potential blocks yeah you you might so kind of even even without so if you have a very large tag right so if you if you have say a dag that's a gigabyte large and you have a lot of little chunks or whatever you may want to raise your code that differently meaning like you you may not just want to have two completely different copies you might want to be doing a racial coding of subsets so you might still want to you might want to transform that uh narrator like non Ares are coded copy into an arrays record copy a single other one and then that one might have might have all of the links to the actual blocks and and that's where I'm saying like you might want to have multiple multiple links this might be good this might be a good topic for office hours I have some next week so you can sign up for those and and we can not go in detail if you if you gonna write up what you have right now and and send it ahead of time but I can I can definitely do it and give some more your some like better better incoming cool where should I send it to you can so when you sign up you should be able to even thing else like actually just just send me a message on the packet slap got it thank you okay thanks Jeff next up let's get Adam he is around still I guess yeah so we missed the hack or the feedback session last week so we're kind of looking for general food vegetables like answers to like a couple those are questions we have but basically the the thing that we're trying to build is sort of like an incentivization system for training machine learning models so the idea would be that like you're somebody who has data but you don't have the expertise to train a model to use that data so what you can do is upload that data to ipfs basically and submit to a smart contracts sort of like a request for training where you say like here's the location of our of our training data here's the location of sort of like the data to evaluate the model against here's like the definition of I guess like what what like accuracy measurement we're looking at kind of thing or like what function you want to evaluate all those things will sort of be like submitted beforehand so that everybody can like see and like kind of audit them and then once the sorry and then you like stake a certain amount of money that's sort of like the prize money I guess for the training each person that then wants to participate can train a model on their like sort of off chain whatever computation system upload that model somewhere to ipfs ideally in some format that's sort of like standard like tensorflow I guess and then basically like register their submission in the like incentivization contract and then at the end of this sort of time period that we have like specified here the idea would be that like each of those models can somehow be trust lessly verified against the initial like accuracy function that was submitted at the start of the whole thing so you can kind of like rank all the models that were submitted in order of like how well they perform against the like initial problem specification and then we kind of want to have it so that it like rewards every participant in the system with a proportional proportional reward depending on how effective their model is so basically you don't you don't like shut anybody out from like doing work and not getting paid for it everybody gets like something but obviously the person who has the best model gets the most so like the - I guess like well other than just like general feedback for that I'm the tooth like main things that we're looking for here are like what would be sort of like a good way to trust lessly verify the model like evaluation a couple things we were thinking so far as sort of like like an Oracle that has like a compute function because we found one of those but that doesn't seem like the best option the other thing we're thinking is potentially something kind of like state channels or you establish like direct peer-to-peer connections and then everybody that's submitted a model kind of like gets like handshake I'm like what they think they're like models outcome is and then agree on the accuracy I don't know if that's good then the other thing is we are worried about the idea of people being able to like submit multiple models with very similar accuracies and like claim a larger portion of the pie so how do you prevent that kind of I guess like attack from happening so yeah maybe something is more knowledge can correct me but Houston was just an uber I so doing some sort of training as well aren't they we're like a bets market on models anybody I'll drop a link yeah yeah it's kind of similar and related bit different in that in those you can submit yeah that's more around kind of aggregating the models into like a larger metamodel that then it's gonna be like doing trading on top of all that data and I think this is kind of a more general more general like provide models to train any against anything like the requester is asking before here's my problem here's my data like solve it and I'm gonna reward proportionately all the people that gave a solution and so I think I think relating I think you're gonna be able to kind of look at a lot of what Nomura has done as a as a good a good a good example to follow the it's a really cool idea by the way I think this is really awesome especially if you think of all the primitives there that you're making along the way you might there might be other ways of using that stuff around being able to register a model in the data there might be a whole bunch of other applications around that use case still encourage you to like you know just build that one app first and get it working on line to end but as you're making the the things just the idea of just registering some data and some like target goal around a model like that might end up building out some building blocks and else once used for Cynthia something also consider that making that into a library or something yeah I think like the promise for interesting in terms of the verification I just wouldn't do that yeah I would just run the verification and some trusted thing for now and then later what you can do is you can think about parties that are verifiers taking some some resources against good verification so they work for they like run the computation and they they measure how how much it took and so on and then anybody can anybody can go and challenge that that like expectation like if it's way too off in terms of because because what you can do with that verify your cloud is the model is known so that so nobody cares about privacy in this case right you just want to run the function and evaluate that it wasn't correctly so you have a set of bear fires that are staking some money for them doing the work correctly they go and verify these they go and run this and submit a some submit a result and then if anybody wants to challenge them they can challenge them and show that it actually was a different result and then they maybe take the fee instead and so like you immediately create a network of parties that are just challenging each other and like that's fine and then additionally like you may want to pay proportional to resources and there you also want maybe a little bit of a you want to also kind of challenge the the count counting their original sis because people might lie they might give you the correct result when they might be inflating the resources used and so that might be a factor factor as well but I would I would probably defer all of that until after you have the rest of the thing working because for now you can just run a server and then later you you you a decentralize it Google thanks we'll definitely look at all that stuff I have to jump but I keep going and good luck this one all right yeah if anybody else has comments for Andrew we're sorry Adam if now we can move on let's keep the party going and mall you're up next yeah I guess so yeah we have been building on ceramic metal so say I'm current you too dear supports identity but what we have been trying to do is add variable verifiable credential support on top of ceramic so what you're targeting is we create a new table type with ceramic ash which is called that in Firebug credential and that can be you know linked to get the values yeah didn't see the 3id bit ceramic supports today and then I think the general idea of ceramic itself is you know the link that link multiple documents on the identity the tree i that they have and so that you know you can have a chain of graphs of the identifiers and then have various set of claims that that person holds and you know and any services who use three a ceramic can present those into anybody so this is the idea and then what we are present as in targeting is you know address the revocable part of that verifiable credential so current approach that means suggested quite a few scientists it's where you know you either maintain a revocable registry or either issue another revocable credential status something and that that general requires issuer to have you know another look up either in the issuer or at the revocable registry and we are trying to approach that in a different way because ceramic documents are generally you know the immutable they are just a link of all the records so you can maintain the state of the claim itself and use the hash of big name so that next time the big issue or has revoked the claim the issuer sorry the very fiber can check the network what is the latest status of the tail so yeah these are the two key challenges that we are targeting and then as you see as in lots of us that has been building around SSI and I think this this would complement lot of services that are building on top of ceramic yeah happy to see it packet search well are you building a specific application kind of on top of this is this like for doing like wat style claims or what's what's the you're not building an app Brad there are the credentials and you build a cadential but the credentials will be stored as a document on in ceramic and that will be linked to the the identity that you want to link into so that you can have a chain of graph that that the person holds all the identity and all the claims that a person has and so any any can resolve those claims and you can present this claims in the network itself so like now ceramic itself can support verifiable claims yeah that's the idea yeah what sort of projects are you looking at for president ox I know there's been many many identity projects in the space so which ones have you considered or using his reference the diag the standard theory George Bailey table credential yeah that's the it supports which supports a third beauty and then yeah we'll be using that as a library rather and then add support for 3id right now the interesting part is the document support for ceramic and whatever they will standard of linking of documents that ceramic has and then linking with various profiles the old tea structure which ceramic natively has and if you add a support for variable potential making a lot of services on top of that yeah anybody else will definitely have to get some some identity focused people on some of these next calls actually I think I think ceramic is a workshop next week so once that's definitely come to it it's it sounds like it like an awesome hack I would just think about what type of app you could build on top just to showcase it might make it easier for for people yeah with it and use it if there's a good like demo app sure yeah we have applying and trying to do that as a side project we'll try to keep that in mind thank you mm-hmm all right it looks like we actually hit everybody on the list Raphael this your connection improved at all so he can come back to what you were working on if not maybe we can I can try and give you some text feedback in the slack just to and a comment the the application I actually was trying to build on MDF breath or ontology you see and to map that data and the idea was took took where to some apt they're the hairs of the of the files and it's basically it so if I don't know if this would be interesting architecture for this for this context I believe it's really experimental or if I should like try to follow some more modern ways to think because I don't know actually this way of using an RDF then ontologies you drop that again Raphael damn well I guess we'll see if he if he comes back is there anybody else who did not register ahead of time but it's on the call and would like to give us a quick pitch forward they're working on give me a wave raise your hand and zoom whatever works drop it in the chat yeah go ahead still water garden I'm unmuting you if you can see that but you have to accept the unmute that way yep you have no idea how difficult this all is for me you're doing great I haven't dead this much homework in 50 years if that tells you anything and while I'm at it hi Andrew I'm the oddball of the group so I might as well let you know that and I'm not working on a an app or a program because I've never done that before all I know is I have been involved with listening to and reading information with regards to the decentralized web ipfs especially textile and now I'm learning more about a lot more of you who are involved in this entire trip and I'm actually developing something that I have never done before along with a lot of other things and it's a blog with regards to the formation of the decentralized web and how it's being developed and it's for the basically the general public because I've noticed that in most of the information it's all geared to the vet to the developers and I think you want to get on board more of the general public to make this a really accepted network to utilize and possibly to involve it can be more older people or even younger people to get into the field and get on board I think this is an excellent Avenue for the networks to go and I'll see what happens because as I said I've had to go back through a lot of history to remember what Andy told me five years ago that's how I got into this and that's about all awesome yeah we're very happy to have you I just I understand your project is you're gonna write a blog and the past few weeks there's been a ton of information and workshop so what's your strategy for taking in this massive amount of info how do you how do you plan to you know I I've had to keep notes and look at the videos a lot as I said this is a lot of information after having not been involved in basically being a student in 50 years as my so as my project is called 73 and web 3 that is because I am 73 but I also have a slight problem in that I am also legally blind in the whole process as I've told my helper I have never law I've never done anything with writing any code or anything and I am actually trying to learn how to do a little bit so that in the process of the blog I can have a section about what end is entailed in putting all this information together because I don't think that people my age who have never been involved in in computer programming really have an idea of how its set up and then where is this going to go in the future I think the idea of a decentralized web which is secure is a great place to have applications that have to do with storage for medical information and that is then safe and secure definitely a big problem or a big challenge let's say if you do I guess if you do end up putting up putting together your outline feel free to send it to me or any of the youth global team members will be happy to kind of check it out and give you feedback on your craft as it goes through and you know welcome to the community you know I think you know we really do need to be reaching you know the the whole world and so I think it's great to have people telling the story that aren't you know necessarily you know nerds and Geeks you know just you know focus on the technology and you know I think it is a really interesting time you know that the ideas behind you know the decentralized web I think I've kind of been out for for a while and there's kind of a rich history there and I think kind of the combination of that with blockchains is is you know kind of new and and and you know I think we need to to somehow communicate to a broader audience the benefits to them and to the extent that we can do that and I think you know really applies both for private data and kind of for public coordination you know so like you said with private data whether it's medical records or other things that you have control over your own identity data and reputation but that's something that you know hopefully at some point people realize is important and they can start wanting that as well as just how we coordinate you know resources and collaborating and trying to you know collaborate on on you know be more more effective as a society that you know having the neutral you know platform and and foundation for our information systems I can really help with that so yeah thanks for diving in and we're going to tell the story okay I'll keep trying it's not easy I've read back some of the initial information they came out on the IPF and everything was all speculative and this is maybe what we're going to do and I have I'm rather surprised at how much is actually the way it is going and being a secure form of of working over the web yeah a lot of the folks on this collar you know really working to make vision a reality imagine what it's going to be in another 10 years you guys are all going to be part of it it's too far it's too we can't think that far ahead well do well thank you yeah I was just gonna say well again feel free to DM me with any driver anything you're working on questions because like I said there's been quite a few workshops and a ton of content coming out of all this thanks for sharing them appreciate it all right it looks like we've got about 15 minutes left with this session and I don't think anybody else has added their name to the sheet [Music] if there's anybody else here in the session who would like to present and you know share what they've been working on to get feedback we've still got a few wonderful experts with us the textile team and any of our hanging around for a few minutes more so this is your chance - all right I saw graven your your week - fingers yeah yeah no questions we stopped by Juan's office hours and the textile guys and helping out Cody we're working on the Geo web project I guess we did decide on we're gonna kind of have two demos one what's which is more spatial in nature it's going to be our land parcels will have the covin policy and mask-wearing policy for all the land as you move around so Cody's going to build a Apple watch complication and a so as you walk up to a restaurant you'll be able to quickly see do I need a mask or not just kind of I mean small easy text based just trying to keep it really simple there and then Juan had some good feedback about trying to build some more desktop like demonstrations be able to have like the Google Earth view of our land parcels and people still be able to interact with information and link information that way so no questions always open to feedback though and rewarded week three well awesome [Music] anybody else because uh Phil yeah I just come on to the cool quite late so I could show a bit of what I'm doing so I'm trying to do like a lyrics sharing application so the idea is that you have a mobile phone and it would display the same lyrics across lots of mobile phones at the same time and I'm trying to create ways that groups groups can share a database of songs so I'm going to be using I think textile spaces for that and then I've been using three box for for the use of stuff and I've just really been enjoying the three box stuff like the there's so much there that makes me really like there that there are applications that have thought about doing with the centralized web and when I look into the three box stuff it's like oh this does nearly everything I need to do for something I thought would take me like a year if I was going to do it but it's just a fitter and not do it this hackathon but maybe the next one or something like that you know and yeah and then I've gone into I've been taking notes so I just joined hearing somebody sort of talking about doing blogs and things like that I just studied using foam which is a editor that you can run in visual studio and allows you take notes and markdown and kind of link them all together first time I've used it but I found it to be hugely useful in hack FS just because there's like a hundred new things that I'm learning and that ability to actually have this like graph of notes so so far in my coding life I've always had a notebook there and every day I'm starting a new page but the notes are never kept connected together so whatever isn't you know left at the end of one day is sort of discarded whereas this is now allowing me to kind of build a graph of knowledge and things like that so yeah cool yeah you want to drop a link if if there is a link to it in the chat I'm sure other people might find it useful you're affirming to a realm yeah so it's basically like a it's based on Rome and it's it basically runs in visual studio so I've not used Rome but it's it's it's inspired by Rome and then you know I it's quite nice because you get the kind of visual studio completions github markdown and I don't know what you get in Rome because of no use deficit modeled on that model yeah well do you want to talk at all about your project yeah I can maybe locations I can maybe show you never I've got anything to if I do a screen share I might be able to show you some stuff that I've got I'm sort of dropping in slightly unprepared but hang on let's see I've got a thousand chrome windows open okay I found something here okay let me just bring up a screen share okay can you see a screen here this is just me trying to sort out the network kind of stuff so this is kind of three boxy things so what I'm trying to do here is like however I've got a bunch of song databases and I want them to be editable by a group of people and so what I'm using here is a space within three books and this is allowing me to kind of add key value pairs in here and what these key value pairs will be in the end is like a database ID and then a sort of private key for editing that data or something like that and so that way each database will have its own kind of I guess a theory in a dress as an ID or something like that and then that address will be shared between multiple users so that a subgroup of users can effectively have read right yeah right access and read access to a particular database so that's me just adding keys in here and this is the channels so basically one of the things I'm trying to do is have it so that each each user can have many channels basically and a channel is basically a group of users who are all listening to the same lyric stream and I've been adapting three boxes ghost threads so the ghost threads with my lyrics stuff basically you will send a song and then you'll send a series of updates and each update will be which verse you're looking at so you get its you know behind the scenes it's using the IP FS pub/sub or Lib PT pub/sub which the ghost threads kind of have and the ghost threads don't they don't hit the disk anywhere they only are in memory and so when you connect it gives you the last 20 messages and then it adds in other messages as they come in and so that's kind of what I need for my application so I've got an idea of like having key frames and then Delta frames and so a key frame is when you send a new song and then the deltas are what come is basically looking at verse war and are looking at verse two or something like that so you're not sending the whole my rendering thing basically needs to see the whole song so that it can decide how big to render the text so this would you could use it for kind of slideshows and things like that so that you could have the slide coming in in a big chunk and then lots of little chunks which are just like bullet points being revealed or something like that then I've been creating the kind of sharing mechanism for how you send these via URL I got a bit bogged down doing the three box stuff because the the Refresh was quite slow because every time you reload the page you sort of have to earth again which means that it got quite cumbersome as I was trying to do there the kind of making it look a bit better so you know so this is it kind of authenticating at the moment it has to authenticate for each space that it opens so you can see it takes about 20 seconds at the moment for it to like get hold of the data and this is on a desktop it's still not come in yet when I've refreshed at the moment here so it sort of takes a while to to authenticate so I've been working through the kind of visual flow of things and so this is how it's gonna look visually let's see so we go in here so I've just gone into code sandbox which is good for sort of prototyping so I'm doing the UI in here so the idea would be that you'd drop into the front page of the app you've got a choice of using remote control or just dropping into an existing session which you'd normally do by just receiving a link I've got this kind of QR code page you've been doing which you can this is the format of the links that you'll get which basically has a just a question Phil who do you see this being useful to or what what sort of users do you imagine this this being built for we have in mind it's sort of it's partly yeah you know for me I'd like to use it for outdoor kind of singing things like maybe Carol singing or something like that but also I can see it being used like in general outdoor things basically so anywhere that you wouldn't want to have things that you'd normally do with a projector and lyrics or something like that but it allows you to do the whole thing in a mobile way you know rather than being indoors so it's particularly kind of interesting with kovat because like churches are not allowed in their buildings and they're not allowed to sing at the moment so it means that you can potentially be more widely spaced in those kind of things so yeah okay I don't want to cut you off but we don't want to get too deep into [Laughter] yeah but it looks very interesting I'm looking forward to poking around the day if you have a demo at some point yeah I mean so what's really kind of exciting for me is that I've I've been trying to I've had it like a centralized version of this before and now I'm trying to you know it always meant that if I was gonna scale it it wouldn't work because I'd end up paying so much for hosting and all these kind of things you know or I'd have to take more responsibility than I want to and by doing it p2p it means that you can scale it big and how about free which is what I want it to be you know so yeah any any thoughts from our panel it's a super cool app and I think that kind of like live syncing could probably be useful for a lot of different types of apps I guess I chose things like that what what were you thinking about just kind of like advertising I mean I guess there's like if you have the QR code or kind of send a link yeah so yeah you can't put the link in it and then do people discover it over a DHT or um I want it like eventually I'd like to have it as being very private you know or a way of having it quite private obviously with ipfs it seems like you know that they you can probably pick up all the nodes which and get all the IPS of people is that right have its live p2p so there's lots of countries where there's persecution for the church and things like that where you know people are trying to you know find out who the christians are and lock them up you know and it would be nice to have something that was enabled a private group which would maybe be going down the whisper direction but also the other thing is just like you know yes I do want to it just bread and be used and in terms of discovery what I'm you know start off with email there's a there's a social sharing API which has just come into Chrome which I'm using and that means that you can bring up a you can bring up share buttons in chrome just sort of natively I'm not sure I've got this on my phone at the moment but move to save it for another time yeah so I was thinking in terms of sharing that you can have like an after event thing so if people join the event through having seen a QR code you can then send out a message to those people saying do you want to be invited to the next thing basically you know and that way people who see it used outside can then start their own groups basically so that's the kind of cool yeah really awesome out all right I think we can call it there it's thank you for Jenny Phil I can echo Jana there again very cool app let's see there's a few last-minute logistic things logistics that have to include as you probably experienced today was or this week was the first time we had a check-in so if you haven't done your chickens yet please make sure to go into your hacker dashboard and click leave that we're gonna be doing these every week until the hackathon is over and it's prerequisite for getting your stake back so we just want to make sure people are continuing to regularly make things and surfacing any issues that they have Andrew Karsen I know you guys released you had some sort of release last week specifically for hacker fests you want to talk about that really quick for a few seconds yeah sure I mentioned on our I don't recall was our office hours recorded or not this week I guess it was yes it was okay yeah so you can go back to that too but just a real quick thing is we had we had two releases one was any teams that are developing on the power gate if you are trying to run versions of your application against test net we have a hosted instance of that that you can use see you can actually see a announcement of those hosted instances our blog and get details just add your information and we'll try to onboard teams to get access to that if you need it for your hack the other thing was the buckets API we have experimental version of that that is already connected to a power gate so that you can create buckets and then run archive end point basically archive commands on the buckets and those will create deals on file coin and so you can do that so all our production API is in all our production documentation plus bucket archiving commands and that's that's available through a version of the hub that we only have available for hackers called hub next and I pinned the I pinned on our support channel in slack I pinned the details about using that if you want to if you want to make use of that awesome perfect summary if you're using any of the textile teams tools or products you have got to go check that out because it seems like a really powerful tool alright this is the end of week 2 I hope everybody has been having a good time so far it's almost halfway through the hackathon that all that will occur sometime next week but time keeps moving and you all are keep building which is really awesome to see and we're looking forward to the kickoff of week 3 on Monday again there's gonna be a bunch of office hours and a few more sessions workshops next week so keep an eye out for that we'll send an email either Sunday night or Monday with a list of all that so thank you everybody for sticking around and showing up really appreciate it especially to enter in Carson for empty Kenneth but he dropped out thank you again we'll see everybody in slack next week Cheers having a friend see it
