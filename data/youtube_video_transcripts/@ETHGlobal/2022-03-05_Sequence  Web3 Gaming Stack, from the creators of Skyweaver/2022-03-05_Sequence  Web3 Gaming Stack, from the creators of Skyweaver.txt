awesome okay i think we should have pretty much everyone coming in maybe give it like two more seconds so yeah okay um welcome everyone uh thanks for coming to this workshop um we have peter here from sequence which is super exciting um we will let him take it away in just two seconds but um just wanted to note uh we'll do q a at the end so feel free to just throw all your questions into the chat and stick around so we can get those answered at the end of the session and yeah pewder feel free to start whenever you'd like awesome thank you very much everyone for spending your saturday afternoon with me it's fun to do this live on ethglobal so thanks for hosting us um yeah my name is peter kaltika i'm the co-founder and ceo of company called horizon and uh today i'm going to be sharing with you an open web3 gaming stack we built for ethereum during the creation of skyweaver and it kind of emerged the the platform sequence um so interestingly a horizon for some of you who may or may not know we actually were established back in 2017 um really to kind of for the purpose of exploring and adventuring through web3 and to do something really cool and creative and make a video game the video game we wanted to make was sky weaver a trading card game where you can actually the actual cards themselves are virtual assets on chain and you can trade them and do all sorts of cool stuff with it as we you know we want to make this a product for normal people and normal gamers as i'm sure you know other builders here on the call are looking to do the very same thing right how do you make how to use this crazy web through technology with uh in traditional video games and what does it mean and what changes um and actually is a whole lot right when we started back in 2017 the primitive is really raw low level primitives really so we had to build everything from scratch and that was really cool because it helped build a lot of wonderful intuitions for us and a lot of learnings that we're really excited to share with you uh with sequence so hopefully you guys can get some great use out of that but you know something that really inspires us kind of a beacon of that that we focus on is looking at this this new dimension of gaming right web 3 kind of in this era emerging something entirely new where you know you have digital worlds but they now have these physical like world properties right you have the ownership and you know how you can kind of gamify all these it's like you know something that's digital but feels real and tangible and you have this deep crazy connection with this controller but it's it's really taking you to this new place so it's something that's really inspired inspiring us this is actually a pretty cool piece of artwork uh that we actually had commissioned back in 2018 early 2018 for us to kind of you know convey convey this imagery and just this the you know the the potency of this connection and experience and as we all kind of know um you know it's you know video games are huge they've had virtual items for decades but the real question of course is well what does blockchain do that's new what can you do that's new and what changes that's really important to consider because it's really a big factor in what you actually design and how you construct things right so that's we're gonna be talking about all sorts of stuff today um kind of the foundational you know again on a primitive level what's what's interesting what's new is the idea of open and standardized protocols for virtual assets or virtual items right which enables open economies and networks that's you know thank you to ethereum for for providing that to us um we can think of it like the web you know the world wide web and that's why i really references web3 because it's really you know open protocols that are standardized that are really belong to no one um that are just widely adopted and you know create interoperability of and users and suddenly you get these networks that kind of connect together and uh do more cool things right open tools into you know open economies of things moving across and having you know better connections between them you know one one one economy kind of exiting and or liquidating and moving to another economy or you know a token item that you create in your contract suddenly can be rendered on a completely different property that you never can talk to or a marketplace suddenly you have a token contract and it can be traded on all the marketplaces right um really cool stuff right um the developer tools that exist even the ones i'll share with you today really are the developer tools that we've kind of built on you know to connect with um the other the ecosystem at large but of course you can bring your own tools as well bring it's it's all all standardized these are the wonderful things around open protocols as we kind of know them on the web so but of course you know so we have these new open systems and from a gaming economy perspective you know traditional video games a lot of these gaming economies are closed economies they're just like this kind of weld garden with proprietary systems and representation of virtual items and no marketplaces whatsoever um so when you start saying hey now you can own you can trade it refer to a player it really offers some really interesting benefits it offers a whole new set of player incentives in that video game in the way they kind of behave right changes kind of the uh the economic and the social behavior and for developer it creates an entirely new ability and new monetization possibilities new ways that you can monetize your your platform and your content which is really cool and how these things kind of again some of the tools or the the properties that come out of this um are things like ownership trade right so you can own an item you can trade an item and you have the interoperability of markets which is really really a powerful idea right where again you could many different markets can actually host that uh your virtual good you can have you know gamification concepts and constructions like play to earn you can have you know really interesting co-creation and mod i think you know capabilities of again given that these are open kind of a virtual item represented as a data structure that's that's an you know an open of an open format you know that people kind of co-collaborating to build something and kind of a shared network there's all these crazy possibilities i think you know we haven't yet to even scratch the surface it doesn't ecosystem there's a lot more talk about like things like guild dows which are kind of interesting where the community you know as stakeholders that are influencing different parts of um the ecosystem but also really quite fascinating so these are all possible and and more as i'm sure we will we all kind of discover as adventurers in this in this new dimension of web3 gaming and what's really possible and so you know coming to this this workshop and even for us back in 2017 it's like well we got this really primitive you know state machine blockchain low-level slow database that's expensive how do you go from that to making full-fledged you know video game experiences that you know is used by millions of people that everyone understands and increases open economies and this is this is of course the the challenge so kind of looking now today this is what we've ended up creating right this is this is what from all of your ideas and all the work this is kind of you know through the things i'm what i'm going to show you today is actually a lot of the internals of sky weaver especially from the block the blockchain architecture of it um and this is kind of the end result um so yeah you can go to actually skyleaver.net www dot government you can play right in your web browser you can play on a you know windows mac linux iphone on your ipad across all the you know platforms free to play really cool it's a trading card game kind of like a magic and like a hearthstone and i'll talk a bit more about it but yeah these are some screenshots and uh yeah so this is kind of in the the player menu when you're switching your game modes this is the actual gameplay so as you can imagine we have uh these actual cards are like physical cards but they're on chain so uh they're digital and you can own them and you can trade them with another we have up to 510 different cars it's the gameplay is actually a one versus one multiplayer tournament strategy video game so you know you're going to divide you're having to assemble a deck of around 30 cards and you battle the opponent whoever kind of takes the hero down you win right and again there's this interesting kind of economic like leaderboard and reward system that really you're not going to cover today it's kind of a different aspect of the sky river economy we're going to talk a little bit more about the architecture to construct these video games that you know you can be played but it's really really wonderful game and really proud of all the crazy work we did and it's been awesome it's been it's been a fun ride and it's you know still tons of wonderful uh things in the future that we're going to be evolving this game um and yeah this is a marketplace that's built into sky weaver so obviously part of an open economy is you know the crux of an economy the ability to trade so it's very important that the experience for you know especially for a trading card game right um how can you trade cards without you know a market to do so um and you can imagine there are in in markets or video games such as sky weaver you can have you know there's different demand for different cards some are more sought after than others and there's different prices for some of these and there might even be a varying supply of them you know emerging at a variety of different properties but what's really important in any case is the idea of you know buying and selling these assets for gamers should be easy such that they can trade these things quite quite quickly this is just for fun i wanted to show you guys what skyway recovery page used to look like back in 2018 and uh this is actually what the game looked like back in 2018 and now you know what the game looks like and it's even only even i saw some of the animations the team was showing me yesterday is super crazy and cool like shocking um so again back from you know thinking of 2017 when we had started this project um you know back in my kitchen table five of us you know uh in toronto and by the way now we're 45 people across 14 countries or 15 countries um what we wanted to set out to do you know was make our lives extremely difficult right we wanted to like really make our lives really hard for four years right because we wanted to build something really innovative something never done before and we wanted to do it right right so quite simply we wanted to build a video game that's powered by blockchain that our friends could enjoy right our friends who are not blockchain or computer scientists and they can have a great experience uh playing sky weaver um and of course no knowledge required and we all we wanted to make it free to play we didn't want to have anyone to require having ethereum or some kind of token um in order to be able to onboard into the video game like it's just again the same the same purity of what you've been experiencing expect in a video game but with blockchain kind of components with open you know standards and economies and things like this so you get to own your virtual items you can own publicly you can open you know trade openly on different public blockchain networks whatever those may be um in fact you know it's interesting like the idea of a virtual good can be decoupled from the blockchain network and of itself right very much so um which is kind of more crazy meta stuff but it's it's where it is um and of course we want to again have an economy that's built entirely open protocols and centers i keep going back to that we wanted very early on by february of 2018 um because we really went full hog on this january 2018 but 2017 was the the kind of the conception of the whole thing um and by february we realized very quickly you know we needed a really good wallet experience that that a gamer could be familiar with and use this is kind of part and parcel of being able to access these virtual worlds and of course we don't you just have to again back to you don't need you don't have to worry about gas because these are huge friction points it's not what you know my friends who are not computer scientists could do it's not a thing um and they could do it but it's again it's uh you know you get the point um what's also really important with these systems is to stay compliant with laws and regulations right i think you know having a really fair economy that's really thoughtful it doesn't isn't predatory in its design um doesn't exploit users um because of a lack of knowledge or some kind of you know a trick of a system again and also being a non-custodial of a non-custodial design is also really important right that's any so all these many many different factors it was obviously extremely important for us to operate extremely high integrity such that we would be very compliant with regulations and laws because we saw this for the long term this wasn't this wasn't us it's for the reason why after four years we've never actually done a pre mine or an ico or any of the sword or selling booster packs or anything like this because again it fundamentally didn't agree with with with our vision for what we we wanted to do we wanted to do something pure and better um of course you know looking at you know similar to your video games i mean i'd urge you to stay compliant it's a good idea um but you know what's you know back to you know and build really robust economies that are really thoughtful to users because again that's that's going to serve you very well and pay dividends in the future um but yeah back to kind of like when you're thinking of a video game what belongs on chain what belongs off chain right clearly we knew we wanted to put these assets on chain that was all kind of part and parcel of it and we knew the gameplay was it's not realistic for it to be launched and it doesn't make any sense so option this gamepl kind of the high level macro view of the sky weaver architecture some of the internals this this kind of summarizes on the left hand side in the gray you can see api web app game game state matchmakers game servers mobile app desktop app these are kind of things that would be you know it could be similar properties to your video any video game that you're creating you have a back and you have a front and you have a video game you have games we'll say that for another time really cool stuff and on the right hand side these are properties that relates to kind of the the blockchain components that are integrated into c into sky weaver so of course we have 1155 to open the contract how you actually represent your goods on chain we have the marketplace which is important we use a set of you know because we're built on a theory and we have ether.js and sequentials and how we interface uh with the ethereum compatible networks we have go sequence which we like to write our servers and go so when we are interfacing we have to have the client library to you know communicate and go we are in fact deployed on the polygon network which is really cool because it's an ethereum compatible network so we only have that we have a sequence of transaction relay it lets us do really fancy stuff around you know gas abstraction and simplifies a lot of gas interactions and firing for getting transactions and worrying about finality and all these cool things so we're not aggression to talk about but there's i will just say that there's another talk i gave called road to web3 building seamless user experiences for web 3. and i would you know recommend you guys check that out um it goes really deep into like sequence wallet and stuff so it touches on a bunch more things and of course we have our docs we'll recover um the other big component of you know again back to the blockchain stuff is the sequence indirect metadata of course you have these assets on chain but how do you query the blockchain such that it's an efficient way so you can understand what's kind of happening inside of there and of course back to the sequence wall that you need or a wallet in general of course you need a wallet to be able to access for users to be able to access these systems um in an easy way so these are this is kind of it and so we're going to be focusing on the blockchain components because the left-hand side could be really anything in the case of sky weaver it is an html5 based video game um you can check out our github you know slash horizon dash games that's a verizon one we also have github.com 0x sequence which is the kind of open you know sequence stack of other things we kind of like to split them up but we like to we when we designed sky weaver we were extremely intentional because we saw this great opportunity you know so we do love open source i do a lot personally a lot of our team does we you know we take it as a great honor to be able to contribute some of the ecosystem and push it forward and innovate uh do something really fun so we were we saw that opportunity back in 2018 we're very intentional about all of these design things to say you know what we're gonna make sure we separate these things so that you know skype is really a consumer as a third-party consequence there's no like special knowledge of it right so coming down to this this kind of the sequence stack as we kind of i kind of kind of keep going on about virtual items it's really kind of the core focal point right it's the actual the the item contracts themselves are what you're kind of building around so we have actually my uh my colleague philippe casagoy an amazing amazing person and visionary um had co-created the erc-1155 token contract and you can kind of see the link here it's used by sky weaver of course it's used by open seats used by many different projects it was you know co-authored by also engine and sandbox and other projects um and you know definitely a big role there too and yeah we have our implementation of our constructs which are really fancy and highly efficient um they're some of the most gas efficient contracts you can get out there they've been monitored multiple times then you know they're they're really great um we have lots of other cool features to talk about um then of course the cool thing we created was something called the nifty swap um nifty swap protocol and it's a decentralized exchange for virtual item with the ability to be able to swap instantly um your digital goods so we'll touch on that later so again tokenization of items you know the ability to trade items very easily and something that's also interesting is of course as you're building your your properties well how do you monetize some of these things across these networks and so what happened with what's emerged is this royalty standard called 2981 um we'll talk a little bit about it as well but are the sequence contracts for both uh 1155 and nifty swap already adhere and implement this interface such that you'll already be able to generate royalty by just by leveraging these things and setting it um another big property of course is the blockchain indexer and token metadata apis this is going to simplify development for you a whole lot um as you can imagine like any um you know any database right as a blockchain is is of type um you know you always have if you're going to be querying data you need to worry about your indexes right so that you can query things efficiently it's no different here um and of course there's a lot of token metadata that isn't on change you have to be able to kind of query that stuff and there's tons and tons of cool goodies and i'm gonna switch gears to sitting down but um tons more goodies on our github and our docs so leave it at that um what i would kind of this this slide what i wanted to kind of the point i wanted to make i find really exciting about web3 is you know obviously we're focused on ethereum as you know for many reasons i won't go i won't digress right now um but you can target one chain and anything that's if you're incompatible your application will it'll just work and so will sequence it so the contracts and everything they'll just they'll just be compatible so that's that's really interesting so you know what i would say is i look at ethereum no longer as a single single network when i say ethereum i mean i'm also referring to polygon and arbitrary and optimism and and others right um because they're all if you're they're part of the you know the network as an ecosystem where and the goal of sequence and the tools that we've created is to ultimately for an end user for everything to feel like one right just like you get in the web browser you have a web server or you know you have a web page or a different framework everything just renders it doesn't matter what server or what your hosting provider is essentially um it's almost you know it almost comes down to that in some levels but you know a little bit more fancy than that but but yeah so going back to that kind of point but also that um other tools that are compatible with these systems are also compatible with sequence are also compatible with your products so you can really welcome a whole slew of crazy amounts of products um and developer tools to help you you know construct your systems which is so fun um and so yeah so i want to also the next part of it i want to share with you is well the wallet experience right so the sequence as a wallet is really designed to make web3 simple fun and accessible for everyone so you know that i think that sums it up pretty well um and so the wallet as i mentioned is really the core interface to allow you to access these blockchain networks right this is it's your interface it's how you can log in and sign up and sign transactions and sign messages and do things that interact with these open systems um improve validity and stuff so the wallet again being very core um we we went and we spent years and years actually iterating and making multiple versions and we like to now you know we boldly claim you know sequence wallet as a smartest wallet on web3 and for many reasons and one of those is that it's actually a smart contract based wallet for ethereum compatible networks so versus um you know a traditional single key account you know as you get in metamask and others a sequence wallet is actually a multi-key system right your account is represented as a smart contract that can be controlled by a number of different keys that you construct through the use as you kind of sign in you know per device and so forth and you can actually add other recovery keys and other security keys there's more information obviously on sql set app you can access it and of course docs on sequence of build and back to the road to web 3 talk i gave it goes it goes in super a lot of depth so i kind of i think that's a better place for that um the source code is is licensed by apache 2 and of course it adheres to open standards it's compatible with anything on web3 any contract it has a really nice integration with allowing users to sign in with their social and their email we get we benefit from this cool product called web3 off as they help us devise one of our signing keys as one of the many of the smart contract wallet um it's very flexible integration you don't install anything it works on mobile works everywhere it has beautiful nfc integrations so if you do receive an nft or you know your user receives an nft it'll just immediately show up um there is this really cool gas abstraction so the idea for a user to think about like what is gas how should i price it is it going to be fast and cancelling it all these things users don't have to think about that or perhaps you're on polygon you have to pay like you know your gas visit mavic well how do you do that you know so again these are all abstracted um again how do you let users from you know the traditional fiat worlds actually go and spend money so you know these are really important for you owners and the goal of sequence is really to create you know in a non-custodial self-custodial way a 10x user experience with improving security and extending the capabilities of ethereum and that's what it does and that's what it does so when we think about you know the uh web three gaming and metaverse stack as we're kind of referring to we kind of break it down you know at high level as we're talking about a lot of sort of stuff kind of like this right here's a bit of a summary we've got our smart contracts of our items so in terms of the smart contracts that you you know you can really get really far with just you know using a standard library set of contracts you don't have to program your own smart contracts right it sounds crazy to say that but you don't have to right you can actually leverage a standard library of contracts like hours or others you can integrate and represent your virtual items you can have you know integrating with royalties really cool um and you know you can have different there's different market protocols like nifty swap and xerox protocol um work very well and of course you're gonna need to figure out you know what network you want to target you know having a different you know node provider and there's a bunch of different blocking infrastructure services such as the sequence index or metadata relay and there's other other providers out there in the world too um that offer you know other other services i you know i'm kind of partial to ours for for many reasons but um yeah feel free to explore and in inter intersects all of these web 3 tools together um and of course the wallet experience for seamless experience is very important for players so starting off as you guys are working on your games i hope that gives you a bit of a good meta high level view one thing that's really important again is the first place to think about is your items right so now when you're thinking about your items you're gonna say okay well what contract should i use right am i doing any rc20 721 1155 what's the difference right so first off i'll many of you may know but i'll just give you a recap a lot of people don't um so the erc20 is a fungible token standard the idea it's a single token you can have any number of it right the 721 it's a non-fungible token standard where you can have any number of tokens but you can actually have only a quantity of one ever right and in the 1155 the multi-token standard is one such that you can have n number of tokens so again some you have any number of tokens and you can have m number quantity per token so you could say of a skype record you can have token id 1 and you can say well there's only there's 10 of it or there's 100 of it or there's 10 000 of it and so forth there's only one of it right so the 1155 which of course i'm i'm a big advocate of as well i find it has we'll talk about has really interesting properties um is extremely well suited for video gaming and a lot of different things actually um and then what you can actually do interestingly with the olympic d5 is you can actually it's like a superset of the 20 and the 721 you can represent a 20 in 1155 contract and you can represent a 721 in 1155 contracts as well you actually wrap these things and a lot of people are doing that in the ecosystem so i and yeah there's a lot of other you know considerations um you know bash transfer amorphous and price discovery right for when your markets can be you know you kind of know like if you have a sky winger card if that card is just sold for 10 you got to imagine well you know that that's where the price is that's the that's the general market price for that very same card that a number of people are holding um and it makes it makes markets work a lot more efficiently and the data structures on chain as well are very inexpensive as a result that's kind of hopefully that gets you kind of started um obviously i'm going to advocate for the 1155 for a variety of reasons but feel free to you know combine your application with a multitude of these things nothing stops you from using um a combination but i again i don't see a huge point in it but you know it's uh it's certainly happy to open for discussion but if anyone would like um and some bedtime reading for everyone um there's an article from our director of product cassigue back in september 2018 around the time you know devised the number five standard and it's hereby dragons going beyond erc20 and erc721 to reduce gas costs by 80 um which is true and you can check out the article on our horizon games medium and it goes into kind of all the analysis and that's not the gas cost which is amazing is certainly not the only reason not even the reason i'm advocating um for the use of it um the next thing so again you got you're gonna be thinking about your token contract you're going to deploy your token contract um i you know i want to just to mention yeah on this page as well um that these are different links um to you know just just again for you to explore um you know highly you know highly recommend also the open zeppelin work um as a standard library of contracts they're they're excellent uh and you know if you are you know here it kind of references the different token contracts so i don't write your own contract use ones that are vetted audited and use um and we have the sequence and uh contract for 155 down here as well so you can kind of check them out and uh yeah so you have to deploy your contract and i'm not going to go into that here today but there's lots of resources out there how to do that and feel free to come on our discord discord.gdg sequence if you need some help um the next kind of part when you're thinking about your virtual items is of course token metadata um the 720 ones and the 1155s have token metadata capability and they're kind of part of a very kind of a standard extension and you can you can kind of go in the eip and read all about it and i'm kind of just taking a bit of a screenshot here for you guys um there's a single method that's added it's called the uri function it's a read function if you pass it a token id it's going to return to you a string where you can go find that metadata off chain so metadata for these tokens is actually represented off-chain some of you may or may not know um and you can kind of go and as an example so i'm gonna you know take you through an example for another 55 token contract though you know that we use in sky weaver so you can go look at our contracts you know github com you know horizon games skyward contracts it's open source and when you look at the source code you're actually going to see it's extremely small especially when you click on tokens and you look at how it's represented and the reason for that is because it really extends it just kind of inherits with some basic kind of like accessibility and other other little things of the you know sequence level 55 contracts that's the way i'd record that's the extent um i'd recommend um you can find but feel free to you know explore but again you know crawl block run is kind of what i would suggest um yes the uh so the polygon maintenance contract you can actually see the skype contract here you can click through it a cool little pro tip is if i'm just using the polygon scan which is using etherscan stuff if you click into here click on read um i can take a screenshot here you scroll down you can see a ui function if you just put in number one query boom it returns you the kind of where you can find you know query that metadata so it's important to look at this because of course this is something you want to incorporate you know you want to make sure you're constructing it this is how other products and ecosystem are traversing this information so you want to make sure yours is available and represented in a similar structure so you're going to just show up automatically in the wallets and exchanges and everything just it just plugs and plays right that's so you want to adhere to the contracts and the protocols um this is an example when you query this metadata of the uri this is what you're going to get boom you know this is again standard kind of functions and from this again wallets and other systems and indexers will be able to represent your your render your system really nice uh the next thing we're going to look at really quickly and i'm going through going through this fast this is a lot of content and i almost two minutes and this presentation will be over but i get more content content than that so we'll see um you know monetizing your items is important so you know check out this royalty standard 29.81 very fascinating um and it lets you kind of represent it essentially what it allows is for you to set a certain royalty on your token contract such as let's say 2.5 percent and anytime your items are traded on any exchange that adheres and respects the 29.81 you will receive two and a half percent to you know the receiver account which is really cool um so really great standard nifty swap and so there's a lot more there but i want to just kind of have you guys explore that um nifty swap it's a fully decentralized exchange for swapping 1155s so think of like uni swap for for nfts and why it's very interesting is because it creates this wonderful experience like kind of ecommerce like experience just go click click click click click buy and you know the market price is already set on chain all the liquidity is on chain um the prices have each kind of like a bonding curve based system and you know and this also goes for sellers right as a result since all liquidity involves the market exist on chain a seller can also go and just you know click around and instantly create liquidity so seller can always sell just very very fast and very novel um most people don't even have any clue about this protocol but we're really slowly emerging it and it's it's used within skyriver so you can see it here um if you go to sky weaver and go to the market you can kind of see you can click around these are we like to do things in usdc to the sky we were good so these are like you know silver cards you can see this card is worth a dollar eighty um or you know 1.85 usdc 1.8 usdc and that's typical of our design for skyway where we like to see sky silver cards kind of hover around the two usdc mark because we want that want those to be accessibly financially accessible whereas the gold market's a little bit more that's where the kind of rare cards go um anyways so you can click here this is kind of interesting that you can click on buy or sell it kind of functions the same and when you sell um this kind of window pops up and again you can instantly click and sell and immediately liquidate there is no order book there's no auction system here it's entirely just you know instant liquidity so it's something really new um there we have i mentioned kind of the sequence index for metadata apis this is again the ability to query you know for example how do you list all the items in a wallet how do you display the history how do you render beautifully you know these nfts um and being able to query simple as saying hey what's the balance you know how much of a certain token do i have how much usdc do i have or how much what are the different cards that i have or what's the quantity of these different items that i have as well and what's the history of which occurred um and so yeah we built this system it's really cool um you can you can kind of follow the links down here if you check if you come to us on the discord we're going to point in the right direction um it's similar to the graph um but it's in terms of concepts like maybe an analogy to but it's very different design um you know different construction in that uh the sequence indirectly actually indexes an entire blockchain the whole thing every single token every single erc20 every single 720 on every single l55 we don't even need a contract registry we can traverse and discover any single contact contract and we do this in a single block time so you send something against mind you immediately have it and if things actually get reorganized because that does happen on blockchains it's actually gonna be it's gonna adhere for that as well so it's really cool to be able to like boom like clear a bunch of data in in a single call um so kind of what's next uh for you that's kind of the quick workshop the quick kind of macro review hope that helps um and you know you have to choose your network still um you know how do you employ contracts on your network get to be really thoughtful about your game design considering that okay there was what was previously a closed system is now an open system what is now certainly having a secondary market versus you know typically in video games you have the primary market how do you think about scarcity versus accessibility right on one hand you want things to be scarce you know so they're like collectors items but on the other hand you don't want to you know you want them to be accessible so they're fun you don't want to be able to like hide them from your game so they're only in the handful in the hands of a few people or maybe people don't play the game which ultimately helps you avoid pay to win payment rails here are some resources for you all and uh yeah our discord like i said discord lgd slash sequence um check out some of the demos you can see my workshop if you just youtube it and somehow made it here in just over the time but we're also hiring and please uh yeah reach out at horizon.io awesome thanks so much peter um so we just have two quick questions if that's okay yes um michael wants to know can they use the sequence wallet uh with react native yes you can and then uh thomas would like to know if there's any plans to move the metadata to ipfs so for sky weaver um yeah i guess i i think if you saw on the slide so the sequence indexer or the contracts we support ipfs nr we even http so it doesn't really matter like in your case you can use whatever you want um the everything will just work we we again support all protocols for sky weaver um we probably will move into our weave i'm a little bit more of a fan of that system um but you know to be quite honest um i would yeah i think for for this current version the uh i think you're good to kind of iterate in keeping it on s3 for instance um just to kind of work things kind of quickly and then um as i do again love our leave i think there's still some work that they need to do as it relates to um distributed access to the data awesome sweet well thanks so much sky weaver looks super cool and yeah um any other questions you guys might have um hit up the discord and yeah they're hiring so cool thanks so much peter thanks everyone for joining
