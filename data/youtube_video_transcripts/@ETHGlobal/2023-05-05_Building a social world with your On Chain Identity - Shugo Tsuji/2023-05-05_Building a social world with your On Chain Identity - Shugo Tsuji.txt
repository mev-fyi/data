foreign [Music] yeah so I'm like 22 years old and I'm from Japan so it's my home country welcome to Japan I hope you guys are enjoying like Tokyo yeah and uh yeah so uh waking up early always give me some more cake so I don't I don't I don't want to wake up every morning so yeah actually like I was back I was working on the bench capital in Japan uh for like two years like yeah when I was in the highest like University student and then like I moved to San Francisco the 2021 uh August and then I just like dive into the crypto world and next they're testing some smaller nft project and also some media uh and then like the the last year January I started this project called Phi uh with my co-founders so yes and then right actually like before like the talking about my project I want to uh talk about the what's identity and also the how different the identity from the how we can be defined identity in the web series so yes actually uh what's the identity itself uh in the first place is the first question so identity like in my understanding like I don't care about the definition on the uh dictionary but like yeah in my recognition so and it is like the how you view yourselves and then like some sometimes like people are mixing the reputation and also credentials into the identity of course like the adaptation in the credential is like party can be part of your identity but I think that's a bit different so reputation is the how others build you so it's differencing and then like uh maybe these are like very typical like examples about thinking the reputation like the uh national ID and the school degree and where which college uh did you graduate and also like exam score something yeah this is like in the real world right so I actually this is like repetition like can help you think about who I am but like actually this is not yourself and the like yeah I'm from the uh Japan and then Japan is like the uh of course like what was my identity but like it's not myself and they I really like the American culture as well I know so I think I really like the Chinese food as well so like my identity is very chaos and also but like actually these like reputation and this credentials is very helpful for thinking about your uh identity so and then like what's the website identity like and how different from the web to Identity and also other real uh like real world identity so I think like in the web 3 like your identity like nearly equal your reward transactions the history data so this is pretty different like structure like in the web too like your data is stored on the Google's like dead server and also Facebook and also like Twitter and a GitHub like like each company has your own like personal information and also which is distributed and if the company is like the uh like disappear like your personal data is also disappear like your history of the and your picture and the uh your writings like I will go go away so like in the website like every information and is like the store don't blockchain like so that's why like I say that your identity is nearly equal to the nearly call that your word transactions history data so with this like structure uh enables us to see the new way more website native way uh to represent identity so like these are just I want the examples uh like the yeah we of course still using the Twitter stuff at GitHub like yeah so religion score and also D5 password and also like git coin passports so yeah a bunch of like new apps are trying to redefine the web 3 identity right so and then like like what like actually like so that's why like the web history company and also other regular authorities in the real world uh British struggle struggling uh with their like transitioning their reputation and the zero Authority into their own chain so that's where it's a huge opportunity for the like us and I'm very young so so that's why that young people or like other like people to create the new system uh like to represent identity so and then like let me into this my project like called Phi uh fight and Dot XYZ uh the language disappears but yeah so this is an application like we're trying to visualize the people's own child entity in the more gamified way like SimCity like Animal Crossing like you can build your own City and and also like this round each round is like represent your or your own chain identity like what did you do in crypto or what's your preference and there was a what's the community and what's the social graph on the web on the on chain on the blockchain so like we have the two website right now so why is the Fight Quest like this is pi connect is the uh like the connector like five words and with the other plot codes so like it's very it's like a quest system like an rabbit hole and registry so if you complete like the only activity Quest like swapping or any swap running you can get this object and uh yeah this object is designed by e-boy like he's like a co-founder of announcer though but yeah that's why it's pretty cute so uh yes and then and also like the other one is a fight end so like that the object you acquired a sister fight Quest you can like enjoying the like The Sims 3 like gamings uh in here so you can you can populate your lands with the objects you acquired on the quest and like each object can show you some traction and also like the round represent uh your own child density so like this is like the interesting point and it's very different from other like the like identity protocols like is that like people have to create yourself so like other like the uh official apps like debunk like they're just like the feed that this is also helpful like what is what what what what kind of transaction are you making like uh like yesterday and today so and the transaction that will be showed on the feed so right actually there's not like the creation and character so like if I enable you to show the you to create yourself and it's like Instagram so you're like the archiving some posts and also only like posting like the good looking picture something like that so yeah like you you can emphasize your some some part of your attractions and also like you can like hide some some like the attractions uh or you're just like the the database so it's like the uh different point and we so that's why I defined my product is like the Instagram or forever three like uh like of course like people don't need to show the picture but like people still keep the pseudonymity but like it's a new way to show yourself so exactly it's NFD pfp stuff so yeah and also like a bunch of people are sharing the fight end uh right now on the Twitter and also other register like uh additional subtractions sorry for the cuttings of the slides but yeah so we are currently like 20 000 like 50 000 like unique users uh yeah it's like monthly active users like and then like the uh 50 000 plus runs created and so 2 million plus object claims server so uh actually like the it's the four months uh since we launched our product I think it's a great traction like it's like the proving the the the our thesis like people want to represent yourself like without share activities now ended up yeah there are a bunch of Partners and they that should be like put it together but like yeah so it's copied I'm sorry and I'm like yeah so it's it's just a while without traction like the last amounts uh actually in February so we're the top one top first social protocol on polygon so uh yeah so like a rent protocol like Galaxy so yeah we're we're like uh actually maybe maybe we are doing doing well also uh yeah and also we are backed by like the community some committee like a backrest guys and there's a Bitcoin co-founder Scott and also like the co-founder of like Isa go about the Celtic like are they really like supportive for our project and these like the song committee enable us to connect with great protocols and like which is connected to like provide the the quality uh of the like our services uh to the users yep and uh I wanted to show you the a quick reader like touching quickly demo like uh with the touching the our project our protocol oh sorry I'll sorry yes sir this is the Fight Quest so uh here is the yeah so you can go to the quests list and their bunch of requests and they you can check SVT and actually I claim the or object like look claimable yeah but yeah DJ score and uh like the balancer like azuki or like these are like we crop it with a bunch of protocols like yeah you can try it out and you can export a quest and like maybe you might want to try you might uh will be there uh try to some other Quest and like there yeah so let's put a bunch of people are said to us like the um because of a fight like they want to try to touch the uh like Abe or like the lens protocol or something like that which is a really good great feedback positive feedback on website report codes so yes that's what I could a file is not just like walking out the like island island I didn't I didn't see right here so which uh we're also walking out the onboarding bottom to F3 so uh by using the social incentives like people want to be more unique and people want to represent them more so these like social like social incentives are very strong and which is really appropriate for the onboarding purpose yeah and also this is a round oh my God sorry good yes so you can create the round from the es domain so like yeah here's my ensugotes here so this one is belong to the sugar piecer and then like the uh yeah this is my round so like there is a uni swap like snapshot and also of course like my Twitter I want to see these called links and yeah other like snapshots so like yeah you you can you can create your own so right now so and if you have the ens domain so I think like it's a good opportunity uh to get the ens and there to do something to explore the web series Supply yes yeah so okay and they go back to the yeah so after uh that's all like uh from my side uh like five can go like together with like the old crypto community and then like the uh fire are trying to uh if I can contribute to the uh more onboarding the next BMP blue next million people are into crypto space like through some more like gaming social way so uh yes and actually like the uh we're not just actually this round is like just like what was the starting point like we're like my country developing the more arbitrary function and also like music kind of integration stuff like that's for like our concept of this community like the utilizing on change activities in the most social in the gaming way and which can essentially people to the touching protocols so uh yes that's what I could not right now without just like the uh like seeing the round right now but like actually uh you will be able to jump into the run and also communicate with your friends uh and also like yeah so in more like becoming the interactive so I think like uh and also uh maybe you you Albert will also changing depends on the audio activities so that's why like yeah everything is connected to the blockchain data so and then like you can play the like blockchain like with the fire so as far like five is like the uh working as the playable like I mean the playable layer of the red blockchain itself so yeah no that's all like a concept and then what we are trying to do so like if you think about the like the web to like adoption like they're starting from the Facebook and other like serious socials so like without sex like monitoring instant devices so there uh like the a bunch of people are trying to show the connection and so social graphs on the internet and the witches that create a strong intent culture so like we have to do we we want to do like same thing in the website space like people I will represent themselves on the blockchain and also playing their like the the the the the identity on the blockchain so I think which can be connected to the next Mass adoption of the web series so uh yeah that's why I could the identity and there's a mass adoption is very very connected so yeah we hope to uh actually find it just like one one way to uh get more like most adoption uh but yeah so we hope the uh they keep like working on this project and then like to diversify the way uh for you uh to represent the ownership identity uh and then like also like playing the the world of the web c so uh yeah yeah that's all from my side so thank you for your listening it's a oh yes oh yeah so yeah maybe uh we have just two times so uh yeah like if you have any questions so just let me know yep uh so super record the uh Fight Quest uh that's the most like the active prototype so like yeah so actually like five questions like not selected to ens holders so that's where like anyone can start from the fire Quest and then actually explore the uh the particles so actually the getting the ens is a kind of like one request for getting like around it so yeah yes that's right uh like The Fight Quest unique unique wallet address uh there is like a 70s 72 000 and then like the uh fight end is like yeah 50 000 like the run so yeah like kind of that rate so maybe like we can improve more so yeah uh you wanna see that so could you show the mic we see yeah so this is our dashboard so and they're like five brand unique user and the yeah so number of finance and total object minted select that so yes so like sorry like a little bit more you mean about data that I mean you mean how we can Define the yes uh sorry yeah so like each other is like they belong to each Year's domain so that's why if you transfer the ens around also transfer so far yes so yeah actually uh that's the that's the one with the reason that the uh we you we use ens for the uh like creating round so uh like actually we are now strict to the like the like bright ID or uh like I mean the not like kyc stuff right so that's like well people doesn't need to be strict about straight to the one identity so maybe like I can have the sugar teaser and also other maybe like I don't know like pixel artist of the user so like any like the like identity we can hop so uh so let's try like a we use the ens I think that's a really good good like the level of the description about the identity so yeah you can you can keep the student and also uh like you can have like multiple identity like with the es domain so yeah okay maybe like I can answer one more question so if you have a yep go through it in a minute yeah so that's like the uh so right now so yeah this year this year yeah this year so yeah so I can't find Avatar stuff so yeah we are currently building yes so uh we're currently using like of chain verification like the not like the fully on chain like verification like like the our Market tree so uh I really like just using the AWS backend and then like like actually uh we're reading the user's own chat with the data from the uh various like API stuff like and including like server graphs uh so that's probably like if you like for example the uh like holding some Esa Quest like we are using the Easter scan API currently uh and then like the uh if the if the address is the amidst the requirements uh we uh issued a coupon on our AWS plugin and then like people I will be able to claim the object yes yeah so uh Samsung Protocols are providing like API stuff like uh some protocol doesn't not right so that's why I could uh maybe uh we're uh developing the case by case so our backend so guess yeah actually that's the uh the actually like the we can use the uh right like she's small like they're using the market tree uh for the verifying the activities like uh that's that could not be dynamic so because we have to update the the time time so that's why like we have to like deploy the market free like every time you want to update the status so that's why I could uh we are more forecasting like real time experience so that's why uh we are kind of either using like more of chain solution about it so just yeah yeah but user generated quests uh and the art so I knew yeah so Yes actually like a weird country uh thinking to separate two layers like like yeah actually first right here is like the uh it's like the existing fire Quest like we're very creating the protocols like to provide the best onboarding experience to users right now uh but like it's like a RB like centralized and like not like the web series right so that's why like uh we're gonna prepare like one more layer uh actually it's the discussing disgusting uh discussing right now but yeah so no disgusting yeah like yeah we're gonna prepare like one more like layer for the uh to accept more and more protocols one more projects I want to find so maybe which is more pretty like a casual like maybe batches or uh something like that so and the people can easily to create the object or batteries uh and then like there yeah they can do the campaign like buy themselves so which is more like a very casual radio it's like more Galaxy it's more it's more like pop stuff but again maybe that isn't the need to put for the for getting their users uh onto file so yeah yeah foreign I hope you guys enjoyed my presentation thank you
