waiting for more people to trickle in all right all right and Kevin says we are live so just wait for like there's like two more people join me and then I'll get started perfect okay hi everyone um good morning afternoon evening depending on where you are um I'm Cree from East Global um with us we have Jeffrey from Phil Fox um he will be giving uh his workshop on the progress of Phil Fox and FNS um and we will save if you have questions feel free to put them in the chat um Jeffrey will read them towards the end of his Workshop um and then of course we can always open it up for questions um if you want to like come off mute and ask them um we can do that maybe like the last five hotels of the of the workshop um just remember to go on mute when you guys join um and yeah Jeffrey feel free to take it away I'll go off camera and yeah yeah thank you um hey guys uh this is Jeff from Fairfax um uh super glad to be here and share you guys with our latest progress and of both Phil Fox and FNS um so just like so uh today's topic would be uh for Fox latest progress and FNS and the key features and also I'll tell a little bit more about the FNS future plan um so I'll start with the Phil Fox so I just did a quick intro about the team first uh we originated from the five coin developer community and we have been working closely uh with the Falcon team since testnet um our currently like product product includes like web series tools for Fox Explorer and fox wallet we also got like applications like FNS and we are also developing ckp mining power and Marketplace for finance purposes [Music] um for the traffic uh for traffic wise we have accumulated like huge traffic from fieldfox Explorer and the fox bullet uh the trash we have put some pictures here and you can show the real data of those tools uh if your focus has more than 80 active users over the past 30 years or 30 days and the fox will adjust exceed 20 uh 20K da use um and next one is about the latest updates about fieldfox um So lately we devoted ourselves uh to the development of fvm ecology and one five coin uh Fe AVN building blocks Awards with FNS uh in hacksaw in Feb and hacksaw and uh lately uh with user programming ability approaching early this year we're going to update fieldfox to show activities and interactions uh involving user defined actors so a few a few important updates here uh we will launch actors display such as wasm and the fevn by code abis and supporting for all address classes also includes F4 addresses uh we're going to display event log and transaction State and finish the the contract source code verification also we noticed that some platforms and the projects are using uh our uh using Field Force Explorer to capturing data so in order to build a better Falcon ecosystem we will assume release the guide about how to make file for uh fieldfox Explorer API course and make the process a lot easier for you guys to use yeah the links here um you guys can check the documents all right uh this is pretty much about the uh fieldfox and the next Arrow share you guys a bit more about the FNS um simply put FNS is to decentralize the five coin name service based on fvm you may consider it as the um ens in the filecoin ecosystem but we have developed more functions on it um we hope that this kind of uh the the launch of NFL will help uh like uh help uh to improve the user experiences in the in the situations right now and uh advances uh erc721 standard um each FNS name is treated as an ft and the FNS contract compiles with all interfaces of the erc7 to one standard and can be transferred and traded on secondary nft markets uh the function we have uh put a picture a flow chart here and you guys can check um like how it works um the functions included registry resolver controller Etc uh we'll also provide the miner name service which we call it MNS it is a resolution from the name to the miner the owner of a minor 85 coin protocol can configure name resolution for the miner users can use the storage Services provided by miners through and easily identifiable domain which tools compatible with FNS uh furthermore ad FNS name can be resolved to an order CID which will be the first step to realizing the decentralized storage index services um yeah moving to the next one uh so here I will list like three main features of FNS uh first FNS provides better user experiences that comes with the use of the dot file uh domain anyone can index on on chain addresses contents and storage with simple characters and our team will Implement a function using on chain storage to search Five coin actors as well on top of that we will launch the FNS space so users can freely create the FNS web 3 space for transparency friendship and and more yeah um talking about the FNS space our team is quite excited about this feature since as a web 3 user myself I personally need a decentralized portal to connect my own chain and off chain data with the help of the FNS protocol users can like create their personalized brand photos on FNS spaces use filecoin and ipfs storage space to store and display their exploration of the wet reward in a decentralized manner um and at the same time um through fnsposo we we call it like the protocol of society uh protocol um it can it can uh get you verified it can verify web 2 identity influence to the West reward um and the FNS protocol will also launch the five coin so scan Services um users can find Webster friends more suitable for themselves uh based on FNS spaces like we were searching uh the seeing habits or or you participate in the same ecosystem Etc to match their friends with for you so and the picture beside shows how how the or functionality works so users can configure their profile profile on the space dashboard such as nickname logo occupation um and the configured information will be generated as a web web file and uploaded to the ipfs and will also be sent as a deal to the filecoin network to be packaged to sectors um the user's signature binds ipfs and the five coin order CID to the resolution of the user subdomain name and the user can access the space through the subdomain name at the same time your space will also update some metadata to the user's SPF SBT sorry SBT um this is pretty much about the FNS space so we uh conclude that uh dot fire provides individuals and organizations with unique fivecoin dot Fair brand domain names it also combines like FNS and the DMS domain services for creating a seamless link between the users and the miners while being able to display their web 2 and web 3 social identities in addition it comes with a web free space for all the dot five registered users we have various size of identity aspects are represented in the source game facilitates users in inter relations and the internet connections so we also got some future plans for the um for the for the FNS for the short term most important one is to open source the audit name service contracts code and provide a complete deployment and the development solution some other functions uh we have already been developing right now like name search and the details display in Firefox Explorer uh we have put some pictures there to show you how it works um and also for Fox will also complete the FNS transfer and the search function users can use the FNS name to transfer fill and tokens this will improve the user experience as well and for the launchers we'll put all the like time and effort into developing FNS space uh we hope to create uh decentralize the personal uh Proto and the did system for where three users based on the Falcon fvm and build a bad speed a blockchain service flexible tool with completely decentralized end entities and data storage um yeah this is my uh sharings today thanks for listening uh by the way like FNS is now running on test net uh the the website is uh below is shown us below um just feel free to try it out um also if you have any questions feel free to ask the ring yep awesome thanks so much Jeffrey um yeah everyone if you didn't see uh Jeffrey's teammate Steven just dropped um all the links in the chat that you might need so be sure to go check those out um Also if anyone has any questions feel free to drop them in the chat right now or uh raise your hand oh we'll have one for Henry uh Jeffrey if you see that one or Stephen yeah probably Steven you're gonna answer that or yeah Stephen feel free to come off you and uh read the questions and and answers um just so everyone can hear them and also so they're on the recording yeah so we guess uh so I guess like the FNS uh we have more functionalities as I mentioned before we have more functionalities uh comparing with ens and and stop the installable domains because right now yes we don't see uh like we don't see any uh spaces like web series spaces or personal profile um it didn't launch any uh functionalities like that but we will we'll do this uh in the later stage and we also have uh some connections like functions we'll launching the in very soon on the five five coin uh Firefox Explorer like uh we can search you can put uh their your domains in their search bar and um in the Firefox uh Explorer it shows all the information about the miners and and about the addresses yeah awesome and then it looks like we have another question from Scott um he says will contract validation work with the same either scan like tools or will it be a different process um this might go to Stephen I guess it contract side Steven okay okay for the solidity contracts uh we will adopt a similar form uh just like the either scam do yes and about the welcome code such as the rust maybe we will consider the a new uh verification method yeah it's all it's up to the function of the fvm yeah and it was a requirements okay awesome and then one from Nick um can we integrate into our contract the The Fill space yeah yeah uh we we will we will release the SDK for the FAS and you can integrate the fs to your uh project uh and when we when we finish the development of the fs space and we will uh release the dark and the API for the fs space and you can integrate it in your own project and maybe some uh corporate yeah so okay awesome um and then I'm a rezai sorry if I butchered that name um just had trouble forking it wondering if there's a problem with the code or forking is not compatible um maybe that's one for the Discord just so they can dig into it a bit more um yeah and then I uh about about the hot fog yeah our Explorer is uh doing is doing a developing a new uh code the new code to support it and the RPC now is living for uh the the new hyperspace chain yeah but the uh the the the the Explorer it's the function of Explorer will be uh online uh tomorrow yeah okay awesome yes check back tomorrow um and then I guess like one last question um they just wanted to confirm that the filled out domains uh URLs the correct one for claiming um yes Stephen just put the domain perfect okay awesome um perfect Well yeah if anyone else has any questions last call for it um otherwise I think Jeffrey Steven um if you can drop all of these links in your Discord Channel um that way people have access to them if they weren't uh here and checking the chat um and then yeah if anyone else has any other questions um feel free to check out their Discord Channel um and Jeffrey Steven thanks for joining us all right thanks for having us yeah bye everyone bye
