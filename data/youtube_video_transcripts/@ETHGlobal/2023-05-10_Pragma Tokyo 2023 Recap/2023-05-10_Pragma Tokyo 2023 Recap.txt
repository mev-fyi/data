[Music] foreign [Music] good morning everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of Eve Global and welcome to pragma this I'm still trying to figure out different communities I do notice some difference in culture but the best thing is that we are all aligned on Deck I think Japanese people are quite familiar with technology and also content like an nft you know it's quite a good fit in terms of culture Japan is based on a Creator economy so I think East Global can host more events like pragma or hackathon so various kinds of events are I think helpful to create more like a wider community based in Japan this culture of open learning happening in museum at hackathon they're mentors and experts like obvious mentors and speakers you know like it's Global provides but at the same time even hackers can be like their newer hackers who are getting into web3 now but the ones that are more experienced who've been to hackathons ethereum hackathon many times they can learn from each other so the things you think are safe or may not be safe that's the big thing to rethink right not just banks for governments in that event in the event that the government is counterparting risk the people who are best position in the world to deal with that are folks like yourself where it is cryptographic private keys that are actually property I love Japan it's my seventh trip to Japan I spent a lot of time here as an entrepreneur I've had investors from from Japan before the culture is great the food is great I find The Hacker Community been fantastic as well some great questions today from hackers coming up to me and asking if you know for ideas of what they should hack on for airstack nothing but positives so the best I use Liquid is just asking people what they're working on and that basically makes sure that we understand like what sort of things excite us a lot of Builders building super exciting projects here like um the developer Community is really strong in Japan and I think it's growing a lot foreign [Music] I think Tokyo will be the top on crypto and Webster City in the world in Asia [Music] foreign
