great um hi and welcome everybody and thanks for joining live peers workshop session this is buildingonlivepeer.com's decentralized live streaming platform and the session is going to be taken by angela and with that i will hand it over to her to introduce herself and kick the session off hi everyone thank you so much for joining uh my name is angie ramirez and i have worked at livebeer for about three years now i started off on the engineering team so a year and a half just building our backend tools and then i transition more to speaking to users and presentations and so here we are um but today i'd like to give you a little bit of an introduction into what library is give you an a demo of our api and how you can plug into our existing platform and then i'll walk through uh example projects that you might want to look at or or think about this weekend and then i'll leave a little bit of time for q a i'll try to make it 10 minutes but might run a little bit over and if i do i'll just answer some of your questions on asynchronously on discord or whatever other platform you might want to use so let's just get started so a little bit of an introduction and a demo and i'll go through this part quickly uh we do have a lot of information on lifebear.com that you can take advantage of but livebear is essentially we're building a decentralized marketplace on ethereum that connects infrastructure providers so that's individuals with extra capacity to do video transcoding uh anywhere in the world so people with underutilized compute power and with companies that need to process video and so to give you an idea of what the potential market of a product like this is uh if you have ever looked at traffic on the internet and how much traffic of it how much of it is coming in through video about 80 of it is is video and so uh yeah the the potential for a product like this is huge um and then uh just to give you an example of of what we do and where we fit in on the live streaming cycle so if you look at this diagram you see on the left hand side an example strive tv uh you see in the middle a couple of names like wowza mux bitmoven and zen coder those are other individuals who are centralized companies that are doing video transcoding then you have like the next step in the iteration which is uh going to the cdn and distribution piece of it and then you have like your end devices but uh for those of you not familiar with the live streaming cycle the reason it's really important is because you you can take a video that might be at a really high resolution and make it into whatever resolution and whatever format that you'd like uh so that it's viewable but by everyone anywhere on the internet uh and so anyone with a really low internet connection in vietnam can take advantage with of of you know some of the lower end renditions uh but now to the meat of the presentation and what i'd like you all to to take a look at is how to integrate with lightbeer and we've actually tried to make it really easy for you guys so we've created a github repo with a sample application and i can pass on this whole presentation to you all um but if you go to that link we have an entire small sample app that that you can look at and interact with that will show you and and and like allow you to copy and paste into your applications but uh actually let me just share my entire screen so that you all can see what i'm doing on obs uh so i will stop sharing and then i will continue sharing some of the uh the entire screen basically okay so here we are so if i click on this uh link here i'll be taken to a very simple front end where you'll be asked to enter your api key and so to do that you'll go to library.com you'll create an account and then if you see this button here on the right top hand side you'll go to your dashboard you'll go to your api key section and hit create and so um here i'll just give my token a name create a token and then i will copy and paste that token into my sample application here uh once i do that i'll hit enter i'll hit create a stream and voila here i see again a very simple front end uh but what's important is that we have these different pieces of information below the interest url the screen key and the playback url and so what i'll do is uh hopefully you all already have obs downloaded but if you don't i have instructions in the presentation on how to do that uh but it's essentially just a streaming software so i'll take this in just url from here i'll copy it i'll go into my settings on obs i'll go into stream paste it into the server field i'll take that stream key and i'll paste it here into this field and i'll hit ok and so uh for now we're going to ignore the playback url but uh once i start streaming i can go back to my sample application and as you can see that video is gonna start coming through in about five seconds um and so uh yeah uh this playback i'll talk about the playback url here so if i copy it i can integrate it into whatever player i would like so if i go to something like theo player i can paste it into here load my stream hit the play arrow and there you go um so uh if you hit this link here on github you'll see all the code that's behind that very simple front end and so oh it's all a matter of just copying and pasting it into your own application uh but to continue on with our presentation uh and i know you might have some questions so i went through this pretty quickly uh but uh let me now continue sharing that other screen i'm interested in showing you so uh here uh you know at the bottom of that sample app you also have a sample post request that you can take advantage of uh and and just try it out on your terminal so we have profiles we have the name of the stream and we have a lot of other fields that that might be relevant or important to you um but for the next couple of slides i've just included some information that i'll pass on to you on how to utilize some of these other features and then how to interact with the api directly and one that i really wanted to mention was recording so something else that you can do with the live peer api is enable uh recording so once you're you you know you've streamed your stream has ended within five minutes you'll see uh a recording url that's output into the livebear.com dashboard and so i've included a link to that guide on how to do that it's also a pretty simple blog post that hopefully you all can uh read on your own time and so i've got some information on creating your first live stream integrating with the api uh and then i guess that slide is a little bit repeated but i think what i i really want to focus on is some of these example projects that you all might want to uh consider working on and so um i think that you all already have the description of of these projects here but i'll just go through uh what's what they are and what they mean and what the possibilities for for some of these uh different uh items are so the first one that we have on the list is the life your audience integration and so uh an audience you have an api you can take out songs from the api and create an easy way for creators to add these tracks to their live stream that's an idea of a project that you might want to work on you can also create a live stream of a video visualizer based on audio's frax an audience if you haven't gone on their website is a really cool streaming project it's decentralized music streaming application the second project that you might want to work on is on nfts and live peer so uh if you've been following the nft field uh a lot of uh individuals will create a time when they'll drop a lot of nfts so if you have seen what's going on in the e-commerce field in e-commerce the way things work is you know an individual would will get up from a company or just someone who has an etsy store and they'll create a live stream and they'll just show and walk through some of the products it's kind of like what you see on tv channels with uh qvc and and just showing a product and then having a link where you can purchase that product it's something that's very popular in china right now and in a couple of other asian countries but hasn't necessarily hit uh the united states or europe in in the way that it has there and so the idea here is uh that you can create an application that will allow a creator to live stream nft drops and allow viewers to just purchase those nfts either during or after that live stream so it is possible to insert links into the live stream or you can think of a different way maybe attaching a chat functionality where you can have the links displayed but there are a ton of possibilities here and then the third one is with handshake and hand shaped is a decentralized dns or a domain registry so uh for this one uh i think it's sort of an adjacent uh project to what we have so if you copied our sample app you could then create a prettier url for your videos so you for example could create a handshake domain name for a live year live stream and for this we're just looking for a proof of concept a demo and so don't worry about making it super complicated uh the the next one on the list we have is file coin and live beer and this one's really interesting because we've actually already created a little demo that i wanted to show you of us using uh filecoin so if we go here to file.video and i did not include this link on the presentation but if you take a look at this we in conjunction with filecoin and another company called uh uh basement studios we've uh sort of integrated lipir into the filecoin network and so this is sort of a proof of concept and experiment in the decentralized video hosting uh and with this is also open source so if you click on if you go to about you can then also click on the github link and see the code to this project so this took developers a long time to build so it's not necessarily something that you would work on yourself uh but it is something that you can take advantage of and create some kind of proof of concept that utilizes both the file coin and then uh lipir and so uh yep so that's that's that for that one and then for project number five or idea number five uh we have skynet and skynet is is similar to filecoin and so skynet adds a hosted service that might be could be easier to integrate with uh than filecoin for some of you uh but if you're more familiar with falcon then i would recommend going with them uh but again it's it's a similar concept to number four and then uh number six uh is a project with a company called unlock and unlock is a decentralized paywall solution so you can essentially buy access using ethereum and this would if you work on a project like this you might could create some private streaming experience so right now all the live peer streams are going through our platform and if you have the link they're essentially accessible to everyone and so you might want to think about how to uh you know turn on or off like the access to a live stream or or how you can use unlock uh to do that to allow a broadcaster to control who can watch a stream and who cannot uh and you could think about integrating a payment solution into this there are a ton of different possibilities here and so actually i think i've gone through this pretty quickly so i'll i'll leave some time for questions if anyone has them uh but i'm not sure where i can find the question oh yeah okay i see the chat uh so i have a question from luke if possible could you put the presentation in full screen mode oh sorry that was a little bit yes i could i could totally do that if that is helpful um but let me take a look at the other question is it possible to create a simultaneous multi-stream experience akin to discord multiple users sharing the screen at the same time so uh right now we are we have the individual streams going we don't have that feature enabled but that's certainly something that you could work on or or work through um but yeah not not something that we're doing at the moment i wonder if anyone else has any questions yeah if anybody has questions for angie feel free to unmute yourself or drop them in the chat otherwise she will be available in the sponsor live peer channel on discord and will be happy to take any questions there as well um it would be great actually if you could share the link to these slides and we can share that with everybody in the sponsor live peer channel as well just to go through again totally totally and i would also say there are a couple of people on the liver team who are participating in the hackathon themselves and so they're also going to be available uh to answer questions on the discord and one of those two of those individuals actually worked directly on our the blockchain side of of live peers so if you do have any questions related to how we've built this decentralized network or how we got started how our token works there they're certainly going to be able to answer that um but hopefully this presentation has allowed you to see that it's it's actually really easy to integrate with live beer and we have created a lot of like five minute tutorials where you just follow step by step on how to create a live stream and uh you know we do if you go one more thing i'll say is if you go on livebear.com let me just uh go there right now and you just go to our home page and you click on the blog we do have documentation standard documentation but if you click on the blog you'll see some examples of projects that have built on top of live pier so here at the top you'll see core kuma and they're an e-commerce company and they're they're powered by lipirin so they allow creators individuals who want to sell products both both companies small companies big companies and lifebear has has enabled them to serve not just the large enterprises but also the small players uh that they they couldn't have targeted uh with centralized providers or the cost structure that exists there and then here you'll see like a variety of articles mostly written by me but also other team members at live pier so you'll see that that article that i told you about the recording piece you have tips and tricks debugging this one might be really important for you guys so if you see that anything isn't working or you're seeing some buffering in your stream you can click on this article here and that will give you a step by step on how to set up your obs and how to check that all the settings are correct so that your streaming goes uh smoothly and if you'd like a very detailed video tutorial on how to stream into live bear for the first time we have that here and uh again some like features and software that we support and are like explanations like more technical explanations on how our always-on transporting network works and again some other examples of people who are built on top of live peer and what they've done with the live streaming experience um so this i bet is going to be really helpful for you guys and then that first article is just like an introduction to what is video transcoding why is it important how can we do it and where does live bureau fit in into that cycle of of live streaming um so i think that's where i will leave it at um but if there are any other questions that i can answer let's see uh okay yes there is another question from youtube any plans to add a subscription model so we have something called a pro plan and with a pro plan you can sign up for unlimited streaming so unlikely.com we have a thousand minutes of streaming free per month and for you guys we're of course allowing you to use as many minutes as you'd like for the hackathon but for other individuals i think we do cap it at a thousand minutes and then and then we do charge per minute transcoded and we also charge for the cdn portion um so another question from youtube do we stream to the live period through an rtmp endpoint uh yes yes so uh you can use whatever software you'd like to stream into livebear but we do have we have a lot of experience with obs and obs has worked really well for us and that actually does our output rtmp which we then uh receive on the library side another question from helios with platforms like this having cost for content creators how is this sustainable against twitch and youtube that's a really good question so we we mostly target content creators at this point in our evolution as a company and the reason that is it's it there's a lot of people there are a lot of people on twitch content creators who maybe aren't gamers maybe the gaming community served pretty well on twitch but uh the music streamers and the individuals who are do are artists and may not have the budget or will wants to live off of the content that they stream they're they're finding that twitch and youtube actually gives them a much lesser revenue split than they'd like or that it's sustainable for them unless they have a very large audience and so we have a lot of people who are approaching us with uh ideas uh content creators who maybe aren't very technical who are trying to build the twitch for their specific vertical of like the user generated content and so uh we have a couple of music streams we have a music streaming platform that's for classical musicians that's being built out on live beer uh so though that population of people didn't really think that they were well served by the options that are out there they wanted a community where they could speak to other classical musicians where they could sell concert tickets where they could then interact and find like tutoring resources or schedule classes with experts online and so it's an amalgamation of a bunch of different services but the the focus really is on the live streaming and being able to live stream to anyone anywhere in the world and so uh with live period because we're about 10 times cheaper than the alternative they're able to set up their infrastructure in a way that allows them to share more of that revenue with their content creators and so we we are seeing a lot of the the people migrate from twitch and youtube into just their own platforms and building on top of of live peer um so hopefully that answers that question and then we have a question from luke uh federation with teams or zoom i'm not sure what that question means i don't know emily if you have an idea of what that means or anyone on the call i'm 100 sure luke did you grab that question from youtube i did okay um yeah that might have been a question that came through on youtube um i can always um make a comment there and we can make a plan to pull it through into the sponsor live peer channel um and get that answered as well awesome cool um i think that might be all the questions that exist on the channel yeah i think i think it is um thanks so much angie really appreciate you um taking the session and for answering everybody's questions as i mentioned uh the live peer team is available in the sponsor live pair channel on discord so feel free to reach out to them at any point um from now and over the weekend while you're building out your projects awesome and yes i will share that that deck with you all and thank you so much and i can't wait to see what you all build great thanks so much angie and thanks everybody we'll see you at um all the other workshops planned for today awesome
