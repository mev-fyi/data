okay we're good howdy happy Friday everybody and welcome to the last session of week one or hacka fest it's been quite a packed week I know a bunch of you have attended many of the sessions including Andrew so kudos to all of you who've stuck it out through this first week of official hacking we are very excited to have cake with us he works in application design at file Coyne and he's going to be walking us through a sample app and if I left anything out he'll be sure to cover it so go ahead Thank You Trent I'll take over from here so I'm going to share my screen real quick all right so my name is uh cake I guess I guess my name is Jim Vigo by cake at protocol apps and I'm working on this project called slate and slate is basically a piece of software that's open source that works on top of the file coin network through technology called power gate which is provided by textile and textiles and instructor company that provides almost a ton of really cool stuff and so I'm excited to go into slate and tell you guys more and also kind of how to build your own if you really want to so kind of touch on this a little bit earlier but slides the internet research platform it's in pre brand phrase so we're playing around so my friend made this graphic this morning for me think of it's like an ice cube and we're kind of looking to kind of add a lot of really meaningful features like I think people need image uploads in their products I think people need a way to organize their ideas extract ideas and so we use textile buckets to do this we used to help paragate ipfs and the following network and as services become more reliable we start experimenting and seeing how it could come together and to finalize product and one thing that's really nice about working on Slate today is we're going to be doing it all open-source so we're not hiding any process from anyone we're trying to allow contributions from the entire Internet so if you have friends you want to work on something like this if you just want to take the code and run with it and do your own thing you're totally open to and I think it's gonna be a lot of fun for people just to kind of be able to use software where it can be used by many people and it's not hidden from you how it works and so the reason why we're making this now is I think there's a lot of really cool opportunities that come with like a product of the scale Philo coin like it's so massive and so big and you know there's so many things that will happen in the future that are really meaningful that getting ahead of it now building some cool features and products will allow us to really kind of move forward on the imagination of what this network could be and on the Internet today we have a ton of really cool research products are used in silos so from arena to get outlined to roam like these products are really great for gathering your thoughts and ideas and Dropbox and box are really great serving users too and so I think it's a time to kind of look at the intersections and see wow what kind of prog can we build what kind of new experiences can we build and like I said earlier just opportunity to be open source from the beginning so less gatekeeping sharing everything we learn as we go along the way sharing all our mistakes because making mistakes is hard learning process and yeah so right now if you go to slate host slash system or just like the host on internet there is a react component system that you can use today and I'm going to demonstrate later how you can use that in your own website and if you plug in power gate if you plug in the component system you're gonna have something really cool that you can use and play around with just a quick note against light sources and my source code is MIT license and we do all our discussion publicly and one really cool thing about slate is we're kind of like building with everyone who wants to be part of it right now so within the last like weekend we've had seven open-source contributors we're slowly building a team of various front-end engineers back of engineers and textile has been a tremendous help I can't stress it enough like they have helped so much with building this thing it wouldn't be possible Aaron's work on the Jess library it's made life so easy check it out if you haven't seen it yet and yeah I just wouldn't totally joy to work at Excel so let's take a quick tour of I guess what we have on the well I guess what we've explored already so here's the design system it's really easy you just MPM install save slate react system and then the next code block is basically just using the primary button you can use that component today if you want to we have a 3d globe globes are cool so people have been adding blokes to a lot of cool websites these days so we have our own and we're gonna expand on it too and make it really easy to show pure connections around the world when it makes sense here's an example of you got a react component and has a few input fields and a button and if you plug it into like a response from using the Jasper gate client you can use the cony immediately so it's very plug-and-play and I really want a lot of these types of experiences that people can just plug and play so they can build apps really easily here's an example of running slate locally so slate is also a working product that you can try out today and slate will work in the web so here's an example of the web UI you can basically send file coin back and forth you can you have a list of files that are proposing deals and we're gonna add other really cool features I have had a chance to prototype all of them for this talk but in the future a lot of really cool things that come here's an example of an image that's not mine that you can preview in the app this is actually the electron wrapper so shout out to Colin who made this happen super quickly it was really awesome work and basically this kind of preview can expands a whole different things we can have video playback we can have games etc because you can store almost anything on ipfs here's an example of creating a new wallet address here's the account management so we'll expand on this a little bit more later here our default settings when you make storage deals so you don't the reconfigure each time you make a storage deal and yeah here's another example of doing file management and uploading a file and right now we don't have retrieval deals in the product but we will later time as we have you know hosted Deb nets that we can cry out and have multiple clients able to machines making rich people deals between each other and then introducing some older features that we took out they see like analytics graphs of performance etc and so here are some holder shots from a couple months ago that we were playing with that will colleague make a researches back to the product and so if you want to contribute all you have to do is go to http github calm filed plain project slash slate if you join us in slack and DME I'll bring you into the group if you want to make contributions you're more than willing there's a lot of issues there's also issues labeled for the public so let's build a website from scratch so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stop sharing my screen here and I'm going to share I'm gonna share my desktop cool so we're done with this keynote right here is the actual client so you can see here I have a photo in Emily I want to store a file on the network I click here add a file I'm going to take this photo face bear you could open source a file locally and then I can start making a storage deal its initial address makes storage deal and right now I've actually broken it so it's not actually changing its status but it would actually update the status it looking for a minor make a deal you can preview the image here you can click on a wallet create a new address here's an example everyone create the address and you can see that there's an address here and here your files and so what I'm gonna walk through actually is how to build something like this pretty quickly using our design system and power gate so I'm going to close this and right here I have a browser screen with a hello world kind of example and if I go over to actually real quick this is basically the source code for slate I'm not going to go into many details because it's available on github you can look through all of it yourself whenever you feel like but there are examples of other experiences on the follow point Network other scenes that we haven't implemented fully yet but we have plans for and so I recommend checking that out but if you are the zoom bars in my way okay if you are starting a new project let's say this is all you have and so I am using next Jas I'm using a styling library called emotion and you can see right here I have beta 13 of the power gate client and the slave react system and what I'm going to show today I kind of skipped some of the installation steps such as like npm install well so show you guys how you could get to where the slate client is today with just using a few components and for starters i think you know looking at this right here to get acquainted let's just like play with some styles so we can see what happens when we change some code so if I change this to background color red and change this to hello world if we go over here updates immediately and so next obvious question is well if we use a learn from the system will render so we have this code here button primary and so you can do take this we can say system dot button primary whoa world just primary and of course we can't use this code unless we import the system so as system from slave the app system and sorry I'm gonna pause for a second because zoom is blocking my okay so I hit save and button shows immediately so cool using the system is fairly simple components are there let's do something more meaningful so if I were to delete this delete this let's say I want to create the experience for adding or getting a token what I would do is I go deviate yeah there's a few questions savelii it sort of start a project and follow along with yeah so there is a server project I'll follow along oh wow I'm sorry to fajn so small I didn't even see that let me see if I can blow it up so is this better the size team oh you see more clearly yes great okay I'll do that one one question just a little bit up there a little bit Oh team was asking about your your console I think yeah I'll increase the size on everything so if you go to an example that's a starter project that you can begin with let's see why were there green check marks on the files you were choosing with the file uploader I don't remember the green oh that's because I was my folders in Dropbox and so that means the files synced on Dropbox see is there any background singing functionality that knows when files been already uploaded if I guess buckling not yet that's something we found adding later is that coming from the J's client yes I think I understand the question the question correctly you're asking if it comes from the code that's running the web version of slate I think I think it is yes and then is this base on power gate yeah absolutely you Dropbox I agree sorry about that and then yeah we don't have syncing working yet but I am confident that with enough effort okay cool so what I think most people be comfortable doing is going to a documentation site like this I'm looking at let's say you want to get start with power gates so you click on generate power gate token we see this example cope component probably looks a little weird you see this code what you can do is you can little bit coffee and paste this code and put it here just so we can see it we don't have to use all of it so we can take this right here this create token component we can say system dot create token use a here this code won't work because you need state so let's draw some stayed in here token let's say it's default values no and then we had a handler for it Handel creaked oaken so we'll do this we'll make it an arrow function to keep the closure of the parent and we'll just do this right here so one thing to note is that requires power get to be running locally I do have power gate running locally in the bottom left it's this window right here I'll highlight some text in it but this is power gate this is my deaf net and this is a example code you're seeing here and this is actually slave running up here and it's pulling for updates but yeah so let's see if this code works so what I'm going to do is I'm going to instead of returning the value I'm gonna do this that's that state we can do this offset state because we have arrow function that's keeping the correct context for this and we'll do token and copy and paste this here you can increase the font size of this as well yeah absolutely and it will do that and this will break because do this cool and this was supposed to happen here this can go great pal this can go here and we can do this and everything should just work and obviously we'll have to extend this and change where power gate is later on but just to prove that it works we'll go back to our code here you see the components rendering there are some issues with the type of this but if you hit crate token is generating a real harrogate token so from here on this point on we can actually start using the rest of power gate that requires a token which is really cool and takes too much time you need to know some concepts that just react and you know maybe state and how to bind a function but other than that I probably took us maybe a few minutes and let me increase the sizes to see you guys can see it is this better timo can you see clearly yeah awesome sorry about that cool so now that we have this working example let's get a list of the falkland wallet balances because that's something that you'll get when you have a power gates okay so we can go to this example here and so we can see that this is what we're expecting we're expecting two addresses names types balances and the code looks pretty simple let's find out if it actually is simple so we know that this is the pure list component here if we remember what we did in the previous example we just copy and paste that and I'm gonna add this here actually that was that's not good that's actually a bug so I'm gonna cheat unfortunately and I'm gonna look at my system file that's the real component name I'm sorry guys okay so system dot point balance this list and I'm gonna go here take this so we know right from here that we need an info object and so I'll just add info it's null here for now and I need to make this call eventually so what I'll do is I'll add a call here after you create a token to get the info and then this is not very performant or smart but I'll do this dot state info I'll just set info here and I won't render this component until I have this dot Stadium so this is using a ternary operator so we can just add a null here for the case where doesn't exist and if I go back to my browser screen find it get this turn power a token off something can't be empty I missed a step actually so I need to after I get a token what is the dock here it's set to again right again if it stopped fine cool so Jerry token I'm so sorry who such state sorry about that so I missed a mess on my variable name but once you created token here's an example plugging in letter component that will rendered a list of addresses and this is kind of cool like now that you have a power gate off token and now that you can query for your info you'll have a list of addresses we can keep going with us so basically we can try out another thing which is before I continue let me check questions yeah let's hope I you know I had a I had a dry one earlier where I didn't make any mistakes this is really sad so okay so we'll create a mattress this is kind of fun hopefully this won't go really smoothly so this one's fairly simple once you have a token you can create an address so I'll plug this component in and we'll make sure it's part of the system and it should render even if I don't so the components rendered here and I'm actually going to make a change to my code what I'm going to do is I'm not gonna have power gate live here in this function closure I'm gonna do I'm gonna add a class member let's say it's null and then instead of constant power gate instead of only being this closure I'm gonna do this stop he G equals create POW and then I'm going to do this dot PG here and this dot PG here and now I can use PG freely I don't lose that in the closure here and what I might actually do is something else I'll add a handle refresh ahead of time so I'll take this code out it's not part of this I'll go here and I'm gonna actually add a little button system what was it I'll go to my buttons I'll see what options I have I've fun primary if butter primary full I've button secondary stupid and secondary it looks fun we're very full and then I'm going to add an on click handle refresh save and so let's go back to create follow point address I'm going to do is add that function handle create address async function and I'm going to go back to my dogs I'm gonna look at this and I'm going to add take this code right here this becomes a stock PG a m-- type make default are responses from using the component from the function call back and it should just work famous last words we'll see what happens so I go back here you have one more power date thank you so much you see oh you're right you are right thank you appreciate you cool Here I am let's see if everything plays out Jerry a token cool hit refresh cool let's create new address thank you so much make it BLS make it default create address hit refresh boom we have another address so with a few minutes of scrambling and a few mistakes here and there we're able to just kind of I mean we have basically a way to create addresses and we have a way to look at them and refresh again it's filled with free textile money so that's kind of cool obviously once you have all this money you kind of want to send around between addresses so let's add another component will go to send and address file coin here's another example and just like the one before we can just kind of take this component here and I'm gonna actually put this behind this as well and so if there is no in photo shows one then this send address file coin so I'm not used to this size it's really big okay cool and I'll do here is I'll do handle send I'll go back to the docks I'll read the signature here it says source target amount pool Harrogate pool you have all those things I'll change this to this dot PG and you can console walk the response to if you want not that important cool and this one should just work as well so we'll come back here I'm going to generate a new power gate token I'm gonna hit refresh awesome we have everything on B iy BL s create token hit refresh let's make another one what is up everyone create an address fresh we have three hit refresh again now we have money let's send some money so I'm gonna send from what's up everyone to this address here and I'm gonna say let's just give up half of money or see this possible something like that no response from the call but if we hit refresh here boom we send some file coin so just a few copy and pastas and we have a way to send money between each other really easily so that's kind of cool the next thing to do is what you all kind of hopefully been waiting for is to make a storage deal so let's do that so here's the component here is name of it create file coins storage deal here is where's the clearance we'll just grab this and we'll go here of course we need system this isn't really the cleanest way to do it you we can also delete there's many ways to do this so if you're new to react you can I'm cheating by declaring this way but you can always do for reference import some specific component from slate react system but I'm just trying to be quick so I'm not I just want to save some time so we have this component here create file coins storage deal handles submit it's not really great names let's do handle create storage deal and then we'll do handle create storage deal and I can't remember what the code says so I need to go back and look at it and says I get some data and I admit it's a little hacky but I get the un8 array and then yeah it's pretty much it it's pretty straightforward so we'll take this will copy and paste it here cool and if I go back to let me double check this code sorry just got the trust this works and then wait the promised oh cool so what we'll do from here we're back at square one again we'll generate a new power gate token awesome refresh boom we have all this stuff you guys something to see this again you probably want to send money back and forth right now but I want to see the storage deal let's take out a file I like this photo a lot it's really pretty cool photo for file size makes storage deal and yeah here is a console log of the deal in progress CID status and we're making storage deals so I didn't think I was gonna play sir this so fast I think it's cuz I was maybe a little bit nervous but um yeah this is pretty much an example of how you can take power gate take this component library and you're sending file cooling you're creating addresses you're seeing the status of things you're making storage deals and then very soon we'll have peerless user accounts more examples so everything that we do in Slate we're doing out in the open so you'll get access to the same components you can hack them you can mock them you can fork them you can say you can do better I think most of you can probably do better and yeah that's pretty much it I love to open I guess like I ended a little bit early but I'd love to open the door up for any questions or if you guys want me to run through something again a lot of the work here on the components like these icons colors this globe is really fun to play with and spin around we'll definitely have this code also open source so if you want to take the globe and do something with it you can't they'll be really cool to see miners or peers or um around the world in this globe I'm not responsible for actually a lot of this work like a lot this work was done by the community so I brought in mentees strangers from the internet everyone contribute all around and so our slack group right now has about 40 people we have 52 stars on the repo but really enjoy you know working with anyone who really wants to help built this new thing that I think is a actually incredibly meaningful so yeah there's a few questions yeah for sure so there is not a list of deals yet I know that in in my in this current example there is a list of deals in the slate client but not in this one I haven't done a generic component everyone can use yet but that's next on my list we were definitely gonna add those components in so everyone can see that Aaron just like made Christmas happen today so he has all the transaction to deal transaction history that I'm gonna plug in and so we'll have components for that too so be very easy to stitch together something that has deal history that you can look back at and maybe you know make the registry at some point so you can retrieve whatever you would like oh yeah well that's a great idea thanks for bringing that up let me check it through the inner questions before I dive in yeah so I'm gonna actually show you guys how to add something to this page really quick if you guys like so it is running locally on my machine so I got a local host system you can see the local version and shout out to my friend Ryan who made this kind of like slate cue for like cold storage if you get the joke or kind of funny hopefully but uh yeah let's let's say I wanted to add a component here for looking at storage deals and so I'll walk through how to add a page and go from there so let's these these are all experience pages so they have their own URLs so this is experiences pierce list and what's really cool about the framework I'm using it's pretty light but can everyone see my IDE and my terminal just want to make sure that you guys can see it especially this file system probably see we can increase the size of this I just got the I'll just do it in terminal so you can can you guys see this this one cool so it's really big expand out here so I'm in Slate I just cloned it and I'll do an LS and I'll have a look at you know the directory here and I see this full Oracle pages so I'll go in there doing LS and pages has some of the bootstrapping that's involved for next j/s i'll go to a folder call experiences so i do to see the experiences and i'll do an LS and you can see that every single name here makes storage deal Pearse lists and address file point create address file coin wallet balances generate power gate token they all map one to one here so whatever the file name is the URL and the browser represent that one's one so we can make a new one here and just say playground yes so here's playground Jas if you're new to Unix I don't know how many beginners are watching but you can also just do like touch dog digests and so there's a like you can just create a file that way it's way faster so we can do is just copy and paste this and I can go here let's just delete all this stuff cuz it's a new example hello world change this to playground you don't have description the URL is just for string matching the show that's active playground and get rid of this cause here we can delete this as well one really cool thing about react I don't sure if you guys know but in next jss you can actually express this entire component why my computer's being so slow I'm gonna close this tap move this over here I can also Express this as export default later do all these things and it won't appear on the left sidebar I'll tell you something manual so I need to go here to system and you go system page I'll just add a component for that link this is kind of embarrassing I should probably make this automated but it's a work in progress so sad playground playground go back to the browser and I hit refresh there it is hello world so if you guys yeah sorry about that other file or other good screen and close I will have kind of close this school your info component look at your information like the component that would render if you clicked on up here in that pure list that's a great idea change the configs or launch multiple ffs oh yeah so we can do an example of settings that one's actually a pretty interesting one so we can go to let me just get let me just show you this table component I have here real quick so we have a generic table component thank you Jason for working on this and it has like copy and paste able widgets already in here so you can copy and paste different columns if you add the option if your all accepted react properties here's an example of it being used so when it comes to just rendering data we can do a number of things really easily we also can add to it as open source so you can add any other types that you want and if we go to the pure list right here I'll address ones first because I'd like to show I don't want mispronounce your name is it karate or it's karate like karate chop Oh sick awesome cool nice to meet you we can add like a way to I can show you how that type affects this table so I go to the peers list component here and I go let's see one second components modules pure list and we have the key we can say is we can specify swip but I want it to be clickable so what I can do going back to the tables page I can see what type would make it clickable and type I want is actually missing from here but I'll just try let's say file link let's see the type of file link you see what happens save I go back to the peers list and this is actually a clickable link now so what we could do is we can actually add a place for it to go if we had like based on its ID so that's an example of getting a Pierce list unlike quickly and I don't I don't know if I'm if I really want to get into the weeds right now but I want to show you how cry karate I want karate I want to show you how we do settings page right now so I'm gonna open slate in the browser just a little bit faster than running it and hopefully does not break hope this is working that's not great well maybe I'll show you just in the code itself so if I go to my I have everything organized by folder called scenes and I have a page called edit account and edit account sorry not in account settings and so you can see here I do I have an abstraction called actions where I organize all the things that will communicate with a server and I have a mapping of every single setting that power gate provides back to the exact same structure it was provided and so I - I got this is an example of I myself like a flat hierarchy when it comes to state in an application so I converted everything to a flat hierarchy but when I'm saving it it's important to get bring that back to that exact same hierarchy that existed in power gate and so here I'm doing it client side you can see how everything here is mapping back and then if I go to actions and this codes available for you on the slate repo I'm actually gonna post this in the chat for you so HTTP projects slate check that out you can follow this navigation when you go look at it but if you look at actions here I do some generic like a header config server path config I make a call a fetch call to settings here and then I include that data you just saw in that one file and if I look at my server j/s you can see that all it takes here it's just one power get called configure settings and so I had that really awesome conversation with textile like they are super easy to work with so feel like if you ask them anything they make life so easy but all I do is I pass in the config I set in the client before I made the API request and I'm there so I imagine when they add more settings they'll be just as easy as getting as long as you have the right shape of data it will it will just work and one reference that I really love using is this this is really well written like this is a perfect example how to get started with power gate I highly recommend just going through each of these and trying them out when someone wants to help me out with slate I also recommend they go just check it out this is really well-written but if you go to SRC and you go to F of s and you go to this file right here this is like a really great example of how you should comment your code like it just everything is well explained and you can see the shape of everything too so I rarely have to bug Aaron I think for like random questions it's just kind of like very yeah it's a G RPC call you can just go in here and you can kind of you can see like even what types are available for creating a new so there's supposed to be three types of follicle addresses but we're only using two and and four here just to see this type it's obvious to me there's only two supported right now so I really like moving in lockstep with this library I can see pretty much everything I need to see so yeah thanks for the question me too I'm going to maybe I'll try to get everything yeah definitely I'll coin LEGOs yeah sorry Thank You Aaron for clarifying one thing I go through dailies I I have like situations like this on Mac it's kind of a lot easier to manage these but I end up doing this a lot so I removed these manually I noticed a command for it but I just kind of like the feeling of deleting these things sometimes they just keep I think this one's because it's running this is like the only tedious part of working on slate and then these should crash so I have a command in slate that's makes life a lot easier so I do npm run dev and I do reset data one of my mentees add this shot to Daniel hope you are around but this allows me to make localnet and then I'll run this command again from scratch I'll make the local net and this doesn't take too long cool awesome and I'll do MPM run reset data team I'm stars is so small blow it up awesome okay so this should work and it works again I think I just hit the browser awesome we're at a blank slate of the Falcon client in an edit account here I didn't really show this off but I can turn myself into this Arthur I see your question I'll answer it really soon oh boy this should work at least changing this should work here's an example of the settings the front end for it so you can see configurations and so having a component for each will have tooltips too so you can he'll explain everything but yeah running and then we have like some forward backwards navigation too so you can go back and forth between scenes really easily yeah one I'd love to do that so Arthur I started working on Slate actually before a major update that the guys that Purcell did where they have API routes that are part of the framework and not like you don't either write your own server for them so I actually run a custom Express server and I take the bindings for basically rendering a react page from the next framework and so I have an Express server and then I call that function that renders a react page manually instead of just using next year's out of the box so there's a slight custom configuration there but at this as of today that will no longer be an issue you can just use next with no customizations and you should be able to just create API endpoints for yourself and you can add Express middleware such as course authentication whatever you need without doing the Express server I have a semi if you're curious about web development in general I have a example code base here that I use to kind of like Mentor it's a it's an extension of my older work with this one so I kind of explain how you would set up Postgres an Express server and like build a front-end and how the whole thing comes together a full stack which i think is actually really useful because when you're building applications using power gate or any other libraries what you're actually really trying to do is build an application and you're using the power of a library but the libraries not the focus so so what would a public version look like accessing the server's power gate Arthur to be to clarify the question are you talking about if you're running a local power gate and a local def nut what would that version look like is that what you're asking I think you I mean like a hosted power gate like if if textile thanks I was running these hosted power gauges and says so maybe maybe the question is about creating a UI and an app that would connect to those hosted power gating senses oh that's a great question thank you one that really helps um I think it's as easy as changing the host here to be honest and like not even I don't think he's had to sweat too much basically once there is a host that exists for a hosted power you just swap the value here and so in both examples that one I just did in Slate that's pretty much what I would do and I'd probably move those values to a configuration file I have them here as constants but I hope that answers your question Arthur of course - yeah but the power gate Co can be per per user or per application like with a developer ship like the app without token hard-coded in or would like a user when they like start running it with like generate an accountant okay so we have that's a great question it's a lot of it's in consideration right now like the ideal experience and one way slate will have slate will be a web app with user accounts and so we can manage that power gate token for you in a centralized way unfortunately when you're doing it locally offline or whatever you'll have to have some options to manage that token yourself and we're gonna play with the whole gambit of possibilities and make sure that there's a good experience for each of the flavors that you want so it's my way of answering I think like anything goes right now but it's definitely all those cases I think between Aaron and Andrew and I we've been talking about them briefly today I think we'll go into more of this Arthur I hope that answers your question as well yeah I'm gonna want to ask a great question earlier about how to add a new route to this app and so I have a file for that and it's called navigation data and all the routes here basically just JavaScript objects and so I'm gonna try to actually I haven't dry run this I'm just gonna try to remember one which was the peer list page and I haven't tested in a while I think its ID was like four or something like that and then I'm just gonna call it like anything goes and I'm gonna give it a custom page title like good luck Jim and I don't know what this decorator values for but I hope it is what I think it is sorry this my IDE has become really big so it's really hard to find myself but this is where this file I referenced earlier that's the wrong file sorry the next site nope file this one here are my scenes so edit account difficulty night navigation data this decorator represents what wishes the scenes to render so I'm just gonna go and pull out peers right now and I'm gonna put this here and ignore true means you don't want it to appear on the sidebar we want to appear on the sidebar so we remove this value right here and I think this should just work and so we'll have a look at the app there we go anything goes boom and then we have the old Pierce page one yeah I see your hand yeah could you like just walk through like adding a file like just the whole thing of like create a page absolutely out of file and so just just so that it's like end to end like yeah so so this was like an existing page right and that kind of seems easy because you know there's it's already there I'm just stitching things together remembering things I'm gonna go into the scenes page here and I see these scenes and these scenes that are actually as simple as like really basic react components there's nothing special about them there's no configuration that makes any different just react components and so I'm gonna make one called scene world peace because that's what I'm hoping for in the world today so we're gonna hope for some world peace export default class scene world peace extends reactive component and I'm gonna render and sorry I can't see my my code right now because the zoom is blocking it so I'm just gonna do this real quick and then return and I'm gonna do anything fancy here I'm just gonna say div hello world or world peace please and then I'm going to import Azria Saurez react from react that's all I have here and so at the scene World Peace I'm gonna go back to the pages and I'm gonna be like let's do world peace here I'll do seen world peace add that here I got to the top I'll do import scene World Peace from scenes cool and one last thing to do is instead of peers let's just do the world peace and then world peace and this should world peace so that's in under a few minutes I think it's like I should probably like 30 seconds 4 seconds you can add a new page to this really easily and it has access to all the global state provided by power gay has all that access to like you know when we add textile hubs I mean features for buckets like it will fill work as well yeah I'm hoping that everyone will be able to take this code and if it's bad they'll tell me cuz that's really there is no library actually so Joshua it's a great question I decide to not go with redux mob acts like you name it I actually did a lot of JavaScript consulting before this project and I decided that a singleton object it's good enough for state believe it or not and the browser is more advanced than it was you know five or six years ago so we don't need anything fancy and I've worked in early-stage products before where I've realized people just want to be able to read the component and know what it does and know where things are being passed down the chain instead of like imagining oh you're gonna indirectly do this thing and I also want to make it really easy for someone to add typescript or if you really want to flow flows great nothing else flow it's just like if you want to do those things and you want to add types you didn't have to go through and type Redux for exam you don't they go and type all these like complicated libraries you can just stick the simple stuff so before we added electron we were only at like 15 dependencies I'm gonna probably spend some time this weekend cutting down dependencies making sure that this is really easy to take use how you please and I hope to learn from everyone else I mean honestly people are a lot of people are just really brilliant and I think it's all about providing people an opportunity to share their knowledge around Jess I think some libraries don't teach a lot of really important principles so you use them over time and you forget things can be really simple so yeah hopefully answers the the question cool cool well thank you I this has been a huge privilege thank you guys so much sorry about the hiccups earlier but thank you for your time awesome any any final questions before we wrap up this was often thank you thank you thanks textile made me look so good alright there's no more admiration for the work cake is done we can we can wrap up there and officially cap off week one echo fest it's been a ton of amazing events and you all are the last folks to see the tail end of it we'll be sending out an email tomorrow to everybody who's in the hackathon with the list of week two events actually Andrew and I were just before this talking about how we're gonna get them in the calendar and there's quite a few again but it's all great content so we're excited to get that schedule looking everybody invited and have a bunch more great sessions as people continue to build and with that we can wrap my I'll do one more plug for showcase channel go check it out we've got a couple of things where actors are gonna make content and we're gonna make this awesome compilation summarizing people's progress over the hackathon and just really feature the hacker perspective about why this stuff is important so go to the showcase channel and hack a fess and I think that's it you call it there thank you everybody thank you cake thank you text I thank you text up [Music]
