foreign [Music] by using fee Masters I am yeah let's start today we'll talk about paymaster use cases to build on ZK sink era and uh the general agenda would be all around use cases right as we are here at these Global and we'll attend the hacker the hackathon um we are trying to build something that is Meaningful and and the meaningful part would come to the end user how we can onboard the end users to blockchain or web3 and how can we make their lives easier how can we lower the barriers for them to get started so the agenda includes us talking about what is pay masters and why is the reason why is paymaster so important uh for uh us at DJ sync and also for our mission uh the features that Paint Masters enables and how is that directly connected to the ZJ sync mission we'll go through the examination of a paint Master how we can build using Paint Masters feature how does that look like on a smart contract developer perspective and then on the front-end perspective what are those key components that connect things together and then we will brainstorm we'll go through each of you guys to ask you questions such as what do you want to see what do you want to see in the next three months if you're here and attending another hackathon if you are like a hacker a sponsor or a partner that's not important what do you want to see being built what do you want to see for your users to kind of experience when they get on web3 before diving in I am Albion ahoti and I am a developer advocacy person as you can sing Under devil team uh mainly focusing on hackathons and workshops and things like that but to give you an insight for the team we are growing our devrel team uh with engineering members so we are very much looking forward for the next three months to provide tools and use cases for you to use on the wave while you develop on zksync and yes we had some other conferences that we introduced a lot of things and one of them was the in-memory note so we do have an engineer down at the booth if you want to go and learn what is that and how you can use it Go and search for Nick because he'll walk you through that um yes so uh paid Masters and how is that connected to our mission at CK sync is that ziki sync is a layer 2 protocol uh trying to lower the barriers and increasing not only the throughput for your transactions but we really want to build on the foundational values and those are the self servers cell sovereignty uh freedom and decentralization but not just that we want to have it not just for a small group of people right we don't want to go through the world attend hackathon attend crypto conferences and be free and meet those people once in three months we want all of the world to experience that so and yeah that is connected to the freedom that we want to achieve from my ht1 perspective and then pay masters what can you do that what can free Masters do from a user perspective or developer one when they start to build things is that you have the opportunity to remove the gas fees uh in different use cases it depends on what you want to build it depends on the creativity and the perspective and what exposure you were having earlier on in your careers when you were building tools or obligations but it's very connected to the application layer of like how do we want to bring those users and use web3 this is one of the ways and we really are relying on this big feature as DJ Singh that and we want to make it big as it is because I feel like no one is knowing because there's a lot of noise on going around some base pay Master features are you can pay with any token that you want and then uh yes those are very basic right um get those nfts hack allowing them to get access to something that is very exclusive or not exclusive or whatever but we were thinking for some use cases that can be like as a developer for the developer experience walk through it's like how can we make developers not suffering to going to each of the POS possible forces to get some quarterly ease or whatever how can we make their lives easier and we want to build a tool that can just remove the gas for people who are deploying through the tutorials that we have so that is one of the templates that we want to do on our docs for the next three months with our team and I'm very happy to share that and yeah we are on the way so yes uh basically imagine all of the innovative ideas you would want to build on uh ethereum and then uh if getting those users to use your idea without the need for them to pay something with their money so it is based on in incentives and uh it's a very big one and on the code level like what will you see when you go through the uh big example that we have the hello world example that you will see to get started with paymasters is that those three sessions are very important um this pay masters is a smart contract that's it and you can Implement any logic that you want to implement to remove the gas fees and then those two functions which are the validate and pay for pay Master transaction and post transaction are important the first one is the most important where the logic goes in um and then we have the built-in flows that are the CJ sync error that provides two flows approval based erc20 tokens and then the general for the others here's a very like specific like Hello World example on the side that shows you about yeah when you go through all the custom pay masters tutorial on the docs it's very long but don't get distracted and don't get lost because there is light at the end of the tunnel and it's not that hard and then on the front end the integration side you will deploy and fund your pay masters via your front end or application perspective and then based on your logic of who will get the incentive part to remove the transactions for the users then you will add that logic there and then you will just fund your paymaster contract via front end to the back end that interacts with the contract there is the parents encoding which is like pay Master payload using get paid master params from ZK sync web3 library and then you have the overrides to send the encoded payment Master parameters as transaction overrides inside custom data whatever these are some specific information that you would want to check checkpoints or that you can kind of go and search on the dock when you go through the tutorial the good thing is that we did created the repo that has four examples real life examples they are not live for pay masters and you can go and play around to the front end connect it to those four examples we have a QR code by the end so you will get to see it but I also will go through it on on the repo so that you're aware but just search paybacks for examples that you can actually use to build on top your hackathon ideas or use cases um those four examples are these the gasless baymaster seamless covers fees for any account allow USB Masters which you can read it yourself now and then erc20 fixed pay master and then ERC 721 gated baymasters handle fees for accounts that possess a particular uh nft those are like build up there so you don't have to just having some small examples on the dogs they are already there and then you can just work it and go on the way well we do have the uh Bounty tracks for this hackathon and we uh I don't know how we can kind of expose that users actually can build full stack applications they don't have to focus on web3 something related right it's like do an application to like one demo that I am building right now is um you know the monkey type thing to actually write very fast and you like that is like how fast you type basically and they have an open API for like a leaderboard so I just want to give some kind of free nft to people who achieve some type of level so I have to do the full stack app build it up with that API and then just connect it with the results of the incentivizing site that okay if you did this uh you're inert then go use this application and that's free and you have you don't have to pay for gas because I have a hundred dollars that I can spat for you but yes um we are focusing on those type of applications uh generally based on around uh social media interaction with users uh whatever it takes when it comes to interacting with users keeping them or building traction whatever you want to build on with your audience that you have on your socials you want to interact in a way or another then you are like okay let me build an email subscription model with pay masters that I can onboard my users slowly to web3 and we can test things out in different perspectives right uh I feel like there is a huge perspective that we never went to think around because we are very focused into uh like very infrastructure level like development but yes uh you have a huge document on our tracks and there are more like descriptions on those examples that we provide another thing that we really want to see being built at youth Global is a developer tooling as I mentioned earlier our several team and protocol built on in memory note for testing it's awesome I can share on YouTube we have the YouTube from Beetle era Dev day that we organized um we got a feedback of like it's better than uh the tooling at ethereum so it's it's a very good thing to share and for you to go and test it around but yes any type of dashboards that can interact with cksync uh pay masters or account abstraction Walks Like workflow uh that you can put alerts and let the developer know what's happening on the way it would be great to be added on a developer tooling perspective and yes how uziki singera developer experience how it is for you to get on boarded we do have Smart contracts that you can write on solidity and Viper uh and then we have our compiler it's different from what you're used to for the evm uh it's the ZK sulk and the ZK Viper for both languages and then we have our SD case uh the JavaScript one which is the most famous one uh and also the hard head tooling like plugins over there for deployment um when it comes to the um deploying uh ziki Singh like smart contracts uh there is the reason why there is another deployment plugin is that the bytecode is different uh when it communicates towards the jbm but yes for more technical diving deeper into the technical aspect let's meet after the workshop and I will push you to Nick and our other Engineers who build it up we do have a CLI that you can deposit funds to cksync era which is one of the most important things uh withdraw funds to layer one and scaffold and hard hat project uh that makes your life easier so you don't have to go through all the libraries to install we do have hard set plugins as I uh mentioned the compiler and the deployment the proxy contract the verification unit tests to write tests do not forget to write tests and also the uh yeah the deployment that I mentioned uh and on the sdk's perspective we do have JavaScript SDK with this CK saying that Free Library uh go python JavaScript um we do have a lot of challenges on the way but whatever you go through you give feedback we iterate that's why we are here in a way we are also in a hackathon from an organizer perspective and partner and yes here are some numbers when it comes to uh our position right now this is a little old from another hackathon but yes CJ saying it's there's a lot of volume there's a lot of users uh but yes for me the most important part is the Developers so yes these are some links which you will get access from are uh QR codes here the first one that is in black is the developer relations team and all of the activations that we had here as Deborah's at ECC and the second one is my personal one uh in one of them you will have the payments or examples that I showed earlier and yes feel free to go through that and if you do have any questions let me know but I wanted to integrate the audience in this case and to ask questions such as what would you want to see being built in the next two or three months on a user or developer experience like what are your challenges that you're having that you really want to see being fixed from your perspective that you would contribute to being fixed or from some other team's perspective if someone wants to volunteer to share some idea hey no everything like web free related that you're here in this room might feel like you are around there too world so yes I would like to know more about the audience and get to know from where you're coming from and uh building aspect uh in their Two Worlds so yeah if or even an introduction about yourselves and how do you feel about today at UC yet global do we want to start should they started at least your hair uh hi everyone I'm Claire from vlado so basically I'm building Smart Control wallet compatible with 437 and very happy to hear actually it's my first like uh hackathon is is a global headphone so yeah listening right uh sorry yeah I'm with my team together but yeah we are also trying to build another project this year yeah yeah thank you so much on hello hi my name's Liam uh also my first hackathon I'm a hacker and I'm building a multi-lender platform for Farmers uh and yeah we're also looking into account abstraction um we need to use it for holding forward four different types of tokens and paying for gases fees so Keen to explore uh what's out there and uh and see if we can integrate uh ZK sync as well um you're more than welcome to go through the docs and reach out to us we have a huge team here ready to help on site also so yep yeah that's awesome yeah I'll reach out to you guys when I'm free and uh yeah Keen to Keen to take a look great can you pass bye yes all right thanks uh I'm Sven I'm a researcher and I'm researching iot payments okay through probably suitcasing maybe and yeah I'm still searching for a team or other people that are interested so if you are here and interested in iot payments using second layer protocols just Reach Out great at this very bad hi I'm Lucas um I will be building something maybe related to AI but I I wanted to ask you how account abstraction in CK sync um relates to account obstruction in the new ERC that is coming for ethereum where there's going to be how whether you're gonna I don't know adapt to the new standard or how we would have to deal with that yeah so our account of structure is natively implemented and uh the big difference is the transaction flow in ethereum with the ip4337 is and it goes out of the main transaction flow and it does something over there not that technical to answer that but for us it's like a natively supported and we do have like ready the library ready to be used like when you go through the dogs I don't know something to ask to share is like just part of our transaction flow and not outside of it yeah well thank you very much for coming
