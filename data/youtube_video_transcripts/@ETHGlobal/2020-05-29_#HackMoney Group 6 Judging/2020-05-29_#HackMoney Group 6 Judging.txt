you you all right welcome everybody to a hack money judging day I am car take one of the co-founders at vivre global and this is our day five and group number six of judging our D Phi X so for those of you who don't know on the livestream hack money is a hackathon organised by youth global and for the past four weeks we've had over 350 hackers from 40 different countries and 15 different time zones work to create projects in the defy ecosystem we have people from all these amazing countries and over 40 mentors who helped out our hackers with anything from technical to product marketing related challenges and and and feedback and and on top of that we had all these amazing sponsors in the dphi space who took out the time and gave their resources to help integrate all projects with a lot of their SDKs to really take the composability to the next level in this ecosystem so let me just say this again we had over 350 hackers who spent four weeks working on projects and as of Sunday night with the submissions of proud to announce that we had 180 nephi projects that were submitted for this hackathon that is absolutely incredible I can comfortably say that with this week alone we've doubled the number of defects in the space so for the next two hours we're going to be looking at a lot of these projects I want to just quickly walk through the logistics of how this call is going to go will have 14 teams that will come on stage and give up their demos where these teams will have four minutes to demo what they've built and we'll have three minutes for any feedback or questions from our judges that gives seven minutes per team in total and to make sure that we're minimizing all technical difficulties we've asked all the teams to pre-record their demo which they will be playing as they come on so a quick overview of how the event was structured the rules and criteria for this event were simple yeah a team you can working with a team will have up to five members in total that didn't mean that you had to necessarily with the team people were allowed to work by themselves as well and a lot of the hackers that we're gonna see are also individual acts but they had to incorporating the five primitive into their hack that was one of the core criterias and that every all code that you've seen at this event was written over the course of just the four weeks of the hackathon running there were some cases where we made sure that somebody was able to also extend features to something that already done and we kind of had made those custom exceptions but overall everything we'll see today was done and over the course of the hackathon itself in terms of how the judging is going to go there's going to be five different categories that artists are going to be scoring these teams and that is going to be how technical original and practical their project is along with on the usability side how easy is it to use from a UI or us standpoint and for developer tools how abstraction is coming in handy for the intended audience and of course we also have a catch-all category call we call call the wow factor where anything that we've missed in the four categories above is is can be addressed and I just want to remind everybody that this is not a competition our hackers are here to learn and share their excitement they've spent four weeks working on these really cool projects that they want to just anywhere from get feedback on so you understand how people may use them or react them and how they can make them better and this is kind of where our judges are coming in and not everybody's trying to make this a business we're not hoping that everything turns into a company or a big project we want to keep this thing in the spirit of the hackathon and the goal is to keep on experimenting in this ecosystem so want to give a quick schedule for how this call is gonna go these are our 14 teams that will come on one by one and after they get judged the top teams will move on to our finale which is this coming Tuesday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. where we will have a set of special announcements around our prizes from our sponsors but also a much bigger feedback session combines all eight days worth of judging or nine days worth of judging that we've done through the throw this entire week so everybody else on the livestream and the product of the community can check out the top projects that that came out of hack money and doing the really hard job today are our three judges Spencer Newman from PTC capital Monte villa from SIA and heart member from uma who will be telling all of our sort of teams in terms of like how they've done in kind of sharing their excitement and we're really thankful for them for giving us their time today on a Friday and with that I want to kick off with our very first demo for the day and I'd like to invite team Yoga euro to start sharing their demo please welcome them on zoom you know last surge edges to turn on their cameras as well and then we'll kick off the demos today all right here we go [Music] yield hero is a one-stop suite for managing your ahve yield currently we have two main features the swap tokens button lets you easily swap your a tokens for other a tokens via a balance or pool and the become a yield hero button lets you pledge your yield towards deserving bid lards in the etherium community let's take a closer look at each function swap tokens before this feature was invented swapping a tokens was a tedious process you had to redeem your a token for its underlying asset in this case die go to you know swap or one inch to swap for the asset you want and finally deposit that asset back into Ave to get your a token now with the balancer pool comprised of the six of a stable coins swapping is as easy as clicking the swap button sometimes you can even discover arbitrage opportunities in the pool redirect yield Ave has an often feature that lets you redirect the yield on your a tokens in real time sending a stream of money to the recipient wallet however during the hackathon I discovered there was no easy interface for making this happen sounds like a good idea for a hack pledging your yield is as easy as selecting which a token you'd like to redirect then selecting a name from the list you can even input a custom aetherium address if your recipient isn't on the list once you've redirected yield head over to the leader board to see your name on the list don't forget to click the tweet' UP button to flex your philanthropy as of this video the a token balancer pool has more than six thousand dollars in liquidity however due to extremely high transaction fees pool utilization has been weak I expect that more a token swaps will happen once transaction fees on the network go down as of this video over 36 eath worth of yield has been pledged to six different open source creators even though this hackathon is ending I will continue to reach out to potential liquidity providers and grow the a token pool with greater and greater amounts of liquidity to foster easier swapping between a tokens there have been also talks in the community of scored of turning the pool into a smart pool controlled by a smart contract similar to pi Dao so that may also be an option as far as redirecting yield I plan to reach out to larger organizations who have a vested interest in supporting the etherium community to redirect their yield towards open source creators heythe global how about you guys leave the charge finally I will continue researching new techniques in yield hacking and add them on to yield hero in conclusion this has been a great hackathon experience and I look forward to joining many more hackathons in the future thanks for watching now ask me anything [Music] all right cool hey guys this is my co-founder Jesse and uh yeah fire away a presentation by the way I have a general question what was the single biggest challenge study faced while building this be a technical non-technical yeah it's a really good question I guess from a technical perspective it was some of the the graph things that I had to learn how to do like incorporating the Ave sub graph and I even had to write a solidity contract to deal with to interact with their back-end but from like a project perspective I mean obviously onboarding people I reached I tried to reach out and find as many open source bid lers as I could find and like get their aetherium addresses and their ENS domains and stuff so once I got those people then getting the actual other people to redirect their Ave yield towards them was also you know a challenge so it's one thing to build a cool product but to actually get people to start using it it's definitely like the hardest thing but I think I was I did it you know I'm pretty happy how it went because I launched it probably I think ten days ago and we've already had quite a few redirects and quite a quite a bit of liquidity in the pool so I'm I'm pretty happy how it went by the way big fan of SIA my favorite that was the first coin that I ever traded in crypto like four years ago so very cool thank you hey guys I thought that was a great presentation it was also pretty funny so so thanks for the comic relief I'm curious if you had more time to work on this what features would you include and would you want to work on next yeah I for the redirect yield part I really envisioned that is becoming like not a competitor to get coin and their and their their way of like doing that but I think there's definitely a way to have a more social aspect where everyone can have their own profile and like you can see who's redirecting to them who they're redirecting to and just a kind of way to build up the whole an open-source contribution and to give a place on in the etherium community to have that kind of exchange so that's that definitely something I'm gonna be continuing to work on building out the social side of the yield here Oh got it yeah that's really cool I mean you can think of it kind of like reputation right yeah so yeah for sure Daniel question just on the redirect yield stuff how do you claim if I get yield redirected to me do I have to do anything to claim it now what's that look like that's actually using the Ave back-end and they have a function that allows me to do that so basically it all gets updated live via their sub graph and as long as I'm constantly updating that it gets updated live and like later I can hook up web hooks and stuff and send people emails when they get a new yield or I can do a lot of really cool things with notifications as well so that's something I plan to do hopefully even use the etherium put push notification service that was one of the hacks here so I think it would be really cool to be able to to use that thanks guys anyway I think we're on with it yeah okay now thank you guys so much and uh that Joe follow me on Twitter yield hero Dan Jesse thank you so much for for this awesome first demo it's a very entertaining and relaxing at the same time just to kind of point out for our last millions and also for everybody else on the call these things are alive and on maintenance oh you can check out helia on young hero app yep and with that I would like to call up our second team contractor to kick off with their demo please welcome contractor Hey hello everyone each time I screen for the video hello and welcome everyone my name is Wes - hi and I'm an independent a contingent earing lead I'm happy to show you today my submission for me hack money hackathon for the past weeks I've been working on a tool called contractor which is a smart contract Explorer it allows you to browse through comedy 5 projects or any other verified smart contractor me to scam you can find related smart contracts and different deployments on different networks it helps you to visualize and interact with the contract resources and its state so why did I build this it specifically aimed at smart contracts with definition and the interaction so this is not another block explore analytics tool see it more as a swagger for smart contracts that really helps you to navigate and explore similar contacts on different networks and of course everything is open source and dependency free let's dive into the demo starting here on the start page of my application I've added a sample contract that you can search for this is one that I deployed myself a few hours ago mainly to display it at any account address that is being showed resolves the ENS name of it underneath that you can see the definition of the smart contract itself this one of course is still fairly simple but let's explore a few other ones for example compounds which have their governance contract over here you can see this is getting a lot more complex already but every contract address that you see here immediately links to the to its own contract page as well so for example the time lock it has contract page you can continue to navigate and explore other contracts related to it so here again we see the admin relates back to smart contract and this way you can continue to click and explore related contracts that are linked to it not only that of course all the definitions and functions of that smart contract now let's look at another example to example unis WAP who recently did their maenette deployments so right now you can see there are three hundred forty two pairs right now in the factory contract but what does it look like on another contract I'm gonna on another network sorry I'm going to connect my Madame masque here and switch to the co phone network they're going back to the factory contract I can see here that there are 27 contracts and it allows to easily check and test on these contracts on different networks of course all the members are something that she can view and see the results off the same works of course for actual functions let's say I want to execute this one madam as pops up in order to confirm and sign my message I'm going to skip that for now but I guess you got the ID now here from you lock the user you can see as well but it resolves back my DNS name that concludes the demo for now so let's quickly go back to my presentation for some of the future work a soap plan to support for unverified contracts that are being deployed by proxy or factory contracts adding user and contract management so that you can keep track of your personal favorites and bookmark some of your contracts in your own dashboard and to further decentralize the solution and hostess on something like ipfs that's it for now I'm looking forward to your feedback thanks for watching bye bye I think it's a really interesting tool for developers I wasn't clear on what projects you used to build this solution which products which are what projects did you use to build the solution I've included or try to include both of these contracts that are related to the D Phi projects and sponsors so they're at least concluded of a compound Yunis weapon ENS as much as well it can work or in the other column on any contract as long as I have the API so linked it with with verified sources on each kind of small for example well yeah I think this seems like an amazingly useful tool and something that I wish existed so thank you for building it two questions just quickly does it require you to do any work on your side to be able to read like do you just need the API or do you need to process it in any way to make it work with contractor I'll it's just the API indeed good imitation and coding standards of course help using proper naming for your functions for your parameters makes it all easier of course to view the definition but the UI can be generated just on the API so this could be super useful for like 95 like any any contract you want to explore and it is part of the idea here yeah i'm settler and then separately what was them what gave you the motivation to build this was just as was this a point of frustration you had in exploring and interacting with these contracts or definitely yeah no definitely it was a lack of I don't think there's many tools or good tools I guess I except for this and so it's one to really perfu the state explore contract that's how they're linked together or they are on there and definitely say as a developer as well too see how something looks like it also helped explain other people maybe let the technical people what a smart contract actually is and what it means in contains all seven points of time yeah I think you did a great job this is definitely a really cool tool I've been frustrated I think like you going through different websites and clicking through contracts and it would be awesome to have something like this what do you think is the most underappreciated thing that you accomplished as you were building this project I think it was mainly collecting all the different ABI Singh contractors over different networks and I mean project their own way of working of course deploying two different test networks so gathering all together curating that list of linked contracts was that really the most they took the most time got it yes missile yeah thank you back though thanks there by well thank you so much and next up we have our next team we're going to talk about their day 5 baht please welcome Fabien from Java t5i I want I'm presenting to you the project Java T if I bought as the project name or it tells you this is bot written in Java did use the WebSphere library to make transactions in the TFA ecosystem it currently used in for API to connect to resume network and it is open source I already started working on this project before the heck money hackathon started and used this opportunity to clean up the source code and get it ready for publication whatever contouring the heaven can be seen in the committee log at the goal of the charity 5 watt is to do beneficial actions on the ECM blockchain for the diva a code system earning a profit for the user these actions include for example maintaining the dye pack providing liquidity and liquidating under collateralized assets you may ask what candid pot - currently currently it sells Dionysus or UNICEF if the tie price is above 1 US dollar it buys time on no asset so you live up if the tie prices below $1 these actions at the equity and help maintain the dye pack the body earns interest on compound if there has been no market action for a while and this action is profitable the black Circe showed that it might be beneficial to have a diversified range of Keeper pods running they've heard about all the bits on flip auctions if the options offer cheaper assumed in the market price let me show you the pot running for this demo i aluminized the balances if you use both for the first time on a net present performs improve for transactions on the time we're smart contracts for such a bot is very important to make sure nothing goes wrong the effort has inbuilt security features such as psycho prey psychic breaker that substance actions if too many failed in the last 10 minutes or there is also maximum gas price there is an easy to use big decimal wrapper to handle smart contracts that you scale big indigent numbers with 18 or 45 decimals the handling of the gas price or the price feeds can also be an inspiration for other developers the pots crates and extensive market that makes it easy to command comprehend what is happening only it is successful currently it's a successfully trade smooth time but it looks a bit just like moving the capital value between thy F and F that what also does not very much if the type Peck is off for a long time which happened recently I also integrated Travis CI and so learnt it is make sure that name install always works or that you can always see the code coverage and get information about code smells trading on OSS and Europe has been tested sometimes the transaction can fail because I was have been faster sadly I couldn't see the flipper actions yet life due to market circumstances you can see that I have lots of ideas on how to improve this despot in my list of feature ideas but sadly yeah I don't have enough time to implement them all thank you for your time very cool I love this idea I think there's you know so many opportunities for arbitrage right when you have all these different pockets of liquidity out there so so I'm I'm curious I mean how how can defence of all do you think something like this is overtime right we're in the early days have defied there's clearly you know people doing these arbitrage errs but not too many but in the future I think we'll have a lot more how do you see products like this kind of maintaining their their edge as we move forward I think it depends on you know what kind of arbitrage opportunity you're looking for on which opportunity to take and yeah for example Messing like if you look at a look at the time type epoch then my might saying that because like the tag is off for such a long time that this opportunity I'd be always there but of course then yeah you have like problems as volatility or in which other STR gotra Fabian I'll back up what Spencer was saying and that like this is a very cool project and like I think it highlights the money Legos aspect of defy the fact that anybody can run these bots to extract these arbitrage opportunities I think it's one of the coolest things you mentioned in your video you have like a long list of feature requests I was kind of kind curious to hear from you what are the top features you'd want to add to this next I think the next thing I would care about the core qualities of me making the code coverage higher so this I make sure there's no and box left and then of course I would like to add that you can use make it out to like get time your serum or like that you also use compound to get like serum in exchange for time and I think there's lots of like although adding new exchanges or saying there is no so many new projects here so it's very interesting cool curious if you've run this button over a period of time and seen what kind of data points do you have if any in terms of how you know how its performed or what profit it's got in so on and so forth yeah so I just thought for the last week and yeah the performance always depends on like ah still mostly on the SEO and volatility because like most of the time like the the assets or the value is in this year and then it heavily depends on Newseum performance losing in the last week yeah I think I made around I think according to the statistics of our import on like 40 west over all I think my time is over thank you for your attention thank you awesome well thank you and with that we are going to move on to our next project called safe and they will be talking about this on top of over the video as a voiceover so a lot on market off hey yeah hi everybody and so we are safe we did a chat but when brought people to crypto so so the problem we are trying to tackle is that many people find it difficult to to enter the world of crypto because it's full of words that people never heard before and so the concept is a bit hard to grasp some sometimes so we thought a chatbot interface to make it easier to and people to learn at their own pace was maybe a good idea so also leveraging on defy and to let people be on board it with their own wallets and not letting the fans on centralized exchange so here we have already what at first I want to hear what Tyrion and so yeah the idea is to save time in to reduce risks by educating people and to bring them also the basics of what we could call me ma Liu ji so all about culture cultural aspect of crypto and that was but yeah so the onboarding is sought to be regarding the how risk-averse god the user there will be proposed different type of investments in defy protocols so there is a risk risk assessment that is being made and also enough education to inherent risks within the crypto space and explaining all the trade-offs in terms of risk and returns provided by these protocols so namely a die so from a be and for some more risk-averse people maybe some token sets and the on-ramp we chose to do it in in stable coin to avoid risk exposure again so we restricted it to some stable crime so that's the idea so helping users make informed decisions when it comes to investing in defy and while saving money at the same time we think already about extending it to social pooling and yeah we have some ideas we could not reach the point where we thought we would be happy because unexpected problems we had we lost many stories in the chat but so yeah I look for your questions Henrique as well cool really interesting concept of implementing a chat pod for education you know in a lot of these onboarding sort of guides forms of Education I think the biggest challenge is curating content curious to hear where you're so seeing the content from how you are segregating it and in terms of just a feedback I would keep it as concise as possible because this is a chat format but yeah curiously here your process yes so interesting one because we thought about our target groups first that there was a explore released some some market research that they did about who are the users of defy and so that was always an arbitrage between how much content is too much how much how many images are too much images because we found out that i the the the if i users are mainly and thirty so yeah obviously the chatbot has to talks to you in a way that you can relate to and that's very challenging one because when you address users that's already used if i who might refer it to the loved ones who they cannot onboard one by one that's also the the seven target group that is targeted so yeah the declaration of course is happening on the long-haul being ourselves in crypto since yes we have time after time gather some contents and some sorry just so we don't have much time left i mean i'm a huge fan of the chat pod concept and I think you guys very cool to see what what drew you to this why did you want to pursue this chat bot idea because the interfaces of this buying crypto most of the time trading interfaces trading like interfaces which might not be so much appealing I think for first-time users or people who are completely strangers to to preeto so just very good directing the the monastry me you know in a more conversational way what's the other part that makes a lot of sense awesome I'm not a judge but I think just as there's feedback if you already have the content part of this ready you should also try to see can integrate with other chat pod services like telegram and make it easy for users in each of those messaging platforms to get access to this thing I'm sure this is already on your list but this is great oh thank you so much and with that we are going to move on to our next channel and that is team slingshot so I know they're here I'll let them share their screen hi we are a slingshot the team is made up of myself already a do it Ben and Ethan our product is an Unchained incentive system to encourage regular participation in ethereal meals which have long been a backbone of efforts to increase awareness and adoption of a theorem despite my kick back our project takes the state reward idea and applies it to communities that meet up regularly members stake eath to RSVP for an event where their attendance is taken attendees of the current event receives payoff from mistake in the previous event whereas stake from the current event is used as payout for the next event let's walk through a demo this is slingshot without signing into metal mask I can't interact with events first let's do that the last meetup reorganized is huge online event managed to attract lots of attendees from around the world post the event had such star power he didn't need much incentive to get people to attend it the high attendance meant stake was divided up into more pieces meaning I got only a small payoff for attending next media in the scale isn't as highly sought after getting people to celebrate the end of the hackathon where the party just isn't as exciting in the current climate people are still reluctant to leave their homes in risk contact with others not sure we'd expect their participation rates to be low e ste organiser I RSVP to support my own event but I don't expect many others to do so sure enough only a few people RSVP'd and only four people showed up in the end she's variously shot comes into play meetup organizers like stake carried over from the previous event unless attendees means more payout per person members are incentivized to show up even when the event isn't at the top of the list as an organizer I have certain functions available to me such as pausing events and creating proposals clicking on the user profile I can see a list of my activities across various meetups we'll slingshot we combine two contracts deploy and meeting ENS and proof of mira attendance to improve replication and admin functions to limit the power of a single organiser in the future we'd like to implement version 2 of the smart contract on the website including governance functions and integrate pool together builder to customize rewards as well as other items you can try out the demo yourself on this link thank you very much for listening yes so that's our awesome guys I think that is is definitely a really cool concept and you're clearly leveraging etherium and some some pretty obvious ways but I really like it a question that I have is just around the mechanics of how this works and I want to know like how do you combat the adverse selection problem right where you kind of want people to go to events in order to like be a good either contributor or maybe they're like they actually want to be there whereas when you introduce this gamification and the ability to make money do you worry about you know that potentially making it not as like a grade of an event and what are some things that you can do to combat that I guess oh yeah so yeah they're whole like putting money into relationships always kind of like complicates things what we want to do to be honest it's just to start it off with meetups so I run my own meetup and we can try it out with the attendees and try it out with smaller groups that know each other and with less fees so that the money part is like enough of an incentive but not enough for you to try and gave me too much and make money expense of others gotcha oh hey I'm sorry no not the Spencer's question have you guys truck like this in the real world yet have you actually done this with meetup yet or not quite I know so we finished but we haven't tested it out with a real meetup attendees in real but that's gonna happen surely I'm guessing right with one of your meetups yeah yeah that's the thing that's gonna be very cool to see how it all works I'm quite excited for that as a meetup organizer myself this is definitely a challenge where attendance ends up being 50 to 60 percent as opposed to what people are asleep so really interesting to see projects like yours I think maybe I missed it but what's the difference between slingshot and kick what's the other one thirty one shouldn't kick back here Sookie bags are focused on singular meetups so you stick for the event and if you don't show up you get you get your stake taken away from you and given to other attendees we want to sort of innovate a bit more on that idea and make it for a regular CD relapsed today it's not just incentivizing a single event are you also inside biasing a continuous culture of attending and participating Gaia and do you plan to integrate in some way with meetup calm or some way to collaborate so that you know attendees don't have to be on two different platforms and it's an easier user experience yeah we love to but I guess it's one step at a time sound good thanks awesome no that's not that's really cool because so this is a thing that we as if global struggle with all the time to ensure that we're doing events especially when there's no cost to the end developers you show up and come in we really had to think about ways to ensure that if there's a the attendance and start logistics are in order so this is really cool hopefully we get to try this out in the future too and more importantly we hope that actual meetups can resume you see herself thanks again and what that will move on to our next demo and that is anonymous credit they've made a really cool way to do loans without kyc so let them take over I think I chronic ready Oh welcome to hey Kai looks like you may have forgotten to check off the share audio on zoom' so we're not getting any audio here would you mind just we sharing your screen anonymous credit you can find our demo a code in the following links as a brief introduction the proton of extend is going to create a missing part or defy application non collateral lending a boring so the user can follow crypto added only by the credit the simple query system we have built in this protein is called markovia chain credit the credit and interest rate for each time of borrowing is updated based on the previous borrow it pay off in time the credit will increase and the interest rate is half hour a times here is a demo will show later it is claimed an account in where madam asked has certain credit line in u.s. dollars and current outstanding balance the second part is about how to create credit identity here our innovative solution is address mining protocol everyone has to use their completion power to create a very impressed with you is a total estate reliance and fraud credit by honoring Bitcoin the money rule is simple valium new address in 10 minutes and - tick tock t FF drafting how a cubics the devil shows not change and target hash difficulty and Mickey mind address in a browser other integrations include boring cross train BTC Oakland CDC but if centralized not GRC 20 BTC we should buy expensive chain also it we integrate trend link to use a prime speed to calculate the amount of Sibley's in market borrow the credit line is in one dollar unit you can find the integration code in the link here we will walk through the demo go over the homepage and they are binding and non-tender in my name we start mining it takes a while sometimes please so finally they dope grass and then we transfer test other it's comfort being polish your dress and see the palace here and we mind the address actually my address means that we recorded know my address to culture then we call the Law Center and click on borrow to follow some CPD see of this down you will see here the credit line is one dollar and current balance you get from the repository is this value and the Australian balance is classed our interest and later we can use our account should pay off with the total outstanding balance in once so you can recover a new credit that's all right demo thank you thank you Oh cake I got a million questions here because I think this is really fascinating so just to understand the mechanics a touch better quickly imine an address and then after I mind an address I'm initially given my initial credit limit and I can borrow against that right yes yes who is lending to me initially who's the initial lender so I mean my basic idea my filter idea is trying to do a peer-to-peer and nothing alright now I just promoted photon program to my token in the repository and as a pool and then the idea is that every time I pay back my loan on this Markovian credit chain my interest rate goes down based off of my previous like good behavior my good credit behavior is that the idea yes yes all right now the model is very simple yeah still it's pretty fascinating did you um that idea of this Markovian credit chain is that something that exists anywhere else in traditional finance or or or anywhere I'm very curious about it talk to my friend was doing lighting though should you do marquee another night and then I did how is he working on a freight car company and yet Li like don't have all his works very soft acoustic is complicated by just a shocking idea in my work and basically nothing in the future room in mind looking at the actual like poor old history rather like for those users of address who are in sequence of portals what what gives performance and Depot rate and we much better Instagram estimation fascinating okay thank you a cool concept similar to building your credit history so your next loan will be based on your history but curious as to what's the starting interest rate and then how sustainable is it to have it every X times eight times or something you mentioned we know what does that end up coming to after a few iterations is that complicated in my slides as an appendix and you can check out later so it's like so little bit complicated watch it you just make sure that it's time you can make some money I'm not doing anything oh all right yeah curious how that works but sure happy to look at this life I'm curious kind of what you think the the largest attack factors are for something like this and maybe if you designed around them oh I think the first one is like doing the karate less loin amazing one thing is you cannot find how to create a identity right so we use the mining strategy so people can know like crazy many as many address to to borrow something initially as possible so this is the first one and second one I just try to simulate like real war like credit like model price due to the kind of it we don't have too much time to work on a complicated one there's something we can work on later laughs gotcha mm-hmm awesome well thank you so much for that amazing Markovian chain demo and what that we'll move on to our next demo and that is team hell I'll let them take it away from here thank you thank you Karthik hi I'm a comedian Oh from Hull and time here with Mario and Matteo oh yeah let me show the screen from Hal Tim in this video I will explain the hack that we did the coolest hack for the WPT see wbec mode so the the hack that we did was to celebrate an important even for WB GCD the first token hazard version of Bitcoin on on aetherium for the basically the mining of 20 20 minutes of Torahs of BTC so this basically minting 1003 and 500 BTC and we build this very nice spot that notify about events on WB TC contracts on on Twitter hi I will explain how we build it so we we built a platform hull it basically helps you to connect aetherium to traditional vacation centralized application but also to execute on chain action to build a bot we basically built a trigger watching an event if you see the transaction of minting you see that the transaction will fire a specific event I mean several events the mind we transferred my conferment so what we did is take the contract basically insert here automatically the hull retrieve the API from either scan and we basically choose to be notified when or execute an action when the mind confirming event is fired so we go to we have several actions email Twitter slack telegram web book these chords and so the guys i system have shared a long video if you can you can switch over to that yeah let me see let me see if I can all right okay do you have is great sir let me recap from yeah from here okay yes can you hear the audio make sure I know we will nothing you turn off screen sure entities share that again and make sure you re optics the previous okay here be fast okay and here we go so basically okay create and here we go so basically as you may see in very few minutes I'm able to create enough connection shorted also on connection just just in few in few clicks under the hood the system is composed by a front-end react app the one that you saw that basically help you to be triggers beckon written in note that basically manage all the API for getting the tree just to be created and vikander Zoroaster written in dough that basically look for the blockchain and at the end of the day execute dee-dee-dee-dee off train action but Hal as you may see is similar to an aft tee platform but to be honest it's a state channel connector so it's an entity between the centralized one and a centralized one that basically connect the the two words we are going shortly to introduce the on train automation partnering with gelato from a gas station network to have more complex flow that help you to build the hybrid automations the idea is to be able to build anything without writing any any kind of code but just while in a graphical way all the all the parts hope you enjoyed thanks ok thank you guys sorry for playing the wrong video you know usually real-time all good man so this is a pretty this seems like a very simple useful tool to monitor if I get this right monitor smart contracts and the actions that they trigger inside them and also filter what you actually trigger based on some of the input parameters that you guys demonstrated is that is that right yeah to be honest I would like to use monitor what you can do is to track and look for what happens on change but also off chain so it's something that lets you connect moreover so you can execute if you want like in this example of chain action that in this case it's just a notification on Twitter but could be also if something happen in a back-end system something that maybe execute a trade on a single exchange or anything so right now we are just connecting the on chain part with the off chain because right in this way it's easier to build something and to create automation without bothering about you know this service that should be managed to realize it yeah I mean I'll tell you guys that I've actually been looking for something like this and it looks beautifully done very professional very clean so like excellent work on that technically just very quickly the back end of it um where is it hosted and since this is something that you want it to be you know very reliable have you guys done any thinking around how to keep the resilience or redundancy reliability on it yeah right now it's a pretty centralized I mean that we manage our nodes and we have a resilient back-end service infrastructure but as soon as we are going to introduce on connection basically we are going to leverage a network of executors basically they one provided by Giotto and others players so the idea is that in the medium term we are going to dysentry lies that specific part just for the on connection very cool guys I was just playing around with your website as you were talking and it's just awesome I mean kudos you guys are building something so user friendly and I think this definitely solves some pinpoints and use cases that people want to do I mean there's so many actually I'm like my head is spinning right now what are so what are some of the like what you would say maybe like v2 use cases you mentioned centralized exchanges walk me through kind of that and maybe there's a core user that you had in mind as well absolutely so one case that would be available shortly with the v2 is basically you can implement the five saver using half so basically you can monitor the you know dick elicited decolorization ratio of a bolt or whatever any added debit position and then you can trigger an on chain action that maybe executes the referential process or if you want to realize an arbitrage between the X's and centralizes parties you can do because you can monitor what happens in B maybe buy an ounce or whatever and what happens in Khyber and the Sun has the condition verifies you can execute the flow that Cydia so these would be what we are calling recipes so premade flows that user can share and can collaborate to so there will be an open platform like UHN analytics where people can basically build their own who as it is flows like you know you do with for a combo but will be sharable and they will spawn both T decentralized water and also decentralized work acedia got it yeah now it makes perfect sense that's that's really cool thanks Austin well thank you so much how if anybody wants to check your cell you can just go to hell XYZ it's live on production and with that we're actually gonna kick off with our break so we're gonna take a five-minute break here and we'll resume alt and I was in five minutes and all gave some of the teams and our judges say a quick opportunity to stretch their legs and just make sure that their scores are up today so we'll be back in five minutes you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you hello a Peter will be back in one minute okay all right we're we're gonna just get set up for our next demo and this just the one where I am playing at the video on my end so I just think 10 seconds to get settled all right so we have opala as our next team and I will kick off their demo video from my end greetings humans capella is a civil resistance system for the apps and a decentralized identity in the future hope Allah provides seing human uniqueness score in dollars the main idea behind pala is explosive bots protocol meaning that any user of the system can delete their ID at any time and run away with an amount of money and this amount of money is this user score the main building block of apalla is a group users join groups they gather pool by depositing money and the group's assign scores to its users now if someone decides to explode they grab their score from the pool and run away between other moments members in a sense so that they won't let this person in again the system ensures that a group is able to provide the score in this course as long as it has sufficient funds to pay for at least one explosion the same way users join groups groups gather in the hierarchy superior groups may require deposit from its sub groups and in turn add extra scores to the users display large group emerge and now an attacker chooses a group with the highest score and all the need is to prove membership by providing a path through groups hierarchy to the top group any group can provide scores to the apps but it makes sense for the app to check the topmost group as they are the largest they may and this group may require fee for providing the school groups can choose any governments or incentive models they only need to follow but explosion rules they also can choose any entry test here is a hierarchy based on reputation and personal social connection connection here is a hierarchy based on using doll membership as an entry test or his a hierarchy requiring simultaneous membership in other identity systems and hierarchies which could be very valuable and in general the system works similar similar to insurance good identity reputation means low risk of explosion and it allows score providers to give the highest score to to the user the cupola score may be used as a very reliable threshold for the apps to interact with or even as a color collateral it is even possible that the power score will be higher than a black market cost of a state ID so it has a potential to be a substitute for that during this hack we made a single group using new polyp article which requires zero deposit has no entry test and there's just out of science three dollars to anyone who joins so let's have a look first we register our ID now we join a group the group assigns us a score or three day now we can explode have a look at pool balance and our balance we still have an ID now our ID is exploded the full balance decreased our bones increased so this how it works thank you very much Peter I think this is thanks man this is I think this is very cool I want to make sure i grok it this is very cool is it kind of like a microfinance group where you have a group of people that had all sort of doubt for each other at the base layer is that like an a reasonable analogy for how to think about this yeah yeah you can use it as an analogy it's a social responsibility so if someone messes up everybody messes up in this person's group and then the ideas that you've got then that's kind of graph structure of taking these micro groups and expanding them expanding them to extend kind of like one type of credit score or type of loan characteristics yeah it works kind of like that in a sense but now the analogy breaks a bit it now it looks more like insurance so when users join groups they have at the group will assign score based on risk so if user deposits $1.00 this year there may receive $10 if this user is reputable and in the same way if a group deposits to top group so the top group assesses the risk and multiplies its deposit so it goes up and up and the users at the top get more and more scores so I'm curious how is that reputation checked or what does that identifier to give scores to people or individuals there may be several or maybe a lot of score providers basically any group can provide a score for the app but the apps are it's makes sense for the apps to choose the groups with the largest amount of people beneath the group so basically any group can provide a score this somewhere is just this this amount of what what the user can expand run away with right and what is the mechanism that any group uses to provide that score that's where I'm a little confused it's the it's provided by the protocol so the mechanism ensures that every group through the path will will pay out there and the score that they headed through the hierarchy so first group added ten dollars then legs group headed four dollars then another five dollars so they paid in backwards all this sounds to an attacker got a question so if you had more time to hack on this how would you have been proved it I wanted to build a Blade Runner down which is a group governed by by the DAO so that they decide which which dowse to let Ian or which entry test to use and to plug in into their into their group and what scores to assign to different entry tests entry tests I mean I interchanged with group so a group is basically a an entry list so we can use group to check if all the members of this group are members of a Medicare tailed out for example this is this group becomes an entry cast gotcha cool awesome thank you so much for that really cool sort of way to manage repetition and with that we'll move on to our next demo and that is project learn and earn thank you look at you uh save so vector insane community very good yeah um Karthik just a quick heads up we're missing one team member he's on the phone currently so he can't find the hands up yeah we can manually promote them so yeah his name is Daniel Steinbach I added it on the chat there we go alright we're all here so guys I'm just gonna start playing video and then we'll take questions after and open computer sounds alright pricing play hi there everybody I'm Edward Boucher from Team learn and Aaron I'm the designer and I'll be running through the demo with you we are a team of very talented developers and crypto researchers and we have a special problem that we want to deal with in the world today we want to help people save because right now there's not a lot of like systems helping us save money and we want to like solve the low completion rate for online learning courses and we think we can solve it by using crypto economics and blockchain interface for that so here essentially the rules in for our app and we could see this further in our flow diagram over here so how's it works how this all works is students as well as donors are able to fund a staking pool and each staking pool is dedicated to a course and while students learn the course for three months and that's how long it's locked on locked in for this as these same students once they complete all the tests are able to earn interest on the stake that they put down and are also able to get the state back students who don't finish give it to students ooh - and funds richer our return to donors here's a very quick glance at our at our tech stock we have Portus Ave and chain-link and that's what we're after today and for a demo I'd love to share with you our Avenue that of our run through here's our student flow here meat is actually signing on onto Khan Academy we have a a Chrome extension which is able to inject buttons and interact with the blockchain from here we also have a back-end that manages the tests and the students staking in right here we're at art history and we are going to learn and earn for this course it's very simple you go to a page where you have to pair your Portis wallet to the app learn and earn and then well while you're here you are students are able to stake a hunter die and be able to take tests and this is a test very quickly run through so once the test is done for an every test has that little course once students pass the tests here the idea is that they're more legible to gain the interest at the end of the at the end of their term they just need to like complete the other tests in the time period allotted which is three months this is zoomed in three months later what happens after three months you pass all the courses well you get your your stake and your die for for participating in this course and here is the donor flow just very quickly the intention here is that students can earn way more when a donor helps out as well the idea is donors can give as much any amount they want and die that's speaking to these pools are really are going to fund that that can support any course that nice thing is they can support any program that they want specifically if they want to but I have to go back to this page over here let's see new in the future we want to scale this up by giving alternate reward schemes partnership partnering with MOOCs to get better courses we want to like also think of a revenue share with the interest that's gained and profitability also played parching partnering the corporate donors so yeah check out our our our documentation at notion right here and a big thank you to the folks who helped us for for this month yeah so yeah that's the our video I we realized that this is not there isn't a lot of like Tech Talk here so we're ready to take any like technical questions and any crypto a model questions if you if you have any guys I don't necessarily have a question but just a comment I think this is this is a really cool concept I've started so many courses over the years that I haven't finished and this would definitely motivate me to finish them and while earning some money so really cool concept Thanks thanks so much yeah or just piggyback on that I think like even more than making a student like put money down cuz maybe they don't have it but just having sponsors come in over the top and say like we're really interested in this topic and for you to learn it and if you complete this course then you get this prize I think that could be really powerful in it and it really demonstrates the the power of like like crypto so it's a great job thanks for I'm gonna I'm gonna echo again like I also a bunch of courses I've never completed me bad economic incentives and you brought up about this idea of like giving diving deeper into the technical underpinnings of this I think you know not everything is about being super hardcore on the tecna's this is a very clean application I'm more curious about kind of the origin story and how you as a team got to this idea and sort of found this problem well very quickly on our side right like I'm part of a company called Bitcoin Bay and all our main mission is really to like like grow the blockchain ecosystem here and really some and my background as a designer is to solve like a lot of like UX problems and this when Victor approached me with this idea I found it to be like very well researched and it was a great opportunity to like tackle two major problems at the same time I wasn't concerned about like any specific ideas but when when we started this but when Victor came up to this I saw an idea that we could like tackle we quickly had a lot of legs and something that we could implement but yeah it's it's other people have other stories too yeah in terms of saving part because my background is in investment in economics so I saw the MOE interest rates really discourage people to save and I want to create incentives so that especially younger people the people who just finished school just start a job give them incentive to to save for their future whether it's a retirement or for the future investment so we try to combine these two problems basically once don't try to kill two birds saving and incentivize learning together and sorry and then for me it was definitely look like you heart and Manasi I just don't ever finish courses that I start and when I think when you have something at stake or something to gain it just makes it a lot more fun amazing is there it like very quickly is our next step for you guys where you want to take this next innocent well yeah like oh well sorry I was sorry I thought I was gonna chime in here because from a sort of a security perspective the wait so far that we're functioning is we are we are basically in an Oracle since you know people's stakes are recorded on the blockchain we have to confirm that their answers are correct when they send us their answers and you know we can't distribute the answers because then people can cheat the issue right now is has to do with how we're dealing with the Khan Academy tests oh sorry oh basically we want to administer our own tests so that so that we can receive people's answers and check them people don't have an opportunity to take the tests vaya con Academy in advance and then just know the right answers yeah sorry yeah yeah that was good yeah great well thank you so much and no this was awesome because especially when we have projects that actually plug into things that people already use especially in a million's I think that's when we truly get you sort of make this accessible and useful to everybody else and I'm also guilty of taking way too many MOOCs that I have not finished at all perfect so with that we'll move on to our next time what Congrats again on demoing and we'll we'll have a crunching come up and share their video oh I'm happy to present function projects for at mone am I so don't you follow and I'm a developer I'm building a protocol that can support centralized and decentralized famous how this work any user of crunchin can use the assets as collateral for token and those token will be automatically shot for coin coin that can be added to rigidity put a quick demo so I'm in the wallet of a user so the user will just have to select it wallet is to select it certificate and click on collateralize and when he will click on collateralize you can see in the karate a life he has he's been granted of an amount of 220 $20 so if he decided to to pay back when he will have the phone to pay back we'll see that the asset will live their collateral and will go back to his wallets here is the administers so the at the administration role is will it will be true to verify if those asset at a legit and also to inject liquidity the protocol is developed from scratch and have no GS connecting the client to the function also have implemented unit swap parties and in the future I would like to support chat to talkin and talkin to share swap and I will also go magnate thank you it's all of them with the presentation do you have any question for me please hey worried the only one on the scene is the only member of the team yeah I'm the only one allowed it to cool a really interesting project so curiously or what type of assets keep and do you collect relies on a platform like this and then how does the pricing mechanism work as to how are these assets valued yes I said that I've been added in intrusion protocol so before before doing before working on the protocol I have a certification platform that have been already so when an asset will be certified from my platform we value and all the and the ash also they fingerprint also will be added in the wallet so those information will be take will be - sorry automatically and the owner can be founded and he asset will be will be collateralized - crunchin and when we when he will pay he will have his assessment so the value are predefined when is proof of ownership and those information kyc for asset does have been done already have a seat well already the application already works ok and who's paying for this who's on the other side I didn't get sorry who's paying for this who's on the other side yeah yeah or the other side is any asset owner asset owner as associate I am collateralizing my asset I get the money who's giving me that money is it your platform yeah it is the platform so the platform have a bunch the bunkie is done with parties have a bank that will will full anytime we we generate a token so we will do it's a unit swap that will be done already with our Alessi 20 token to take some to take some 80 ash from from uni swap and give back to the user so I have a question for you definitely really cool and and anytime you know I I see projects that deal with like real-world assets I always like to dig into this question which is like what do you think the blockchain enables here and it like could you do this without a blockchain and would there be kind of similar like experiences that users would have or I really want to kind of get into that fundamental unlock that the blockchain is giving you yeah that's what what the deflection is doing there is that we without the block yet we can we can do this post currency we have many projects who are certified like a diploma so with that if INRIA in the real life I can refuse to to give you my my ownership I can I can help I can be funny every future payback but with our smart contract you will have a time to pay back so when you want when you didn't pay back you will lose the ownership of the asset gotcha so there's like an element of I guess programmability is what you're saying yes Kalen okay and so what's what's the next step here what's the thing you want to do next if you had more time yeah listen I want to do next is to to to implement F because I didn't implement f it is the I didn't implement and after implementing F I will I will go manage I will go met and after going minute I would like to do to to be able to do swap from crypto to to Fiat and what the user that I'm targeting is user who and who are not who are not able to lose technical to you to use a technical to deal with private key public key so those user I'm targeting and there are many many many many those user who just want an application that they will click they will have the default and they don't really want to deal with with reproduction anymore so those are my customers awesome well thank you so much and we hope you will keep on building this thing and and all the best for in this domain that let us know when that happens thank you great next up I'd like to call up team redefine and I kind of got a chance to look at the video beforehand and this was really cool so actually before you play the video a love for you to tell our judges what Finn for Explorer is and sort of the context around that first and then would love to see for them to see how you've extended it okay sure Marcus do you want to take that one we're trying to think of a new financial system that rewards sustainable action communities can create tokens and community members can obtain these tokens by proving they actually did something sustainably they planted a tree they had an elderly person they took the bike instead of the car there are thousands of possibilities and the idea is that that it's bottom-up and communities can just use the platform to do it Dec exactly that ok then I would share the video yeah sounds great all right [Music] welcome to team redefines presentation during the hackathon we extended our existing the app info Explorer with the functionality to add underlying sources of value to tokens a simple workflow would look like this you plant a tree you prove it with a picture you obtain a tree token now I will show you how the the app looked like before the hackathon this is the landing page it's responsive design so it also works on metal mask mobile for instance I will create a repair token basically you see 20 properties I can change I will leave the default so regarding minting and I will set the verified type picture this is basically extended in the heck up into two steps with a lot of functionality that you will see later creating the token now I'm switching persona I'm no longer the token creator now I'm someone who can repair bikes and I just repaired the bike for someone and I want to claim my repair token and now I have to submit the proof which is the picture I have to give someone's address who will approve this this is the person I repaired the bike for and he has to approve now this person has gotten a message yes definitely looks like repairing all right got verified and now you can see I have a balance of one on this repair token so let's have a look at how the dieppe looks now with options implemented to beg positive action tokens with different underlying sources of value I created the repair token again and we are in that step in the previous version there was only a free text field but here it's two steps now and I'm gonna run through them rather quickly I had a sorcerer and need the address of my collateral I added our collateral token called Kali which could also be a TV TC or RP tokens and when I created that I minted 102 myself so I can deposit on the collateral I create a contract that implements the interface all right the token is created we can see that the repair token has these collaterals furthermore it has two external sources of values one with a contract that implements our interface and one free text for this one I will and we can see nothing happened and I have to deposit something so there is some funds on this and now someone else can come claim that repair token and what I wanted to show you with the console is now this change to that worked meaning that external contract was caught through the interface upon a successful claim this person has a balance of 1 on the repair talk and wants to redeem that for the collateral so we can convert this one the repair token gets burned one Colliver it one colleague and no more repair token so this one is sort of the default case we imagine so you Beck a tree token I repair token with PT PT C or another year C 20 collateral that is considered valuable let's say after a campaign for instance token owners merge their different sustainability tokens into one token that has specific properties like its lock for some time someone deposits hundred sio2 tokens that represent hundred tons of real world emissions and various co2 offsetting tokens that are proven to do so through our proof types I can be used to burn down this hundred this one we imagine could be possible - for instance the trigger across Shan communication or start a business process in a Dao token traders can promise free museum tickets to their token holders and we also discussed a way to create decentralized liquidity via a mesh network of trusted personal coins which also comes with a universal basic income obviously that's it all right that's it yeah sorry for the quick run-through I had to compress it a lot to get into the four minutes I mean amazing yes there is an awful lot there that's that's pretty pretty compelling so okay so I'd actually love to know because there's so much here and it's so damn cool what would be the first news case you guys really want to tackle like if there is one first initial use case on that you really want to see like happen you know today or tomorrow what would that be well I can tell you what we try to do in reality in the next few months which is to use cases one is with an NGO that does time banking in Switzerland and the other one is let's say a collective in Berlin and that God got an old industrial area and they would like to well run their community there and they are already thinking about local currencies and so to reward people without using fiat and so that would be the idea to try this system out in the next hopefully in extra months and in general we try to be open there's a demo site where everyone can try this out I think there's a lot going on in this local currency space that I'm personally like super excited about so this is this is going to be fun times for sure if we don't have any other questions we'll move on to our next demo Ben and Marcus thank you so much for the second for staying up late for for this demo on your time zone you will move on to our next team and that is Project X ops and they made a really cool options protocol so I'll let them knock it off with the demo hey everyone okay let's take it away hello and welcome to axe alts we are team interlay and we have built restless Bitcoin native options so what is this and how does this work so we built Bitcoin put option as an insurance so if the Bitcoin price drops relative to the US dollar or Die then Alice can buy an insurance to protect against that and what's cool about it is that we don't require any kind of rat tokens we don't require anything special on the ethereum site except for SPV proof so Alice can just use your Bitcoin how does this work Bob essentially underwrites an auction if I using die and option contract has a specific expiry date a strike price and a premium and an alice is that insurance by paying in the premium and saying how much Bitcoin she actually wants to insure well Bella Alice can then do is if she wants to exercise the option she sends a Bitcoin to Bob and in return she can claim the die that pop has locked and she only can do so by proving that she actually did that Bitcoin transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain by using our CC relay and if at the end of the expiry date some unclaimed die are stolen the contract Bob can obviously refund those so let's take a quick look and how that works okay let's look at this from Bob's perspective so what what can do is he can sell additional put options for a search contract so let's say he selects this one which will expire next Sunday with a already certain number of die I should but he knows that he can earn what 11 die per Bitcoin that's gonna be insured on this contract so what he's gonna do is like he's gonna add some die that he wants to put in he's gonna put his Bitcoin address in there and then he's gonna select pay and what Ellis will do is she's gonna buy some options and we can see here those expire in about a week at a strike price of 9000 die for Bitcoin and there's like seven thousand seven thousand two hundred dialogue in there and we're gonna buy some of that we have to select a seller so we know in the background where we have to send the Bitcoin in KS we have to execute and we're just gonna say we have a very few bitcoins so Alice wants to have like a small insurance we can see here she only has to pay like about 1 cent for that option we're gonna pay which approves this on the die contract and then as a next step we confirm and pay the option in the in our option contract and then now what we can do is we can go to Alice's screen and then we can see here that she has purchased this option at a certain strike price and now what we can do assuming directly that this is profitable we can exercise the option this is the one that we have available that we just bought and then we would technically be scanning the Bitcoin payment here so what we would do is like when we scan that QR code we get a Bitcoin address of the seller which is Bob send a Bitcoin to that address and we then wait for the Bitcoin payment to process so essentially what happens in the background there is that we're doing the payment and we can then add the proof so let's just add something randomly here this is kind of mocked it at the moment we're exercising this and then we confirm the transaction and we have successfully exercised our option so when we reload the page we will see that this option is come from the view here right cool that was our presentation thanks for watching and yeah so this is a project done together with Alexei and Gregor oh so I'm gonna call and happy to take care of questions now guys this is super impressive you can kill the screen share so we can all see you but I am super impressive how how was it working with BBC relay were you guys able to get that implemented and working and I'm actually kind of curious just your your experience of actually using that mspb proof solidity essentially interlay is a company that works on the top ability solutions and we previously built this in rust and now we built it in solidity basically and yeah it's yeah we've got it to work I mean it took a bit of time to get used to the Bitcoin nitty gritty things below the but essentially we have some experience with that from implementing it and before yeah yeah and then like one more technical question no I'm just gonna also ask how are you guys setting the premium that you paid for the put option right now are you because it's not market based you guys are just setting a premium price based on a model yeah so how it basically works at the moment is anybody can just go in and create a option and to be honest like what we did in the video is just more or less random data what we should be using or would be using would be some sort of like Scrolls model or like binomial models or some proper pricing but we didn't get around to do that but yeah since ultimately we just allow anyone to create an option really people can just you know create their own own thing if they if they wanted to using a pricing strategy that they feel is right um guys I think you did a great job yes sir Tanner apart but it seems like I mean there's a lot of Bitcoin holders right who could be looking for something like this what was the biggest technical challenge that you guys overcame while doing this project yeah great question I guess the first well I guess the biggest thing was that options expire so we had to create like a new kind of ear see 20 a variation of that very much inspired by open that would just expire after some time so you shouldn't be able to really trade those tokens after the time so I I would say like that was probably the most challenging part because it's such on a like low-level detail that we have to change it and I guess another one was to make this as easily usable as possible so right we basically right now you just need the Bitcoin wallet so you just kind of draw our code and what we do it basically would fetch the takes proof from block stream so and then submit it for you oh you can just do it yourself but the idea was that the user really doesn't have to care too much about copy pasting something from the command line which is not that easily done a bit but we're running out of time quickly are there any attack vectors here where brought Bob good grief Alice so currently Bob could relay an Ulta transaction of the same payment type I'm so kinda we only check that an amount has been paid to Bob's address and someone could replay that from any point in time the next step in this will be to like add additional information that an attacker Sayyed can replay in the future so we potentially I cannot return for Bob's aetherium address which we could collaborate with what we would expect on a theory side thanks awesome well thank you so much ex-cops and uh with that we have only two more projects to go for today and I'd like to call up the Delp to share their amazing demo all right so Mitchell is gonna be sharing the video here you're a team mfb and we have created the decentralized autonomous liquidity provider otherwise known as the doubt so the problem that we saw is that adding liquidity unis want to earn fees is not as simple as lending money on compounder Ave you need the correct proportions of each asset to start and moving from one unit spot pair to another that is generating more fees is especially time consuming today this requires you pull out liquidity slot to new assets try to get the correct proportions of those assets and a new liquidity and then deal with all the token dust left behind sapper can help with some of this for you to swap be one but not be too regardless you would still need to monitor your liquidity and manually invest in a different token pair if it starts generating better fees our solution the DAO solves all these problems a user simply buys doubt tokens and the doubt manages their liquidity for them all we seeking the eunice watt pairs that can generate the most views it works by performing on chain calculations to rate yuna swap pairs by their ability to generate these this is done by comparing the percent growth of a pairs Square rooted k value to the total notional value of the pairs reserves this notional value is calculated using the new year sloppy to Oracle's in theory this tells us which pairs generate the most fees for the lease liquidity as you can see right now that is maker and wiith when a user purchases doubt tokens the ether they spend is added to the liquidity managed by the doubt this liquidity is swapped to the appropriate tokens so the doubt can added to the highest-rated pair so lets purchase some tokens right now if the doubt discovers a new pair that has a higher rating it will remove liquidity from the old pair and swap to the tokens required for the new pair as you can see there's an upcoming allocation to die eath when the user wants to cash out they can redeem their doubt tokens an amount of liquidity is removed from the active unit swap pair that's proportional to the number of doubt tokens redeemed and the tokens are swap teeth before being transferred to the user so let's redeem some tokens now so the risk for the doubt is the same as when anyone's dealing with an automated market-maker exchange and it's in permanent loss we're interested in exploring ways to hedge against impermanent logs such as using LP shares as collateral on Ave to take out a loan and purchase assets that can use the hedge like leverage long shorts or options we believe this project benefits schema swap with just a little bit of refactoring polish a number of functions developed for the doubt can be broken out into useful standalone periphery contracts that can benefit other is trying to develop on top of you know swap these functions are using yuna swop v2 router and Miss Ravi to library and they simplify the process of adding liquidity from a single balance of ether as well as simplify certain types of swaps moving forward in addition to supporting more protocols we want to improve the Dobbs decentralization right now there are a couple of function calls that require a contract owner and we believe we can completely eliminate the need for an owner at all because we were able to perform our rating calculations on chain we believe the doubt could be capable of operating truly autonomously with zero or at most very minimal governance with some extra work the Dow could exist completely independent and immutable with no external entity in control all right pretty awesome will seems like a very useful project product to two questions for you guys have you done any modeling around what you think the yield would be on this Delp talk the token basis we do not have any reports to show you necessarily right now it's just kind of a hunch that this would be you know a cool profitable thing but you know maybe if I got one of the the guys from the the will team at least Boston to run some data science stuff I could I could show you I'm a feeling like it actually might turn out to be very profitable which would be pretty cool to see and then the question the the current design has the Delp only investing in one cool at a time and then switching between them correct yeah did you guys think it all about diversifying and like potentially having an allocation between the pupils and I'm just sort of curious your desire your thought process about you know that design decision yeah so right now it's only doing one just for simplicity to get you know we are the project is you know end to end working right now the smart contracts are working pretty good so we wanted to simplify it to start out with but we realized that as the delp's through putting all the liquidity in one may like tank the amount of yield that you could get from the ease compared to distributing it if you had like a significant amount of liquidity to provide so we were thinking of it as kind of like a liquidity aggregator you know in the same way that like one inch or khyber aggregates on the one end you know this could congregate on the on the other end and optimized very cool very cool thanks yeah I really like this it reminds me of steak advisor product I don't know if you guys have seen that before but it's called ray so this is I think something that really want I'm curious what why did you guys build it was it just because you you found yourself in these pools and think there's a product here or yeah like we we built it because we we do actually think there's a product here like we approached the hackathon as a let's build something like independent of the sponsors independent of the goal let's build something we think people would use and see where sponsors fit into that you know as opposed to the other way around of trying to build an idea around what prizes are offered so we we started out with like we wanted to create something useful for like you know a prop like an actual problem that we see yeah cool and I guess my follow-up question would be you know I think smart or contract security is just extremely important for something like this how do you think about that especially as you kind of like get more complex over time with product well we started out from the very beginning doing a lot of testing you know having automated unit tests we weren't just you know trying to speed through it every component we were making we were trying to test with the goal of having it prepared to be able to actually pass an audit awesome amazing well well Michael and Mitchell yeah sebastian is also called a spatula - thank you so much for this cool demo and i'm really glad to see i hope that as as Hart's at the yields ends up working out so this would be really cool to try out yeah and that we are going to move on to our last demo for today and I want to thank everybody on the livestream and this call for kind of giving us a time so let's make sure that we do this thing release sweetly and nicely please welcome Penn safai for the last demo for writing hello hey Don yes we start the video is it uhm Acropolis Alex and Pamela working on the backhand side and series out from the sky there's a pretty big gecko because you make sure that it's it's not coming through your mic and you have checked the video audio share box so what is fancified how does it work it is built on a Gruffalo sauce framework which allows automatic memory management unit balancing and immediate supervision enabled by the constant curve one constantly generates interest from various defy protocols by utilizing Rob advisor who you have staked us members can also earn additional income by utilizing thresholds and caching arbitrage opportunities between unit swap and balancer balanced commissions are not the source of heels for users so let's test it out so let's connect our wallets intensifier will be using purchases for this great so here bin suffice starts all deposits are converted to tokenized shares the price changes based on bonds on curve and dries the salon is acquitted same here you can check current deposit and withdrawal price for shares let's move to the account so I already deposited sanjaya I can deposit even more here you can see a penalty fee for preliminary exits by default parameters your pension age starts in two days after deposits this is distribution tab once per day you will see accumulated distributions from you three balancer and +1 commissions here is distributions history let's move forward to the arbitrage so if you want to earn additional income right here and now you need to create executors so for arbitrage we are using flash loans you just need to choose token choose pools to swap amount add slippage click apply then input amount you're willing to earn after transaction piece balance condition and slippage inputs private key from any of your wallets we recommend using hot it's Zen click approve tokens and click run swaps will be executed automatically while your browser is open let's fast forward to a pension and withdraw our silence that's it for this hack reintegrated porches that allowed us to build a mobile version of the fund we also used balancer and Eunice web pools as a source of flesh arbitrage opportunities for flesh loans we took inspiration from other and our fund parents interests from Arva and compound so what's next we want to add gasless network token support enhance Yui weeks even more add ability to create your own pension plan add community governance for mine and parameters integrate a stack protocol to all our privacy transactions add support for various tokens and add support of different arbitrage strategies let's each from us densify is deployed on a serial maintenance and common chestnuts thank you very much yeah so I can answer your questions now thank you for the presentation for pension funds the usual end goal is to earn sustainable interest over really long time horizons 30 40 plus years curious here you know how did you decide to build a pension fund on well in this demo we set up the deposit period for two days and the draw period only for one day but in general we think that this should be long-term strategy so if you want to invest the long-term or to say to tell you're staying alert for long term this is this one maybe for you cool with the idea be pebble that you'd have different to different funds with different deposit periods and withdrawal periods or because the idea to actually have like kind of one big fund and then have different payouts directed out of that single big fund one big front and right now we only have one strategy for the whole fund but we have plans to improve it and have individual plans very cool I think it's a very compelling concept and I also will comment and say that the idea of using all of these risk free strategies to earn yield and creating a pooled investment fund to invest no strategies that's a very interesting and compelling concept that I think is pretty unique to defy so so congrats I kind of pursuing that yes I think you guys did a great job what do you think is an underappreciated aspect of your project under underappreciated something that you'd like to draw attention to maybe that you're proud of it could be it could be really anything well I think should be noted that there is two strategies the one strategy for long-term savings and another one if you just want to get money right now then you can also use the our arbitraged board and the whole fund will benefit from this not not only you got it makes them that's very cool awesome thank you so much Tim pen safai and this concludes our Friday f demo and this is our day five so we want to make sure I give a quick reminder everybody here on this call on the livestream that our finale is set to be on June 2nd that's this coming Tuesday from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. Eastern where all of our top teams from this entire week will be presenting to our judges panel that's on on the screen we have Robert leshner vitalik Lutherans Destiny coach of Ashley shop Thomas Burton and andreas and topless so I want to thank our judges again for giving us the time and their feedback to all of our teams and we will be following up on Twitter with some of our highlights from today and the rest of this week with all of our demos and with that thank you so much for watching take
