thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign [Music] good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is card sake one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the super hack finale let's get started you're all watching this thing on eveglobal.tv this is what we're going to be using for today to talk to all of you and share any comments and also anybody who signs in and kind of interacts with the rest of the live stream we'll also be getting a poab for participating at this event so super hack was hosted by youth Global and our goal and our mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the broader web 3D ecosystem and we do this by running hackathons and Summits both in person and async and for super hack for the last two weeks we just we did just exactly that this was an asicument for us we hosted an incredible Summit telling you all the things that are happening in the world of ope stack and super chains we got to learn from what's happening with optimism solo mode bass and uniswap to kind of just get some insights into how they're thinking about a multi-chain L2 world but the next hour and a half is about the hackathon so let's tell you all that's happened last week this has been a massive and incredible event for us we've got over 1150 Hackers from 87 different countries participating in the worked and came from 26 different unique time zones just to see where everybody was on from a map we kind of saw representations from six different continents and it's incredible to see all the amazing things that everybody was excited about and all the things that you built submissions were due on Sunday and we're going to talk about all the things that came out of it it's not only just the hackers we had 68 ecosystem Partners who were the the brightest and the best people in the op L2 super chain world and they were there to help and see what all of you can do we also had six dedicated ecosystem mentors who were there 24 7 to help answer all of your questions whether it was feature requests bug reports or understanding how they can help you get unblocked for your project and what today is all about is showing you all the things that came out of it and giving away 175 000 in prizes so we're going to talk about all the things that everybody's going to win and has one and uh especially through all of our amazing Partners so before we get into all of these things I want to give a quick shout out to all of our 14 incredible Partners we have optimism World coins or up base hyperlane layer zero mode chain link save the graph etherscan EAS conduit and covalent thank you so 11 55 hackers submitted and worked on 295 incredible projects this was a huge number of things for us to see review and look at and get feedback on and I was personally super excited to see all the incredible things we looked at hundreds of these projects saw hundreds of demos and we're going to talk about everything that came out of it so on Sunday everybody submitted these Monday and Tuesday we did our judging and from these 295 projects we have 10 finalists who are going to come here on this live stream and tell you about what they built and do a live demo of their projects so we're going to bring them on one by one and they're going to show you everything that they built over the course of this hackathon and after that we're going to go into all the prizes so I want to quickly give a massive shout out to our 10 amazing finalists I want to congratulate Shadow roll up shortcuts cling safe a testament per capita glowcrafter star.ccip refer on-chain review and super search these 10 teams are going to come on and demo everything and we're gonna quickly get started but before we show you the very first demo I'm going to take a quick second to thank the 285 teams listed here for working on something absolutely incredible submitting it and getting people to give you feedback coming on a call to show this to our judges answering questions clarifying things on how you did it why you built it and what you're excited about and why you got excited about all these things just because you were not one of those 10 teams does not mean you were not good enough we really want to make sure that you have an opportunity and a platform to better yourselves learn interesting things get better at coding designing anything that you're excited about from research to applications in the space and you have an Avenue to effectively continue to better yourself so to any of you here if you're still interested in continuing to build your project you are more than welcome to pay us for additional feedback or introductions to anybody you want whether it's some of our judges or some of our partners or some VCS or whatever you are looking for in this space if there's something we can do as if Global we'd be more than happy to help please continue building after this event ends because the goal here is to get more people to try out everything that's possible in web 3. and for those of you watching this thing on the live stream all of you can head over to youth global.com showcase to see all 295 of these projects you can see all the information about what they built screenshots some video demos some live demos URLs and all the details around why they built it and how it works under the hood so be sure to check that out and with that uh let's get started so all of you here who are hacking and hacked uh just before you kind of call this event finish I want to take a quick second to remind all of you that uh we'd really appreciate it if you can take two minutes to click on that link on your dashboard and give us some feedback uh there's a few questions there very simple yes no rating out of 10. uh just helps us really understand what worked well what didn't work well so we can make the next event better for the next thousand people and this is the kind of feedback we're looking for to get better and we want to make sure that we are able to help make this experience better for you and that everybody else who comes and participates in everything that we do moving forward so please take the time to do this thing will take you a quick minute and uh we really appreciate it all right enough of me talking it's time for our very first demo so without further Ado I'd like to bring on our very first on list floor today and that is team a testament so with that please welcome and test them in on the live stream [Music] hello hello feel free to get started [Music] hi everyone my name is Diane and we're a testament we're here to ensure that nft funds are used responsibly rugs happen every day here's just one example of where the founder mysteriously died only two minutes after the collection sold out well there goes that road map along with all the money in fact rugs have happened so often it results in over 2.8 billion dollars in losses this makes it hard for even good creators to stand out a Testament comes from the word testament which means tangible evidence we've developed a smart Vault where creators can fulfill their promises and token holders can attest to fund to unlock the funds this allows creators to build trust and on-chain credibility while users can back projects with confidence this is how it works creators verify their world ID and fill out the roadmap they deploy an nft contract on Zora along with a vault a user also verifies their world ID and can now make the nft Zora with an nft in their wallet the user can attest to the Project's completeness when enough attestations are received the funds are unlocked otherwise the funds are frozen until a new Milestone can be reached a testament scores are available publicly via the graph the score acts like business credit so companies like infera or chain link can actually offer discounts to trustworthy projects the score uses a weighted formula and it's actually inspired by a charity rating agency now let me show you a live demo here we have our dashboard I'm going to start by connecting my metamask and World ID this ensures that only Unique Individuals can mint nfts and create projects below you can see the collections that I currently hold and projects that I can mint to support now let's say I want to raise money to save the planet I'm going to create a new project for my Milestone I promise to plant about 8 000 trees by September 9th and to unlock the funds I'll be required to reach at least 50 percent of the minted Supply in attestations now I'm going to upload a jpeg and to keep things simple we'll have two nfts in this collection let's click finish sign Center my NFC contract has been deployed now let's go back to our dashboard and mint an nft it's reassuring knowing that the funds are going directly to a vault here and not to the Creator's wallet okay I'm going to refresh the page just give me two seconds there we go okay we can now attest to the project you can currently see that there are zero attestations but once the Milestone is reached we can attest perfect now going into the collection we can now see that there's one attestation and we can claim funds let's verify the attestation a few seconds ago the testation complete okay and finally once a milestone has been completed collections are also given in a testament score which acts like a credit score in the future a testers will also get a positive score for attesting to projects we're a testament we ensure that nft funds are used responsibly thanks for watching [Music] awesome well thank you so much for being our very first demo for the day and uh and it was a little bit risky but it worked out everything there was great and it's one of those things where you can't uh just the demo Gods may not always be in your favor but congratulations and hopefully we all get to see this thing live thank you all right we are ready for our second demo for the day and for this I'd like to bring on Shadow roll up so Taco whenever you're ready [Music] hello find Paco bites and I've been working on Shadow roll up that will derives another roll up from layer one I will explain what that means later but it does it with a different execution engine and the way this execution engine is different is that it does everything normally but it also attracts the gas usage of every smart contract and it stores it on chain so a section of Unchained storage is dedicated to having this index with how much gas every contract has used and given that this is on chain and this is mostly a normal obstaccrollab we should be able to do our fault groups for it and then we can make this data drastically available in our change our chain of choice so before getting into the demo and deeper into how this works uh let's think about why this might be interesting so first it's a sort of a proof of concept for measuring unchain impact on chain so let's say you are optimism or base and you want to incentivize smart contact developers to build in your ecosystem so you can decide to give them a share of sequencer fees in proportion to how much other contracts are used and by using something like trailer roll up you could do that stressously next you can even generalize this indexing to something that's general purpose so something like the graph but on chain where you can do any sort of uh indexing you can put on chain what without having to put it in your actual contract you do a shadow roll up thing and then you foolproof everything and then sort of putting both of these things together you can even do something like credibly neutral airdrops so instead of having one centralized entity put together this miracle tree with the recipients of the airdrop you can come up with a simple resistance algorithm put it in a shadow roll up where the right one chain with it and then hold proof it and then you decide the token distribution this way so now into how it works when I say we are with arriving a roll up from layer one uh what I mean is actually very simple so with a normal op Circle Labs users can send transactions either directly to delay or the layer one or they can send them to a sequencer which is cheaper than the chipping the sequencer puts a bunch of transactions together and sends them to L1 the takeaway from this is that everything ends up in layer one eventually so my shutter roll up takes advantage of this to read all of the transactions that have gone through this roll up film layer 1 and execute everything again almost like a validator but with the with this modified execution engine which keeps track of gas usage then for the proofs it's very similar to the shorter thing you would do to with your tokens from let's say optimism into mainnet so first you need bulb groups for the state route and once you have that users can make storage proofs for specific pieces of data which instead of being tokens in this case would be uh these like gas usage metric for every contract so now I'm going to show you a demo of this I will be focusing only in the second part so we will assume that we have a fault groups done some other way we will be running a layer 2 and we will be running the shadow roll up which indexes the gas usage in this layer too and then we will be doing storage proofs from this indexer back into the original layer 2. so let's jump into it so you can see for this this actually an optimism review deploy contract you can see how much cost it's been using according to the indexer uh this is how much we have more uh most recently proven and this is what we've actually tracked soon actually gonna show another contract you see it hasn't used much cost now I'm gonna click update this is going to generate a storage proof and it's going to send it to layer one so you can see here now the two values are the same and actually if we wait a few seconds uh we should see something move here uh given that this contract we are sending the uh stretch proof tool is the same uh contract we are seeing here these might take a few seconds oh here it is so you can see the indexer has caught up to the normal roll up and given that we send a transaction to a roll up to make some proof now that validating that roof takes gas so now we can see that reflected in the indexer so you see these numbers are different again uh so this is my demo if you are interested in learning more you can go to real bytes on Twitter and that's it for me thank you awesome well thank you so much for that amazing Dev tool I think this just makes debugging and just actually simulating things a lot easier so hopefully all of us also get to play with it and hopefully continue to build a contain to actually building this um congrats [Music] all right we are now ready for our third finalist demo and that is Project click save so without further Ado let's welcome stage hey everyone uh this is Punit let me introduce link simplifies sharing crypto assets with just a link let's get started with a small story here I introduce Tim is planning to send a crypto gift to his best friend his best friend is none other than very famous Bruce sending a crypto gift is very easy only if Bruce had a valid address but Bruce is a newbie in the Victory World so he doesn't have a crypto wallet so Tim has Bruce to set up a new crypto wallet didn't really realize this process can be very painful why because Bruce had so many questions what is this 12 words what is private key what is public orders what is chain on and on Tim became so frustrated with all these questions we all can imagine in deep situation when we try to onboard a new user into the web thing so disappointed that he started wondering why it is so difficult to onboard a new user into the web he just wanted to send a crypto gift to his friend if a single user like Bruce is facing so much of difficulty then what about the next billion user we are planning for but what can be done let's watch a demo here we can see link is already loaded we can see the chest image which symbolizes it can store crypto Assets in it let's click on setup just and create a gift card here we can see sign in with Google which actually helps anybody to sign up easily let's click on sign in with Google and select team support here we can see the team account we'll select it now we are trying to login Tim here we can see that smart account is getting set it up we can see the wallet Got Loaded we can see some balance in his account if you want to deposit more we can just click here and connect an external wallet and deposit or we can send it directly to the public address important thing to notice here there is not just another wallet it's a smart contract deployed on chain if you go into the base camp we can see it as a contract deployed on chain and we can verify the balance now let's create a crypto gift card worth of hundred dollars let's click on create an account here the transaction has begun processing under the hood we are trying to create a new wallet and trying to transfer the amount into the new gift card now the transaction is getting verified so now we can see the chest got created and we can see the hundred dollar now Tim can share this directly with Bruce you can just click it here and share it directly with any of this platform or you can just copy this and share it directly let's copy this link and head over to telegram to share it with Bruce we can see the Bruce account here now Tim will save this with Bruce so the message is sent now let's switch to the Bruce account here we can see the Bruce account now Bruce will receive the link he'll just open that link now Bruce says hundred dollar worth of gift card now we can decide to save this in the same gift card and keep it with him or you can claim it whenever the Bruce is ready you can click on flame and connect an external wallet and claim it or you can just directly send it to your public address or if he wants to transfer to the bank he can do that now let's see connecting an external wallet how we can claim it let's click on external wallet now we can see the wallet got connected it was already connected so the claim is also initiated so here we are trying to create a smart contract wallet and we are trying to transfer the amount in the gift card to the gross address now if we see the Bruce current address here in the extension it is having only one dollar now in the background we can see the chest got claimed and if you go into the transaction hash you can see the details and if we come back if we go to the specific account we can see it as a contract it it got created and the amount got transferred now if Bruce sees the balance again you can see the hundred dollar which is claimed Bruce is happy he got 100 Timmy is also happy because he was able to like facilitate this now let's get back to the presentation so on the tech stack we have built this on base without base we wouldn't have the cheaper transaction and faster transactions account obstruction is done through the safe core SDK and everything is built on next and we are using gelato for relaying the transactions and we have used valid core and with the auth as well so what is next for doing so I have divided into two phases in the phase one I am planning for the announcements like security encryption of the wallets and ux Improvement for Community engagement Rewards and in the phase two I am planning to have your system and gas sponsorship and also expand the offerings in the platform like on and off ram solution or more token supports or Dex integration that is it uh thanks everyone thanks for the global team for making this happen thanks for the judges for their valuable feedback if you want to use Link you can just scan this or if you want to connect with me just head over to telegram thanks everyone amazing thank you so much for that awesome demo and uh it's a it's a great example to actually make things more consumer ready so hopefully all of us get to try this and uh everybody watching on the live stream be sure to check it out congrats all right with this we are ready for our fourth finalist demo for today and that is Project glow grafter so let's welcome them on screen hello can I start I'm trying to get started hi everyone um my name is Damian I'm presenting our project global grafter um shout out to my partner Noah I know you have been working your ass off to raise your family and still manage your time to participate this hacks on with me really appreciate it and uh what do we build in past 10 days is a map generator for all auction games in web 3. in order to show how Global grafter works we have also built a rock live game with this long-term map generator uh we have deployed uh both our map generator and roguelike games contracts on optimism mod base as well as Zora Network and our generator the whole map generator Global grafter mainly consists of two important uh parts of the code first part of the code is what we code to generate um to generate corridors and the rooms as you can see here it's a randomly generated ones and zeros which draws out the floor your role in the game can walk and the walls of the rooms since the very valuable uh random function from chain link has not been supported by op Network we wrote Our Own algorithm to Generate random numbers to assure that uh all the routes are different in the map based on the number of rooms and the size of the map gaming map generator is too abstract you can also try our Rock live game it's pretty simple to to test the game basically you type Rock and uh connect to your wallet There's a Hero randomly generated in the game it's a play to die type of game and each Hero has four main characters on the up left part there's attack your health points on your experience and the goals the number of goals you can find it also shows the location of your hero so while you exploring the gradually generated map you'll find um you will find more goals you are also cross our doors but if you don't have higher attacks you will be killed by by the by the monster that you encounter in the game that's what what happened uh in in the Rock like again so after completing the game after your hero dies it requires you to to sign and upload all the upload all the game data on chain you need to sign twice so basically all the gaming data is ongen you can find the the data and your performance on on gra on the graph here and we also utilize uh ZK snark uh to we also utilize DK snark to avoid any cheating happen in the game so here is a code of the ZK snack we utilized in this game so if your experience in the game exceeds five thousand in our local game you'll get a you will get a rare nft generated on Zora Network and all your gaming performance and your uh your performance coding will be coded in this nft that's all about our Global uh crafter and the the um gaming map generator uh that's that's all thank you awesome thank you so much for that demo I know it's a cool way to look at more practical gaming applications of snarks and uh this is even more creative when you kind of ended up doing your own Randomness algorithm so this is really fun and uh congrats to you and your team member yeah thank you so much all right awesome we are now ready for our fifth finalist demo for today and that is team per capita so we'll get them here and I quickly start with the fifth demo welcome everybody hello so let's get started I'm Megan from uh per capita team and uh we are from blkam blockchain society so you can see who we are and we have old school Khan mehtaan and me in our team so uh what we built for super hack we built per capita and per capita is a decentralized initial nft offering platform utilizing proof of personhood and random distribution systems and we are using worldcoin hyperlane Zora and chain link so let's get started with the demo and as you can see this is our home page and you can see our Tech stack here per capita main contract lives in the Zora test net and let's actually launch an ino for this and so we create as a collection owner you can enter the name description the image giveaway time and and if the contract address and the nft price that the participants will have to take to join the offering so we created a special uh collection for the super egg final so let's create this and it takes some time to upload the image to the ipfs okay so let's create our offering let's launch our offering in Zora testnet and as you can see we are directed to the Ino page and you can see the details here okay so as an owner I can actually approve the spending of the nfts and then add the nfts here and um as an owner I will actually join so in order to make sure that our offerings are resistant to cyber attacks we are utilizing worldcoin okay so let's actually copy the QR code here and paste it here in a manual input and it will take some time and then we will verify with the world ID okay so let's verify with the world ID it's verified as you can see and it will show that it's correct proof and we will also prove this on the smart contracts so we know that worldcoin is not supported in Zora so we are utilizing the hyperlane here we are sending our Senegal proofs to girly girly test net we are verifying it there and the response is coming back to us on the Zora test net and we are using a layer 1 cross domain messaging here for the op stack functions okay so uh you can actually see our uh active inos here and let's see executable I knows when the deadline is over and as you can see uh you can see the what happens when the deadlines are over so the collection status is executable and you can see the owner here and three unique participants are here and there are actually Four nfts and uh if we execute this one uh you can see that we will earn this amount of ether and this is because we are incentivizing people to execute the offerings and we are going to execute and as you can see we have the cross chain events here we are requesting chaining vrf to produce a random seed for us but it is not again supported in Zora so we are utilizing hyperlane again here we are requesting it with the messaging API and it's coming back to us with the layer one domain cross domain messaging again we will not wait for this it takes about three uh minutes and you can see the status here it's actually pending random seat and let's see our last uh part and it is uh past dynos you can see that we have a page here it's nft Nova we have three unique participants here and uh you can see that we have we have two nfts here so this address actually one and nft and this one and you can actually come up here and claim this nft but let's switch to another address okay so this address did not win so you can see that we can claim the deposit here and uh so there's no winner here so uh yes so uh let's continue and for our future work we are planning to support initial coin offerings and distribution of airdrops and uh our first Focus will be deploying this one Zora mainnet and improve on it and when op stack chains can communicate natively we will wait for the migration of keyboard codes chaining and gold coin into options in mainnet and then we will be doing super chain messaging and uh thank you for listening and I would like to thank you thank it Global and all the amazing Partners it was an amazing journey for us thank you thank you so much for uh for that demo and uh super interesting use case to kind of do these things cross chain and uh rely on different messaging to actually make this whole thing work so it's definitely a much more fair way of uh thinking about any sort of participation so congrats thank you all right file is number five done let's get on to demo number six without further Ado let's welcome refer Armin whenever you're ready hi my name is Marvin with Team refer and like you all our goal is to be part of crypto uh reaching the next billion and what's more mainstream than McDonald's So today we're going to show you how McDonald's could have used refer to promote its nft drop by getting super fans to refer their friends who get rewarded in usdc but first we need to clarify two terms we'll be using a lot uh campaign nft and reward token in this case the campaign nft is the McRib nft the thing that the business wants the public to interact with and usdc will be our reward token meaning that if somebody refers a friend who then mints the McRib nft they'll both be rewarded in usdc so let's jump into the demo and we're going to start out as a McDonald's marketing manager that wants to create a referral campaign they'll start off by defining the campaign nft and the reward nft and we'll use these two test tokens and they also needed to find some thresholds and some payout amounts that will just kind of Breeze through this is using our on-chain contract Factory to spin up a new uh contract just for this campaign and now we need to approve the newly created campaign to just distribute rewards on our behalf as the McDonald's Marketing Manager now the campaign is fully set up and super fans can start engaging so we'll switch to the wallet of a super fan and they'll validate first their humanness with worldcoin and they'll send that on chain for final registration great now the Super Fan is registered and they have a link that they can share with friends uh and so to finish up we'll switch to a wallet for the friend of the Super Fan foreign this referral but when we were setting up the campaign we said that in order to claim you needed to have some McRib and for the sake of time earlier today uh or yesterday we went ahead and sent some McRib to this friend so they should be able to also validate their humanness register and be rewarded and will ultimately expect payout to both the Super Fan and their friend and sending that on chain create the Referral List successfully claimed and we can see that the friend just received some usdc as a reward and the Super Fan did as well 19 seconds ago so that's it for the demo and to close out uh talking about work in progress from the back end perspective we got some cross-chain functionality work being so that you could validate ownership of a token on one chain and pay out on another or perform World coin validation from a chain without native support there is a tutorial on our website for how to do this we also got started with account abstraction so that the refer and referee the Super Fan and the friend wouldn't have to pay for transactions uh leveraging safe and Pimlico and as next steps we would want to double down on our civil detection through bespoke kyc social graph and on-chain activity detection as well as integrating with oracles and attestations to detect uh loyalty Beyond nfts and possibly even off chain thanks a lot it's been a lot of fun thank you thanks Marvin uh this was a really cool demo I think uh just it's hard to kind of condense all the things that you're you're trying to do in a just a short amount of time but the fact that you get to do this super creative creativity and uh manage referrals from both sides is uh I think just a very unique way to do that on chain so this this was super cool and uh looking at the chat comments uh everybody wants on my crib now I'm including myself so thanks for that and uh and uh congrats thanks for more demos to go so let's bring on number seven super search welcome hi everybody so I'm presenting to you super search so before we dive into what my hack is let's I would like to propose a question that is what would you do after a transaction so when I make a transaction in my favorite app it takes me to these screens so I might need to click on the link that is The View on the Explorer and it will take me to the Explorer but this might not give a great user experience because I need to leave that and as soon as I enter the Explorer the Explorers are quite Technical and overall and it might not be that much easy for a new user to understand it and user might also need to refresh the page multiple times if he wants to see the updates and suppose he's making a bridge transaction then we might need to see multiple Explorers so I have to see the status of different transactions so in that perspective do the dapps have any other choice what if they do so we are introducing you supersearch which is emperoring Dash with the features of an explorer now look at let's look at the short demo of this so here I have actually learned my unisap interface which is one of my favorite swaps so I've also integrated supersearch as you could see and now I'll try to make a simple swap from Matic to a stable point so as you can see it's loading it's fetching me and I'll confirm this app which will take me to metamask and I'll make sure that I'm giving you Mr gas vsi so that my transaction goes fast and as you can see tanks is getting submitted and the transaction is picked I did that and it's continuity thank you Okay cool so my transaction got success and you could see all the details the status has been successful and you could also see still block related data from where do sand from the value of the transaction and the transaction free caspase Etc so if you also like to verify for whether I have received my swapter I could just click on my address so it is currently loading my address now it will actually fetch me the balances and also the recent translations so super cool so now I've received my swap token also so apart from this what all features that are there so there's a feature where you can search for addresses you can search for transaction and also the ens domain now I'll make search for a simple ens domain let's say John 2.0 and then selected substitute and it is as simple as such so as you can see it also loaded so integrating in your apps is pretty much easy so now I'll just close it and I'll show you how easy it is so you could integrate all of it with just a single line of code you just need to insert it inside the header part of your tab and you're good to go and going ahead we have a lot of features that we want to build currently we are in a MVP Stitch then we want to improve the user experience for a normal user and you would like to also give a proper reason for why a transaction might have changed and other features like gas tracker nfts stiffy data Etc and we would like to add faucets for test stats and educating a user in the technical terms is also fighting for them and we would also like to update the searches Builders information so with that I wrap up my presentation so if you guys would like to check this research you could just scan the QR code I would like to thank each Global the judges and the responses for hello letting me present this event and it was super fun to work for this thank you I was a really amazing slick demo just uh super easy and all needed real world utilities so congrats on shipping that and entrepreneur this is now just a few days away from being a norm where everybody wants to have this small widget there to let everybody see what's actually happening on chain so congrats and hopefully all of us get to use this in in the wild yes thanks thanks though awesome moving on to more Dev tool related demos that's welcome on chain review Talent team whenever you're ready um GM I'm Don and here is our divers team on Champion View we are from size stream it's a tech company in Germany um is the missing tool to review and to attach deploy smart contracts for office Tech Developers and why did we build that first and foremost is to solve our own pain points of reviewing contracts but we believe this can also solve other people's problems as well then let me skip this and show you the demo of the tool so first you select the chain here you can see all the chains that we are supporting currently and I will click the ethereum and then you can type in the contract address that you want to review first thing you see is a source code of the contract and the same contract if you scroll down a bit you can see this this includes the here we identified all addresses of this contract and this includes the hard-coded address in the contract and addressed affected from ethereum blockchain state and or so you just scroll down a bit more you can see the variables that holds the address and if you click one of this you can also see the source code of the contract that that is deployed on this address and another important important functionality of the tool is the ability to attach the contract here you can click the test after you finish your review the important part is that we are not only attesting the address of the contract but also the hash of the code so this helps to make the review attestation more reliable and now we change the state and also show the revoke button and the third functionality which related to the video test attestation is the ability to follow other trusted testers for example you can follow your co-workers or you can follow the known auditors with the contract attestations as well as the followers are stored on chain for transparency once you follow the user you can see their attestation on the top part as well okay and also you can go on your profile page and then see your follow your old actions and see who you are following and also the followers that you have and this was our demo here's our future plan with this project our next school is to build this into a fully flooded suit for unchain reviews of deployed contracts and the further goal is to include Nova solutions to incentivize and align a higher number of independent contract reviews if you have any career regarding our project you can reach out to us using this email and thank you all for your attention this was team unchain review amazing thank you so much for that really cool demo and uh like an awesome collaborative way to actually do reviews and actually make sure things are performing as expected on chain especially at the number of weirdness we've seen with sneaky code in there so this is great I hope they always get to use it and congrats thank you very much all right we got two more demos to go so let's bring on our second last finalist for today Stardust ccip it whenever you're ready hello yes my name is David and I'm really interested in making blockchain games that you can play outside of a browser and that you can play across multiple chains so for this hackathon I made a stardust which is a space clamorous game that uses chain link ccip to send secret cargo between blockchains and I built it using Godot which is an open source game engine I use Godot rust and ether's rs to handle private keys so let's launch the ship pretty quick here it's going to take some time to get it for between blockchains but first I'll put some Cargo in the cargo hold and then we'll go to optimism so here's some lag here as the game waits for a response from our PC node and you also see that there's no metamask there's no web wallet required because ether's RS can handle the signing of transactions so a game like this in the future people download just straight from the games Marketplace or an app store so the majority of gameplay right now is just about shipping three different kinds of cargo between blockchains so you have Anodyne which is free it has a small reward you have Tech which has a modest cost and a modest reward and you have Contraband which is probably the most interesting of the three and then it's the most expensive and confers the highest reward but it also carries the risk that other players can basically try and catch you as you carry between blockchains so the way this works is other players can see when ships are coming you know between blockchains and so if they suspect a ship is carrying Contraband they can put up a certain amount of currency in the certain amount of collateral in the form of game currency and put a claim on the ship and so that when it lands there are certain consequences for that action which I'll talk about later but I want to talk first about how this system maintains privacy and the secrecy of information because in the game you just put in the values in the cargo hold you just put you know you choose your destination you press launch but the smart contract is public it's on public blockchain so how do you prevent people from just seeing the fact that you carry Contraband in your cargo hold so the way this works is when the player picks values for their cargo the game will pad those values with some zeros and it will concatenate concatenate them with the salt that's generated by Godot and then Godot will then hash those that that string to create a Shaw 66 hash and I'll put that hash on chain into the pilot struct so at this point you know the hash is a secret that only you know because only you know the values that were used to make that hash um but Godot handles all this for you so you have to worry about you know managing the hash yourself and constructing it properly the game client has been coded to make sure you can't submit bad values but the smart contract is there to make sure that people can't slip past you know the incorrect values so anyway once you've committed the hash to the pilot struct it is sent cross chain through ccip and when it arrives you need to sell your cargo before you continue playing the game and safe to prove that your hash was made correctly so to do this you can supply the sole Supply the values that you had on chain and unchain they're padded and then they are hashed and that hash is then compared with the hash you committed to the chain previously on the previous chain so the hashes should match and if they do the SMART contract invalidates to make sure that the values you supplied were valid so it makes sure that you for example you didn't provide more cargo and your ship could actually hold and also make sure you have the money to pay for the cargo that you just sent because your charge retroactively through the cargo that you sent along the reason why we do this is because if the amount that you spend was public someone watching the contract could infer what you had just purchased so we want to keep that information secret until the moment that you actually have to reveal your cargo and as I mentioned there is this system in place where if someone suspects you're carrying Contraband now they can't they can't know it because they just see your ship and they just see the hash in the cargo hold but say that you have a large ship and they think it's worth the risk of trying to catch you or if they see your shipping history like okay this person ships Contraband pretty frequently so I'm going to try and catch them so they can offer up that collateral deposit and they can make a claim against your ship let's say you were carrying Contraband and they catch you so instead of getting reward for selling your Contraband you would actually lose your cargo you lose all the money that you have spent on the cargo and the person who made the claim against you they get a small Bounty as a reward however if you were clean and you weren't carrying contraband you receive their collateral as an extra reward on top of your cargo you know what you get for selling your cargo and of course if you were successful in carrying a Contraband across nobody put a claim on your ship you get a really big payout and that's the risk and the reward that comes from you know taking Contraband and taking that risk that no one's going to put a claim on your ship so we have arrived now in optimism so let's sell our cargo real quick and once this transaction clears we put a claim on our own ship so we should get penalized for this instead of getting money we should actually lose some and yes unfortunately because we put the claim on our own ship Contraband was detected so yes that's the the majority of the gameplay for Stardust and thanks for watching there that was a really cool game demo and uh just really impressive that you're able to do this thing in a week uh congratulations thank you very much can't wait for uh on-chain Eve online rehearsing of this lvlb Ultimate Dream this is this is amazing all right well thank you so much and with that we are ready for our 10th finalist demo for today and without further Ado let's welcome our last finalist team shortcuts whenever you're ready right hello everyone my name is Alex my name is Sergey and we want to share with you what we built during zth Global project name shortcuts well love smart contracts rather as devs or users openness implies transparency and building on existing foundations is easier challenge Horizon discover and verifying of new Jabs also they often come with a unique user experience which may not always be convenient for newcomers with shortcuts our way of doubling these problems making it super easy to mix and match smart contact actions and helping you find new stuff effortlessly presented in a user-friendly UI let's move on to the demo yes uh we start by getting two shortcuts app and then the first shortcuts we will create is uh Bridge into base what it does is we select the chain first and then amounts that will be variable and required for every launch of the shortcut and then we add actions actions is different smart contract calls and then you select the contract we fetch the API of this contract and then specific parameters you can also use inputs that you defined before and this is the bridge and Quantum the base uses and then we publish that we can add more actions to to make a multi-step um this transaction is posting the shortcut to ethereum Education Service um on optimism as soon as it clears uh we see that its base Bridge here we use graphql to fetch that from es and then we can go ahead and just run it so you remember that it's on ethereum on L1 so we can switch chain and this is something that I will um I want to bridge but before that I want to assimilate to see if it's really uh something that you know I expect to happen and we use tenderly and then it loads that it is indeed L1 Bridge some coins will be transferred this amount that I set so all good before that I can also go ahead and inspect that when I inspect that I can see that it's indeed a es optimism uh posted by me this is the chain use the name and then the ipfs ID so you'll be able to go ahead on ipfs and check that you know the shortcut is uh legit and this is basically the shortcut definition something like that it's from a different one and if you find with that to save your time next time you can save it to bookmarks for later and then we can basically go ahead and execute and you see that it's a mainnet transaction I'm going to send this amount that Heath to the bridge I'm sending it and while it happens uh it may take some time so um what we'll do is we will explore what else is there um we prepared some other uh shortcuts and one of them is actually on our GitHub where all the code is posted for this uh project and this is a donation shortcut so you'll be able to send us some op on the mainland so for that we have two different actions it's two different smart contract calls and as we know that wallets are not great and call in multiple contracts it's going to be two different transactions we'd like to use save for that so we use Save and integrated natively so you don't need wallet connect or anything like that so you can just select whatever safe you control and then you can propose transaction right away if you are you know one of the signers and I do the sign and then transaction proposed I can go to my save now which is here and then in the queue you'll be able to see that transaction is indeed here just post did two different actions but not just I approve spending hope and then I do the donation with this amount of hope you can actually uh you know go ahead and explore what's there and you see it one up I will just execute this transaction um assign it and then um it goes wild in France um it's the time that we go and check what happened to the bridge well most likely it did it yes because the bookmark is saved as well and you can go ahead and explore this um bookmark to rerun the shortcut you can also share the link this link is basically you can post it anywhere in Twitter or GitHub or anywhere else I think we covered um more or less of all of it and then in order to try that yourself you can just go ahead on shortcuts WTF and um you know give it a run thank you Alexander Sergey that was a such a cool hack the fact that it's live and everybody can use it and you also got that really nice domain name it is amazing I think the perfect mix of uh a Dev tool but also a utility for everybody else and uh and a good service for everybody to kind of quickly get started with a lot of these block connections yeah congratulations thank you thank you well this concludes all 10 of our finalist demos and I want to quickly also congratulate these 10 teams again so a

check out all these things now on youth global.com showcase these things will appear on your dashboard in the next minute or so if they're not already live with the caching and this gives you the ability to check things out on your dashboard or check things also directly on your project page and now before we can wrap things up I'll just make a quick announcement around the price delivery so everything that we talked about is a tentative and not a final announcement of prizes which means that over the next couple weeks we'll be verifying everybody's code bases making sure that we have all the information that we need to know to fully make sure that these things are finalized which isn't everybody ensuring everybody worked on the projects after the hackathon started all the team members were there we don't have any comments from somebody who was not registered as a team all those things will kind of happen over the next two weeks and our deadline to kind of do all of that and finalize everything is September 1st and after that is when all the prizes and your stakes and everything else will be released and there are a couple of kyc requirements from some Partners so there may be you may be in that category so if you fall into that category as a recipient you'll be getting a note separately around some compliance related things that you'll have to satisfy before your prizes can be given to you so keep all that on the look in your inbox all this will be communicated to you over email and uh that's kind of the final note on the price delivery so this is very much closer to the end of super hack and when I make sure that before we wrap things up and kind of say some thank yous and talk about what's coming up so I want to give a massive shout out to everybody that made this event possible obviously there's a lot of roles that work behind the scenes to do all these things but I want to start off with all of you amazing hackers I'm with 1150 of you took the time to work on Amazing projects for 10 days and you put your heart and soul into it you made something you were proud of you showed everything to everybody else out there and you shared everything with the world so congratulations to all of you for taking the time and participating at this event this means a lot to us I want to thank all of our amazing judges for talking to everybody on a live call from 80 different countries learning about what they were excited about how they built something and giving them feedback and advice on how to take them further so congratulations and thank you to all of our judges all the amazing mentors and volunteers that made things work in the background ensuring that you have the best experience no matter which part of the world or what time or what time zone you were on thank you to all these mentors and volunteers who made this possible amazing set of speakers we did workshops talks and everything that you can now watch On Demand to learn about what's happening in this space and really stay up to date on all the latest tech and research I want to thank all of our speakers for all of that and the amazing set of Partners who have been here to
