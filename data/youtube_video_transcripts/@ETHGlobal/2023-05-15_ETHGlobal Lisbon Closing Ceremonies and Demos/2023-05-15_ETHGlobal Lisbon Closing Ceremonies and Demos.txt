foreign six five four three two one this is not a conference if you've been to any couple events you'll know that this is a hackathon [Music] this is our first event in Portugal yeah I love The Passion of the Heights been great to see people diving in hacking on things asking really good questions many people think this is a really competitive thing and it's not and I like that when you finally achieve like what you were trying to do that's like the best moment [Music] good afternoon everybody super excited to have all of you at the closing ceremony for youth Global Lisbon my name is kartik and my slides have disappeared but I'll get this going anyway thank you so much for making it till the end our goal is to talk about all the things that happened this weekend for our first ever event in Portugal 975 attendees were here this weekend with us and out of that 650 were hackers from 51 different countries and 30 percent of them were new to web3 trying something for the very first time in the space this is amazing congratulations to all of you you made it so many people came in from all the countries and cities nearby and even more from the rest of the world and the next hour and a half maybe two is about what came out of the last 48 hours now remember this is a hackathon and our goal at 8th Global is to onboard thousands of more developers into the web 3 ecosystem and as part of that this entire weekend was about building and focusing on developers and because we believe showing is way more important than telling what's going to happen for the next hour is going to be all the things that people built and you get to see those things live so let's get to the hackathon itself I want to keep my Spiel short because I want to focus on code 650 hackers spent the last two days working on Amazing projects and collectively they built a 183 projects give yourselves a massive Round of Applause that is incredible we just literally added almost 200 projects to this ecosystem and [Applause] in addition to all of you who spent all this time working on these projects I want to thank all the judges who spend all of their morning a little bit of their afternoons talking to all of you giving you amazing feedback and just being there to support and get and share the excitement so please join me in giving a big round of applause to all of our judges stani hate them Danielle Simona Diego Elena is yours and on Alex Leo Alfonso Arjun Rafael Julia Nuno Christina and Ilya they were here all morning with us helping all of you stay in this space get some more ideas get some feedback and help you continue all these projects and on top of that all of our amazing incredible Partners so I'm going to make you clap a lot in the next two hours so we'll we'll do this again one more time so thank you to all of our amazing Partners one inch World coin optimism polygon knows his chain air stack ape coin ZK Bob fuel save ethereum Foundation cartesi Uma metamas Falcon Virtual but she's last protocol unit swap Foundation the graph Avi great style mental chain link sismo scroll and neon Foundation all these amazing Partners also saw all of your projects and they're going to tell you what you want from all of them very soon so let's get back to these 183 projects 9 A.M we saw this number go up and then 9 to 1 pm where all these projects showing and running around the building up and down showcasing everything to every everybody and from all of that we chose 10 incredible finalists so what's going to happen today is we're going to bring on these 10 teams and they're going to demo live what they built so you get to see what also came out of this event and some of the projects our judges were excited about but well actually without further Ado these are our Tel finalists so I want to give a big round of applause to credential Corgi dookie's buddy local Pro crypto Bureau prinky protocol web 3 GPT 4 donation station change EBT and op compressor these are our 10 incredible teams they'll be coming on one by one and this is what happens when you don't sleep enough you figure out and you mix up the slides but before we get into all of these projects I want to take a quick second to thank all of these 172 teams that also made something really really amazing just because you're not one of those 10 teams does not mean something was wrong or you were not good enough all of you did something incredible you submitted a project you did something that you were excited about you built something that you wanted to build and you submitted and showed it to the rest of the people in this building almost a thousand people saw and we'll see all these things and even more so please don't think of this as discouragement continue building this thing we really want to see a lot of you push more code after tonight to the same repos give yourselves a massive Round of Applause [Applause] and to those of you who are watching this on the live stream and to everybody here in this room you can head over to eat global.com showcase and you can see all the projects listed out with what they built who why they built it what they were using under the hood and their Source codes some demo video screenshots all the good stuff is now publicly available for all of us to look and before we get into the demos I want to make a really really quick point all of this is us doing this thing for you and we again only improve things if we know what's broken or what can be improved so on your dashboard after you simulate a project you would have seen this action item on the right sidebar just give us feedback there's 10 questions we have for you just fill them out a lot of them are just one to ten type of ratings and an open text area for you to tell us everything that we can do better please take two minutes today tomorrow now to just fill out this form and just tell us what we can improve we want to do these things more and bring this to more parts of the world and the more feedback we get the better we get to make them for the next group so please please please please please fill out this feedback form now I'm going to stop talking I'm going to go into demo time so without further Ado let's welcome our very first demo project for today and the team come on up credential Corgi is our first demo and please give him a big round of applause take it away all right thank you so much so credentials are all around us we use them every day ranging from passports to medical records and with zero knowledge proofs becoming more feasible we're now able to use these credentials in new ways to prove things without revealing uh private information but there's a problem here which is uh zkp enabled credentials need a very strict format for these proofs to work properly and right now we have issuers of zkp credentials who are also defining their own formats which means a credential issued by one issuer won't be compatible with the same proof system as a credential issued by someone else and so with credential Corgi I'm creating a zero knowledge proof cred credential ecosystem that separates out the structure definition from the credential issuance so I'll show you how it works now so I'm going to connect with metamask this is deployed on a evm networks and that's in order to store some structured data on chain so the first step is let's say that we are an international Aviation agency and we're trying to Define what a pilot's license looks like so what we can do here is Type in plain text um we can type in plain text a description of what a pilot license is so we're going to say it consists of a pilot's name the expiration year of the license and whether they're certified for commercial flight or not so essentially three fields in plain English and so now this is going out to gpt4 to generate a well-structured structured definition of what a pilot's license looks like so now we've got that and if we agree with this definition of a pilot's license we can publish it through the chain so I'll call this a pilot license not publish it to the chain this is going to initiate an on-chained transaction to push up this data and basically assert that we're saying this is what a good pilot's license should look like no matter who issues it all right so now we can see this is deployed to the chain now let's say we're um we're an aviation agency of a specific country and uh someone has just earned their pilot's license and we now want to issue it we're going to choose the pilot license credential format and we can populate those fields in here so let's say vitalik has a pilot's license is good until 2030 and let's say he is certified for commercial flight this is just generating off-chain data this is the private certificate that's going to be sent to vitalik and along with that we have this uh Poseidon hash which is compatible with zero knowledge proofs and so this Poseidon hash can be published on chain to demonstrate that this zkp enabled credential really is valid but without revealing any of the private data so now that that's been published uh let's say we're an airport and vitalik is trying to fly a plane from our airport but we want to make sure that he's really certified to fly but he doesn't want to reveal all of the private data in his pilot's license to us so what we're going to do is describe in plain English what we want to certify so let's say we want to certify that vitalik has a pilot's license valid through at least 2023 good for commercial flight so we're going to choose that structure input that description of what we want to verify and we're going to generate this request and this is also using gpt4 combining that Json structure with the request that we made and this is going to generate structured requirements and this is what we're going to send to vitalik essentially to prove but it gives us this unique link which we can just send to him I'll copy the unique part of that into the page that vitalik would land on and then he can see okay this is what the airport is trying to convert firm but I don't actually have to send any of the private data on my pilot's license I'm simply if I agree with this uh this request I'm going to paste in my credential which I receive privately along with the zkp compatible hash and I'll generate a zero knowledge proof to show to the airport that I do meet these requirements without giving up any private data and this part takes a little bit longer because this is compiling a zero knowledge proof um and uh generating is compiling the circuit generating a proof and you'll see it's quite a bit of data that gets output here this is using a JavaScript library called snarky JS and you can see here we have this Big Blob of data which can be sent to the airport to just verify that um that vitalik in fact is authorized to fly and just to show kind of the failure scenario here let's say that his credential data said he was not certified for commercial flight the same process would attempt to happen but you'll see in just a second we'll see an error it's a little bit obscure but basically it'll say one of the constraints was not satisfied and that's how the airport will that's how vitalik would fail to prove to the airport if he wasn't really eligible well um so yeah that's uh the current state of credential uh Corgi moving forward I plan to make this support composable proofs meaning maybe you have a medical record and a health insurance card both issued a zkp compatible credentials you could generate a single zkp showing that you need a medication and that your insurance covers it show that one proof to a pharmacy and be prescribed the medication so there's a lot of potential for this to help a lot of people thank you so much amazing that was our very first demo for today out of 10 this is just the first of many AI collaborations you're going to see so without further Ado let's welcome our second finalist of the day project dookies [Applause] yeah hello everyone we're dookies dookies means decentralized cookies what we've built over the weekend is a solution for ad targeting but with privacy preserving features and we face this every day we browse the internet when we browse the internet we can't stay Anonymous we don't control the data we share we get irrelevant ads and annoying ads and we can't monitor monetize our data dookie solves this everyday problem now in terms of the demo what we're going to show you is three different roles the first is the role of an advertising campaign manager Tai Chi here works for each Global and he's going to create a new ad campaign for each Waterloo and that's what we're going to show as an Advertiser next is we're going to show you as a user how a user can record their preferences but without disclosing their identity and this piece uses zero knowledge proofs and lastly we've built an account abstraction wallet which effectively allows you to create gasless transactions which are funded by The Advertiser but not only that we also can display the relevant ads that the user has chosen so after the advertiser here's taiji he's a marketing manager for eth Global he wants to promote his Waterloo event he's going to create an ad campaign as you can see he's chosen the image and the groups he selects is people who have a Bitcoin passport ens are members of the ens Dow water and uniswap contributors so he wants to basically Target his ad to these three groups without knowing who they are and this part creates the zero knowledge proof we do also interact with the contract here so we've added we have a budget which is in goal and the budget for this campaign is a hundred goal what will happen to this hundred goal is it'll be split from The Advertiser to the user of the ad who views the ads so they'll basically get paid for their gas transaction as well as the content publisher which could be web 2 and in our case it'll be a wallet so here we go we've created a new ad campaign this ad campaign is on chain [Music] and now we'll move on to the user preferences screen so as a user a user can select whichever groups they feel they're interested in so a user can say hey I'm a Bitcoin passport holder I'm an ens Dow holder and and with zero knowledge proofs we can what will happen is it'll validate and create a dookie or a decentralized cookie which has all the user group information and the preferences but doesn't have the user identity so a dookie is created and you can see it right there on the user's browser and so now this user will be able to use our account abstraction wallet which will give them gasless transactions so here's our account abstraction wallet and we're gonna send some ether and as you can see it already recognized that we have a dookie and we're showing a disclaimer now when we click continue we'll reflect on the user groups from the dookie and show a relevant ad the last step is when we send the transaction gas will be paid by The Advertiser which means behind the scenes there is go token which The Advertiser has paid for this user's transaction the gas fees of this user's transaction as well as the content publisher which is the wallet holder okay and we're done thank you [Applause] amazing that was demo number two and it's even better when the teams do our advertising for us it's lovely see you all in Waterloo too up next is demo number three without further Ado let's welcome project buddy [Applause] cool all right what's up everyone thank you for for selecting us as finalists this feels pretty amusing and this is like our baby so very happy with this um I'm Kat I'm Kevin um this is Buddy so buddy is an application that allows you to find hackathon Partners Tinder Style yeah it's built on lens and it has like ZK proofs I think we're the third project now to talk about ZK first but you can ZK proof you're a crypto knowledge or skills so you can verify that you have those skills um without actually showing anything about your wallet or about like your GitHub profile and stuff if you want to not be docs yet all right so why did we build this application well um back at East Denver we actually came across a very common problem amongst designers and developers a lot of people couldn't find complementary Partners or team members at all like it was kind of crazy so luckily for us I'm a designer and front-end developer she's a blockchain developer and back-end developer so naturally we kind of complement our skills right and what we want to do is help others get that same exact synchronization with your skills with the web3 uh twist I guess yeah so we've built this um like it's completely with lens so everything you do on buddy is going to go onto your lens profile and everything you do on lenses building a buddy as well just like super composable and everything and then we've also got these ZK proofs that we're using sizmo with so whenever you want to prove that you have like maybe you've been an eth user for a long time or maybe you've won a hackathon before so you have like a token from the youth Global ens address or something you can like prove that on your profile qualify it maybe exposing the wallet address that you had out there if you want to keep that private so then you can the way that it works is that we've created a collects a collection module within lens and so that anyone can actually create a publication that is connected to this connection this um collection module so you can anyone can select select a type of user they want to be able to collect this module and then it's completely just done over lens the user is going to attempt to collect this publication and if they log in with sesma connect and they are like a part of that user group so say they do have like East since like 2017 where they have contributed to eth GitHub core or something then they can like get this they can collect this publication onto their profile and that's going to be across the whole of lens and then says our buddy is going to check like it's going to verify specific ones and then those are the ones that are showed on your profile so we have a little demo here this is what it looks like this is after you've logged in with lens just like the super basic login flow um this is like the Tinder thing this is lens protocol it's the one that's like coming up for me because it's like a recommended follow that I work with them um so these are their like zoinks here is what we're calling their ZK proof skills so they're a hackathon winner they are a core eth contributor and also an early eth user so I can like them then I see Ave it's another recommended one for me don't want to talk to them we got Stoney hell yeah so I can go to my matches up here this is currently connected to like my test environment so there's a lot of soundies there um but yeah these are all the people who I've liked and they've liked me back and it opens up it allows you to start a conversation with them so we sign this this is just like our lens conversation this is very one-sided so you can start a DM and here this is completely on lens so like on Tandoori you know the way you have to like get their Instagram and stuff you don't have to do that you can just message them from here and then they get it on their lens profile so profile is where like all the fun stuff happens so you can see my zoinks here so I'm an early youth contributor on a previous hackathon winner and I can add some extra ones into there this is my bio from lens and then this is the kind of zoinks that I want to find in other hackathon partners for when I'm building it so what's next so basically what we want to do is get better and more zoinks or basically these are your badges for your achievements right and we want to work uh with sismo and let's collect more of these sewings another thing we want to do is actually uh get if Global into this because obviously we're in a hackathon so it kind of just works out uh and lastly we want better filtering and teams and match matching algorithms algorithms yeah I think this is really exciting we can totally make better matching algorithms since like everything you do is on lens it's like really good somebody actually told me this the first day I came here he was like really International algorithms don't know where you are but that could be super cool yeah we just want to make this like super composable really portable anyone can create a publication that basically just access like a ZK proof on lens that's it yeah thanks guys [Applause] awesome next up finals number four please welcome team local Pro there's no big round of applause [Applause] hello Lisbon uh we are local Pro where Global organizations team up with local independent workers we are bringing on-chain coordination to offline work opening up a new and fairer local job market so under the hood we're using safe account abstraction to abstract complexity and zero knowledge with polygon ID and ZK Bob to maintain privacy our mission is to build flourishing local economies and communities and it's key to note that we're addressing a real world use case one month ago I did a workshop with the city of Amsterdam where they highlighted that they really struggle to find incentivize and coordinate qualified local people to host activities for kids after schools but that's just one use case we've thought of a bunch of others iot device technicians on the ground sales people lots lots of opportunity so let's get started so this is Nico our local Pro worker Nico arrives at the local Pro Marketplace here you can see which roles he is able to apply for and what credentials are required note how this other role we have uses an award from the Amsterdam role as its application criteria so you can start to get an idea of how sharing these credentials across organizations will reduce the cost for all of them so benefiting all of us Nico decides to apply for the Amsterdam teacher role and so now has to prove he has the credentials to be assigned the role so when Nico clicks verify Amsterdam uses a custom polygon ID verifier to check the zero knowledge proof that Nico has those credentials and then issues a new credential for the role of guitar teacher city of Amsterdam the credentials are securely and privately stored on his device thanks to polygon ID so Sergey now will demonstrate the issuing and verification process so right now this is on the wallet in future this would all be abstracted under the hood so I can't really see what's happening hopefully you can so Circa is issuing a credential which for demonstration purposes will say this task has been complete in reality you've checked into the right place at the right time along those lines Nico then connects it to his polygon ID wallet it's authenticating and it's okay and then I think in the app he needs to accept it so he now has the credential that he's completed the task we now in a separate process move to verification so Sergey has a QR code open that has been generated zero knowledge proved that this task has been complete and here we go again using the polygon ID wallets and there we go okay so back to the uh demo so now we want to do performance verification so if we take a look and note that uh there's 12.75 in the wallet at this point in time so Nico arrives at the task location um at the required time and checks in this is important because especially in Amsterdam's use case they have a bunch of people who turn up to these tasks late uh or not at all so we're trying to create verifiable proof of performance that we can build reputation and incentive systems around and then finally to allow organizations to further incentivize workers we can create custom credentials so here for example Nico has completed his final task received two four star reviews uh so he has fulfilled the requirements to get the trusted teacher certificate from Amsterdam um this logic is currently centralized but polygon tell us we can do it decentralized in a few months time and then further with the task completion we automate a payment we've used ZK Bob to maintain privacy here so there's no connection between the organizer no public connection between the organizer and the worker so if we refresh the page did we see the updated amounts ah there we go okay so the updated amount appears in his wallets already and now Nico has this trusted teacher credential we can unlock other roles so back the role that was initially locked is now available for him to apply that was a demo of local pro thank you so much for listening thanks to the team for all their hard work and congratulations to all of you thank you amazing I am really liking the integration of all these things to day to day events and just problems so that was demo number five or four up next is crypto Bureau welcome cryptibular team and give them big round of applause hello everyone we are happy to be here today and we are a crypto Bureau team uh two persons we had a lot of experience in web 2 and decided to try ourselves in web3 so um I first want to set the problem uh and the solution that we proposed then we will get right into the crypto Bureau so uh we decided to take a look at the overall utilization problem uh sorry and uh uh as you can see here on the screen we all know that this is usually the really uh like 150 collateral that you need to pay to lend money so um we gave a look to the existing solutions that we could propose and of course we thought about the key proofs and uh decided that we can not only try to like lower the percentage but also try to provide the under collateralized uh lending for people and we saw a lot of flexible solutions that we could try and use and build so-called protocol that we can try further to distribute uh to all and let's go yeah so this is the demo uh we can see the crypto Bureau I already signed up in here um this is my address this is my basic score that I have right now this is my collateralization coefficient meaning that for like any given 130 I can get a 100 loan and then I already put some collateral in it and you can see with this coefficient I can only get like 76 uh Euros for this amount of dye we also use a number of different proofs that me as a user can provide to the system to uh basically showcase my trustworthiness and hopefully a system will improve my rating invest based on this different proofs we use broad ID it's already connected here for the demo purposes and um it basically allows us to links to link different addresses to the same human so you're not like avoiding uh and they're not creating a new identity every time you need a fresh new score so if you uh like mess up your score it's forever with you and we can use other proofs for instance we can verify that you have a specific nft and then your owner a specific nft we use the ens here we generate the proof on cisma for that and then the proof is sent back to the app and the app actually asks you to send it to the uh to the contract and this is the proof data in there and the proofs are being verified on chain so all the proofs here they they are verified on chain and you can already see that it reflects my collateral coefficient and my score has improved because I'm like a noun or NS owner and I'm kind of you know a trustworthy person uh the another one and you can also see that uh available funds also increased and another cool stuff uh we have is that you can provide a ZK proof of your funds in like traditional economy Fiat money we use true layer API it allows you to connect to your bank account uh really popular in the UK and the coinbase uses that as well if I connect that um using the sample credentials it will generate the access token to my like mock balance bank account and then it will generate the proof we use zocgraders it's basically a wrapper for ZK snarks and it's our own circuit that certifies that we basically have a specific over specific amount of money and it with that you can get a huge upside in your score and you already achieved like under collateralized loans but you can also try to maybe lower it a little bit more for that we have a proof of diploma so if you have a diploma and you can try to present that and if you're indicated enough maybe you know how to handle money and stuff so we use polygon ID for that I have the app on the right and then I can scan this uh we should uh my University issued my me a diploma with like specific GPA score and I can sub interproof verifying that I have something more than that I will use my wallet for that to sign this because it's been submitted on chain that's why I need the wallet and the verification will be on chain as well for the proof so this is the transaction details and then we wait for that to process and then the magic will happen on the front end yes and then we have the lowest collateral the highest score and you can see that for 99 die you can borrow more than 110 Euros let's try to do that and if you confirm it would also immediately reflect your coefficient we didn't use any like super Mass but still it's it's a on the protocol level so everyone working with our protocol can read the collateral coefficient and read the score make decisions build other lenders and stuff and moreover if I repay the loan back then I will basically improve my rating a little bit as I'm like a good player if I choose not to do that well everyone else using the protocol and you can see the collateral coefficient improved uh we'll be able to know that I didn't pay back and as I don't have another word ID because I don't have another pair of Readiness I'm stuck with this bad score until I repay uh as for the protocol side as I mentioned uh this is uh um the three different parts one part one part is you can build other lenders we'll build like a reference uh really simple you'll see it many lender you put one token as your collateral you can borrow another one you can build other lenders uh lenders are able to read and everyone else can read the score details and coefficient for any account and even the human uh using the nullifier hash and then we have a protocol for building a different ZK verifiers we have this snarics polygon ID where all the idea system right now you can create another one they can improve the score affect the score and then lenders the only thing in protocol they have to report all the uh like how much the person borrowed and paid back so it updates the rating for them yeah that's that's about it thank you more D5 looks like the talk about d5's feature at the opening did something because this is a lot of cool recurring themes and even more experimentation so congratulations next up is our demo number six pinky protocol please give them a big round of applause foreign today I'm very excited to present you pinky uh it's a peer-to-peer NFC rental protocol that we built for the past two days with my team behind it allows true ownership for the boar no collateral is needed from the borough also and it's fully scalable as it's pluggable with almost not almost any nft collection um I would like to present you quickly my team we have two solidity developers that are just right behind me we had one full stack developers and one front end I'm the product guy and I'm very happy to present you how our solution working and why well-being it so today you have two systems if you want to borrow or if you want to land an NFC you have a school lending but you don't have fully access on the nft utilities you also have quality or as lending but you have to bring collectible so we wanted to build a solution that tick all the boxes here that is collateral free that allows the borrower to enjoy 100 of utility access that's suppressed uh Delete the risk of liquidation for the lender that works for any collection so that is scalable and account attraction ready so let me explain you a little bit how it works first we have a lender that needs to list his nft on the platform so tune transaction one approval and one for the listing a daily price and a lending duration the board will choose these NFC to rent on the protocol the app it has to install the plugin on its smart contract wallet we use safe wallet for this and once it has installed the plugin that is working with safeword it must clear any operator of the targeted collection for its wallets for his security purpose the board send the transaction pay one-time fee to run the listed nft as soon as he is doing this transaction the lender automatically receives daily payment while the NFC is transferred to the borrower wallets how plugin build with save board prevents the board from transferring the nft the lender claims back as nft once the landing period is over and the plugin is automatically deactivated a quick demo on how it works you arrived on a catalog page let's say you want to borrow the purple go you first have to connect your wallets you use metamask once your wall is connected you can borrow this nft you have a price per day and you have a total price once I click on borrow I will need to sign an approval I assigned the approval then the transaction will be sent it's kind of the time you have to take a coffee or take a break because we are live it's not a fake demo but it's already done good news so we confirm the transaction sorry for my fire window once the transaction is signed you just have to check on your profile to see if the nft is actually listed and we had two because one was already listed but as you can see the number 8091 is here so let's go back to the presentation to see how it works we build it with safe so it's a smart contract wallet that most of you know it was the best framework to below service in two days leveraging account attraction we plugged a plugin if I can say so with safeguard that prevents nft to be transferable and leave the Border wallets we use a subgraph that fetch lending and renting events that are on chain Alchemy to fetch NFC data react.js for the front end wag me for the Smart Control iteration and rainbow kits for the wallet Authentication The Next Step first are many round ux the very next step we want to the borrower easily clear operators on his nft because this is a security pose better ux implementing the plugin on the safe wallets and make the return of the identity automatic because now the lender needs to claim is nft to have it back in his wide we also want to overboard to choose a period of time for the renting instead of letting the lender Define this period obviously these are the very next step that we want to work on but there are many use case that we want to build and we want to be adaptable for such as gaming for example or token gated experiences and I just have to say thanks for your attention have a great Sunday [Applause] amazing thank you so much all right we're almost at the end finalist number seven web 3 gpt4 please give them a big round of applause hey guys uh my name is Mark I built web3 g54 uh so I just got plugins this weekend and I was really excited to uh start messing around with them and I think they're super powerful and working with chat GPT is is going to be awesome um I got a prompt ready here so we're gonna just jump in to a new chat and let's go ahead and give it this prompt we're basically going to ask it to create a smart contract for us added some criteria to it it's an access list and then we're asking for it to deploy to mantle testnet as well and if you guys see at the top I have my plugin enabled and it's running locally all right and let me say make sure to deploy to mantletest.net and the cool thing with chat GPT is you can just you can just halt it if you see something not going the right way and tell it and as you see we now have the chain ID in there that we needed and the context is always there it's still new the the contract was already starting to write which is really awesome but uh onto the project itself so basically I'm running the back end with next JS I found a really cool boilerplate where instead of using a python backend they just did it with next JS and they were able to uh use uh open a open API to um create a schema so that you can actually uh have openai detect your plugin and then use it on your uh on your front end on your chat so we have the source code done and it should be sending to the back end and we have we have a small issue so it looks like they're doing an import in the contract so we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and say we're gonna go ahead and say don't use any Imports especially when I'm live demoing and hopefully it'll be quick with that response because we are keeping the progress from before so let's go ahead and see how it's doing on that looking good and the cool thing is you could actually deploy uh multiple you can deploy to multiple chains at once so as of now it's just a hot wallet in the back end but that could easily be made into a smart wallet or using something like safe to provide account abstraction for chat CPT users or even crypto users um so my first thought was to if you have a front end you can have a user authenticate on one chain and they can basically interact on chat gbt without even using their wallet with a token or a authentication and you can do things on any chain and just pay from uh from the one chain so it looks like we did deploy finally and we're going to get also which is nice we get a nice parse result of the Explorer address let's check that out and it looks like we did deploy the contract and just to wing it for the end of the presentation I would like to just uh let's try to do let's try to add one more thing to the prompt so we're gonna go and grab these and let's just say also deploy to these this is a this is a shot in the dark might get it might not but this just shows what you can do with with chat GPT you can you can just add on to your prompts and if you have the infrastructure set up it's all going to be connected there so far so good we have the chains going in on the back end it's basically I'm using a Soul C to deploy stuff uh and basically just deploying uh all these all these contracts uh the next big step too is to do some on-chain actions so you can actually deploy something and maybe even run tests live on on production and have an assistant do that for you so let's just get this response and let's see if we can go multi-chain with this contract and should be wrapping up soon I think plugins are going to be coming out for a lot of people now because I was very surprised that I got the access so I'm super excited to just see what uh gets built on there especially from the web three front all right so we got our deployments um we got we definitely got an error or two probably yeah we got one or two errors but a lot of deployed contracts and just in a matter of a few minutes we have 10 contracts deployed some are on mainnet some are on test Nets these are all coming from a chain list with data and we can verify the links and let's see if these are these links are parsed correctly here sometimes they're not but we can verify uh these links on the Explorer let me just get one that did deploy let's check there we go optimism do we have a deployment okay we might have to wait for the deployments to come in let's check let's check a hyperspace and there we go hyperspace fevm for the win that's it for the presentation guys uh web 3 chapter 54. thank you that was awesome this is great just being able to tell all the new contracts we need um sweet can't wait for more AI stuff all right next up is donation station please give them a big round of applause hi everyone [Applause] who here has donated to the recent Bitcoin better round was brave enough with these gas fees one hand over there two three okay would have been different probably six months ago um but as you know gas fees were really high in the last few weeks there was a tweet that inspired me for for the second time project and they estimated that about around 600 000 were spent just in gas fees and donations on the Bitcoin better round so I wanted to build a solution for that but with a little bit of a Twist that uses a Chrome extension that you can use in any Chrome browser to donate to your favorite Bitcoin projects open source projects or or public good projects directly from Twitter the browser extension looks like looks like this just a simple interface and you can enter the name of some some project that you want to donate to to get some some quick bio for example so just take the Bitcoin name here okay but around this over but if we take some other Project's name and we actually get the bio of what what happened on uh or what you can see on the on the Bitcoin page right now um and then what the browser extension also does is uh it can manipulate the interface of what you see on Twitter so let's say let's say you see a tweet like this and you won't actually donate to this project um then then you can also see this Bitcoin icon next to the name which is generated through the browser extension and you can select some amount and some some chain evm compatible chains and donate on a layer 2 which makes it much more user-friendly just because uh you don't have to pay 30 or 40 bucks in gas fees let's do this while we wait this for this to go through uh just one challenge I faced was that for example from browser extensions you cannot connect to other browser extensions so what I had to do is it opens up actually a website on the background you can see it down here that is just a blank HTML that runs the script to connect to your wallet and then in the end also the um I went through it and see the success page to the wallet end to the contract so this would be a donation contract uh similar to the good condonation contract that is not live right now because the round is over but I just deployed the donation contract on my own uh for for different chains I went through you can you can donate on different chains one special thing about optimism contract was that they have this attestation station so whenever you donate an optimism the contract actually attests that you donated to public good um and then what's next for this you can imagine that this is just the start of what the browser extension can do you can imagine for example going to the Twitter page from I don't know uniswap it can select two token that you want to swap and swap directly on Twitter or you go to openc and sell or buy an nft or you just take something somewhere so this project extension is really for you to bring any web 3 app that you like to use to with two platforms that you're already using um and you don't even have to have to leave the page um yeah it's just an example of how you can use it in in the case of Bitcoin thanks sweet this would have been uh very handy 10 days ago but you can use it next time all right our second last finalist of the day please welcome chain GPT hey thanks for having me to introduce Chang gbt which provides cryptographic truth to all of the AI Bots that are taking over the world I'm a little bit guilty I'm actually a roboticist by day I am not a web 3 developer at all and I am very much a roboticist technologist for good so I my day job as a skin printing robot for burns patients and educational Technologies and I wanted to to bring this vibe to the hackathon um and when I saw that actually you can build non-web three technology and use crypto to secure them it blew my mind so I was reading through the sponsors cartesi allows someone has already deployed distributed opencv which is an open source computer vision Library that's very common in my work um and now it's distributed so I saw that my mind was blown and I was like I want to get involved in this I when I thought of change EVT mostly it took my interest because it's like could that be possible everyone that I spoke to they're like but could you just deploy like a chat AI to um The blockchain Well cartel rollups make it possible that you can have this cryptographic trust in AI systems that comes in two forms so I've deployed uh alpaca.cpp which is the CPU plus library that uses Stanford ai's alpaca model not full Chachi BPT but you can verify that the correct model has been used the expected model and also the output of these agents so where this is useful in it's in all sorts of fields right it's taken over everything but here are some examples in in business um the if you have a if you're running a business where you're selling a product people get clever with these chat agents that they can make them eventually like trick them into giving you something for free and so later on as a business owner it's your responsibility these are Italian GPT will keep business owners accountable for like hey actually the AI agent said that I could have a refund for this so bringing that um verification but then also in like Insurance regulated Industries for auditing of actually what these machine learning models are outputting um are they biased they can be audited and also um you can use that to introspect as a business owner yourself and then in education uh you know we're putting kids in front of these things to learn but it relies entirely on what model they're interacting with and so I think this is going to be coming up more and more in the future of education but something like chain GPT will allow School administrators to say like no I assure you that it's using this model I know because if not change EBT running on the Cartesian machine will actually flag that there's been some tampering so if you're any of those people then that's good to know but can it work so here's a demo um this is this is a so I have a local I have a local blockchain here um that is running the catchesi roll-up framework and on that I'm going to deploy my chain gbt implementation which is a port of alpaca C plus plus two um to run in a particular container it eventually needs to be compatible with the risk V architecture to be deployed to the chain it's um a work in progress and like I'm excited to see it get there but for now this is a local demo so I'm going to interact with this as if I'm a student I want to know tell me about first person who walked on the moon this is going to get received then um by the demo it's now running like at the moment it's gonna at the moment it's running in a Docker machine on my computer but deploy this to the chain have multiple validators you'll know whenever there's a discrepancy from them but also you know because they're putting the state of their actual virtual machine snapshots are being taken and they're stored on chain so whenever we need to go back and see if anything's gone awry then that information is all stored in the blockchain like it's uh I had no idea that these sorts of things exist I interact with this just like with cmank and C plus regular tools that I'm used to and I just kind of get crypto for free um so this is going to here we go it's thinking out there okay so it's sent that response and then as a client I'll be able to receive the response from the um from the chain in general that yes uh this is the answer to that question according to change EBT thank you thank you um it's an input like I'm drawn to this because of the potential for us to like okay everyone's terrified about these AI machines at the moment um so we can capitalize on that hype for the the good of like Pub publicizing crypto products like this but also we can you know be the Savior for people's fears of like I know you're concerned but the the educational system for example it's not just going to be left to run loose so we have opencv distributed openc on cartesi and now I am happy to say that uh you can get full cryptographic safety from chain gbt also through the cartesia operating system thanks [Applause] that was incredible that's going to be really really important congratulations all right you ready for our last finalist demo of the day yeah are you ready for our last final step of the day welcome op compressor all right so hi everybody my name is Ben uh so op compressor is kind of a it's really really simple but creative way to work around the current l1v scalar settings on the optimism chain so effectively like just for a little bit of background each byte of call data that you add to your transaction payload actually equates to the same cost as writing a kilobyte of storage on optimism so if you guys are used to working on L1 that's obviously flipped on its head and the real reason for that being is that we compress your transaction data and then post it to the mainnet however we charge you for the uncompressed call data so there's actually a way to get around this I was kind of brainstorming with a friend the other day and the way that you can do that is that you can compress your call data up front moving the compression earlier in the pipeline so that our sequencer doesn't have a chance to actually compress your transaction's data further so to do that I actually kind of came up with this really simple modification of run length encoding um calling it zero compressor and basically what it does is it compresses all of these zeros inside of your transactions call data and the whole idea behind that is that zero is the most commonly repeated byte inside of your call data and so effectively it's actually a really really simple set of contracts you guys can see here that we have 65 lines inside of the zero to your compressor live and it's re it's written in assembly I also have a like pure assembly version and huff of this that I'll put on my GitHub tonight and then we also have this other contract called the call compressor and this is best used with some sort of smart contract of all like a gnosis safe specifically because for things like uni swap swaps you're going to want to be able to delegate call this code so I would recommend either setting up a 4337 wallet or using gnosis safe with this contract and effectively what you guys can see it doing is that it will first of all decompress the call data that you've sent it and then it'll forward that call data to whatever address that you added beginning of your payload so super simple contract there's also a rust library that does the compression and decompression for differential testing as well in terms of security I've used bounded symbolic execution to test the memory safety as well as the Integrity we also differential test it against the rust implementation here so we have pretty high assertion that it's working so we can kind of see here this is just a simple fuzz test that we're doing to forward the call to call compressor you can see we're calling out to this Rough Side Car to compressed a fuzzed payload obviously this one has a lot of zeros in it so this is the payload that's uncompressed this is the payload that is compressed plus the selector because Forge thinks that the selector is actually a part of the payload but so some live examples of this if we go over to Arc real quick in the readme is that we can see a uni swap payload to multi-call on optimism maidenet sent to just the ID pre-compile you guys can see that this payload is like absolutely huge and so as a reminder every single one of these bytes which is two of these digits costs the equivalent of storing a kilobyte of data inside of L2 so obviously every single one of these bytes we want to get rid of as many as possible so what we do is we use that zero compressor lib as well as a gnosis safe to basically delegate call the zero compressor Lube and then what we get is a much much much shorter transaction and so one thing that you might have not noticed is that this transaction was 68 cents the transaction prior to that that was uncompressed was 93 cents so just for a small like single uni swap transaction that saved 31 of your calls price and then obviously it kind of scales close to exponentially there so this could be a really useful way for smart contract Frameworks to thank you so this could be a really useful way for a smart contract wallets to save even more gas on optimism and then also we can change our fee scaler settings so that this set of contracts comes useless which would be awesome we've got 4844 down the line uh and it's all in the name of making blockchains more accessible to your common people thank you guys [Applause] a genuine true hack that was amazing those were all of our 10 finalists um not only do we see that the feature looks like zkps and AIS and chat GPT but there's some really genuine cool Hardware solidity golfing but the best part is nothing went wrong in a live demo did anybody notice that we had 10 perfect demos and that's unheard of amazing I want to give a massive

winners congratulations to all of you amazing teams who've just won over 250 000 all of these things will also now be visible on the Showcase so once you see this on the live stream just refresh your dashboard and you will see what prizes You've Won and we'll also contact you with all the next steps speaking of next steps here are some key things to remember all of these announcements are tentative and not final which means that prizes can still change because we will be verifying everybody's code base we'll be making sure nobody cheated nobody worked on a project before Friday and if somebody is removed from those lists and for example if you're part of a pool Prize or one of their top winners we will have to readjust so it'll take us a couple weeks to do all of that and then notify all of you that this is the final set of recipients for the winners so the debt our deadline is by June 2nd this is also the same timeline where all of your Stakes will be returned so give us the next two to three weeks to do all of this and we'll be following up with anybody with any next steps over email if if we have any questions or if you want to have you clarify if something was done before or not so now comes the last five minutes of me stopping and just stop talking so this is where we're gonna get to a lot of clapping and now I really get to say the more you Clap the faster we end because there's a lot of people want to thank for making this whole thing possible you saw all the things that are happening here this weekend you saw all the things that are happening in the background and it takes so many people to make all of that work so I want to make sure we recognize everybody for all the things that they've done up till this event for the past few weeks to the months to just this weekend so so many people here but first of all I want to thank all of you as hackers who stayed with us over the weekend worked on something that you were excited about submitted a project talked about it sometimes they didn't even sleep thank you so much for spending your weekend with us and I really appreciate you being here in this building I want to thank our judges one more time for taking the time to spend all of their mornings and talking to all of you we're really making this possible all of these amazing mentors and volunteers who are just roaming around making sure nobody has any problems your questions get answered anytime something is not according to schedule we run and address it all these people were doing so much amazing stuff behind the scenes so thank you so much to all those volunteers all the amazing speakers who did workshops and talks without them you won't have all this educational stuff that you can look up in the future and help out bring other people onto this space I want to thank all of our amazing speakers one more time please give them a big round of applause and look at all of our partners all of these people were here helping you all succeed with all of the sdks helping answer questions giving out prizes coming here or talking to all of you sometimes answering questions in the country or city they were on because they couldn't make it in person without them this would not be the event it is today and a special shout out to the eve Global team you don't see all of them here because we're always running around I want to give a massive shout out to Shari Andrew Maggie Nunu Oregon Taylor Fred Polly Rory Chloe Kevin Ivan Kevin cake Cree who we see mini and ammo as Emily Andrew and Jacob they make all this in the background possible and a special shout out to cree and Kevin for being an incredible member of a team with the past one year so those were all the van cues let's go back to those 10 finalists that came on stage we call them our finalists because unlike other events these are not designed to be competitions our goal is to really make sure that we help people get excited about what's next in this space and help them experiment with all the new technologies you what you saw now will be what becomes normal six months from now which seems like more chat CBT and a lot of zkp is becoming more mainstream and we called them finalists because we want to really make sure that people are here just building things that they're excited about and just the cool that they think is cool and not really game this or try to keep this separate or tied directly to any prizes so effectively anybody who came here on stage all those 10 teams they are our first place winners there's no one to ten and these finalists are our winners for each Global Lisbon so please give those teams a massive Round of Applause for all coming in first and as part of being a finalist in addition to any prizes that they've won we will be giving azith Global 500 usdc Port member to each of those teams but that's not all there's a lot more on top of that on top of that you'll also be getting tensapolia e to test net and play with whatever you want per member an ens domain of your choice not the three letter ones we're not we're not there yet anytime you want to come to any pragma events for this year there'll be a pragma for every in-person event that we do you'll be allowed to come in any time independent of if the registration is open or not if you are interested in getting a hardware wallet you can get a hundred dollars off a grid plus lettuce a lens protocol handle if you're still on the wait list a push video Alpha access if you're not on that product just yet from your wallet web3 Storage Pro tier for storing anything on filecoin we forgot the AWS credits ten thousand dollars in AWS credits too and for all the finalists if they want to come to our next in-person event we'll give them a flight credit to come with a guarantee reimbursement and we'll fly you into the next Global hackathon next month in Canada so on top of all of that 500 uscc all these things are given to all of our finalists so congratulations to those 10 teams and just as a sneak preview for what's coming next we are also going to be making a lot of these things available to all of you soon by launching something called Eight Global perks where we get to just list all these things and anybody who's been part of our ecosystem can claim different perks including test net eats for gorley and sepolia very soon on their own so congratulations to all of these teams let's wrap this up with the one last announcement which is telling you all what's next this wouldn't be any Global event if you don't tell you what the next upcoming events are so in terms of my final three minutes on stage up next is our online event called autonomous worlds if you're interested in building something that's collaborative game world called Mud if you've heard of mud before these are multiplayer interactive universes where all of them are hacking on the same thing that event starts this upcoming Friday it goes on for just four days it's all online please check out autonomous worlds this is one of our most exciting hackathons that we're just looking forward to after that is hack FS if you're interested in building more web 3 stuff leveraging ipfs and filecoin and fem this is going to be the event this is also online it'll go on for three weeks starting June 2nd to 21st on hackfs.com then is our first our next in-person event eth Global Waterloo this is where eth Global started five years ago and we're doing it again for the third time so we're going to be bringing a lot of that back to what's happening in the interim ecosystem at this event after that will be eth Global Paris right after ECC that week if you're interested in joining this one especially a lot of you here who are very nearby we'll see you all in in Paris in July then we'll be doing New York in September that's going to be our second last in-person events of the year and we're going to close the year off with Istanbul devconnect on November 17th to 19th you can check out all these events right now I encourage all of you to apply all the details and everything else is now available on youth global.com so we'll see you a lot more this year so this almost concludes youth Global Lisbon one final thing we'll do before we let everybody go is we're going to take a quick group photo so what I'm going to ask you is to just get up and look over there at the back so we can take a massive group photo and for all the top those 10 finalists just come on stage we'll have you here quickly and after this thing I will shut up and we will enjoy the rest of our evenings here we go I'll uh can I have this slides back please looks like we're going to squeeze in the middle don't go on the sides come come in the middle please this might be a hard one to take I'm glad we did this last say cheese all right awesome thanks everybody all right this officially concludes youth Global Lisbon thank you so much for being here and we'll see you all at the next one have a great evening everybody [Applause]
