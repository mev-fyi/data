foreign hello everyone and welcome to the ipfs and file coin 101 Workshop joining us today is jinx who will be taking us through this session and with that I'll pass it over to jinx to get the session started hello everyone my name is Changs your friendly developer Advocate from fallcoin Foundation today I'm going to give you a introductory talk on ipfs and falkway 101 this will be a acting as a vocabulary for your rest of the workshops this will be the workshop to introduce all of the workshops for rest of this hackathon so let's get started and also welcome to hack Fest so um at first I'll talk a little bit about introduction to web3 and then I'll move on to ipfs and how ipfs saw some pieces of puzzles for web3 and equally important I'll talk about how Falcon is contributing to web3 infrastructure I'll then introduce a few products and tools that you can use in your hackathon and also some case studies on why people have used ipfs and file coins so you know the business behind it and I'll then talk about the future roadmaps so um overall we are as a human being witnessing a great movement from a centralized centralization of web technology to a more decentralized future and to eventually to a distributed future um the current Internet that we use uh we rely on every day is very centralized by Design choices ipv for IPv6 dni DNS internet service providers and HTTP protocol that we use every day are all having this centralized design thinking um it is there's nothing wrong including Tim Burton Lee also claimed that you know the internet will be decent it will be a centralized thing because of the nature of TCP IP and HD protocols it there's nothing wrong with this design it's just a design choice at the beginning but because of this design Choice many organizations and platforms have accumulated it tremendous amount of power hour um over over time and they're influencing a lot of our lives so some of the centralized platform companies have access to our data they are social media profiles and use this as the basis of their business model um they're it's designed to collect massive amount of data from users and being able to capitalize on those data um this one this this lack of ownership and probability around that data um and uh is is costing is causing systematic failures um this shouldn't be this way right if you have systems that are centralized um all you need to do is just take that um Central take down that centralized point and the whole thing will fall apart companies have tried to decentralize uh their infrastructure having pointed presence everywhere but the design is still very much following a Authority within that decentralized uh word um we're seeing gradual movements to decentralization um and what people uh really want um people who believe in web3 is a distributed future where users are are empowered to provide services where everything is Unstoppable censorship free um they are open but private and then you have verified data and you have data that is not siled to certain companies and certain organizations so incoming web 3 everyone is building uh web3 fiercely and there is a lot of capital certainly flowing to F3 space right now to fill the uh the gap between Innovation and implementation so what is web3 um exactly one of the explanations that I enjoyed a lot is from Juan Bennett founder of ipfs and protocol apps he said web3 is a broad movement in a group of associated Technologies and people aiming to make the web and the internet more decentralized verifiable and secure this sentence is is beautiful because web3 there is up till now I don't think there is a strict definition of it but it represents a group of people and then a group of technology that people are trying to make um to work towards a single goal that is decentralization of the future so web sorry um the other version that I have heard of web3 that I really like and and this breaks down into different things is that web3 has three components to it one is the physical and the and the and they're on the protocol level it is going to be a distributed web so it should work should be designed to work offline it should be faster not slower it should be safer not less secure and there should should not be a central point of coordination for the distributed web and there should be permanent links for for contents online um the second part is about making sure that the computers and uh and people have a trustless network to working this is where blockchain comes in blockchain is able to provide a publicly verifiable data it encourages permissionless entry and exiting if anyone wants and everyone is incentivized to do the right thing in the network so you shouldn't worry about certain entities starting behaving as adversary to you so you don't have to trust anyone for it you can trust that the system itself is going to run by itself and in an in a good way the last one is semantic web and I think that this is very beautiful it's about creating a graph of knowledge and making sure that the machines understand the meaning behind the data so we don't have to repeat this this information everywhere on the internet so for example I live in Melbourne Australia and Melbourne should be a single object on the internet as a as a maybe a node of the knowledge graph um and then people can if uh if it is marked as a location then people can do certain things with it for example navigating to it um and getting interesting spots of this location so that is concept of semantic web so how is ipfs and Falcon helping with this web 3 movement um ipfs provides a peer-to-peer protocol um to for for internet to work on um as I said earlier the protocol itself is centralized by Design and then filecoin is uh aiming to provide infrastructure for the web3 um the applications that we use every day Airbnb Uber and alike they all run very Hefty infrastructures right now there's no way we can build a web 3 a truly decentralized internet and allow developers to build internet scale applications without using a hefty infrastructure and that is what a falcon project intend to do exactly how we will take a look at it ipfs stands for interplanetary file system apart from being the the the the favorite uh acronym in web3 that I know of it is also a very good idea um it is very essential to web3 because one of the most important functions of the computer system and the internet is file systems if there's no way for computers to understand how to store files and retrieve them it is going to pose a very uh very big problem so ipfs is a peer-to-peer protocol that intends to be the decentralized version of HTTP that will allow users or nodes to communicate with each other and transfer files between each other without using a a centralized server in between how does it do that it is using it is using peer-to-peer technology the underlying technology there's a few but one of the most important one is the P2P which allows the software to talk through many internet interfaces and then speak to each other as a cluster of computers and not not talking to one single server and asking for for information so in this swarm of computers of ipfs nodes you have photos and files and these nodes will provide services to each other they have a unique ID so people know who they are and then they they use services from each other as well and the content on ipfs is able to be addressed based on its content and not its location because we're trying to get rid of this location-based schema in ipfs and then the class of computers will help each other to find find the content on the network it is fully distributed distributed in those Central server it is quite resilient and it's offline first design so what that means is if you take a chunk of the computer take a part of the network offline they should still work within itself by itself until they are reconnected to the main cluster or if you take a single one out it still works by itself it may not have access to certain peers in the network will be less useful but it should still work so it really promotes resiliency the most important part in ipfs and I think is uh it's one of the most valuable part is the content addressing technology we in web 2 we always type in a domain name which gets translated to IP and Port um but in ipfs how computers find files is actually through the ID of the system which is a hash digest of the whole file itself this hashtag just replaces the address based location and it basically is a fingerprint of the file and then the computers within the network will talk to each other and see who has this file and serve that so imagine if your computer has that file itself visiting ipfs or visiting a website could be retrieving that file from your computer and that's Ultra fast because you know there's no latency there's no network there's no need for communication with external systems or if this file lies on your Wi-Fi network so someone else computer in your home perhaps this will be retrieved from there and not from a US server for example um or if the file in ipfs is located in the other side of the word the system is able to broadcast messages and gossip with each other and find out where the content is and eventually get through many many Hoops to find the content and then retrieve it for you so it works very like a BitTorrent but it's made for the Next Generation application so Made For Real World applications out there so the underlying stack for building ipfs is ipld interplanetary linked data and the P2P so limpop also has a Bunty in this hackathon I encourage you to take a look at that on top of link a link P2P you can build many many systems not just the file system and lip p2b is trusted by a crocodile project in ethereum ipfs has gone through a tremendous growth since 2019 it had about only 800 contributors now to about 11 000. the performance has improved a lot it took 40 seconds to find uh fine files in at the beginning which is very slow and in 2022 the Gateway I think the 95 tile is a lot quicker now is probably a little bit better than that I think there were some optimization on routing that's been done um and if you're using a Gateway that caches content for you then it will be a lot faster than 400 milliseconds we have uh now five browsing Integrations Brave and Opera natively integrate with ipfs so if you're typing ipfs column slash slash and then the CIT um Brave or Opera you can find the file or the website uh directly that way and this is a future sort of we want um muscle user increased to 50 million and ipfs empowered apps are up to 1000 now it is a huge ecosystem of developers and Builders out there using this uh this protocol uh we also have many Gateway operators I think there's uh the monthly request is over 1 billion it is uh over these uh Gateway requests so uh there is a real demand for uh for retrieving content from ipfs there are many tooling you can use to interact with ipfs including ipfs desktop client um I'm I have that installed on my Mac that I printed up to store some files myself there is a CLI tool that you can run and runs the Daemon behind it so it provides API interfaces a web UI for you to visit um your browser and have that find control over your node and it's all it's also able to um it's also able to provide some services that you need behind the scenes um you don't always have to install ipfs on your computer to use it you can install it on the server or you can pay someone to host it for you so pinata and inferior two providers of private ipfs nodes that you can you can use to access the the vast ipfs Network um uh there are also implementations of ipfs in different languages including some native uh OS environments so you can embed that ipfs module inside of your application where wherever uh you want it to this is great for decentralization of um uh of ipfs because the more you can Implement on your device uh the more kind of the more point of presence or notes we have in the network it's better for decentralization that way there's a few things that's uh pretty exciting that's coming coming our way to make the life of Builder easier one of them is iron project iron dot computer and they are trying to make a very lightweight ipfs for mobile native devices there is also a Content exchange improvements called carpool and ipfs debuted um uh Unreal Engine and unity earlier last year um to to tap into the gaming development industry um there's also native integration of ips into tools like curl ffmpeg browsers and and more a lot of things are very exciting if you just search on Google ipfs implementation you will find quite a few of them there are a couple of sites for you to find more things exciting things like that we can't always keep track of what is happening in the ecosystem awesome.ipfs.io is a site that is hosted on ipfs and then it showcases all of the projects that are using ipfs or if you did something really really cool on ipfs please feel free to submit your idea there and let other people know about your how you use ipfs now there is also a official ecosystem ecosystem site for you to look up which companies are having collaboration or using ipfs and that's ecosystem.ipfs dot attack so hop on there and take a look once in a while you might find something really cool so now on to filecoin um now ipfs really provides a good ways for computers to talk to each other and store files in a very decentralized way in my work across planets as well but who is going to actually pay for the infrastructure and who is going to establish build all the plumbing that it needs to connect different computers together and who are going to pay for the computers right so falcoin is established to solve this problem it is designed in an initial phase designed to encourage a mass of Hardware to give this web3 thing a a a a a kick at the beginning so falcoin is the largest decentralized storage Network in the world there are about 3600 start providers or node operators some project calls it around the world um and then the it represents over 40 countries this commitment uh from our storage providers um are not just in terms of Hardware investment they also invest substantially uh monetarily or financially to ensure the network so falcoin has um uh has collateral system and slashing system um so the total pledged amount of coins are 147 Millions as of April this year this is a huge financial commitment that people have put in to secure the network filecoin enables open services for data and as an incentive layer to ipfs this is um this is kind of a global digital economy that we have started to help people to find data center Services help people who need State business services and who has data center services to provide to them it is a kind of a market for hard drives like Airbnb so if you have large amount of files that you need to solve a store for a certain amount of time you can make deals with people who own these private data centers around the world and then make a deal with them and then the filecoin blockchain is able to keep track of um uh to provide the underlying security behind it it facilitates the the storage deals and then they ensure is that all of the storage providers on the network is doing the right thing to protect clients interests that is it you know um providing data storage reliable um it is a layer one project in the web 3 world it is designed for storage but it's not limited to storage file coins Master pen always includes things that are not uh not storage because storage is the first step it's not the last step we will take we are also interested in building a data retrieval Network um decentralized CDN services so anything that gets stored into the filecoin we can retrieve it at a very fast speed performance speed and also we're interested in providing developers with dab tools tools so we have built Falcon Virtual machines that allows people to compute over Falcon blockchain State and then we are also wanting to get into the compute business as well so falcoin has projects that are focused on perfecting decentralized way of compute especially over filecoin nodes where the valuable data is stored it's very expensive to move data around on the internet there are some key benefits of all coins compatible with web story protocols we have built Bridges with near um and then now with the help of sem we're building more interoperability um Integrations so uh Falcon is more uh more Nimble with other other blockchains out there we are also providing verifiable data so a lot of data centers actually charge more money if you want to secure the data so making sure that data is not tempered or lost or corrupt um Falcon thanks to ipfs design can provide the verifiable data with no extra cost falcoin is secured by cryptographic proofs and I will talk about a few Primitives later in my presentation and it is massive in size because it is a design so far going from the from the economic design perspective is encouraging Enterprises to join the business falcoin algorithm there are some details about Falcon blockchain so if you're interested in that you can look take a look at falcoin specs so if you search Falcon spec you'll be led to specification page and that talks about all of these Primitives in in details and linked to research papers and stuff like that feel free to dig deeper there but for consensus we are a probabilistic uh bft so something called expected consensus for proving it is more more like a proof of storage and plus proof of stake so it's a combination of these two we call them proof of proof of space-time and proof of replication so the verification is primarily ZK snark we use DK snark to reduce the block time to meet the block time and also reduce the message message size broadcast method is P2P that I mentioned earlier and some of the cryptographic Primitives are Mercury or Merkel DAC for data Integrity Vector commitment scheme look it up for commitment and then uh e ecdsa BOS to Signature schema existing filecoin and for Randomness we have this decentralized Randomness Durant or trend for providing verifiable randomness so Falcon is also the largest deployed ZK star Network to date because of the infrastructure that our storage provider provides we have um yeah we have some pretty amazing numbers there Falcon is crypto economics um is um is very well designed first of all the falcoin economy design is completely open source so if you look up engineering file coins economy paper written by ZX or if you look up crypto econ lab you will find many many research papers behind uh the decisions that they have made at the beginning and it is very useful for many many people who are interested in tokenomics out there so farcoin economy if you think about that is an uh is similar to a island economy you have people who are amassing Hardwares um you know paid for electricity and running off these data centers and they interact with developers and researchers to make products and offerings to people outside of this island and then inside of this island everyone uses filecoin as value exchange and then outside we can exchange value with with external parties sales are utility tokens it is designed to purchase services that that Falcon Network provides or network participants provides um there are there will be about um there will be only 2 billion uh fall coins ever minted or issues that equates to about uh 330 million uh minted each year um so over 90 over 30 years time 97 of the um falcoins will will be minted and issued um Falcon has a simple minting and Baseline minting for Block rewards uh based on minty means that it encourages everyone in the network to increase their capacity um if everyone does that the total power increases and the rewards that we give to the to the participants or storage providers and other kind of service providers will increase in the future there is a linear investing concept we do have in our fall coin allocation we have allocation for the investors for Falcon foundation for protocol labs to run um and there are also a mining Reserve to increase search new services to be established on the network but Storage storage mining allocation is still the biggest uh in uh in falcoin coin allocation so so the um so out of all the file coins that's being that will be created the storage providers will get most of it uh there are concepts of deals and sectors which I'll go through a little bit later I also have another talk in about an hour um about start providing and there's also a concept of collateral and slashing in filecoin if you're interested more find primer to fall coins circulating Supply or engineering Falcon's economy to find out the exact thinking behind it falcoin runs in a phase economy so in stage one we encourage capacity and building up the network to handle to be secure so at first a simple minting or a reward to the storage providers will be quite great to encourage them to onboard Hardware at this point there might be very little quality services and that might be very little deal payments so deals means people actually paying for storage Provider Services and then for the second stage in the middle of the economy this should be turned around so simple maintain should reduce quite a bit we're already seeing that first wave of storage providers reward is reducing quite a bit and what we're encouraging them to do is to set up equipment and also build softwares to be able to provide services to clients and encourage real clients real data clients to use these data center services and in the stage three we should have our little block words for the storage providers and other kind of services providers and they should be making they should be making money primarily from their for providing those services and making deals on the network so we're uh kind of in uh in stage two or between like about to step into stage two right now for the for the whole economy the network growth has been a incredible story um in 2021 we only had about 1.6 Eep and now 17 ABB if a bite this number is actually including the um this number is not the roll byte number this is quality adjusted byte so it looks a lot better than the actual a lot better than the actual Hardwares that we have Hardware spaces that we have the number of providers went to 800 went from 800 to 4 000 so I mentioned three thousand six hundred earlier that was 2022's figure and now we have about 300 3600 minor IDs out there The Flash collateral went to 174 and now it's not 170 or so million dollars um maybe 140 I think yep um the orgs that are built on Falcon went up to more than 500. the storage size also increased so the number of files uh we call them content IDs increase to 6 million and unique providers went up storage deals there's millions of storage deals every year um and then total data stored I think is up to about 700 petabyte or maybe even over one exabyte now so either from the whole network capacity or from the data that's been stored on Fall coin um it is um it is the largest you know in the world so who are actually using these uh Services right now right um and why so the reason why people use that is uh is because Falcon provides a dramatically lower uh storage costs than traditional data centers to store one petabyte of hard drive it could cost you around uh tens a hundred thousand to twenty six hundred thousand dollars for a year in a Data Center and that's a store in there doing nothing a petabyte of data will will cost you that much in filecoin it costs a lot less than that so it's very attractive for people who has a really large amount of data to store somewhere and they don't need to immediately retrieve it it also improves um data availability because falcoins uh fall coins storage providers has many many point of presence you can store your data in many places rather than just one data center or one company's uh data center there and it also verifies the data storage for free um it needs it's easier to meet regular regulatory requirements if you're dealing with a local data center that is in your region that understand your Region's laws then say putting everything on the uh on the country that you're you're not you're not familiar with and they probably the country will probably have some pretty strict data Import and Export policies um and uh we're also very green chain so there's a project called Falcon green that intends to make a falcon start providing a carbon neutral business and maybe covered negative in uh in at a certain time so some of the feature clients are internet archive they're a bunch of people who are preserving the internet um there are others you University of Utah UC Berkeley uh CERN the research science research institute in Europe uh there's a there's a few other web story customers as well so openc Solana Are all uh users of filecoin systems so different kinds of people use um use filecoin um on the top media companies uses filecoin and then production events e-commerce education public data there's a wide range of customer segments on farcoin if you want to find out more about Falcon clients I encourage you to go to fall coin Explorer you can scan that QR code to visit fallcoin explorer.com we will be constantly updating featured customers to this website and some there are some really useful case studies in case you want to dig a little bit deeper on why they have used fall coin the client growth is um is incredible storage client gross so we're onboarding a vast amount of uh of data on the internet every day um since April by April 2023 um one million terabytes of data has been stored on falcoin and these are the number of unique storage clients we have is 1500 um and we're on some occasions we can onboard about one petabytes of data per day so how these data are onboarded is through deal making so um the whole fall coin Market revolves around storage deals this is overview of how it works first of all the client who wants to store some files will make the prepare the files for a friendly structure for falcoin protocol and then it will along with the sort of file information and the deal information it will make a deal broadcast the deal to start providers that that they're interested in storage providers will negotiate and and respond to these deal proposals and then the the ones who accepted the deals will then need to receive the files once they have received the files they will be providing approval replication on the network that's the first message they sent to Falcon blockchain and then once that's been produced they need to constantly provide proof of the uh space-time so prove that they still have the file and the file is not is not destroyed or been tampered with um and then to the network constantly in order to get a block reward over time as long as they can prove that they're still online and then they are still storing the file Faithfully they won't be slashed for their staking will not be slashed towards the end of the storage deal the clients will need to renew the story deal or let it expire letting expire means that the storage providers no longer have obligations to to store this they won't get slashed for um uh for for not providing a good storage service they can recycle the sector for for new files the one of the thing that is key to Falcon architecture are the concept of actors actors are the things that in the Falcon software that will do things so there are different actors for different purposes they're reward actors that calculates the block rewards that someone deserves um and then there are minor actors that help with mining operations there will be storage power calculators uh actors storage Mark actors data cover actors which are related to verified data we give higher incentive for start providers if they're doing actual storage of useful data to to their clients and verify registry actors so there are quite a few of those if you want to look into the deeper part of how exactly Falcon interacts with its nodes and and data clients and storage providers I encourage you to take a look at the YouTube video and and some documentation we have on Falcon actors but don't don't feel um this is a completely strange thing in the saxophone if you know what hackers are actors are you'll have a good idea of how far my protocol operates Falcon Virtual Machine is our way of opening up falcoin blockchain to device developers out there um Cloud conversion machine is built on wasm and the intends to build many runtimes on top of it and the first runtime that the project decided to do is the EDM so the ethereum virtual machine standard so Falcon now has falcoin evm deployed quite a few months now and people are doing lots of DAC development on top of it if you're interested in that please scan a QR code and read more on on fvm since launch in I think it was April or May we have um quite a quite a big interest on fem uh there are about 75 000 active fem wallets out there uh there is a a close to 1 million fields that are held by Fe empowered smart contracts or actors we call it um so there's a quite a bit of a trust that people place in fem that they can you know they can trust these these smart contracts with their money TVO is around 1.2 according to defy Lama and they're about 937 unique smart contracts has been deployed and there are about hundreds of hundreds of teams building on dapps Falcon ecosystem is definitely a lot busier after the launch of Fem we also have built into our operability integration with XLR and Kraken there's a there's quite a few uh web3 partners that are building to us if you're interested in the status of fem and wanted to have a have a look at the details of how well it runs um scanner QR code and go to this femexplorer that Starbucks Ventress has created for us it's got the overall it pulls all the data from Falcon blockchain and then analyze and give you all the insights in there there is a solidity library for Falcon um it integrated with many of the actors that I mentioned earlier um the you can use these actors directly in your solidity contract if you import zondex file coin solidity so take a look at that and they've got some pretty good documentation too about about these there is also uh quite a few starter kits that the fem developer experience team have created I encourage you to take a look at the fevm Hard Hat kit that's been created it's a repo for examples of how to interact with fall coins through Fem the development experience and the user experience should be pretty close to ethereum falcoin is integrated with metamask as well you can import test net and then also connect mainnet about for hackathon probably you'll only be using the calibration test net and then the deployment experience development experience should be pretty similar to to solidity developers on an evm compatible chain so fall coin overall uh the project has attracted many projects to build on top of that and we're very interested in helping the teams to actually go through the funnel um get funding get expertise from the from the project from protocol lab spoken Foundation all of the people in the ecosystem and then what we want them to do is actually use the ipfs and Falcon technology build their Ventures and secure funding to build it even further so we have helped we're working with 15 accelerators out there and then help teams to raise a tremendous amount of capital to to push them forward Falkland ipfs is a perfect combination because ipfs provides a fast flexible retrieval with this k-based local nodes browser integration and Falcon is great for persisting and providing verifiability for data so together one has the protocol of doing uh of course of for file system to go decentralized decentralized way and then Falcon provides the uh the the hardware infrastructure and the backup for for all of its content so on top of lip P2P rpld ipfs you can build protocols like filecoin and I also encourage you to take these modules and combine it and build your own protocol if you uh if you have a really good idea on this also a lot of people have turned this into a a storage business model so there are a lot of storage helpers out there like pinata that uses ipfs and nft web3 storage they're charging for the Dropbox storage like systems for for users to use it whether that's household users or developer users out there so use the stack and build your project uh there's some I'll go through this really quickly there are some products and tools you can use in your hackathon um that will make you not only eligible for um for the prices that we we give out and some of our partners prices but also uh if you use the right tools that can reduce your build time a lot and then allow you to focus on the important part of your project you can go to filecoin ecosystem page to take a look at some of those tools as well but today I'm going to introduce you to you nft Storage nft storage is a public group program it is a nft for nft basically at Dropbox for nft for uh for nft projects out there so if you're an FC project you can use it for free forever um and uh it works it should work similarly to a uh a to to Dropbox or Google drive it has a pretty awesome API that is able to handle large volume and then um the idea is that when you're maintaining nft use nft storage for the asset storage and then write the um write the image URL or the asset URL as ipfs links and not um not a centralized version or HTTP links luxury storage is the same deal as nft stars except this is designed for General storage um so it's super easy to use website storage I've used its sdks to do many things including this photo booth that you can see on the right corner this was for one of the conferences that happened in Lisbon last year web Summit so the photo booth software was sending photos to a uh to a node application that I run on one of the cloud storage cloud cloud platforms and then it will interpret the apis from the photoboo software to Webster and then pass back the ipfs link back to the to the to the photo booth software and then the photo booth software will display a QR code that's called the ipfs link on the users can retrieve it from the from the phone uh their their favorite selfie from from the phone so it's Ultra easy to integrate I encourage you to use this in your project if you have some storage names things um ipfs is also great for deploying websites so flea can sphere on are two businesses that have successfully integrated with ipfs and filecoin so if you uh just connect your GitHub repository or get a lab repository to Fleek and Sphero and it is a website they can pull it crawl it and then build it constantly deploy it to the to ipfs for you um and I think central now also runs compute so you can run backend on on their Network Fleek might have similar plans as well but take a look at their tools I use them quite often for the for my demos okay filecoin data tools specifically Estuary are some are some tools that are really helpful if you want to hide the complexity of dealing with blockchain and so you can install a S3 Note or just use the cloud version of S3 to interact with filecoin it allows you to run ipfs nodes very easily so storage nodes and then it builds all the integration with Falcon market so you can make storage deals by clicking through the interface or by sending some apis it will automatically orchestrate the deal making behind the scenes and replicate your data for to six times and then and then make those storage deals with with search providers out there so take a look at a file coin data tools especially Estuary to see how this can simplify your project who and why are people using Falcon um one of the examples so first of all why would people join a startup provider business right so SEO storage is one of the start provider in Europe a lot of people join us because they think this is a feature of um uh of the internet um and then falcoin has a really good economic design so they um it is a business so they can get profit out of operating um you know in the early early days you can just bring hard drives online to join Falco Network and get paid for it and that's available business for a lot of people but as you know the Falcon economy has certain stages so later on they will have to start providing real storages so a lot of them are in with this journey and then are very committed so certain steel storage is one of them and it is Seal search thanks to them we were able to land a partnership with adolescent experiments which is storing certain valuable scientific research data for sir so this is the example of why file claim has a stronger proposition than really large Cloud platforms out there because we are working with small businesses essentially and small businesses are best to understand their local customers needs so CERN is one great example and seal storage uh New York um New York City open data is also stored on uh stored on Falcon these days so um public data sets are perfect for a fall coins to store because we're designed to hold Enterprise level data so whole data center you can migrate to Falcon and then we're designed to last for as long as possible through crypto economic incentives and also having so many people joining us and then permissionless entry and exit and also replication technologies that we have so um there are many governments that are storing open data on Fall point um for a media medical and research purposes Falcon is also very important because we have this verifiable data um the the research industry really requires solid on tempered data that they can trust so generate is one company that's based in Austin they are putting uh Human Genome sequency data on filecoin and uh um yeah their progress is amazing so getting close to the end of my presentation I'll introduce you a few things to look forward to uh in this hackathon or Beyond this hackathon um so one of them is retrieval market so I mentioned how amazing uh fall coins storage network is to get the data out is a different kind of story um so if you want to retrieve data and and read the content very quickly on the internet people often rely on this thing called CDN content delivery Network or content content it's CDN so content during Network content distribution Network so to do a Content distribution Network or delivery Network in the decentralized way presents many many challenges it's easy to do it if you're a centralized company but it's very hard to do it in a decentralized way retrieval.market was the project program that got set up to encourage projects like Saturn and Titan Network to be built these are this is these are our approaches to building decentralized CDN and and Saturn and Titan are both will be integrated into filecoin so in the future you could see that people joining CDM businesses in in your maybe in your city to provide content from ipfs and filecoin and they might get paid for providing such activity or developers will pay them to to provide us to speed up the content delivery uh Pacquiao is the project that I mentioned earlier that tends to do heavy Computing so building up a Computing Network these in a decentralized way and encourage intensive processes to run on storage nodes so for example if filecoin is storing a lot of video data in really high resolution then back IL is made perfectly for people who wants to decode these videos into different resolutions to serve on on different devices and moving this these really vast amount of data to elsewhere to perform uh decoding and transcoding these things is uh is a nightmare because the egress cost will be tremendous and Falcon is also updating its consensus algorithm the next one is going to be called interplanetary consensus and it is next Frontier in blockchain scalability and so I'll talk a little bit more about that later so retrieval Market if you're interested in that and Saturn network is the one that's being launched please take a look at that I believe Saturn also has a price pool of 5000 for this hackathon so take a look at their Dev tools out there and see if you want to build a project related to decentralized CDN Pacquiao is compute over data scan this QR code take a look at that they got some really awesome demos um generative Ai and batch Computing of really compute intensive jobs it's step by step they go through everything for you um yeah so take a look and and hopefully use it in your project and this is IPC IPC also has a price pool I'm not exactly sure what kind of Dev tools might be there so but take a look at the the the price description and see if you would like to do something with this new consensus that we are actively developing so um if you're more interested in that bigger picture of how Falcon is doing what I have said is just the beginning you can reach our industry reports so some are produced by falcoin foundation and massari has done a report on filecoin they have a quarterly report on falcoin economy and coin gecko has published the state of decentralized storage that largely talk about falcoin in their report so you can also talk to me uh directly if you have questions I would love to answer your questions on East Global Discord Channel or DM me please I don't turn my DM off um yeah feel free to ask me a question I may know may not know everything but I will I'm well connected within filecoin and protocol Labs teams I will direct your question to the right person for you so that's all from me I think am I I might I'll see if there are some questions here yeah there was one question about linking to the economic resources oh economic resources yeah releasing profile coin economy engineering Google it we're still Googling these days um so it'd be let straight to the PDF which which gives you a high overview higher overview of how things uh were designed for um but the the one that is uh crypto econ lab is the website that you need to go to to read all the researchers so I'm gonna pop it into the chat um and this falcoin economy resells over here yeah so with crypto econ lab ZX is lead in this organization and really amazing amazing team there um best in the business and they have produced many many resources so if you want to look at uh maybe let's see like technical reports I think they have done some researches on how fem is going to impact falcoin's economy um yeah they they have they have all these things so consensus scaling IPC if you want to read more papers on that and they seem to have done some researchers on on fee mechanisms these are really like good public goods for for rest of the industry because they can anyone can come and see how they think and have done the work and the mass you know the the arithmetic behind things and then you can replicate it to other projects and type parts that will benefit you to use so yeah so it's pretty good take a look cheers thank you thank you we've got a few more minutes until the next uh next uh Workshop so thank you everybody for uh for joining and thanks Jinx and yeah he'll be uh having another Workshop in about seven minutes so see you all again soon
