welcome everybody uh somebody talking no okay cool so we are gonna get started in just a second uh we are going to use the same same document that we did last week so let me grab the link for that you're going to want to add your team name and the all of the team members who are participating on this call do that and that will be the sign up order that we we go through and it's first come first serve so go add your name now to make sure that you have some time to present and once you see the first name on there start with room one uh we'll fill up room two once we get some more uh panelists there and peter simona do you want to just give a quick intro i know some of the people were probably here last week but maybe there are some new faces [Music] um i'm going to send the link in the chat again please add your team name you want to go first team members in the chat i can go first so in a very small nut trail hi everyone um i'm simona i am currently heading up community for status um before that i was the co-founder of the bounties network creators of the standard bounties protocol on top of which bitcoin sets you most of you will be familiar with with git coin um other than that i am part of um the meta cartel dow medicamen um whaler dow there's a whole bunch of dowels that i'm not part of um but generally um i tend to help out across the ecosystem in terms of anything that will help us get to adoption and help us create very meaningful applications that will hopefully get um ethereum mainstream um i'm i've been part of or we're taking part in the eighth global um hackathons in some way or another um for the past what is it now three years wow um and i'm excited to see what you guys have come up with and hopefully i can help with um the feedback that i will give you great to be here peter hi vern uh you know recently i would consider myself a community builder in space but you know recently tone investor i'm at 1kx and um i've also created the ventured out the first investment tower and ethereum and before then worked in metacartel and still working on that so like actually looking to work with teams after the hackman as well uh and you know to receive grants and metacartal and yeah like you know i've been building the space so yeah happy to see what people cook up perfect uh scott do you want to give a quick 30 second intro um yeah hey i'm i'm scott lewis um mainly work on a d5 pulse and a dex dex dot ag um was i like d5 um i like most of the stuff people are building i'm in some dowels but i don't run any like these other panelists um but uh yeah i'm looking forward to seeing what y'all are building so we will have a few other people joining us david and austin from last week we'll also be joining in a few minutes but we're going to get started now um so we'll we're going to have two rooms once they join and so don't be alarmed if you get pulled into another room where you see your uh order change on the sheet which i just linked in the chat um emily's over there so if you have any questions relay them to her and then we'll get anything figured out and then we're gonna just start right off with the first team which i believe is stop loss protocol we're going to keep all three of the panels in here for now and then once we get some more like i said we'll start to split people up uh stop loss you want to go ahead and present hey so how should i start like with the product directly yeah sure um and and just remember i forgot to mention uh try to keep it pretty short because we do have a lot of teams but we're gonna allocate five minutes per team okay so i just keep that in mind thanks i have i have an issue i have to restart my zoom i'm sorry for this maybe i'm gonna be second team or something like that have to quit and rejoin for the screen sharing okay um let's go to the next team while he does that which is 20 pay jack sanford hey guys how's it going can you guys hear me oh cool uh okay cool yeah so we're 20 pay and basically we are creating a very easy to use e-commerce checkout so you can pay with any erc 20 token um so let me share my screen really quick hopefully this goes well um zoom oh yeah it's making me do the same thing that the glass guy was doing it's gonna make me quit zoom um okay i'm not sure if i should just should i should i just get back in the line after he goes then yeah we'll jump back once once you restart but yeah go ahead and restart okay sorry about that no worries all right let's see if we can get um new fi do you want to go ahead and present hopefully you don't have three all right but let's see yeah let's do the test um there we go all right good good deal that got me scared all right cool um so yeah new fight uh we're the our project is growing your net worth has never been this easy um and our target is really um the crypto curious crypto nervous the 93 of the population that doesn't have exposure to digital assets we all know um you know getting people into this ecosystem is a challenge um and there's just so many options in the d5 world it's got you mentioned like yeah d5 pulse and all these different tools are out there but it's still really difficult to get into this stuff and but there are really practical benefits for people owning digital assets um so our project is really to capture that market so what we're offering is a platform where you can invest with experts the people that know the most about defined crypto you choose managers this is all decentralized and non-custodial you choose managers that fit your style you can sort and filter based on how they perform or what their what they're invested in what their pools are invested in and you can allocate into stable or volatile pools that we're calling right so our whole premise is um you know things like yearn and there's a lot of great protocols out there but really it's still challenging for most people to understand like where should i put my money so we really broke it down into stable and volatile pools and then your the investor has the ability to put their money into um those pools in a proportion that really makes sense for them um so this is kind of like understanding the investors risk and allowing them to get into those managers that will get get them into investments that will return something for them but safely as well so i'll go through our uh the demo and we are um i'll tell you where we are in a few minutes but um this is our ux flow uh we're not completely hooked up at this point but i want to show you what we have at this at the moment so um there's two sides to new fi it's investor manage um and i'm gonna go through the invest flow right now so first you connect to your web through wallet and then you can see the the dashboard of available managers uh in the platform so here um you know we see jim and jane and their stable and bottled pools and how they're doing overall and how much they've invested themselves into that pool which could be an indicator of you know how much confidence they have in their in their strategy when you view that pool you see a breakdown of how the how it's performing over time and you can see you can actually get into those pools themselves the volatile or the stable pool and you'll notice that we have a one percent withdrawal fee which is really an incentive for the advisor to get onto our system and i'll talk more about that um uh when we get into the advisor platform um but really the the way that you get in to any of these pools is you invest eth for volatile or invest ustc which is the two things that we chose at the moment um so it's very easy to get into these things once you provide heath to the volatile uh that that um money then goes into that heath pool and you're going to see the manager uh invest that on your behalf um and you know hopefully you have good returns on that and you can view all of that within your dashboard within your portfolio you can also add or withdraw all to get out of that pool all right any questions up to this point maybe i'll keep going on the other side of this we have our advisor or manager and the manager as explained they are the ones who are coming up with the investor pool and coming up that strategy so they provide their their profile name which would be seen on that list that i was i showed before in terms of like available um managers that they describe their pool strategy and then they could tell us how they want to uh invest investors funds in terms of volatile and stable pools so in terms of volatile they could put in east themselves and then we would have some strategies that they could put that money into and allocate for the hack right now we're we're limiting our options um so for volatility we have urine um but for stable we have urine and stable uh and then they could allocate proportions that they feel um are going to help perform um so once they create that pool this is the manager's dashboard uh and they would see how they're doing in terms of their fee income and this is really the incentive like i mentioned like they want to do well because they're going to make more in terms of fees or get more people onto the platform so that they generate more fee income they can edit their amounts that they have or invest more themselves and they can also invite investors directly so this is where um you know folks that might not be familiar with uh defy or crypto in general you know this could be someone managing and saying hey you know i want you i want to bring you into this system very easy to use give me your email address i'll send you a personalized message and then they can get into you know assets that are generating return for them so um that is new fi and here's where we're at um in terms of the roadmap we did idea and research um at the beginning wireframes you just were shown we have developed our contracts and we're integrating the front end right now eventually we're going to add governance and future investments to the platform so governance i think is a really huge aspect of the system where advisors will have a say or managers have a say in how we add things to the platform and how this ecosystem grows um so yeah that is new file awesome yeah why don't we move into questions or feedback yeah i really like the idea um just like one small idea is like you know in terms of like the uh pull managers you know you're really like kind of enabling people to manage amongst like you know predefined calls right at least that's what i'm assuming you could probably you know work with zapper finances like zap contracts uh you know because they're already out there you have like you know like a hundred different like lp pool positions amongst like balancer you show up etc and you could probably allow them to like play with that right yeah that's a great idea uh how do you prevent the the managers from uh like what's what's the mechanism that prevents the managers from running off with the money is it trustless or like uh contracts and stuff yeah they're legal yeah yeah i know i can answer some i'm here and i'm one of the engineers working on the project um yeah it's also more contract based right so you can't so there's only a limited amount of stuff you can do in the smart smart contract so you give your money technically to a smart contract where the advisor is allowed to put it into urine or something but they can't transfer that money into wherever they want right they can't just transfer it to their own wallet or they can't get for anywhere they want you see what i mean so the strategies that you invest into white white white basically white listening wait white listing classes of transactions they can do okay essentially yeah yeah and so that white list can grow based on the governance so if advisors want to add more uh different you know different protocols and stuff they can they can have a governance token and they can vote on that um but yeah it is limited to what they can do yeah okay so it's like it's basically like an arena for different people to do y vaults kind of but like they're like 85 y vaults and people could yeah okay that's interesting yeah yeah cool basically yeah and another kind of cool aspect of the manager side of things too is that for a manager you don't have to be a crypto expert right um you you have these kind of pre-built strategies that you can use and you can like kind of get a good feel for it but you don't have to be the most knowledgeable person which is kind of a cool thing what we're kind of trying to go for i mean i hope wait oh to be an investor or maybe um oh yeah i wait full stop i want my manager to be an expert for you yeah me too yeah like you can just find someone to do that that they're doing i was gonna i was gonna suggest there was a project that um was done with that denver this year or last year um i think it was by the guys um behind pulled together or certainly some um of the team members were from pulled together and it was called high priests and you basically followed what these people were doing in terms of causes or projects that they supported and you put your money or like you followed what they did so that you would also put your money behind whatever projects they were supporting but like scott says they were let's say experts right like i would trust those people to pick projects based on experience based on like know-how all of that pick projects that would be winning or would be beneficial so you want those guys to be experts and you want to have a very simple follow mechanism so that you actually put that before any other steps if you're talking about noobs yeah you know i don't i don't know what the what the jail i agree with everything is what i just said um and i don't know what the jail risk is for managers um but if that's really really really low like i i i feel and y'all had users that actually wanted this like it seems like something that would be pretty attractive because like for an expert not only can you make some money you can also sort of like show your expertise to the community which is kind of like generally also an incentive you know yes for sure when i say expert i kind of mean you don't have to be a technologist right you don't have to be a programmer to understand what you're doing right you understand finance you under you can learn more about crypto you can start understanding how returns work but you don't have to build your own smart contracts you don't have to have that kind of technical knowledge i guess is what i mean you probably still want people that know people like so i actually agree i totally agree in principle with like simon and scott here but you know taking like the stance like you know i think like this someone's gonna build this tool right uh you know and it's a kind of permissionless in a way like someone's going to build a permission that's like pull manager that like you know kind of like curates you know a bunch of like preset and impossible like white listed pools right someone's gonna do this i think uh and you know i think like can you like yeah like there's going to be a recklessness but this is kind of the nature web free i think as well just like you know it's all permissionless right to some extent i think that you know but like i know it's hard to prevent people too like i know more secrets in the space than you do peter so it's like i'll be able some insight whether there's like more curved bugs out there like i think i think right now there's a lot of insight for like asymmetrical that's what makes it appealing right like that's what would make it appealing to me yeah you're getting there exactly i'm getting like a sneak right yes yeah like that's the whole feel of it any any final comments i do hate to interrupt i like it though it's great it's a good idea yeah thank you for all the feedback i appreciate it yeah it's awesome thanks guys good luck all right good all right hopefully the zoom issues were resolved we're going to hit back up the list to stop loss you want to try to share your screen hey yep hey guys so i'm going to try to do this uh yes it's working okay awesome go ahead and remember it's just five minutes for demo and questions uh if you can okay so really quickly uh we've seen uh with with a lot of excitement the fact that sunrise exchange has been have been replaced by decentralized exchanges but they were providing other services like landing and we've seen harvey that is doing this and it's great so building a protocol so that this protocol behaves as a as what the exchange was doing before in a centralized way that is block borrowing from users to others and so there was this protocol avi that that does this borrowing but uh centralized exchanges also offered other services like limit orders or stop-loss offers so basically you could say okay i'm gonna take a risk by by getting in this trade but i want to be sure that in the worst case scenario i'm going to be liquidated and so that i i know the worst case scenario like i take risk but i have a safety guard and so with this price exchanges we we have kind of lost that and so stop-loss is a protocol to to allow you to make stop losses so we we started on in permanent losses so basically the fact that when you provide liquidity to a pool uh you you you bring two assets like eater and dive in the ether dipole and you could lose a lot of dye or a lot of heater because uh the the balance your your liquidity changes and so that's what the project we've built uh is is a project that allows you to bring liquidity to a pool within that with one token so it's a protocol the protocol what it does is you provide liquidity you say i don't want to i will i never want liquidity to die eat you don't want to have two sorry you provide let's say three liter as liquidity in this pool but you never want the permanent losses to make it so that you have only two heater so you create a stop loss that says okay i provide three liters as liquidity in the pool but if the impalement impermanent losses make it so that i have only two left please liquidate me and so that that's how it works it's a protocol you said you you you settle you set a maximum loss and then you will have liquidators that will liquidate your position for you so now the demo so i unlock my wallet here i have so i have die usdc usdt and and these things and so i can provide liquidity to the pool with dye so it's going to provide liquidity to the pool dye weight they eat so let's say that i want to provide a 200 die so it's going to convert it for me in it so that like i get lp in the end and i can say okay i provide 200 die but i don't want to lose more than 50 i want to be sure to always have 150 like so that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna create a surplus and so what this transaction does is that first it chooses my die to provide liquidity to the pool ether die and at the same time it creates a stop-loss offer that says at 150 liquidators can liquidate my position and give me back the 150. oh i need to reset sorry i'm sorry for this of course the demo so you provide again 200 150 graph guarantee and so that's it you have 200 less and so you have you have now provided liquidity to the diet i've refilled the stuff so now you can see the the the stop loss you've done so here the one we just created is here so we put 200 in we said that we want 150 guarantee and the current value is 190 the health factor is is more than one and as soon as it gets under one you will be liquidated it is when your current value is close to 150 and in this case here you can see that i've pre-filled some orders and two are at risk so this one you provided [Music] one 104 die but it's and you the sorry the ground is 100 die but the current value is 1 103 so this is at risk and so liquidator can can liquidate your position so now let's see what happens if a liquidator actually does it so if it goes to the liquidate section of course it's going to be bought later but for now i've built this right so that people can liquidate so here you can see how we find the the stop loss that we see so has a liquidator now i'm going to liquidate that i have the right to do it because the health factor is negative is is less than one so i'm going to liquidate that hopefully i don't have to set my yes it seemed to work so now okay i can't see that but let's let's get back to the yes now it's it so it has been liquidated and so now the liquidator he he managed to liquidate the position so he got he gave back to the stop-loss order the amount that he wanted and he received the fees that was the extra amount because he he liquidated just before it went to 100 by so now if we get back to the initial user so now you can see that oh my my die has been here you can see that in the the closed uh stop loss offers one has been executed and you can see that the amount that has been raised raw is exactly what you were guaranteed so so yes and you can see now the die it's 2 15 and before it was 115 so that's how it works it's basically you you you provide liquidity you don't know a lot about impermanent loss but you're provided with one currency and you guarantee with the same currency and at the end you get the the let's say this one you can say okay now i want my liquidity back i want to die back and anyway so i think that's it so yeah now you can sell it so that's the we see it as a protocol that would be more used maybe by by by other smart contracts or i don't know but yeah it really is a protocol more than an app it's a protocol that ensures that you have liquidator that liquidate your position when when you want it so i think that's it for yeah let's move into questions if anybody has them feedback yeah that would have been my first um question what are the fees and how are all of these things covered so transaction fees do you pay these liquidators with that dynamic okay so the dynamic is that here so here i have uh let's let's look at this order the current value is almost two and uh the guarantee that i set is one nine one nine two and so the extra amount will be used to pay for liquidators so basically you incentivize them to liquidate your position because it's it's profitable for them and at the same time he has to pay the gas to make the transaction and gets back this value got it so they pay for the gas out of the money that comes from from what they make okay yeah we liquidate them just a bit before they are in danger so that we can pay for the liquidators got it okay so future thought might be like it'd be really really interesting if you could figure out a way for people to ensure the liquidity positions where it's like you know you almost have this like uh you know default spot right where like you know the others can bet that you'll never be able to you'll never need to liquidate right like you you it's almost like hedging this um possession i don't know it's a dumb idea but like i'll just like really really really large positions right and maybe you have these stop losses but you know you ideally don't want them to really kick in uh you know it's not in your favor maybe others are willing to like you know bet on that right so just an idea interesting um yeah to me it feels a little more like a feature than like a standalone product um like it might make sense inside of like a bigger interface um but that being said i feel like it's a a pretty novel feature um and also just kind of solving the stop-loss problem how like um how do you enj how do you ensure that the the stop loss is filled like at a reasonable time or like uh at a price that's okay for the customer or for the user so it's exactly like uh it's exactly like the business model of maker or or avid is that okay you don't want it to be executed but it's a worst case scenario it's when you are at risk and in this case you you pay fees so that people so so that a liquidator does it for you so really is a guarantee let's say that the price uh like yeah it's in the night and [Music] there is a very large permanent loss and you are you're not here you're going to be liquidated you have this guarantee and what is great with that is that you can you can give back an nft to the person that has this position that will be always worth worse more than the humans found there's a lot of things we could beat around that it's yeah yeah definitely make your doubts sort of learn the hard way that these systems can be complicated uh for like these liquidation auctions what would you say like the the advantage of like what you're doing is is there anything about the way you're doing it in your system that's like a bit simpler or like safer than like what is currently kind of being built into all of the protocols that have to manage collateral yeah so actually it's really simple is that uh i've built it the the subgraph that does it and it's for for building a bot that liquidates and that is uh that makes arbitrage like basically it's it's super simple to do it and it's just like people will make money if they liquidate so i don't see a world when they where they wouldn't do it like uh yeah if you see how much the the arbitrage are hard to get in right now if i say okay you can liquidate and you can earn free money pretty easily with this really simple api because you just have to follow the heads right now and manipulate when you can so yeah cool the should be making money so i i think that we could find something yeah no it makes sense nice well done good work thank you guys for the feedback i'm gonna share yeah cool thank you all right so we yeah thank you for presenting uh we are still waiting for austin to join but we're gonna just bite the bullet and split into rooms because i want to make sure we get um as many people as possible to go through so simona and peter i'm gonna throw you in the other room and then just start pushing people that way you're good with that uh scott you're gonna stay in here with me in austin when he joins all right cool uh let's try to get 20 pay hopefully you resolve your issues hey guys can you hear me yes okay cool yeah let me see if this works share perfect see that yep cool okay yeah so 20 basically what we're trying to do is create a little widget that goes in an e-commerce store and when you want to pay for something um so you see this is kyber network store and it says you can pay with you know knc ogn die ether credit card what we want to do is make it so that you can pay with literally any erc20 that is tradable on uniswap one inch etc um so basically you know you go in a store like this say you want to buy a shirt you add cart check out go to the checkout page it's right here and you have four options um k n c die eat ogn and what we're gonna do is throw our little widget right into here and you're going to have the ability to pay with hundreds of erc20 tokens just like that and the way it's going to work is we are literally going to call unit swap one inch on the back end right now we're using unit swap call unisop on the back end and do a token transfer for you into the token that the merchant has requested and up to the amount that the merchant has requested so we're still putting things together um sorry this is a little bit difficult um but here's our little widget that we're gonna throw in we're gonna change the look of this this is kind of what we're playing around with on the front end but basically you're gonna be able to drop down into what you want to pay with um it will give you something like you need to add up to you know one each and then it will do the unit swap trade on the back end for you um and so we have a lot of the smart contracts done and whatnot we're just actually putting them together in the next few days here so that's as far as i'll take the demo uh safely but that's basically the idea cool um yeah i think so what part of this is what already exists and what part is your project so yeah we're literally just building the widget and we're also going to build a demo ecommerce store that's going to look like this but it's obviously not going to be functional except for demo purposes um and so what we're building i i guess i guess the thing i'm trying to figure out is me paying with die is that is that your project or that's currently exists and you're just doing the switch from die to something else so you paying with those four currencies here on kyber that this currently exists this is their e-commerce store so you can do that and then what we want to do is make it so that you can pay with you know the 200 or 300 other erc 20 tokens that you can swap on uniswap okay cool yeah i think um yeah i think there's a bit of a problem right now for like merch stores because if you accept the projects token you probably have to sell that into the market and then it seems like anti-community uh but then if you pay in something else you're like not using the token for the project so it's weird but definitely like you pay and die and then i will market by whatever the project token is is kind of like better for memes so if i'm trying to growth hack my store yeah i'm like hey like i'm accepting die but i i market sell that to buy base so you can buy like my based money shirts or whatever right that meme is going to spread better on social media because everyone that has those bags will want to spread it so i think that's actually kind of like a cool a cool like little hook that's not currently available to people that want to sell crypto project related stuff who do you see as like your core custom core user so the core user is just going to be any you know sort of random ecommerce store that is trying to get up and running or trying to get a little bit of traction or get people excited um and then we'll we'll make it so that they're able to you know people that want to buy stuff they're able to use literally whatever's in their metamask account and it's going to work okay cool yeah i don't know i don't know how far you plan on pursuing this after the hackathon but i think there's currently like a missing spot in the market where like i can go on figma toss together some designs or whatever adobe or whatever i'm using and then i can do drop shipping really easily but this sort of widget can kind of like fill that missing link because i want the payment to be like in my currency and for like newly launched coins whether they're fair launches or farms or whatever letting community that's sort of like a good first project for like community members and if you're if you like created this like kind of like sdk but like entrepreneurial kit right and your app your widget was part of it it might actually i don't know i i think there might be people like projects would direct their users to use your thing to do the merch stores yeah that's a cool idea so basically what you're saying is you want to spin up a store like you can drop ship super easily let's also have you make a token super easily give it out to your you know early adopter users and then they can pay with that token immediately in your store well we'll well sort of like okay like when wifey launched right i was sort of like playing around i'd be fun to like toss up a really quick wifey merch store like sell wifey shirts or hats or whatever and like what what you really want to be able to tell people is that you pay me in stable coins and then but i'm actually going to like stack wifey when you buy the shirts so it's like you're buying you're buying the shirts and stable coins helps me accumulate wifey and buys wifey on the market so it's like for the community the more shirts that store sells that's all wifey being bought on the market so it's like a very monetarily insignificant amount of the grand scheme of things but it's like a fun thing to share so it's a good like growth growth hack for both early communities and the person that launches the the well is selling the shirts and sort of by extension your widget right right yeah i could see something like that for sure yeah i might like focus in on like one very narrow core first user and kind of build the experience around their needs rather than just kind of like for everyone yeah yeah just for bootstrapping i think that's a really good idea it's gonna be hard to penetrate the market if you don't have a specific place to focus yeah but i've definitely like wanted something like this in discussions with with like early communities because it is like a problem because you know if you buy in the token like you know bitcoin is like i don't want to pay in bitcoin because like that bitcoin just gets sold right right and so like this sort of solves that problem in like a pro social pro share way it's kind of neat i don't know interesting i think yeah i think i've already chimed in on this too and i think mine was all about making it really easy for the developer to integrate right yes just like npm install whatever it is and it just like works out of the box this cool little trick of on the way through you can swap it to different tokens and kind of i just caught the back half of that conversation but how kind of on the way through you can swap that for different tokens and how that can have some meme value to it in terms of what you're stacking on the other side that's fine yeah yeah and like what once you become no once any product becomes known as like the easy thing to recommend like it's in a niche market like it'll just sort of be included in docs or be included like in like the conventional wisdom and then you can like kind of get a toehold that's that's like you can build from right right because this isn't like the sexiest thing to market around so i think you're right that is kind of the way we have to get the toe hold yeah like no competitor or you will be able to afford an advertising campaign to like get this out there right so it's like you said it's like once there's a standard it sort of just sticks until the standard messes up yeah exactly cool i don't know yeah it's cool yeah no thank you guys for the feedback that's a really cool idea we definitely i don't think we had thought of that so i'm going to think a lot more about that and think about where we want to target early users okay thanks man well good luck cool thanks so much appreciate it guys thanks jack moving right along we're going to see if machu picchu is ready and if they yep yeah let me show you perfect you are muted if you intend to be muted yeah hello yes yeah yeah so uh uh like we were on the idea validation download and watchers uh in which farmers will go to enablers and and and give deposit their rupees to them uh for the uh compensation and the enablers will provide the mattress and mint uh tokens for them and that will be uh like used when the farmers have their crop loss and all those things that will be used to compensate them at the last so i will go through the flow first and then i'll show you the demo so uh first of all are they farmers they will have only if we add a currency but they will have no computer no blockchain knowledge to use they will go to enabler enable the person who will be identified uh using blue so that uh it's like a head of the village or some people will be identified and farmers will get their money to them then enabler will use a portis or any other uh service to generate wallet for the uh farmers basically addresses all those things and after uh after that enabler will send a request to our tab with the new address and the mobile number and the amount uh to register this particular farmer to the uh system now this particular system will send an otp to farmers mobile uh in which farmer can see like yeah the amount that is going to be minted is correct and and the address is there or not right so all this thing will be in the otp message and farmers can verify that because they don't have knowledge for blockchain so they can't use the platform directly but they can have otp service medicine service to see all these things once farmers get the message they will have the option to check whether the amount is correct or not details are correct or not and if it is not then they can just uh like they won't proceed from there and if it is correct they will give pro gate they will tp back to the enabler and enabler will use that to delete the token now all the tokens from all the uh farmers will be deposited in a pot so this spot is like a global pod and from this part we are trying to create a money market kind of thing like this part will be uh will be deposited uh on compound or away and kind of thing right and from there watchers can uh swap or borrow tokens uh in uh like using it or some other cryptocurrency so that uh they can have tokens so watchers are the people all over the world who will use the satellite data to assess the crops of the farmers who have deposited the repository in the pot right if what like okay and before watchers do the assessment they have two staking and for that they will not need tokens so they uh they will take the tokens from the uh from any swap or some rvr compound and uh they will do the assessment after doing this taking part so again the stake will come in our dab and the assessment will be done by the watchers and after a certain period of time let's say one month uh a final calculation will be done uh based upon that farmers will be compensated their money and and the watchers will be given by this stake but if they are not close to the result some mistake will be cut if they have they are very very close to the stake they will be rewarded at some point so in this way farm watchers will earn and farmers will also be compensated if they have a crop loss so this is the basic idea and the basic flow uh right now we have uh developed like eighty percent of it uh but we have some uh sponsors to integrate to it so this is the first page uh and uh like it has two options to choose the order from what is your metamask let's say i go with metamask in this case yeah so this is the account of a member we can see here like this member has deposited 80 uh rup tokens out of 100 100 is the total pot contribution right now if this member wants to contribute more he will just go here let's say he add 20 now when he's adding 20 is actually giving 20 rupees to the enabler that is present in his village and this uh enabler will click this button proceed and send otp okay now this otp will be sent to the farmer's uh registered mobile number so that pharma can verify like yes uh uh 20 rupees are being minted for him and that has been deposited totally uh diversity bought for this account right so now we can see the timer kind of thing right so uh within three minutes uh farmer will get get otp so this otp is basically a random number that we are getting using the chaining vrf and i have created a external adapter that uses some message service and from the on chain data on chain otp is sent to farmers mobile and from that mobile when we enter this otp here it will again be sent to our smart contract to verify so in our smart contract we have stored the uh hash of the otp and otp that will be entered there they will be matched with their matches then uh yes uh like uh the farmer has authorized the transaction kind of and uh so i have bought the otp now in my mobile and when i click on verify and contribute after this translation is completed now this particular farmer has contributed 20 more rbp tokens to the uh to the pot similarly we have water rolls and enabler rules watchers will uh will have the option to stake and do the assessment for the uh group so we can see like 120 is the total bottom one now and 100 is the condition of this particular farmer similarly we can uh switch between different uh accounts to show showcase to that but as time gets performance and our uh flow is very big so i'll stop here i think this gives a bit demo of like what we are trying to build and what we have well till now uh so yeah we are open for questions now uh until like you guys want to uh go further also i can i can go for that so yeah there's there's a ton going on that you want to go scott you go you go if you no no no it's in gaza okay okay i was just gonna wait i was just gonna really quick add that you made a ton of progress uh i remember from the previous call we talked about this and i'm just impressed like how how much the ideas crystallized since that call but it's pretty cool but yeah go ahead austin so that there's a ton you've got a lot going on here right there's a lot of different systems at play you've got chain link you've got uh swaps happening you you have the one-time password mechanic and i i think i say this to a lot of people that have these big ambitious projects first of all it's awesome right like it's great to be experimenting with all of these systems but there's almost always going to be something you find along the way like that one time password thing that isn't standardized within this the space yet right maybe there's not a system just to do that one time password think maybe there totally is too i don't really know that much about it in particular but that alone could be a really good hackathon project right just being able to set up a system like that so that that regardless of that like let's let's go to the like the human part of this and i think that's what's the key the key piece here is you're doing a lot of onboarding and you're interfacing with a lot of humans and a lot of humans have to understand these systems and so i think that the best first start not not on the on the hackathon side obviously building it but getting it in people's hands and seeing how they use it just trying it with some of your friends and and trying that onboarding process with them you might find some things along the way that can really inform how you build the thing so i i don't know if that's that's not necessarily like hackathon hackathon advice but more like i've been through a lot of hackathons building a lot of these things and i learned so much just by having a couple other people try it out and go through it and i would do that with that that onboarding process that you have set up yeah real quick just can you go back to the flow uh yeah well also austin i mean we're kind of in a hackathon i'm not sure what sort of prizes we're trying to get so sometimes there can be an incentive for slightly more checking off the list yeah yeah checking off yeah names yeah but if we were if we're going to take this to a market uh everything that's not on the screen right now in that upper right hand corner that can just go away i think we all can agree on that because i think whether this works or not is not going to be dependent on whether we're getting a little interest or doing some swaps it's going to be depending on whether like farmers want this insurance whether they trust this system or not you know and you almost start with farmers right you may find a a similar subset of humans that wish to participate in this that aren't necessarily farmers that may be easier to onboard at first right maybe it's like kids at an arcade or something like i don't i don't know exactly what it is but you can pick out some other subset that might be easier to get on board also well he has i love farmers cool innate he does have a setup no there's this like enabler system the local enabler doesn't okay they just keep their piece of paper and like the guy at the local shop kind of does it for the enabler is the one on the ground yeah it's like someone you trust from town essentially but like you know i would it like post hackathon strip out everything except for what you really need if you want to really pursue this and just go try it and see if anyone actually wants to buy it or like you know hold a giveaway in the first like season where like you just give away the insurance to like some subset of farmers if you can find someone to bag you and they buy the insurance and give it away and just see if it see if the simple version works you know because you'll know whether people care about this or they don't care about it if you offer it to them and you hear what they really say if people are saying they actually want this and you can make sales on like a very simple like something that like you're proud you did it but you're not really proud of how well it works type of product that can be validation to like take this bigger because it is like a big market you're addressing but you really have to get that answer does anyone care like does this system appeal to like your core stakeholders that you need to care about this you know yeah so next thing that we are targeting uh right now is to uh find out a system to uh like identify enabler for that we are looking to bloom uh right now but we have to integrate it yet and uh and uh one more thing was like regarding the reputation of the watchers uh i think scott suggested us to look into case in a beauty contest right so one of our team members looked into it and got an idea from that regarding the reputation yeah yeah just just just go to market go to market and see if it like yeah see if people care if people care you might be you might like you know it it could be a really big thing you know yeah but but also the simplification there i think that well my my last piece of advice is it's like way way way too complicated and i would be looking at one simple mechanism or or one simple loop and i would want to try that loop give it give it uh put it in people's hands and see how they use it and and really you can't do that during a hackathon i get that but like maybe your friends maybe you just have a fake round where you guys just pretend like you're doing it and you go through it you'll notice a lot of things while using it yeah thank you awesome thank you colby good to see some progress on this from last week thank you let me stop shooting yeah cool all right next up we have d beats you guys still around yeah hi hi uh we are team d bits um so um basically what it debates is uh it's a decentralized platform uh for independent artists so through which they can incentivize so how we are making this possible is uh there is a substance based pattern so whenever uh a person has to listen to the artist's music or his albums he has to pay a basic subscription fee through through that fee they will be unable to listen his uh tracks and that freeze that fee is completely reversible like if he wants to unsubscribe he will get the whole amount like there is no deduction and even the gas cost uh will be paid through our system so he just have to pay for that fee and what this will initiate for the artist is basically whatever the fees will be connected collected smart contract those will be posted into compound and over the period whatever the interest will be gained that will be distributed to the artist so it's a win-win situation for both the artists as well as the subscribers and then we can build things on top of this uh platform so i would like my teammate to show us a demo hello uh i'm vinai i'm a member of this team can i share my skin yes okay so i will like to show you the overall uh flow of the of our app and then i would like to uh to do a demo which uh till now we have created okay can you see my screen uh the draw dot io yep we got it okay uh so uh the technology technologies we use are portis audience audience component textual and matic okay so i want to start by asking a question uh do you all uh do you all know about audios what it is it's it's a streaming uh music streaming platform okay like uh everyone can go on that platform and uh listen to some music on which every game can be uh everyone can be a creator okay like uh if you are a creator you can create your music then you can upload on there uh on the platform and you can everyone else can listen to your music okay but there is no uh like a way to uh like uh get into the blockchain bit in that part uh so uh what we think is uh of this uh subscription based uh decentralized system uh in which the subscribers can uh subscribe to the artist which they like the most okay like uh and then uh the money they have subscribed like uh we have now just uh used a sort of uh like this is our app and uh there are so many trending tanks okay here so if someone clicks on a app and he uh starts to listen but he cannot listen after 10 seconds we have given a uh a restraint on that system okay and when he clicks on subscribe uh some uh staking money okay some uh he will take some 0.25 ether in this demo uh to the contract address okay and then that and then that money will go to this uh contract and then it will go to a compound uh compound api which will in case supply it to the seed tokens on which we will get almost three or three percent overall uh interest interest rate okay and then uh once he has subscribed it then you can see all the artist tracks okay he has just played his one song and he subscribed to the artist but we can now listen to all of the songs and we can listen it freely okay now he doesn't have to uh like wait for ten second uh reload and all he can just skip to any part and listen the full song okay uh and then what is the next part is like if he tries to like uh he has subscribed for like a month or a month or a two-month period and then he likes to like get his money back or he has bored or he just needs to just uh take his money and subscribe to some other artist then he can do it easily by clicking this unsubscribe button which will no sorry the api just failed which will in case which will in case call the buy economy api okay uh which will uh call the bi economy api and uh that way our transaction would be uh gasless okay like here are the all the buy economy apis we have set up uh which are supplied to supply the to compound redeem the seed and send that ether to uh to the user or to the subscriber itself and then so basically what we want is we don't want the end users to pay the gas fees yeah they just they just want to stake the amount and that incentive will be earned by the uh music creators okay and this is a stable stream through which the music creators can earn rather than some tokens or anything yeah uh see now i've unsubscribed it okay and then it will send a request to the buy chrome api which i don't know why it declines every time every some time uh wait a minute actually this is just working progress we are going to see this issue why it is going uh going on uh uh the biogrammy api setup was just uh done last uh in the last day so yes so this is our work till now yeah and there is like a second option to uh like if if you're not a long-term support of that artist if you want if you just like that artist and you and you listen to his songs like uh so much time then you can just give him a one-time donation okay and that can be done uh through uh poor test and then like uh he the artist will get his money uh and then like uh the artist will get a big amount of incentives okay like he he doesn't have to wait a long time for the interest to go back to his account and uh then he can just uh like create start creating his own content more and more often till now this is our demo awesome this is a cool project this is a good use of apis like you you do a good job of not reinventing the wheel these guys can do meta transactions for us these guys can handle the music stuff i want to kind of dig dig into the how that how that how you're handling the music stuff i'm guessing it's just like an audio api yeah yeah you're putting these songs on ipfs and stuff right they're handling that okay yeah so so you as the app builder have to pay some subscription to audience for the api and then that gives you the ability to have a service that plays songs is that how it works uh no actually it's completely free to get their songs awesome so it's like a kind of like a free spotify api in a way yeah now now i have um unsubscribe from this and uh it has run down successfully okay now you can see like i have 14.9 and suddenly uh increased like 2.25 how are you guys doing the subscriptions which okay uh for now uh we are like when when the artist is subscribing it the whole money goes to a contract address okay uh the the in the contract address all the uh calculations like supplying the ether to a compound to the compound address like as a whole and then getting the interest and then redeeming the ether and then sending it back to the uh subscriber who paid it so it's like a no profit no loss for the user to listen to the artist okay uh so like for when we subscribe then the supply to it compound uh calls and then it checks whether the contract address has enough uh balance in it and then it supplies to the compound uh here you can see here see uh this is uh last time when i checked and now uh the the see each tokens are increased in the address this is the compound it uh compound address sorry compound ether uh read contract from where we can feature we are basically by building on top of this we are managed to get a sweet spot out of everything through which there is a windmill situation for both the parties say that again sorry i missed that last little part yeah so basically by building on top of these we are we we have uh got a sweet spot like basically a small incentive and that creates a win-win situation for both the parties the artists as well as the uh subscribers yeah and the the instant artist onboarding is is a great idea that's what like with nifty ink that was like one thing that we really wanted to focus on is when an artist gets in it's free for them they don't even have to know about blockchain they can just get in and kind of do their thing right yeah and then on the other side the subscriber side that's the guy who pays and and you know has to put in the money and understand the wallet and stuff like that and also we are planning uh further if we are able to complete it till the end of hackathon to like make the uh subscriber we convert uh there on our side through uh one inch apis or something so how does the security work whichever way uh how do you how do you how do you detect like they've already only watched 15 seconds and like like that's definitely not in the smart contract that's definitely something yeah like we have just uh the users who have not subscribed to anyone uh will just like uh there there are free songs okay anyone who will listen to free songs can only listen up to 10 seconds he need to subscribe to those songs which he likes the most okay like he is he's uh getting a demo like how the song songs is gonna be in the in the starting 10 seconds okay and then if he likes that song he can subscribe to it and when he subscribes then he can listen the whole song for that we have like used matic contracts to uh do this fast transactions okay like when we subscribe now the whole bunch of like artist id go goes into the uh arrays of the contract matic contract uh because it is a layer to solution it is uh much much faster yeah and cheap and also much faster than the link b's uh ring b ethereum network that's why you may use it awesome this looks great guys uh scott do you have anything uh otherwise i think we should try to get in a few more teams before yeah no i like dawson's feedback it seems like a cool cool project thank you yeah yeah sure yeah thank you yeah all right we're gonna try to fit in these last three teams here in the time we have so blockchain a rpgs you guys want to try to present yeah um hey guys my name is um alfred schecker can you all hear me yes yep yeah uh so uh i'm working with my partner zachary law on a blockchain uh unfortunately zachary couldn't be here today he's uh driving i think from work but um so basically uh i'm gonna show a demo of our game so far and then talk about it and talk about what we're doing in terms of the blockchain stuff and uh yeah we'll see how that goes so i'm gonna go ahead and share my unity uh page and then i'll show you the program running also on webgl so you guys can see my screen yes all right so essentially um for our project we were inspired uh by stanley's idea from avi uh and when in creating uh the concept of an interest-bearing uh esports uh like competitive tournament um essentially the idea that we have is we wanted to create a kind of competitive game where like players don't fight directly with each other but like kind of uh they kind of compete in the gold and the person who achieves that goal gets the prize so essentially what we came up with here is a bit of a mix of a diablo-style game with the call of duty zombies where like the point of the game is to survive as long as you can um in an area and you know kind of use your power ups whatever you have to defeat as many zombies as you can get to the furthest level and then whoever does would be the winner so i'm just going to quickly show a demo of what we have so far of the game itself and then we're going to talk about the blockchain aspects so just going to hit play here we're going to see we have my player character here where can i have like this isometric view if you've played diablos should be a bit familiar uh we have one of the zombies here kind of shambling towards us if you hit c here we have a character sheet and i brings up an inventory so i'm gonna go ahead and start swinging at him i can see him kind of like reel back a bit if i want to back up here i can shoot a fireball towards him so eventually he's going to die so so he's dead and he has dropped an item here so if i go up here and pick up this item you can see it's popped in my inventory i got some chain mail if you're paying attention the armor here went up a little bit and so did the hp so basically you pick up an item it affects your character stats and of course the character stats affect how fast you die uh how much you can hit and all that stuff obviously if you play that uh any kind of video game you know this should be familiar uh and if you want to drop the item you can just hit drop you know the armor goes back from 14 to 10 health back from 105 to 100 so it's kind of the idea that you'd go around you'd kill these enemies they would randomly drop loot uh and you get the salute to empower you and you know mix and match what you want based on what kind of build you want if you want to focus more on your magic spells or your attacks obviously these are just like the first steps that we have for making something like this and the enemy of course is very basic just like chases you down and slaps you a bunch and does damage to you so we're going to go ahead and uh if i can get this is this share screen ui in my way right so we're going to get this out of the way here so essentially what the idea is what this is um is that you go through um and uh oh and we also have like a quick little level i can test uh i can show you it's um it's not uh fully like finished but this is another like example of what kind of aesthetic we're going for so this kind of these kind of visuals here um this is a level made by my partner zack so um so this is just kind of an idea of what we're going for we still have things to tweak obviously as you can see here like the edge of the level is showing with the camera angle and certain things like that but you know you can still fire attack there's enemies uh here somewhere yep here you go here's one of the enemies same deal just kind of beat them up and they drop their items items that we can see in the character sheet here staff all that stuff so um so the concept with this game the idea is that we want to have the uh players compete with each other and go through these uh these like dungeons that have these enemies um and you know there will be like different types of enemies and uh and uh the idea is that at the beginning of the week so we want to use um avi in a way that the beginning of like the tournament cycle they uh stake they stake money um uh you know like they would take and the funds would be pulled into an avi liquidity pool to gain interest throughout the like throughout the duration of the tournament and at the end of it whoever wins whoever has like the best time uh you know like for this level whatever we decide on being like the ultimate like winning condition whoever wins that is the person who gets to take all the interest and then everybody else kind of takes back what they staked so nobody really loses you just kind of like um uh you just you just kind of like play to try and gain over what you staked um and then another thing that we want to implement too or that we are working on currently implementing is the uh certain enemies will drop uh based on uh they will drop the loot box based um uh nft like they will uh drop like a kind of ft that will give you like a special ability or a special item that will greatly increase your chances of winning and this is triggered using the chain link alarm clock to trigger like the randomness for these loot boxes to show up so that we can guarantee that they're random and they're not like somehow deterministic or they're like rigged somehow or whatever right um so essentially these loot boxes would show up out of like boss enemies they'd be like legendary drops you know if you've ever played like world of warcraft or some other video game like rpg like that you know you get that one legendary drop that only comes around like you know if you're super lucky and then that item uh you know is the nft and you know it's a big deal because it gives you a big boost um that's kind of like the idea that we're going with here is just kind of have these like uh you know like zombie style diablo uh game you know uh see where we can go with that and uh take these uh take these blockchain concepts uh further this is uh our first blockchain hackathon so as first i'm working with like smart contracts and stuff like that so we're definitely excited to be getting into this kind of technology but uh you know i understand if we're you know thinking too much or you know uh if we guys have any feedback towards what we're thinking of you know like this is kind of like our uh you know first time tackling something like this i've made games for a while but and so is zach but uh we have experience in the game-making department it's just the blockchain stuff that's kind of brand new to us so uh any um feedback you know would be yeah and if any questions you guys have if i explain something weird or something you know i'm just kind of trying to wrap my head around it yeah no no personally i i i have some feedback for you i think um so in general um like at least in the states i'm not sure we're from in the states all of our sports leagues are like trying as hard as they can right now to get legalized gambling um on sports and it's because like people will watch a very a a sporting event they don't care about at all and it'll be fun to watch if they have just a little money riding on it it's sort of like using steroid for engagement and until very very recently like with ethereum kind of blockchain running with not that many transactions per second and slow-ish blocks and high fees it's been impossible to kind of have these real money games on ethereum um but i think and actually austin's i think is involved uh with a kind of dark forest has shown that you can like have a game that people even though there's not real money in it you can have a game that people are interested and engaged to play like running over uh like like x die which that one was run but i i i think the market i think this is a market that like maybe you i i i think a game that maybe a smaller team has created can compete with a much more fully featured game by only adding this like extra engagement of like the money being on the line um and i would say just just do this and ship something um because i i think you're going to find that there are a lot of people that will play this game um that may not play a game without that money on the line because it's just a little more like you know like when you win there's like a little more to be happy about you know oh yeah yeah um and i also think the mix of it being if like a skill game versus like a game of luck is treated differently by laws in a lot of places and then on top of that no one's losing um it may be much easier to like keep this within the spirit of the law um than like gambling on games which is what kind of a lot of people tried to do before now like in blockchain and gaming and so i i actually like the model and like i would be surprised if if you ship your mvp i i think people i think you'd have some people that would really that would try it out and might play and see how it does i like it i think my my main feedback like is like first of all the aesthetic of the game is gorgeous right like they're your your gaming exactly like you said your your ability to make a game is obviously really coming together it for me the question is and it is for you too you're saying how you know like how does that really merge with blockchain and what are we gonna do like i'm assuming that most of the game mechanics are sort of off chain and maybe you're using blockchain for tokens or or like are are all those upgrades going to be on chain are you going to find a side chain or something that's like cheaper or faster is it is it just like the final like once it's it goes into ave on main net there's like there's like that transaction and then everybody's kind of competing in the game that's not really in a smart contract to find finally when when that money at the end like where's the actual like what does the solidity look like here i guess or where's the smart contract uh action and don't let that discourage you like you you should keep building this and we should figure out how to make it work like i i love the aesthetic in the first place we'll figure out how to make it fun on chain i just want to know what you're thinking about that yeah for sure um so we're thinking of using like an nft smart contract and like so you saw like there was an item that like um dropped out of the enemy so like not every item would kind of be on that nft uh uh like on the nft smart contract where it would give you the token um and uh you know it would it would only specifically be something from like the end game like you know like one of like the end dungeon bosses or whatever like one of the big enemies that would come after like a few dozen waves or something like that because you know zombies you'd have like the smaller enemies and then eventually you'd get like the bigger boss type enemies like that would eventually show up if you go far enough so those would have the chance to drop that kind of like legendary loot would be that would be like the nft token and uh uh and you know we were talking i'm thinking even though you're talking about chance does the player does the player trust you and your servers that the randomness is happening do you go to an oracle we use chain link alarm clock and vrf for randomness so that way so that way it's like a verifiable like randomness so that they don't feel like they're being cheated or there's any kind of like rigging going on to you know what you do when you get the you know like your chance to get it so they still have to kill like the certain enemy but then that certain enemy would be the one who would trigger that uh verifiable like random um function that would then you know either give them the item or not give them the item and then if they get the item then they would have that um then they would have that token i've had this idea of like almost like a game master like you guys are the dungeons and dragons game master in a way where you are kind of having to play god in a lot of ways where they still will just run around on your servers and they'll be playing around and they'll be trying things but there'll be maybe some moment where within the game on your servers they do well and they get this magic dice roll online and that's kind of what you're talking about is you your tool your blockchain tools this magic dice roll maybe so then what they get is they play their game they play the game then also it's like oh this guy achieved the magic dice roll so the game master basically like you know uh allow lists them to go access that and then you know yeah i i'm with you now i got you that's that's cool so keep building this stuff this is really cool stuff like i love seeing such uh you know like uh such passion in the design and the aesthetic i love seeing stuff like that awesome thank you so much for the feedback and um also another uh thing is for like the lower transaction fees we that's why i was saying we are thinking of using like mavic as kind of like a side uh a side chain for any of the lower transaction fees like that's something we're thinking about doing but we're mainly going to put the for like the chain link one for the verifiable um yeah you can kind of do some decent like decentralize as you need right progressive decentralization yeah i gotcha so like maybe in the middle there there's some sidechain stuff where it's just like quick fast transactions then when they go to ave and mainnet stuff then that's a bigger even still but then like some off-chain stuff is just your servers and that's the 3d stuff and the the guys moving around i like that that's a cool system cool yeah thank you great thank you alfred for presenting we're going to try to fit in two more projects real quick uh clash of gears and d5 poly clash gears are you ready to go uh yeah hi uh hi guys uh my name is uh and then um the project i'm building the name is called the crash appears and then the goal of this project is that we have been building uh multiple like different different physical robots and then people can have a website and they can like assign for the lobby on the website and then we can then assemble robot for them then they use their logo to find each other and then basically we are going to use like um every to like to ask users to stay to stake into their money in the first at the beginning of the competition so basically this will be like at least for global competition so like people stay there inches into the competition first and then they choose uh or like building their robot to find their way to the top and then for each lobo they have like a different unique scale unique skill the unique skill represents as rft and then like you can do two domains and stuff you releasing to defeat the defeat other other lobo and then like in the end whoever lowers them to allow me wins like uh advice like because my english is not my strong shoe so i'm going to show you guys a video demo video while i'm talking and then i think you better show what i mean by that so [Music] in one second uh okay so basically like my basically my my goal is that we have um we can allow the user to design their own logo in a win wherever the way they want and two logo can fight each other and then in terms of the blockchain line we can issue each lobe our were assigned to a unique skill as an ft and then during the fight the user can also draw a random car like random card [Music] uh london skill kind that you will generate by changing so like the thing we show on the video here so this is a one design of our 3d printing over and then i'm currently working on the other one like these ones haven't been fully finished here so that we have different shape of robot we can provide user and the user can can uh [Music] modify or clear about like the way they want so like uh like currently i'm still on the beginning of um still learning about a lot of practice so i would like my friend to talk more about how the production to disable to work with this project yeah hi hi guys says irvin over here uh to kind of summarize really the concept uh came about because this is um there's this ios mobile app and essentially the app is about robots and they like to kind of put together your robots and they fight um but we think that's very simple so uh since you know sean is working on like ar and vr stuff and i've been looking into that stuff i feel like when you look at battlebots right and people are controlling these robots within a certain location and fighting etc um i think ideally we want to see in the near future would be sort of these kinds of events but except that people could control these robots remotely and one interesting idea is that rather than than just the skills of the robots existing in the physical world they could exist in the virtual world so for example uh sean 3d printed this uh flipper and swatter well the swatter itself could uh could perform different kinds of motions that could be represented as a type of nft and so in essence either these uh these kind of skills could be earned or rewarded as you fight more different kinds of robots and in the near future as sean was showing his designs that he's working on it would be really cool to to have a way for people to kind of build these robots remotely and just have them uh have them fight each other so essentially you are designing your kind of robot uh and and there's like these machines that allow you to put things together already and then you can just fight between each other and uh essentially we turn it into kind of like an esport thing so similar to to the concept from avi where you can have a tournament and people could just fight uh and a few other things uh so we're still working on the front end uh because uh really what we wanna do is we wanna be able to have a camera so it shows these two robots and just streaming this this this whole tournament happened live and they just allowed the people that are playing the two people that are fighting each other to connect to the robots just via websocket so we have that sort of going on and essentially if they want to join the tournament similar to uh the previous game and then the other ones they would have to essentially stake and i i'm not sure if uh uh sean shantu went over that but the robots themselves and internally we attached some little sensors so that we can notice that the robot gets flipped and since currently it's running a raspberry pi we're just listening to events happening on on on the smart contract and we're also sending it's at an event that uh something has happened overall so really that's that's what we're going for it's been a bit bit tough just with the robots um but i think we might be able to pull this through maybe uh in the next coming seven days uh definitely the other part was pretty hard this is really cool it's a lot of fun uh it it kind of goes to the same thing of like where's the blockchain where isn't it and how do you focus on finding the i i actually had a very similar idea of having a camera on a world and then letting people interact with that world on chain like could i could i set up uh my fish feeder on my fish cam so if someone paid like a dollar of x die it would feed my fish right and then their their interaction with the physical world and the you know virtual world and there's this element of blockchain there too there's there's a lot going on here for sure but i love the idea of there's this live cam somewhere like like this live view of like an eagle's nest or something but really it's these two robots and these two robots can can basically be controlled by maybe it's a dow right maybe you have two doubt you have a dow controlling each one and people are like buying into the dows or using a token vote or some of these weird like kind of on-chain mechanics but to control like these two physical robots that are slapping each other on the other side of the world i think it's a really fun experiment and i like the style of all of this ah thank you we were thinking initially about doing like a chess robot thing but we just thought that might be a bit boring so the fighting part was sounds exciting i mine were simple mine were just like if like my son has a duplo train and i was thinking i could definitely just set that up so like someone whoever has the highest bid is currently controlling the train or something like that and then maybe like if the train was under a certain thing the owner would be collecting some kind of token you know you you use some kind of trigger or mechanism or sensor within the real world and let people position and control things similar to getting into weird positions and contracts right they you have to move everything in the weird the real world just right to then unlock some cool on-chain thing using sensors and and all this like hardware you have i props for the hardware too i'm an electrical engineer uh by training a bad one probably but i love i love robotics and i love seeing uh physical stuff too this is cool guys keep keep it up thank you austin cool um yeah guys keep keep it up i'm looking forward to see maybe uh two robots fighting each other at the judging session or something uh we're gonna do one last project um and that would be uh who did we just have a d5 poly if you are here and ready to go it's gonna be our last one for the day cause i know um austin and scott probably have other things to do hi everyone can you see my screen yes yes okay so defy poli just as a reminder it's a kind of monopoly um to educate people to educate people about blockchain decentralized apps and um defy mechanisms it's um decentralized game so every every action in the game is performed by a smart contract there is no centralized server um to talk about technical things um i've had to face several challenges um during this this design the first one is a full decentralization that requires random numbers and random numbers can be provided by chain link vrf feature so i'm just integrating this these features in my game um second second challenge is i would like seamless connections for user because i would like to address users that doesn't know blockchain yet and that doesn't have an ethereum account um so i think portis is a very good um it's a very good part to um to connect people to the blockchain and to automatically create the account and uh so it's it's uh it's more easy than metamask um i would like also a fast and cheap transaction it's very uh important for for this kind of game so um i'm implementing the smart contractors on i'm deploying them on matic it's a layer two solution and the next step i would like no fees transactions for the same reason people doesn't have an ethereum account at the beginning so they don't have any native token either ether or matic tokens so they don't they they cannot pay for the transaction so um i would like to integrate a guess relay but um i would like the players to fund the gas relay indirectly i don't want to pay for [Music] every players in my game so what i would like to is using a pull together so people are staking money on a pool and the the interest that are earned by the pool um funds the the gas relay but that's on the layer one um pulled together and and the interest earnings on layer one that means we need um we need a connection between what happens in the layer one for the users for the the pulled the pool together and the gas relay on layer two he must be able to check uh if the user has contributed to the pool to allow guest list transactions um so i don't have chosen the solution yet for that so i still need to investigate that and um last one because there are some actions on layer one and all direction on layer two um i found the port is very useful because i can you can easily switch from the two layers and you keep the same address so it's very easy and completely transparent for the user um general overview we've got on layer one with we we can connect to put together and generate uh interest um to fund the gas relay and on layer 2 we have a contract that is a game factory we can create all the contracts that manage a game session and so people can interact with the game contract after that and there is a chain link oracle on automatic they didn't have a node nodes on matic before so i have i've deployed one with the support of training training team it doesn't support vrf now so i still need to to progress on that point with still with the support of jailing together the vrf working on matic so let's see a demo so don't pay attention attention to the look and feel still under progress so that's a first connection page using portis so let me refresh yes so import this requires a login no i'm i'm logged in on the on the layer one on on girly so here is my my account so can i have a look on etherscan this account um so in to to contribute to the pool i need to stake usdc so i need my balance of sdc to be more than 10 because the stake is 10 usdc and i get my stack back so it's um it's a fake interaction though it's just to show the demo um and now i have in at usdc i can stake this usdc and pull together and and i got pulled uh tickets from pull together the ticket is the proof that i've contributed to this uh to this pool so i'm now allowed to use the guys relay during the game so i can enter the games now we are switching to matic yeah oh sorry it's refreshing whatever um it's it's reloading on my tech come on a bit long yeah so parties is refreshing now i am i'm on layer two same same account but on layer two um i've seen different game sessions already existing and i can join these sessions so let's see this station this session is managed by this contract that's the game master contract okay i will interact with this game master um i can start the game because it's not started yet so i will send a transaction to call the contract and say we start we have two players so here is the second player so it's another account it's um nine four seven one nine four seven one is this one okay so i've got two players on the same same game sorry i have need to refresh because i should be able to play i'm i am the next player um no here's the next player yeah unfortunately we we are 10 minutes over time so i want to make sure we at least get some feedback from austin okay and scott real quick so so yeah here are my achievements yeah you see the demo and and and the things that remains to be done still a lot of things integrate pull together integrate the the gaze relay and complete the the game i would say don't worry about the gas relay don't worry about pool together don't do anything on l1 focus right in on that l2 piece where those two players were playing and they were rolling the dice that's where it's all at that's where it's all about make that fun focusing on making the game fun for the players will get you you will make way more money in the long run than you will on some sponsorship prize if you can make a game that's fun for people to play i would focus on this right here the onboarding getting people to the moment where they're rolling the dice and they're playing the game and and get rid of all the bumps in between i understand you're saying gas network or gas station network or something like that you can assume that they're going to have gas they're going to be ready to play set it up so they can do what you're doing right now and i think that's the key piece all right all right thanks um yeah i would i i thought it was gonna be monopoly but on the blockchain but then the game looks more like a dice rolling game no um it's it's it's a monopoly it's it's inspired by monopoly it's not exactly monopoly i've changed um a standard rule i've adapted the rules to the the crypto executive ecosystems um so you can launch acos you can take money you can do these kind of things um to to use define mechanisms in in the game so i've come it's like monopoly but it's not not the same rules has been adapted yeah okay yeah yeah uh one thing uh i i i don't know if if if the branding should make it seem exactly like monopoly and then you get in there and there's actually an original game because there's so many times monopoly itself has like done like uh like a a disney movie version of monopoly and so i thought it was gonna be exactly monopoly and then when they get in and it's actually like an original game that's a bit inspired by monopoly i think you might be kind of down down selling yourself a little bit i agree you might be creating something really cool here yeah yeah yeah you've created something new but like you know like there's star wars monopoly which is literally monopoly with different star wars names as the monopoly but you're kind of like i'm expecting that but then once i get in it's a new game so i might kind of like communicate the originality a bit better and not sell yourself short so maybe it's as simple as like a different name uh yeah that probably that that probably do the trick maybe like defy mogul or something or i i don't know just like something that kind of like communicates that it's it's a new game because uh that that'll make people like people like novelty when they're trying a new product and so more people probably want to try something if they think it's going to be something they haven't done seen before okay yeah good it's easier to explain when i say it's like monopoly but uh it's it's a bit different yes yeah but i don't know i think it's interesting i definitely agree with all austin said just like you know focus on the user um if you continue with this after the hackathon definitely focus on the user and uh less on the sponsors for the the other the integrations okay it's a constant uh constant challenge for hackers figuring out what to prioritize but yeah it's good to see you at this point and you've still got a week to work out maybe some of the issues with having two players going so i'm looking forward to see how you resolve those things great thanks well thank you ludo all right we are 15 minutes over so i want to thank everybody for sticking around including scott and austin uh these guys are awesome and you should follow them everywhere they are very wise crypto men um they've got knowledge out the wazoo uh so we're going to wrap here uh if anybody has any questions or something that didn't get resolved try to ping me in the discord now i'll see what i can do and remember that your video for next week is four minutes max so it might feel impossible when you start to you know record yourself talking about it but it is actually possible um you want to get your concept across very quickly and then you know this this video is super important for getting to judge getting judges to understand what your intention was with what you're building and how far you came along with that intention so um start to when you're when you're going through your demos or practicing yourself just keep that in mind um we'll have details on judging hopefully uh before this weekend and any questions again just reach out to one of the team members all right we're going to wrap here thanks everybody for coming we'll see you in the discord happy thursday thank you thursday thanks scott thanks austin
