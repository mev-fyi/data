hello hello good morning good evening afternoon hi there how's it going well can't wait to hack it's good I will just give it a minute or two let people join will this be your first uh Global hackathon or for me it's the sword or Force okay first ever hackathon in my entire life nice you excited oh yeah and I don't I don't know what's in front of me but we'll see let's go yeah hopefully this uh helps ease any nerves you may have around it um and yeah of course we're we're here to help if you uh need anything that's something from Switzerland Spain I personally from Texas we're based in Texas let's give it another minute foreign okay we can go ahead and get started now so awesome welcome everybody to the uh beginners workshop for super hack uh super hack as you probably know is starting this coming Friday so um you know we have a few events kind of lined up before the hacking officially begins before the opening kickoff and ceremony starts this Friday um and uh yeah so uh this is the uh we've kind of done a couple of these beginners workshops uh this year so uh you know a bit a little background you know we received a lot of feedback requests for folks who are completely new to Global events and to hackathons in general uh kind of trying to asking for you know guidance and retools resources before the event actually begins just to make sure that you know they're as fully prepared as possible in order to you know participate in the in the hackathons um so of course we have youth Global's been around for five years and so we have have a lot of hackers that are veterans but almost every of our events um and as we continue to grow and grow we obviously get a lot more new new hackers so the idea is really just to make sure that you know provide the uh comfort and guidance that you if this is your first event you know don't there's certainly no you're not meant to feel any pressure or anything whilst this is a hackathon it's not really meant to be competitive it's meant to your ultimate goal should be to you know really learn something to take away whether it's um something at a partner or a mentor showed you within a particular Tech stack or that you know you just kind of kept pushing yourself to learn and learn and grow and fail and Grow Again and that's kind of basically the outcome of our hackathons so again if this is your first one please definitely do not feel any pressure whatsoever um if you're if you see some names like oh wow you know this person's in this hackathon um that's certainly not I'm not trying to create that sort of environment here um but yes as long as you're you're learning and you're growing and you're you know could get enough pushing outside of your comfort zones and your boundaries and that's ultimately what we're trying to achieve here with our hackathon star events um so yeah I'm just going to go over a few things on the dashboard that some of you may or may not be familiar with yet as well as kind of go through the Discord a little bit and um you know just kind of talk about uh stuff that's coming up as well some some opportunities that that I think you all might find interesting um and we can uh generally if people ask questions throughout the the uh the um the workshop and that's totally fine as well so uh if you do have a question feel free to sort of maybe interrupt me and because I I might not be able to see it if you type it in the chat so don't don't be afraid to to uh to just kind of hey you know I've got a question real quick about something I just spoke about and then there'll also be time at the end for for Q a as well so uh I don't expect this to go the full hour but um you never know we might we might get to that point so um yeah so let's go ahead and get started so um this of course is the the super hack dashboard um if you haven't been here already or if you're not familiar with it yet definitely take the time between now and Friday too to kind of acclimate yourself to it there's a lot of resources on on the dashboard um and so any if you have particular questions chances are it's going to be here you just kind of have to find it and sift through it a bit so if this is your first uh hackathon for the Youth Global you're probably overwhelmed with all the material that's on here but I guarantee you that everything that you could ever want is is somewhere on on this on our on our dashboard on this page um if you're if this is your first hackathon and maybe you're you're kind of worried like I don't have a team yet or I don't want to hack solo um you know what what should I do uh do not fear you know we do have a couple of Team uh uh formation brainstorming sessions uh this week one is on Thursday and then the other is a Friday so Thursday morning Friday evening if you're in the states depending on what time zone you're in um and then also you know if there's the Discord find a team Channel as well so I'll show you that in a little bit but um if you don't have a team yet you know definitely you you don't don't be a don't be alarmed or worried um but one thing that some people don't necessarily know about and this is something that we're working on is uh on the dashboard if you scroll down a bit you have your team overview your team so this is you know the youth Global team test dummy account if you click this I agree to my Discord username being shared with other hackers to contact me for team formation uh your this you'll basically become part of a directory so if you click find team member and then you'll see your information your details kind of stuff which you filled out in your application and then if you want to filter by by particular Dev tools programming languages you'll begin to see hackers that have also um that have also provided this information so this is sort of like a really neat way to see who else is maybe hackers that want to join a team or teams that are looking for more members so if you haven't seen this yet definitely take advantage of this um and of course everybody's Discord name is provided to you so it's easier to also reach out to folks as well but this is something that people haven't noted sometimes don't really notice that it's there and so it's up to us to kind of make sure that we do a good job better job of promoting that information as well but if you scroll all the way down you can see there's 240 results 240 hackers that have opted in for this in Discord so um I would say if you're if you're unfamiliar or you're not not still looking for people to join your team or you want to join a team of somebody and please uh take advantage of this so the the filters and then all the all the other hackers that have provided this information um as you may or may not know like in the Discord uh we had the fun and team Channel as well so people have been posting on on this on this channel for uh to try and you know say Hey you know I'm here at full stack engineer looking for this or that so this is another great way to to find a team team members as well um one thing with Discord you know just make sure that if you're pinging somebody that your the DMS aren't private they're open um or that you know you accept friend requests that's just kind of one bad thing that this court has if you're trying to connect with people that you may or may not know already um but uh yeah so that's that um if I go back to the dashboard um so yeah so that's that's that um and then the project this is where you know you could right now you can basically kind of start doing an outline for your project you can't there's some there's some items that you won't be able to to um obviously submit when it comes to the project but uh if you you know click a few things your name or the category or whatever emoji that breast represents your project you click on confirm create project and then boom you'll be able to to um to see kind of what uh what what you're gonna expect it to be to fill out so you confirm as you read all the points and creative event rules create project okay so obviously you can't submit a project yet but there are some things that you can go and start filling out like maybe the short description if you have a description what you want to do already um of course as you go further and further along this you won't be able to fill out everything but I if you kind of have an idea what you want to do already definitely take advantage of this you know start submitting start providing this kind of the admin stuff administering stuff early on that way when it gets comes come comes to crunch time you know towards uh Sunday the um uh mid middle of August that uh you're not you're not you know feeling that that pressure um and you are able to to edit this you can go back anytime and edit this before up until you submit and submit your project so if you were to create something now and then you know two weeks from now you actually I completely done something new or different then you can go back and edit that that is not a problem once you submit your project that's when you won't be able to edit it obviously um but um but yeah this is this is something that you can certainly kind of kind of do right now um so we asked for you know the logos cover images screenshots of what you're doing um and then the the demo video as well this is um a demo video this is something that I would say definitely don't wait till last minute to to create your demo video uh the demo video is used for whenever you're they're doing the live judging and the asynchronous judging so it's quite quite critical and quite important piece for an online events for in real life events it's a bit different but um there are certain guidelines strip relations around the the demo videos as well so um you know just just make sure that you you read through the materials uh around this not gonna I'll go over a little bit in the info center um and you can also see a past past projects and what people what other whether their teams uh have done as well um and then if you even go to like the uh the Showcase page if global.com forward slash showcase you can select you can search for projects it's like different events so the most recent online event was hack FS 2023 so you can go in here and check out other other projects what what folks did um for for that event uh currently there isn't a good way to filter it by like project winners or the global finalists but if you scroll through and you can see some of them that have these um partner icons next to them that means that they were a partner Prize winner so you know mint lock was the push protocol best use of push SDK but you can see here like this is their video they have a few screenshots logos and stuff um so all this all the stuff that you provide on on here this is kind of Where It ultimately will go in the Showcase page and so this is something that obviously you can you know share with you know potential employers or anybody really and to show that this is what you worked on at an indie Global hackathon at super hack um and then the other video here this is again this this is what you're creating uh what you're making whenever you submit upload your video so definitely take the time to uh to kind of uh have a really good thought around how you want to want to present it and do it but do not I highly recommend not waiting until last minute to to create your video um when it comes to submissions to close to the submission deadline um so that's that uh the team this is you know if you found somebody you want to buy something to your team you can um you know enter their name email click invite and they'll receive that acceptance uh there's a maximum of five team members but you can also hack solo you're not you're you don't have to have team members if you don't want to um some people hack solo and that's fine but you can't have more than five team members and anybody that's on your team has to be a registered confirmed hacker so that means that they've they've submitted a super hack application they've been accepted they've staked their 0.005 eth and so they're confirmed they're good to go um you can't we you won't be able to invite team members that have have not submit an application done anything like that at all so if there's somebody that you really want to hack with and they haven't applied yet definitely you know tell them to submit an application the application deadline is this evening at midnight eastern time so still have you know a good while to uh to submit an application and and be accepted so um yeah it's just something that we have sometimes we have a few people that that don't necessarily uh do that submit their uh have make sure that all the teams are there okay if I keep scrolling mentors so we've got a few Tech mentors uh joining us so these aren't people that are part of like the of the partners so they're not part of optimism or a world coin or Zora or anything these are just folks who've done hackathons before with this um who are just worked in the industry for several years and want to get back so they are here to help you all uh we currently have four right now we're trying to get a few more online events is we don't necessarily receive that many just because it's an online event is drawn out over the course of a couple of weeks but um these people these mentors are here to help you answer any typical questions that you may have so they'll be you could find them in the mentorship help channel on Discord which is right here um and if if you want to reach out to them personally individually like of course you can you have their Discord names and their Twitter handles as well and you'll see what time zones are into it so depending on you know if you if you're trying to get an answer for them right away it might you might not get an advance right away depending on where you're at and where they're at if they're sleeping or not um but yeah so these are I mean the mentors are here to provide the technical guidance help you you know get through your blockers for your projects or clarify the ideas or thoughts you that you may have around your projects um but then also we have excuse me we have the mentors but then we also have the the partners and the partners have their own mentors technical mentors associated with their projects as well so if you go here my colleague Anna she's already because filling out prize information for the different partners and prize information links related to each of their each of the each of the different partners but if you have a particular question around like hyperlane then definitely send a message here the partner hyperlink Channel or partner World coin and then those the devrels uh or the devs from from these teams will will answer your specific questions around their protocols so um yeah the mentors are there to kind of like overall General guidance and but uh if you really want something an answer specific to particular question around a project and definitely take advantage of the uh the Discord partner channels as well and if you're not getting a message like I I monitor these the channel so if somebody's responding to you then I will make sure that I I follow up with the partners or the mentors say Hey you know this hacker is asking asking for help and he's needs your guidance so I will make sure that somebody does answer your question as quickly as possible um to go back and the schedule so right now of course we have you know The Beginner's Workshop uh we actually do have a inside the op stack uh uh Workshop tomorrow by Kelvin from optimism so definitely suggests that everybody you take a look at the different the the events that are coming up here's the idea breaks over team formation session I mentioned on Thursday and then the other one Friday uh of course hacking begins Friday at 11 A.M by time which is noon so if you have a question about time zones like it'll be automatically filtered for the schedule will be filtered for your time zone based on where you're at so if you're unsure like it's double check the time zones and everything this this becomes really important uh whenever we get to obviously to uh to the submission so project submissions are due Sunday August 13th at 11 A.M my time which is um you know noon eastern time so we try to make sure to make it as clear as possible because sometimes people may forget or they they thought that the project submissions were due on the Monday instead of another day um so yeah it's uh just keep an eye on the schedule this this this will be this will be sort of a great reference point for for you all uh to look at um and then yeah the project feedback sessions these are these are next uh one sex Tuesday one six Thursday the project feedback sessions uh they're an opportunity for you all to get get feedback for your project so it's not it's not like a submission you're not required to do it we highly encourage you to do it because um whenever you do this you basically you kind of provide the partners an update on where you're standing so if you're applying for specific partner prizes you submit your project feedback it'll be in a project check-in so on your on your dashboard you'll see um you'll see like a project check-in button and we'll obviously we'll notify you on the Discord Channel as well but you'll basically provide a description of what what your project is any blockers that you're facing Technologies you're using any questions you might have for a particular partner and then those Partners will get it so if you're stuck on something then they will be able to address it as they see fit uh there was a question so for project feedback is it one-on-one feedback or everyone who wants feedback just join the meeting and describe their project uh that's a good question Kelly so it's um it can be one-on-one it I think it depends on how the partner wants to tackle it so uh in the past I know some partners that they will reach out to you individually some Partners will sort of host their own like office hours and then they'll just answer questions all at once um I think it's so yeah I think it just depends on partner to partner but we um ideally everybody that does submit it will get some sort of feedback from from the partner um yeah so that's uh you get asked uh I can't see chain link as a partner in Discord channels but you can are they a partner in super hack so they're currently a partner we haven't we're still waiting on prize information from chain link so once we get that information then it'll be open to to the hackers but currently we're still waiting on a few items from them so that's why you can't see them but I can see them um another question was how can one know what each partner prefers will we be getting an update on Discord and and Co and co uh so how can one know what each partner prefers um yeah uh yeah um I I think I think I understand your question but if you we can go like if you go to the partners uh tab over here sorry so this is the part it's actually if you want to go to the prize this time if you go to the prizes tab so the price is a tab and even in the the Discord channels uh you'll see basically see kind of what you see here so you have you have the breakdown in different prizes that the the partners are offering the amounts uh but then also what what it would take to win win a partner prize so um that's I think if to answer your question I think this is this is what this is what you're referring to so this this is what you would know what what a partner prefers um when it comes to their prices so some of these like a base hasn't hasn't provided uh information just yet um but hyperlane here we have you know what it would take for best use of popular and warp Roots um uh so yeah this I think I don't know if that answers your question or not and feel free to check yourself off mute if you if you if if I didn't really answer the question I I just meant like um what would happen if uh so how do we know whether um one partner will host office hours or the other department will you know oh yeah one-on-one sessions and stuff like that so it was a follow-up to Kelly sorry gotcha gotcha yeah you know they would uh they would make an announcement in their partner in their partner channels um so right now it's a bit quiet uh once once the hacking begins like all the the the partners representatives from each partner will start answering questions on here and stuff so they'll be they'll be the ones that sort of provide provide they'll send a message to their channels um addressing any project check-ins or their methods or whatever they prefer uh but yeah I can't uh yeah because it varies uh there was I know for hack FS one partner uh how to just received the whole list of everybody and just kind of individually tagged folks in Discord so to be honest like it's we don't have a there isn't a set guidance and uh around how we want the partners to do this and I think it probably ultimately just depends on what works best for them so it's very uh sort of done asynchronously um and maybe once once we find maybe if there's something that works for one particular particular partner really well we might ask that another partner to try this method as well um but uh but yeah so it's uh it's not um for anything like that it'll be they'll they'll post announcements in their in their individual partner channels yeah okay so if I go back but yeah so and go back to the project feedback so yeah it's um I definitely I'll definitely say take advantage of it you know it's uh it's really great way to to kind of put your project out there and just to early on and then to kind of get that that early feedback before you submit you know projects um you know a couple of days after the project feedback sessions are done um and then and yeah so the what's what's that so one one thing that we started to do in Racine I always get a couple questions around this is the uh misjudging so project submissions are due you know on August 13th don't wait till last minute to uh to submit your projects um we always will have to always have deal with the handful of cases of folks that uh just because everybody's trying to upload their videos or they'll submit their application at the same time so the the website can can tend to be a bit slow and then everybody starts worried and freaking out uh so I would suggest that you start doing this a couple of hours before uh the uh submission deadline uh on Sunday that way it gives you peace of mind and you're not having to worry about it and it just makes congestion on the side a lot a lot easier and simpler to deal with um and the main thing around this really is that the the video the your demo video that you're uploading creating because it's you know two to four minutes and it's um you know it's kind of the you know what ultimately that the judges will see so you want to make sure that you put a lot of care uh and quality and effort and time into your your demo video um so doing it well before the the deadline you know is much is highly encouraged instead of doing it like 30 minutes or an hour before the deadline um and this is something like if you I mean if some people maybe if you have a demo video done well beforehand then if you if you want to show in the project feedback like that's that's certainly a possibility as well um yeah so once that's done then on the next day the Monday we have asynchronous project judging so this is uh we will kind of filter out projects uh before live project judging so there's a few criteria that that goes into this so um how do you find the criteria so if you go to the info center and then in here I mean there's a lot of different resources but like probably the most important pages of rules project submission and judging so you have a lot of the the key information about the the deadline how long the demo video must be and then qualifications for round one include the video presentation quality project live demo quality and the proper use of git commit history so these are the the three main things that the the app the project reviewers are looking at before they move on to live project judging um so just make sure that you know whatever you're submitting that it's it's um it kind of it meets these meets these different criteria um and then once you if you make it through screening then you'll you'll get an email about the details for the next day which would be uh on Tuesday when we do the live project judging and so the live judging is is you have uh you know we have about eight or ten different judging rooms and then two judges per room and then so you'll be assigned to to one of those to one of those rooms and then you'll have four minutes we'll play the your video your demo video and then three minutes of q a so the judges will ask you questions and you'll answer for about three minutes and then it moves on to the next team so it goes quite goes quite quick um and the reason why is just because it's a lot of teams that we have to get through a lot of people's time set you know that we're pulling from all over the world and not just not just us but like you know judges hackers you all so we try to get through as quickly and efficiently as possible um and if you're if you're submitting if you're not like so I mean if you're only doing partner prices then you don't have to worry about the the live judging all you have to do um is the the partner judging will will take place async so you submit your projects um on your on the dashboard you select which PRI which partners that you want to want to select so if I go back real quick there was a question can two people present uh yeah well anybody um you so you have five five members Max on your team so and then every all the five team members can be in the in the judging room uh whenever you present so you don't it's not like it's limited to one or two people so it can be one person or five people um and you it just depends on how you all want to want to present uh your your project or want to answer questions so sometimes somebody that's really technical will answer all the 10 questions somebody else will answer some other questions um but yeah there's no there's no limit like everybody if you're if you're present for for the Tuesday for the live judging and then you all will be promoted uh as as panelists in the zoom room so you'll be in the same room basically with with the judges um yeah so for for partner prices if you select go to select prices under the project tab uh this is where you'll select like top 10 files and partner prices or partner prices only top 10 finalists means that's you the potential opportunity to present during each Global's closing ceremony on that that Friday um so these are the the top 10 top 10 projects that that are presenting for doing an actual like live live demo not you're not playing your video you're doing a proper live demo um and so that's what the live judging is all about you're the live judging is meant to find those top 10 teams the partner prizes are just if you if you're only submitting for maybe optimism or worldcoin you would select these um you can't do it now because it's not not really like it's not active but you would select these provides a few information within each of the partners and then you would uh you submit and that's basically it so like the partners will receive your information and then they'll pick asynchronously which which teams they think should should win you know their their prizes so you don't have to do any present presentations to to the partners for this um so if you've been to our in real life events normally you would present live and then you'd go downstairs to the partner booths and present to the partners um so here you don't have to do that all you're doing is this is why the demo videos is pretty important because they're going to see the demo video uh so you want to make sure that whatever you're you're doing that the audio is good that the quality is good um that you know the demo works because this is what the partners are looking at and look the live judges as well but definitely the partners are only looking at this because they're not they're not getting into really ask you any questions about about your project they're just seeing what you put information you've provided here um but that's that's the difference between partner prizes and like the top 10 finalists so um again if you're not if you're just doing partner prizes you didn't you have to worry about live judging you're you're you're basically you're you're done you're good to go so I think that was uh let me let me go back if I seem to say anything so and so yeah so I mean uh this I mean again this page that the rules project submission to judging like again it has a lot of information around you know open source libraries and boilerplates um can I work on a previous project can I work on a project before you know it starts so it'll cover answer a lot of questions that some folks may have around this um and then even the judging criteria so this is what the judges are looking at when it comes to to uh to a rating ranking uh or rating of projects as well um and then we do have some some past examples of good projects too so definitely take a look at these as well um and even if you go to you know past Heath Global fireless if you go to like our Twitter um and see like the finalist threads that's that's a good good area as well let me see if I can do it real quick oh you know what because I'm in cooking you know I'll do it later I'll share with you all later um okay so that's that uh just a few other things like I mean we've got the the speakers and judges so here's some some folks that'll be that'll be currently already you know presenting just feel a few more I think they need to be onboarded uh I already showed you all the partner the prizes and again so some of this information like like for bass hasn't been updated yet so expect to see more information from base and World coin in the next couple of days um if you have any like other other particular FAQs then definitely check out the FAQs page in terms of you know when will I get my stake back or I don't see my mistake after the Project's end has sent or hackathon has finished why is that um so that's that's kind of where you just find this information as well um and let me see so yeah and I kind of went over that uh super hacks like the the event schedule all the pings you know again we have some stuff here for the summit the summit will have particular like individual uh workshops going on so you'll see more information in here um again this the information tab has links to kind of everything I just kind of went through as well the project Updates this is where the the project check-ins will sort of be pushed too um so you'll be prompted like hey you know share this and so this is kind of where it gets shared on on Discord as well um and yeah and there's uh so there was a few things I know because uh this is super hot because super hacks is sort of you know a theme theme hackathon that we have so there are a few um YouTube videos and links that I'm going to share in the Discord later but uh you just like uh Carl he's one of the speakers so like he he's given a talk on the modular LP stack at optimism Summit um he also you spoke at Defcon last October on the op stack and then uh Kelvin who's a half cents Workshop tomorrow he you know launched you on roll up with Erp stack in 30 minutes so there's definitely a lot of resources if you're unsure of like what maybe op stack is or how would you build on top of it or anything um you know I will send these send these resources over and I'm sure like they these I mean if you go to the partners Pages they'll have their own links as well um so if you're stuck you're unsure maybe that or project ideas definitely look at the um at the the partners the the prizes page because that's where a lot of their you can find a lot of resources and help with the mainnet or the stock or anything um and these are just like links that I I came across these videos and I saw them kind of preparing uh for this event um and they're the really good resources so definitely you know if you haven't already like Jing Wang uh she'll be uh I think she's a judge as well but I mean you know she's uh this is really a great interview that she she gave a couple weeks ago for a crypto startup school at uh a16 Zed um so yeah um so yeah those are basically the one thing um this uh we have this uh slide like I guess because super hack Stark got started a bit later this was another way for folks to to kind of find teams and um maybe like a more fun way so it's not nobody's really used it yet so I don't know many people who don't really need it or not um but uh normally people will fill out the little bios on this and I'll send it in the in the Discord again but um uh yeah it's just another way to kind of a more uh uh more friendlier way to uh to to show this show this information because right now in the in the in the projects um sorry in the the excuse me in the team we can't really you can't really see exactly the um kind of it just it's just like Words pretty much so uh I guess one thing to really mention about this and for future hackathons is that eventually this information will sort of be linked to people's profiles so you'll be able to see you know what what their role is skills past hackathons that they've done uh maybe past prizes that they've won so it'll be kind of a bit not not completely like a social platform but it'd be uh I think an easier way for for hackers to sort of find find uh team members information and bio so instead of having to you know to post this information on Discord like post your your all this stuff it'll just you can click on somebody's profile within the hacker dashboard and it'll be there so you don't have to worry about doing this you're just gonna have to sit through and find those people but um that's kind of the point that's where we're getting towards So eventually we won't have these these uh slides anymore either uh there was a question can you share the YouTube links here in the chat please yeah I can do that see I'll share them in the in the chat and then also I will share them um in Discord as well let me um let me just copy them all here oops are there any other questions feel free to take yourself off mute if you want so the presentation video so I'm kind of looking forward to actually making one like to planning my uh presentation video so um is this supposed to be some y combinator pitch thing where you kind of sit in front of the camera and then try to summarize your application or can it like can we like be creative with it and just try to show off our product as best as possible yeah yeah so yeah yeah it's uh you're basically showing off your your your project your product um I think the like it's it's like a proper demo so you don't have to really be in in the um in the video at all um I would say like I mean the judges are basically looking for you know that the really I think just what is your project doing what or product what's it solving and how does it work does it work um so the focus really should be like on on the product the project itself um some people have like slides that'll maybe kind of talk about the background like the history like why we're doing this or the benefits of it and then go into the demo so and some people just do a straight out demo so like maybe they're you know the face will be in the lower the left hand corner of it um you could have your face showing you don't have to have your face showing but uh you know it's it's uh I think the judges are really looking at you see like you know does does does this does this project project product work um and you know what's what's the what's the main purpose of it what's the functionality do does it does it have like real use of value and you know in the real world or for consumers or businesses um that's I think that's kind of the the main key thing so I wouldn't don't try and don't get like don't overflow with so much like distractions or or you know Glitz and glamor you know I think just the meat of it you know showcasing your your demo the product is is all that really matters um and uh yeah and also I'll uh I'll find the like the Twitter threads of past finalists so yeah if I go to here so yeah I just sent a link in the chat like the twitter.com forward slash globeeth Global for slash highlights these are all the past finalists from from our events so you've got a mix of online in real life and then if you go to the Showcase page you'd be able to search search them up by you know buy the event so if actually if I go to hack fs and let's see hack FS uh I'm trying to think about like a wallet OTP so they are these wallet OTP one time password they were a packet Fest finalist and so like this is you can see like their their video example right here um just just you know press play and just kind of give it a watch give it a go uh but basically this is what this is what their their demo their video was that they played for the judges um so yeah if you're if you're unsure like I would definitely like take just take a look at past finalists from events kind of see what their videos look like what their projects look like maybe and uh kind of kind of give you a really good feel for for you know what what the quality of of folks uh products and demos and presentations is is all about uh and again yeah sorry that it's right now it's not a good filter on the Showcase page that's something we're working on um but uh but the uh the the Twitter link the highlights definitely that that is a great great way to sort of find uh past the past finalist winners um and again so I get I guess not if you're completely new just there's no no pressure like you shouldn't um you know be striving to I guess when all the prizes and the money and the finalists like that's certainly great as well but uh really it's you know should be as long as you're challenging yourself I think in learning and growing because we want people to keep coming back we want people people to keep building um and some people we want I mean some people take on their products to keep working on them after the hackathon stone so we definitely want to see that as well we encourage that so um again something that we're continuing to work on is how do we provide support uh and tools and resources for hackers post the event once the event's finished so um that's that's something that we're currently working on and fleshing out and building out and uh but yeah because obviously you know our Advanced currently a couple of times a year so there's so many days in the year that that we don't necessarily get to interact with you all that much so um it's something that that we want to make sure that if we create a nice nice environment for everybody and that you know you feel that you can you can try out new things test things and you know people will fail that's totally fine everybody fails um and then as long as you learn from the failures and keep growing and growing from that that's all that matters um but yeah cool that's basically like all the prepared like remarks I had um does anybody have any like other questions or anything like feel free to ask anything um no such thing as a dumb question and if not like I'm so I'm on the Discord uh posting a lot um you know I'm uh I'm sure I posted somewhere recently but well either way it's like I'm yeah here I am like Rory so this is I mean this is me you'll see me posting uh every now and then and um where can we find the finalists prices yeah so um actually that's a good question uh so for for anybody that that um yeah let me let me do this so if you actually if you go to YouTube and just do like youth Global hack Fest closing so every and just an FY everything all of the workshops open and close ceremonies that they will be posted on our on our youth Global uh YouTube page so if you're maybe you can't make something and you're just really bummed like it'll be eventually it'll be posted on YouTube so do not don't worry about that but if you go through here closing ceremonies um and then you'll you'll see you'll get an idea for for what what's going on in in the during the closing ceremony so we have you know uh Mohit from weapery stash is going through his demo he's he's over here um and then you know the next team so this is what happens and then towards the end of it you'll see you'll see card tick well this is Juana Benet talking about he had a guest appearance but you'll see Karthik will talk about uh the finalist prizes so uh yeah if you go to past events you'll see the the very end of our closing ceremonies content goes over exactly what what the the finalist prizes are um so sometimes it changes but um more or less it's going to be around around the same um but uh it's like free practice 2023 obviously pragmas our conference event for their in real life events so it's uh it happens the day before the actual hackathon so we only have New York and Istanbul coming up this year so there's two opportunities to potentially attend um pragma for free um so that's so the rich that's the you'll be able to find that uh here and I can I'll send the uh the link in the chat that's for the hack FS uh uh how does the mentor sessions were so the um Mentor sessions I I think uh Tom are you talking about like the the team formation sessions or the project feedback sessions um I think uh so the question was not not sure how to cover but how does the mentor sessions work yeah feedback session okay yeah so they'll be it depends on on the on the partners they um they'll they'll receive a list of all the all the projects that have that are applying for their prizes and so some of them on Discord they might have they might talk about office hours or um they'll reach out individually so it depends partner to partner we don't have a really uniform way of how this happens and I think it's just because you know some Partners prefer to do it one way and some Partners prefer to do it another way so but they um they'll get uh they'll get your your information basically and um and just reach it reach out reach out that way so it it it'll depend on partner to partner but what we're we're trying to we're doing uh getting to the point we're trying to make sure that Partners do address any blockers especially that you may be facing whether it's you know I stuck on something within one of the resource documents or or maybe don't have enough to polio test or something I I don't know it could be anything really but um it's uh it'll we'll find a way to make sure that whatever you're blocked on that you do get that you get do get the support and help that you need for your project and so yeah D to answer your question to top ten percent in person yes so yeah if I go back to here so the the other top ten uh finalists will will be presenting uh alive so the difference between when you're doing the judging uh the last like the live judging you're we're playing the video for you and then if you're a substance a finalist on that Friday during the closing ceremony you'll be presenting uh live basically so you're not you're not playing a video you're you're actually doing you're walking through your your demo you're walking through your slides um or or whatever whatever it is so like uh Steph uh orpelia from wallet OTP you know she's physically walking through her her demo live um during the close-up ceremony so this is what the top 10 finalists will be doing but yeah I would suggest like if you haven't seen one of these events if this is your first event then definitely you know take a look at the the last online event um and uh just kind of get a get a better feel for it it's like see what people have done um see what maybe the expectations are um and again like I say expectations but really it's you know um there's certainly like you're not trying to I wouldn't say like this is the end I'll be all trying to aim for like a top 10 finalists uh again I can't stress this enough as long as you're you know you're really you're pushing yourself you're learning you're growing then that's that's really what what matters and we want definitely want to make sure that's just overall great experience and that you continue coming back and you continue hacking um because some people they've you know I don't uh some people maybe this is like their 10th uh uh ethical hackathon and they've never been a finalist or never won a prize until that that number 11th uh hackathon so it definitely it it might take some time if that's what you're going for so it's just it really depends on you know what what project you're working on uh who maybe who the judges are as well um so um I you know definitely don't don't feel discouraged if you don't get something or you don't win something because it's uh you know everything's subjective and some people that don't initially win anything end up ah later on going on to do great things so it really uh it's it's you know it's it's again it's subjective but yeah any uh any other questions okay and if not yeah uh I will be on on Discord and uh if people have you know um if if you're stuck maybe you haven't found a team yet or you haven't found somebody to join your teams let me know uh we'll see if we can find somebody to to join your teams um ideally uh my goal is that you know everybody whether they wanted a hack Solo or where they want to be a part of the team that that happens so I'll do I'll do my best to make sure that that you find a team or that you find somebody that to join your team or that you're you're happy hacking solo so um yeah if you have any questions about that please don't hesitate to reach out to me and um we will do what we can to to make sure that that does happen so um awesome well yeah if there are no other questions thank you all for attending uh this will be uh posted later uh on YouTube too so if you know somebody that couldn't make it that missed it that would benefit from this then we will then you know we'll share it I'll share the link with you all and you can share with them um so that they can also kind of participate and enjoy enjoy the uh enjoy it as well so cheers thank y'all happy hacking and uh look forward to seeing what projects you come up with in the next couple of weeks thank you bye
