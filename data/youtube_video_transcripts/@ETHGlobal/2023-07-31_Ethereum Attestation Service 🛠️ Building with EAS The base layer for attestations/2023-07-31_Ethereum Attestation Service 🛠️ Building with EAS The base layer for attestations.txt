foreign [Music] part of the core team of ethereum attestation service so my role is around really around like product development product design I do some of the front end Dev stuff and then we also have Steve here let's see do this intro yeah I'm just a CTO well stacked up for EA and so today what we're going to go through is we're going to spend the first like couple minutes just explaining why we built EAS and then the uh we'll go through some examples that have been built and then we'll really spend a lot actually making some schemas together so you get a better idea of how to start using EAS for the sackathon we'll also give you some inspiration of some ideas I could be hacked with and go from there we want this to be interactive and I know we probably won't cover all the questions that you have so we will have be at our booth to help interact with you throughout the rest of uh this weekend so how many of you know what access stations are to start nice good it's a newer primitive that is catching a lot of like the narrative today and so we're excited to introduce a little bit more about how we see them so attestations are simply just a digital signature of some structured data and that might seem pretty abstract right like okay about what right so we're gonna go go into that uh what we're noticing in the uh ecosystem is that there was a lot of identity protocols being built and while EAS isn't distinctly an identity protocol what we're recognizing is that there's a lot of projects that we're trying to solve digital identity because it can unlock so many new and Powerful use cases and so we're thinking well with all this fragmentation as devs we have to learn all these new protocols right just to try to come up with a more comprehensive view of what an identity is so each of these entities are creating their own type of attestations but none of them are really communicating with each other and so we're thinking well what actually is identity what was your first identity and so we went through that kind of first principles approach and we're thinking well when you're born you didn't have an identity and then you did so what happened it's when your mom named you right she said this is my child Bryce and then throughout life other entities started testing about different aspects of who you are the doctor could have attested to your date of birth the identity your identity card could have been attested to by the government you go to school and the teacher attests to your grades your employer attests to your job and your skills into and you start also attesting to other entities you attest to the friends that you like the food that you like so you're not only receiving but you're also issuing access stations and so we realized you can actually represent identity as an aggregate of attestations about someone over time or an entity over time and so if you actually want to solve for digital identity it's really difficult to start with just a service or a protocol that just focuses on that we first have to start as a base layer where any entity can make attestations about anything this could be identity related or it could be much more so that's what we built we built an open source infrastructure public good for making access stations on chain or off chain so it's completely open source we have an SDK and a bunch of Dev tools to make the process really easy we realize that if you want to solve for like Trust online and use using these digital signatures for things like Identity or like verifications of any type it's extremely important that it wasn't monetized at the infrastructure there because then one person would have some advantage or try to game the ecosystem where someone eventually would just Fork the protocol and then just take it to zero so we built it as a public good so it's funded through grants and uh the the whole idea is to make money on top of the protocol not from within so yes it's completely open source free to use it runs on two simple smart contracts and we'll get into some examples here but just understand it at a high level there's a schema registry contract which allows you to register any structured data about any topic so that structured data Could Be Imagined we're at this hackathon right and you wanted to attest to the hackathon location you might think like okay well what type of data would be important maybe it's the hackathon name maybe it's the hackathon start time so you might use like start time unit 64. so you start to create the structure of the data and then the second contract allows you to make attestations on that we also allow you to set an optional resolver so if an attestation is made on a particular schema type you can make it mint in nft or do any sort of smart contract functionality based off of the attestation being being made with that schema the traction's been pretty great so optimism they're building their attestation station that you might have heard of in the market they actually deprecated their v0 contracts and upgraded to the EAS standard so we're part of like the native uh core contracts there and then so so with that we're deployed on base any of the op stack chains will have EAS and we're excited to continue to unite the ecosystem towards a unified attestation layer so attestations that go beyond identity that can be used anywhere trust or verification are needed and I'm going to be showing you some examples on our EAS scan Explorer it's kind of like the EAS scan for for attestations uh sorry The Ether scan uh for uh at the stations so this is if we think about attestations a social network is simply just a network of attestations right so when you post something on Twitter that's just an attestation of you making a statement if someone likes that post that's also just a like of your post right there are testing that they like that piece of content if they follow reply repost update all these interactions are just one entity saying something about some other subject or or event and so we've built this sample UI it's called speaketh and you can see that there's some posting is this is the screen size skin yeah go a little bit more you can see that there's these posts being made here's one from Tim he attested GM and then there's a reply there's one reply and a like so if we inspect this attestation underneath the hood this is all running on at the stations so if we click on the attestation record it brings us to the EAS scan which is like etherscan and we can see that Tim attested GM at this time and then each attestation record has its own unique identifier and that can be used to reference things so if we scroll down there were two other entities that reference this uid that they liked it and that there was a post so if we click on the like it goes to a different attestation record and it shows this percent of testing like true and then referencing that previous attestation uid so you can start to build very composable networks of statements people are making you can do that all off chain two one other use cases around content authenticity so imagine with all this AI generated content that's being produced produced how do we actually know what's being made by the Creator is real so if you've seen these Tick Tock videos with Tom Cruise he's like running around smiling dude doing his Tom Cruise thing but it looks just like him and I'm pretty Technical and I was pretty convinced so imagine our non-technical friends and family in the next year or two it's going to be extremely scary on how people can actually trust the information that they're viewing online and one way to do that is through a digital signature right attesting to the authenticity of content being produced so we actually built a way for you to Hash any piece of content and then attest to it but this is just an idea of if you're exploring some projects for the sackathon thinking about like attesting to the authenticity of of information and building graphs around that is a is a unique idea this is an attestation record of fake Tom Cruise I actually just like changed it in the UI so this isn't his address but it's Tom cruise.it the testing to a hash of his content and then people can verify that content against the hash independently this could all be done through a really pretty UI but the idea is that having a digital signature from an uh an authority like a Tom Cruise saying this is my content yeah uh if you see us by the booth we're showcasing this is a open source app that's all a part of our repo that you can access you can Fork it for this hackathon if you'd like it'll show you how the SDK Works in pretty good detail but allows you to attest to people that you meet and not in real life it's called met irl.org and if you want we'll be down at the booth but you can scan this and it'll take you to met IRL with my ens on there and you you'll need to make a digital signature with that so you just attest hey I met Bryce allen.eath and then I make a two-way attestation confirming that so on that attestation record what you'll see is this is actually an off chain at the station that was made public there's a uid and then a couple time stamps here and so one thing with off chain at the stations is that they don't have a verifiable timestamp because there's no consensus from the network that says this existed and so what we've done is we we took the uid right and we just time stamped that on chain so you can make you can basically time stamp an off-chain attestation on chain giving it proof of existence that it was seen so it gives it more uh more a more trustworthy uh historical record of it so here's Dak attesting to me that we met IRL true and then I re-attest it to him and I can show you that in a second and then from this type of data you can start to build these pretty cool like social graphs this was actually one built by Kelvin from the optimism team it's called coolgraph.youth catalog I'll actually load it here but this was people are just attesting this is kind of a Mimi one right adjusting to cool people so they're walking around just attesting to people and then other people at the event were testing attesting to each other as well you can start to see this like pretty cool interactive graph of these nodes so we're attesting cool to these other entities these other ens addresses and then you'll see like this one node over here is receiving a lot of attestations I'm not sure if you can see it through the color but this one is receiving a bunch of attestations coming in but no attestations are going out and so oh it's actually this one this one has more um but that's vitalik's address right he's receiving cool person at the stations but not issuing any so you can start to see that there's all these like notes that kind of hang out outside of the network which if you think about aggregating attestations for like silver resistance you can start to see these nodes that kind of hang out alone right so someone issued like a thousand new addresses and they're just attesting to each other if they're not actually a part of like the trusted Network graph then you can start to weight them however you'd like so this was uh the the actual access station record it was Kelvin attesting to vitalik true on chain with the uid and then the schema that was used was called cool person private data is extremely important especially if you're working on identity related things it's really important to think through like what actually needs to be on chain or not on chain so we built a way to attest to a basically a Merkle root hash on chain and then you can selectively disclose data against that Merkle root that could be more privacy preserving things so this is kind of an alternative to Legacy K proof but it's just allowing you to attest to one entity of testing to like let's say it's a document verifier for your driver's license right they could hash all the different fields on your driver's license attest to the Merkle root and then give you that data and then you could give people leaps of that data to selectively uh validate against the miracle root after so it kind of looks like this here's the Merkle root hash you get approve you verify against it I can show you how this works um downstairs too so there's a lot of use cases that can be built we have a use case sheet at our booth if you're looking for some inspiration but uh attestations are not an identity protocol you can do way more than that within because it unlocks a very composable and interoperable network so you can build Registries can anytime you need to prove compliance in a process notaries proof of anything like proof of attendance or proof of solvency things like that anytime an entity needs to make use the digital signature to build some sort of trust in in an interaction is when attestations are are valuable so here's some ideas that you could hack we're not judging against these but just to give some inspiration hopefully you can think hey if I could do this perhaps I could also do something else so social graphs knowledge graphs Dynamic nfts based on attestation data and silver resistance zero knowledge attestations generating an attestation based off of so generating an attestation and generating a proof off of that attestation would be really cool the testing to rolls kind of get the idea there so I can uh one other thing are these private attestations I'm going to make one really quick so uh first to start if you want to make a schema you can interact with the SDK pretty easily but if you want to do a no code way if you go to the EAS scan on the chain of your choice then you can use this no code Builder so you could say like you know event name and maybe this is just a string you can choose the ABI in the field type that you want and so I'm going to make just this one make a statement and it's just going to be a recipient is to no one but I'm just saying nice chatting with you all and one core thing with an attestation is you can also apply an expiration time so if you want them to automatically revoke that's possible and so I'm going to make this off chain which is just a 712 type signature so I just signed it and it's completely encoded in the URI fragment of the URL and oops and you can store them wherever you want locally you can store them in a centralized Place pass them portably but EAS doesn't even know that this existed but there's a lot of really cool things you can do with private off-chain access stations as well so we have a few minutes left but uh any would love to hear kind of your reactions and feedback questions go for it no don't answer yeah because I've been talking a while so in the case of a university like uh getting an attestation from like a reputable uh entity you would actually want that at decision from the University or from someone that's capable of verifying a University degree so the the value of the attestation is based on who actually attests so like if I attest that like you know Bryce has paced past kyc like it might not mean much to most people but if coinbase does then it then it would so yeah so uh you could create a schema structure for like the diploma or types of whatever information is important and then you just the digital signature would be made by a trusted Authority on that that data type so the schema matters less the the person who's signing the data is what gives the attestation value unless there's a resolver or a hook on on the schema another question uh in the case of off-chain attestations does the chain ID really matter no right so I mean uh technically you can as far as as far as bringing off chain out to stations on chain then yeah you can actually read any eip712 signature and just care about whatever chaining ID you want or not yeah so the Met IRL app that we showed you for a test and that people met is a off-chain attestation on mainnet so zero gas but I'm the contracts are a minute but we are also on-train an object yes the on-chain attestation data is public correct so if you're if you're focusing on things like identity and stuff then you should think either to use private data attestations right or go completely off chain just make sure you're not putting like actual private data on chain so if you you might want to put private data off chain and pass the option at the station to some entity where they can share it on like a need to know basis but in general if you're going to put something on chain then you maybe want to plug like some sort of like uh hash that as some sort of salt with it so no one can break it so you wouldn't want to actually put any private data on chain that's not what we want to do at all we want to add people from doing that no private information yes yeah so we actually do have a tool on the Explorer is um so you can verify off chain out to stations using our SDK or you can drop any as a station file like directly into our UI and it'll verify using the SDK yeah so if we if we download well so this raw data that you can see here you can just have that and then drop it into the verify off chain attestation then we'll see if it verified or not or just use the SDK any other questions on off chain or on chain in the back uh can you can you say that a little bit louder he said how do we compare it to verifiable credential okay so verifiable credentials typically follow the w3c standard okay and there's uh typically so the w3s w3c standard was built not related to blockchain technology so it has a lot of data right so a lot of off-chain protocols today like disco and others will use verifiable credentials and I think it that has a lot of value towards like web 2 interactions and stuff but w3c standards um can also be you can also create like dispute records and things with attestations in different different ways yeah so uh the difference is that verifiable credentials were made before blockchain and they have like a ton of data that you wouldn't want to actually put on chain and also there's no such thing as a schema registry for verifiable credentials so when people are using verifiable credentials to attest about things there is they've never really thought of any kind of schema registry where any entity can register a topic and then that topic has its own unique identifier and so we think that this is is much better for being able to decentralize all these kind of like interactions another advantage to think about is also the composability so if you were to make an attestation or like not exactly as a w3c verifiable credential but if one access station is made and you want to be composable with things outside of identity maybe it's like authenticity of content signatures and things like that then it allows you to do that in a much easier and faster way thumbs up from the front so he's a testing time is up but if you have questions related to this we'd love to show you the kind of how the Merkel tree approach works but there's a lot of cool things that you can build really excited to see um just the progress from the previous hackathons a lot of cool things can be built using AIS as an alternative to nfts and and things like that so if you're thinking about nfts for verification think maybe an attestation could be used since it [Applause] thank you
