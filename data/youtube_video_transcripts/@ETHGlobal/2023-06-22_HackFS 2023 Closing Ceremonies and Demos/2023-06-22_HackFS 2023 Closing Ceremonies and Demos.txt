[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of eth global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to hack FS 2023 this is the fourth time we're running this event and it's so incredible to kind of see the fourth iteration here after four years of doing this and I want to thank everybody who's watching this and tuning in on eveglobal.tv this is what we'll be using for all of today which means you get to interact with all of us and our our teams and speakers to uh can I ask them any questions or any follow-ups and for us to also address any questions that you have so let's get started so this hackathon is brought to you by Eve Global in partnership with protocol labs and our goal at it Global is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and Summits and these are both online and in person hackfest is one of our online events for this event we also did an online Summit that talked about all the things that are happening in the protocol Network protocol Labs network uh everything from how they're thinking about consensus to compute to storage and all the things that you can look forward to in the next coming months two years and that took place on Friday June of June the second all the videos of the talks and panels are up now for you to watch and catch up on you can head over to the youth Global YouTube channel to see all those amazing speakers but the next hour and a half is about the hackathon this was an amazing and massive event for us we had 800 almost 840 Hackers from 76 different countries participate and they came in from 23 different time zones we kind of put a map of where people were coming in from all the cities and it's still amazing to see constant representation from six different continents so welcome to all of you and thank you for tuning in for some of you uh super late at night and super early for a lot of you on top of just the hackers we also had 29 ecosystem partners and 12 mentors who are there to help you succeed with your projects and also giving a lot of help and advice and they were also giving in 150 000 in prizes so today we'll also cover who won what prizes so stay tuned until the end of this to learn about who the winners are I also want to quickly thank all of those amazing Partners who made sure the last three weeks were incredible for all 840 of you um and without further Ado you want to thank give a big shout out to falcoin ifcoin LIT P2P bakli out ceramic Lighthouse tableland poly base live Pier huddle 01 Barracks push protocol ens nft dot storage sphere on lit protocol dran dataverse OS Vision Mona and chainsafe ipfs altcoin data tools consensus lab Saturn secured Finance graph paper Capital online Ventures and Falcon foundations most of them are giving amazing prizes so we'll be learning about who won what prizes and and what they built so let's go back to why we are here in this finale call 838 hackers spent the last three weeks working on incredible projects and together they made 200 projects that came out of this event 200 projects were submitted this past Sunday just three days ago and we spent the last three days going through all the projects going through judging looking at every single one of them getting feedback from judges doing live calls with the teams to get feedback and get any questions clarified and get any answers for anything that went into building those amazing projects and through that whole judging process we are here with nine finalist teams so I want to congratulate first those teams and what today is going to be about is we're going to bring these nine teams on and they're going to show a live demo of what they built and what their project does and how they built it and why so I want to quickly congratulate these nine teams we have wallet OTP hardside Hangouts decentral AI shitty chat Cosmic waves sub prober daggle D5 kicks and web3 stash these are our nine teams that are going to come on one by one and demo what they built today for all of you who look and after that we'll kind of we're going to cover all the prizes and everything else that we want to talk about before we wrap up hack FS 2023 so before we go into the very first time I want to take a quick second to thank 191 teams listed here for all the amazing work that they've done just because you were not one of these nine finalists does not mean there was something wrong with your project or you were not good enough the goal for the final list is for us to highlight some projects that our judges and the rest of the ecosystem is excited about as upcoming themes or just super creative ideas a lot of you here are going to be winning and have won a lot of prizes which you'll be learning about very soon and we want to make sure that you also use this as an opportunity to learn and get more feedback on your project this is by no means a way for you to be discouraged we really want you to succeed we really want you to be working on your projects after this event ends today and we want to be there to help you get any help you need whether it's being connected to any of our partners or getting more feedback from a judge right after this event ended or any other person that's within our Network or the protocol Labs Network that you would like to be in touch with to take your project to the next stage we want to be there and want to help you make that happen so please do take the time to Ping us and get any feedback in or ask us for anything that we can do for you and we really hope that a lot of you get to continue working on the projects after this event ends so with that let's Jump Right In to our very first demo for today and that is Project wallet OTP so without further Ado I'd like to bring on our first team and Steph welcome and uh looking forward to seeing what you built awesome thanks kartik hey hack FS I'm Steph rapilia and I'm a web3 Dev who likes building products that are useful today I'm presenting wallet OTP which is a decentralized wallet encrypted two-factor authentication app that provides one-time passwords for all of your services across web 2 and web3 first of all let's start with a little bit of context what's 2fa that stands for two-factor authentication and it's the idea that you want to have two ways to log in so the first way is usually your password and then the second way can be an OTP or a one-time password sent to one of your devices and that makes it harder for hackers to hack in or get access to your account making it more secure current OTP Solutions include twilio's authi app Google Authenticator and Duo by Cisco there are other apps that exist and can hold those 2fa secret keys that log you into accounts but I noticed some problems uh mainly centralization so these apps have centralized storage and also centralized encryption mechanisms so those lead to a variety of issues first of all data available availability issues if the storage goes down and also you don't have data sovereignty because some other app is doing the decryption of your secrets and then worst of all there's a ux issue at this these apps limit you to just one device at a time so if you lose your phone or you can't log in for any reason you lose access to all of your Social accounts which is the worst so these are two memes I made basically I think that otps or authenticator apps should first of all have better ux so you should be able to access them from any device and I also wanted to get rid of the centralization problem so that you own the encryption mechanism so this is really for anyone who cares about data sovereignty and also security and uses a ton of devices like I do so this is 2fa reimagined with decentralized storage encryption and OTP generation on any device I'll walk you through the demo demo in a moment but this is kind of like the tech behind it basically you can open the app on any device even your phone uh you sign in with wallet connect and then lit protocol decrypts all of your secrets that have been stored in polybase and then you can encrypt more secrets if you want to or you can just read your one-time passwords that are generated every 30 seconds so this is kind of what the UI looks like but next we'll get straight into the demo if you want to check it out yourself feel free to scan this QR code but I'm going to walk through a demo where I actually add a authenticator app so I'm going to add 2fa to my real email Google account so let me add an authenticator and the authenticator app will be wallet OTP which is my app so I'm just signing in with my password and I'll set up an authenticator so I need to set this up by scanning a QR code and I'll do that from my phone so you can see my phone on the right side I'm just opening metamask metamask actually has a browser and my app is within the browser it's also a website but this is well at OTP this is what the DAP looks like I'm just going to sign in with my wallet so connecting with metamask come on Wi-Fi okay here we are you see I already added a b reel 2face secret um you can see the actual secret if you click in or you can see all of the encrypted data but I'm actually going to add another 2fa secret you can either scan this code or enter it manually but I'm going to scan it asks to use my camera so that was just all auto generated from that scan it grabbed the service which is Google the account which is my email and the 2fa secret from the service so I'm just going to encrypt and save this data lit is doing the encryption behind the scenes oh did I I don't know if I uh actually push that button user error okay encrypting and saving and here we go okay it's asking me to sign the message to encrypt and save this data you can see what's been encrypted and it's super fast which is awesome you can see I already have that OTP on the side so I actually need to validate that this is working so I've already scanned I'm just going to hit next and I'll enter the code we just got a new code 340-550 from the service verifying that and my authenticator app has been set up just to show that this actually works I'm going to open a new private browser and I'm going to sign into my account um in a way that will make me prove my 2fa Factor so I'll go to the Google account this was my account I need to enter my password and then the last thing I need to do is send myself a code from the authenticator app so it's asking for my new code let me just open the app one more time and we'll get my new code 956-027 and there we go I'm into my account so wallet OTP successfully got me back in so just to give a bit of a recap of that demo I'm storing three different factors service account and Secret in decentralized storage and it's encrypted ahead of time by lit and then once it's stored in polybase the database is public but all of the information has already been encrypted so the only person who can decrypt it is the person whose account it is in this case mine and I used wallet OTP to actually get that one-time password the way I'm doing that is with a totp or time-based OTP algorithm basically it's hashing my secret which was added in that modal and then also hashing that with the current time so that every 30 seconds that password changes that's OTP while at OTP I would love to hear what you think scan this QR code and tweet me some feedback thank you so much I had so much fun hacking at hack Fest thanks to the judges and the youth Global team thank you so much Steph this was awesome and thanks for going uh first to be our first amazing demo uh this is really cool hopefully all of us get to uh to use it soon and uh good luck in making this even better thanks kartik all right take care so that was our first of nine I want to get ready for our next teams and what I want to do next is bring on Beaker number two that is Ting Chao from decentral AI yes we can of course awesome so let's introduce our fantastic team of decentralized our talent team is scattered across the United States and Asia Ethan still having full stacks and working there crazy UI U apps show content thank you again and I focus on a lot and machine learning our mission is decentralized is to harness the power of decentralization with just passing challenges in the AI industry according to MIT by 2026 we're going to run out of high quality demonstrator Berkeley researchers emphasizes the need of human engagement to improve AR Motors but the way big firms make impedance of dollars scoop out our data without asking and without sharing of energy it's discovering just all don't contribute AI means people's conclusion but we are left out and not getting Fair shares this visual cycle first ai's potential decentralized is the answer if you do this web 3 to allow Community ownership of AI applications to adults wear data sets and a apps are built together and govern collections is centralized not only offers state or Data Solutions to efficiency but also ensures that all the financial plans are shared ways encouraging very valuable contributions and the best part no coding negative now let's dive into a demo you can visit distance us and login use your wallet then you should be able to explore all the dials and apps being created by all the by other members and then let's also create a new down for Fire co-in virtual machine co-pilot to empower file invoice machine education through collaboration and AI and the dial creation can involve token creation so that we can Define all the reward distribution to members up front after reviewing all the details then you can click deploy to make sure that that your reward is guaranteed by smart contracts and then so that we make sure that people can collaborate trustlessly using blockchain technology once your dial has been created now people can join your dial by taking on various flows such as data contributor add your own data data Wizards process and killing the data storage provider instructor several hosts Etc once you click join then we will mince nmt to recognize your membership see this is a way like we can involve people from different backgrounds with different skills to contribute and work together and next let's add the data sets this is where really the crowdsourcing shines see this slides where we can allow people to contribute knowledge just like Wikipedia style and with decentralized people can upload data from web 2 or web 3 storage providers such as ipfs and ceramic let's just add an FM tutorial uh and then the tutorial will be encrypted using mid protocol by signing the transaction so that we can provide an extra layer of security and permission so that owning controlled wallet can access your uploaded data and then we will trigger a buckler job to pre-process the data put them into different chunks and then convert them into more embeddings so that it can be pre-processed and consumed by AI models once you're embedded is done you will receive a notification from push saying that the job is done now you can check your documents and then next we can create a AI app so we've integrated with um beefy a fantastic open source uh large language model Ops dashboard to allow anyone to manage their uh AI Bots and here people can configure pumps variables contacts or without coding now let's just add the FM tutorial to the chatbot so the chatbot can have the FM knowledge to help any users then we just click publish and now your Bot is live on cferon and then let's test it out to to chat you simply just connect to your wallet and then now let's add the chatbot.fm question how to send a data yield to the down in fam so very excuse the question and then you see like our leader protocol will check my wallet has the right access to your earbuds and then in a few seconds we see that response has been generated by child gbt with the knowledge has been crowd sourced by essential and it is quite powerful but it doesn't just stop there you can also um uh check how to create an API key so that other people can also build on top of your aiap and the API key creation is also securely suited and authorized from there because once your model is deployed it is foreign library to make sure that the ranking and the Voting is done anonymously using CTP underlying Magic so if Enterprise is built on top of a five image machine data can be moved in and out uh that allows manages data processing to ensure that you can mentioned for low code calculations models are deployed and reposit them information the access to access these sales coming back to about directly decentralized build AI together please check out our website application amazing thank you so much for for that awesome demo and uh it's good to hear that you kind of were able to add all these features to this project and really make it super powerful so hopefully you also get to continue working on this and uh thanks again thank you all right take care all right on to our third demo for today I want to bring on team Cosmic waves to show you what Amazing Project that they built together so welcome everybody and feel free to get started hello thank you so I'm here to present you Cosmic waves but first of all who are we well we are a team that works together here in Portugal I'm a product manager Philip unfortunately unfortunately couldn't make it but she did everything that she'll see uh here look awesome and then we have our developers that we've drawn and paired with that built and made all our songs possible so we work together as I said and we faced a problem as in we wanted to experience music together uh remotely but we couldn't find a solution that would simulate the experience of doing it in a room or and listening to the music at the same time either everyone was listening to this to the song out of sync or there were a lot of blocked apis and even if you are a content creator that's the question of uploading your your content to to a storage or to uh to a server that you don't own so that is the problem that we had and then we built a solution which is causing place a decentralized peer-to-peer free broadcasting station that allows content creators to share their music and their songs to anyone anywhere in the world so a little bit about the architecture basically leapy to peer coordinates the storage and stores the files in ipfs while polybase is storing the metadata of those files but this is all happening in the background what does actually happen for for the user so as a streamer I would go to the cosmic quiz website connect my wallet because anonymity is important so now that my streamer wallet is connected I can access the stream web page after verification and on this web page I can see the places spoilers already created and I can add new song files to it for example the office theme or even our own opening theme these files are being uploaded to ipfs as you can see I have to sign these these requests and once the files are uploaded I'll be able to add them to to my playlist as you can see so once the files are on the playlist me as a streamer the only thing that I have to do is to start my stream and once I do uh what I put what I have the songs I have on this amazing playlist will start being streamed on on Cosmic waves so I'll start the stream I'll do I do have to to stop the screen sharing so you'll be able to to hear the audio so just give me a second cool now you are seeing Cosmic waves as anyone in the world you're not a streamer you just heard of cosmic quotes it's just sir that's a popular content creator is there showing their music so you just you'll just have to go to the website no signing required and just tune in and once you are tuned in you are broadcasting you can start listening to music at the same time as everyone else in the world is listening so this is the problem that we have this is a solution that we brought to allow everyone to enjoy this magnificent magnificent piece of art together and to simulate the experience of actually showing around and listening to music so this is cosme coins and thank you for listening oh that was uh such an incredible amazing demo it's really good to see a decentralized radio player it's I'm surprised that we haven't seen this happen yet and uh finally we kind of have a way to make this work everywhere this is incredible congratulations and hopefully all of us get to uh watch a live stream here very soon all right cheers thank you everyone thanks everybody so next up is our demo number four and that is project daggle so without further Ado I'd like to bring on our next team Leo to talk about daggle welcome to get started Leo okay hey guys uh so I'm Leo from team daggle and this is my submission for the hacker first 2023 hackathon and like before starting with the demo let me explain you guys what uh really Douglas and what it does and the Technologies behind daggle so daggle is basically on platform to offload your extensive workloads to backlog baklav is an open decentralized network of nodes which take in Docker images and webassembly codes and it executes it for you so like this is this can be a cost effective alternative to AWS Lambda and Google collab so yeah this is like this is an overview of what really taggle does now let's get into demo so uh like first let's go to the marketplace in the marketplace like we have something called as actions so basically these are actions uh what really action is that uh it's like prepaid Docker images and quotes which we have written it for you guys so with just a matter of clicks you can upload your actions to backlog and for this demo like I'll be showing you guys two actions which is a remove background and node.jscript first like let me go with a remote background so what uh remove background basically does is that it will take an image as an input like for this demo like I'll be taking this image where you can find a family with a good background and like let me remove this background for you guys let's open that image and let's submit this image to the backload to remove the background yeah let's wait for it so yeah it is done and like before seeing the result for that let me also submit a node.jscript here you can find a sample script but you can replace it with your own script instead so here let me change hello world from hello world to uh hello from hacker first final something like that so let me create a job for you so yeah let's wait for it to submit so yeah it is done so you can see all those jobs here a script notice and the remove PG like these two are the jobs which are submitted now before checking the research like I would like you to uh like I would love to show you guys around my platform about the features which we offer we have something called as data sets and models here uh like you can use these data sets to create the models uh like using an action which we have which is called as train model action in the background it uses tensorflow as an uh code like you have to paste your python code here and you can even mention the data set which you want to use here so if you don't have a data set here like you can upload from this tab so yeah uh once you have selected your data set you can click on train model once the model is trained and everything is done you can find all of your models here so yeah and we also have something called as credits so like if you need to run an action platform you obviously need credits to buy those credits we take you have to pay like we have five credits for five file coins so like this is just a demo like literally might be changing that and we have also enabled notifications for you guys like it uses push in the background push notifications so whenever there is some status update uh all those notifications will be pushed to you and like you have to subscribe to it like daggle and we have also enabled ens for you guys so that uh click names and authors will be resolved for you and like in the background we'll be using ethers and within Pro like we need an RP URL for that which supports uh resolving those names yeah a pretty this is daggle and yeah now let's check the results for these two which we have submitted earlier to get your results the ipfs nodes hosted on backlog like it takes some time uh so instead what we will be doing is that we'll copy the job idea and we will directly get it from the CLI which is a cloud get and the job ID let me also uh get the results for the remove BG let me go to my other console [Music] get yep let me submit that too so yeah you can see that there's a new photo which is being created a t7 here we can see the outputs and the results yeah you can see that hello from hack FS final which we have submitted earlier and let's check for this yeah even this thing got published yeah okay let me take my terminal down you can see that we have a modified image yeah pretty much this is click this is our platform this is a daggle for you guys hope you like my presentation and thanks for seeing amazing thank you so much Leo that was uh it was great a really cool demo to be able to actually send all these kind of package shops to be able to do this in a whole decentralized way and hopefully get to add a lot more actions for people to uh to use congrats all right next up is our demo number five I want to bring on Mohit to talk about what three stash welcome hello so hi everyone this is Mohit and this is my project web3 stash which is a standard library to get a single API to connect to multiple decentralized service providers so you all might have used uh decentralized storage networks to store your data and probably you would have used services like ipfs pinata nft dot Storage web3. storage or here client but the problem that mostly the users face and especially the new users face is that they get confused between all these services that they like take a lot of time to understand how to upload Json data how to upload uh video how to upload image across all these services and the another problem is like the syntax along across these services are quite different so if you have to migrate from one service to another you have to understand their documentation they have you have to change your code which takes a little bit of time for your your development process to solve all these issues and have a common interface between uh all of these decentralized storage networks and services web 3 stash has been made so what you have to exactly do is basically you just have to install web 3 stash Library you don't have to install any other Library if you want to use any of the service providers you just have to install web3 stash it is uh it supports common JS and es6 formats so you can use it in any node project once you have installed the web3 stash Library you just have to instantiate the web3 stash Constructor and pass the service name so services like services are like this ipfs HTTP infuri pinata so whatever service you want to use just put the name here like pinata or ipfs and then provide a config config is like uh the private key or the API key or API secret needed for that service you can keep the config options null if you want to have advanced options then you can use it but only these two things are needed to connect to the ipfs through any of these services and once you have instantiated that you just have to call these functions which is same across all the services so if you want to upload Json just call service.upload Json and pass the Json data if you want to upload image just put the path and image gets uploaded video and file the best part is another thing is like the output for all of these Services I have also kept same across in the npm library so whatever the service you are using you will get the output in this format like the ID which is basically the hash you want to store on the smart contracts etc etc and then the metadata associated with it if you want to use it you can use it but the output is same the functions are same and it's just like a single line syntax to use so you can use like Helia Helia is just launched so you can use Helia also you just you don't have to pass any config as well in here just pass Ilia Helia is ready then call the services same way for pinata just instantiate with web3 stash pinata pass the API key and API secret and then you have all these services with you have like upload from stream as well stream is like for big videos or big images so you have to do chunk uploading if you are uploading from AWS or any other service so that is also simplified here just provide the readable stream it will do chunk uploading for the big videos and big images so let me go quickly to the demo so this is I have created a test npm uh project to test the web3 stash Library the web3 stash is currently available on npm so you can use it right away as well so I have just instantiated all the services so you can see just one line for instance situation where three stash passing in queue up in our time I have just provided all these things and once I have done this so I will just call any of the services so let's say I want to use the inferior service the ipfs service so I will just do npm start and just take 30 seconds to upload the video and I will get the hash yeah so you can see I got the output from the I have controlled our logs so this is like the ipfs hash so if I just open it you can see there is metadata in the ID so if I just go on the gateway to check like whether it's really uploaded so so yeah the video is here so same way like if you want to use pinata these are the things to use for finata like pinata dot different different kind of service you can just pass directly the Json and you have to just provide the path all these things are kept here in my local so I will just call this thing and this is done SO waiting for its upload and same way for stream upload so you can see there is a pinata stream upload so if you want to do chunk uploading so this is the way I am creating a read stream and then I'm just providing the stream to the upload video from stream stuff so I will just comment out this thing and I will just call this if it will upload the video in chunks and probably it's a small video but if it's a big video you will see the difference of uploading it in the chunks and from the string so this is almost all about my project so if you are like using any of the decentralized storage networks and if you are using any of these services use web3 stash to ease out your development process thank you awesome thank you uh well this is super cool because I have myself tried to do this a lot of times for large files and it's just always tricky to figure out the stream movable uploads so uh now I finally get to use the library for each Global so this is great thank you all right next up is demo number six I want to bring on Naomi to talk about Hearthside Hangouts welcome okay hi everyone my name is Nami I'm a front-end developer and for the past two weeks I've been building Health site Hangouts a mobile app full of book clubs so you might be thinking well web free and bookless what does this have to do well to boot simply there's a lot of issue you can run into when you're a member of a book club from you know getting your tools materials with you know banned books to organizing or even moderation and the good thing is that web 3 Tech can help and that's how I got the idea to build a mobile app that will help readers find their book club but also have more easier and meaningful conversation thanks to Milestone based reading and dropping audio call and now that you're all caught up with what her side hanger it's it's time for with a small demo all right so the first thing we're gonna do is explore the clubs so right now I'm not connected so I cannot see any club but if I go and check this club details I can see the current read who is running the club and I can also see here that they have a couple of discussions however I'm not signed in therefore I do not have access to the discussion and here in the schedule tab I can see the different Milestones but again since I'm not signed in I do not have access to them so to fix this what we're going to do is we're gonna sign up here I'm gonna sign up with my Google account so this social sign in is followed by Magic SDK which allows users to sign in with their Google account Twitter account any Social account but under the hood they are actually using a web free wallet so this is gonna just take us a couple more seconds it's going to still take a couple more seconds to appear and in the meantime I'm gonna just explain that all the data that you see in the app are actually sold on polybase and we don't need to sign any messages thanks to the magic SDK all right so I'm signed in now if I go back to the clubs I unlocked the my club Tab and I can see all the different clubs that I'm either running or I'm a member of so if I go to this club what we're going to do first we can see here that I can update the details and I can also change the current read so let's go ahead and do that so here we're gonna have access to a wide range of books thanks to the Google Books API so we picked a book now it's getting index to our polybase database I'm going to set it as a current read so old I didn't mention it yet but all the images that you can see in the app or other media for that matter are stored thanks to web free storage all right so now we have our current reads being set and now that we set a read I'm going to edit the schedule by adding different milestones right we add our title we set let's say today in one hour and we're gonna create our milestone so our Milestone was added properly and here I can see that I can join an audio room for my Milestone so let's go ahead and do that and here it's gonna open a huddle 01 audio room all right we got the room open here but we can also see here that in the club discussions um I have access to this Milestone room that I just created and I can sorry about this I can share messages in the club room and any other members will be also allowed to post messages and read them but if you're not a member of the club you won't be able to do that so now if we go back to the schedule tab we can see here that I have this uh Milestone that I created earlier and I can RSVP right I RSVP now if I go to my calendar I can see here that it was successfully added to my calendar with the link that I showed earlier all right and that's how I hang out in a nutshell thank you very much for watching this demo and thank you for it Global and all the sponsors for this amazing thanks so much Naomi and this is super cool to see that uh you kind of built something that you're also super passionate about and also gets more people into what three this is great all right um three more demos to go so let's bring our third last team Shady chat to our demo so Patrick welcome feel free to get started with what you built that's good thank you very much hello everyone I'm Patrick from the chitty chat team those are hard to imagine most of the time the tools used to communicate like Discord or telegram are not web3 optimized we wanted to create a tool that would make it easy to create a data dial manage it and interact with it leveraging other web 3 tools natively all within a chat itself so we created Chit Chat um so let's imagine that we are an arc Collective and we want to experiment with AI tools we want to create the perfect prompt for the art have an AI system create the art itself and create the art that will be stored using filecoin using the push-up we can create an fem data diode chat group with participating wallets and execute various commands so for example here I can create a VM data dial with a simple click just have to create my name description nothing to uh too interesting here and then I can add whatever wallets I want within this data dial all every single wallet that that is integrated into the data dial has the same voting rights in terms of what they want to do for um for voting in terms of creating proposals and saving uh files and so in the back end what happens essentially is just by creating this group chat uh they did a dow chat um all the different Falcon fvm uh contrast get deployed and uh and all the tokens the business are votes the governance uh every all of that gets automatically created for everyone within that chat um so once that was created we can communicate within the chat as I said before and within the chat there's there's premium features so one example is like calling PT API that can only be accessed using super fluid apcoin streams so right now in effect uh this chat is token gated using apecoin um so going back to our example uh let's begin by creating a suitable stable diffusion prompt using chat GPT so we're asking PT to create us a prompt to then be able to use that prompt for stable diffusion so we get a prompt back which is great I have saved a prompt already to use this and what we're going to do is we're going to call bakalao um Rebecca loud network uh the stable diffusion application on top of the background network with the specific prompt that we want to create um to create an image from it and this is all within the chat every single person within the check and see what's going on so from this um from this like a job essentially we just created we can fetch uh the outcome of the job once it's done and then we'll this fetching essentially we already have done it before we have a nice little sailboat picture here that was created using the back of that Network um with this file now we can push it over to ipfs create a car file from it just straight from the chat and then the most powerful kind of aspect to this application is that now we can propose uh to save this file uh just within the chat itself so by doing by doing call to a funky call F10 proposed within necessary arguments we can create a proposal within this data dial within the chat that will store this file so what's going to happen here is that in the back um this this proposal will be sent over to a Smart contract an ID is going to come out of this proposal and then anyone within this chat can uh vote for the proposal so you can go and call fpm vote and you need the right proposal ID for it we already have a peripherals idea 384 us to do this at this point we're going to have essentially three buttons that are going to come out a yes no and abstain for anyone to be able to vote on this proposal again we're the proposal is to save the stable diffusion image that we just created I'm going to go ahead and say yes I like this uh image so now we're going to go from the go early Network which was the network used before through the falcorn network switch to that the pop-up of venomask saying that you you want to vote um yes will come up and be able to confirm and at that point and then we go back to the Google Network which is the current Network for this chat app and so right now that has been sent out the proposal will um as the votes get counted and as a timeline uh time of the vote gets uh gets finished then at that point we can call as VM execute to execute this vote with the right proposal ID which then will save the file that we've just created within the chat um onto the Falcon Network um so again just to go back to what we've done we've successfully created a data dial with other artists created a prompt using cha GPT used back allowed to create a stable diffusion image fetched and uploaded this file to ipfs we proposed using our data dial to save this file to Falcon and we've fully voted and executed the vote all within the same application making making it very very simple to be able to manage what's going on with this stuff thank you very much and thank you for listening amazing thanks Patrick this is super cool and I feel like we're just scratching the surface on what you can do with cat prompts and uh integrating with a lot of the web 3 protocols and seeing data dials used this way is even more amazing because you get to kind of bring in and chat with all the contributors immediately so it's gonna be fun rats thank you all right two more demos to go so welcome our second last demo for today which is team sub proverb let's go welcome uh hi everyone this is Utica from Team sub proverbs uh uh we built uh an all-in-one and no code decentralized IPC subnet Explorers so you probably know all the keywords uh maybe I can explain what is the IPC subnet is IPC is a shorter of interpolated consensus and subnetses like a sub Network what does this do uh you can launch your own chain inside the file coin and you can launch your own chain specifically or for your app for your game or Etc and you can communicate with other subnets and you can communicate you can send Crosshair messages and you can benefit all the file coin features by using your subnet so why sub proper we specifically built for IPC subnets and this is everything including Crossing messages which is a IPC subnet feature and of course transactions accounts and blocks are indexing too we have a CLI tool to subnet creators to deploy our infrastructure to decentralized network if it's no code which is just one comment and we are using tableland and so on for the centralized data and centralized computes so I can start my demo by using rcli Tool uh rcli tool has need three arguments first of all is through to RPC providers and seconds is subnet RPC provider and third one is foreign API key so I'm clicking enter and it's deploying our infrastructure all to the sphere on network and this will have some take time and uh I'm going I'm going to my local node you can see our front-end uh we have an indexer in the back end we utilize filecoin.js to make RPC calls make way way more easier and it's creates database page statements and insert into into the table lens SQL storage which is a decentralized also and we have a server utilize the express.js to serve data from tableland to our front end so this is our front end I built this with a react and I integrated World connect to user scan through their ANS names volt address or avatars or anything so you can see the last blocks are indested last transactions last question messages so right now there is no last crochet meshes in this node so you can don't you can't see any message let's go to the this block it is a block that indexes with a height 54 and this is the block ID and if there's any transaction in this block you can see it right here so right now I'm clicking this transaction and I open the transaction so you can see the transaction ID you can see from address to address value and guest details uh and if there's any transaction that you can see on here so let's go to the account page I click this from address you can see the address right here you can see the balance you can see the nose and you can see the all transactions that this address is made so let's continue to slide uh I explained this and also CLI build with the ax uh for for next steps we need to measure database architectures for built-in subject actions because they perform differently from others databases so we need a better database architecture and right now we are refreshing our front end to fetch the data but we need to Auto fetch the front end and maybe we need to add guerai to top of this CLI tool to make improved developer experience and of course we need to allow users to customize this team all these colors anything for subnet creators so basically why we are using table length and severon I'm explaining going to that because the peer-to-peer transactions the payment platforms using these explorers and if we can use all decentralized if we can create all the centralized platform we can illuminate the frauding or misunderstanding by users so because the payment platforms and peer-to-peer Transmissions relay on these explorers so thank you for listening to me this is Optical and my partner is or from my college you can find the songs tab thanks amazing well thank you so much for making such a cool utility for others to now kind of Leverage subnets even more and uh this is great hopefully you get to do all the future features that you just talked about congrats foreign with that we are ready for our ninth and last finalist demo for today and without further Ado I'd like to bring on Pablo to talk about D5 kicks welcome hi everyone uh well I'm Pablo Maldonado and today I'm presenting my project D5 kicks uh D5 kicks is a data Dao that democratizes defy data aggregation when we talk about defy data aggregation probably the first example that comes to mind is the phylama ifylama and similar aggregators offer insights like tvl protocol rankings yield farming and more enabling us to evaluate the state of defy the problem with such projects is their lack of true decentralization as the approval and calculation of information ultimately rely on their team defy kicks solves this problem by offering a fully decentralized transparent and Community governed defy data aggregator at the entry point the front end allows anyone to propose a new adapter a JavaScript code piece calculating project tvl at a specific time and continuously generating tvi tvl over time next any kick or Bitcoin token holder can vote of chain on the adapter to approve it or not the votes are time lock encrypted using unbiased voting when voting period ends anyone can execute the resolution requesting a back allow job through lilypad to Aggregate and decrypt the off-chain votes calculating the resolution and the rewards and Publishing everything on chain efficiently in a Merkel 3 route once the adapter is approved data collection begins through a lead action ensuring compliance with the adapter code and securely generating and storing the data in a decentralized and trustworthy maneer within ceramic stream finally the data can be visualized in the dashboard so I will first start by proposing a new adapter to add my project to D5 kids I will use this sample code that just returns a random number based on the latest block number of the chain I will confirm this track is up transaction and behind the scenes uh I'm first submitting my code to ipfs and then the CID is submitted to the governor contract to start a vote now I can go to the voting page and once it loads we can already see some existing adapters here in different states as a voter I need to evaluate whether an adapter should be added or not to the protocol by checking the code and any other pre-existing rules I will just go ahead and vote for this one to speed up things and I'm signing this message where I vote for so during the voting process as I told before my vote this time log encrypted and stored of chain ensuring a guest list and unbiased vote and once a vote is approved anyone can request a resolution to the smart contract and this resolution triggers a back allow job that computes of chain the resolution together with the rewards and then finally publish everything on chain foreign so once an adapter is approved the data collection is handled by lead actions configured to guarantee compliance with governance votes and in the end the data is produced in a decentralized and Democratic way that's it thank you for your time and your attention thank you so much Pablo this is such a nice way to keep a lot of the Integrity issues that we face right now in check and super extendable this can work for anything so you got not just a a defy llama equivalent but you basically got a datadog so this is super cool

profile and you will be able to see what price you want on directly your showcase profile if you're logged into your hacker dashboard you'll also see what prizes You've Won and I immediately be able to celebrate all the amazing things that you've achieved on top of all that don't worry if you're not watching this video live you can also see this thing we'll be notifying every team via email about all the prizes You've Won and confirming everything before we move forward so a quick note on prize delivery is as follows we are announcing all the prizes as things that are tentative because we've only had 48 hours to go through all these things with our partners and we are going to be doing a lot more diligence before we release the prices which means that all of them will be released on the 21st of July and that gives us the next couple of weeks to go through everything make sure that everybody's source code was correct we may want to make sure that he cheated I want to make sure that nobody worked on their projects before and that's only then we will log in all the actual winners so that also means that everything that you've heard so far is tentative and not final which means that if some team is disqualified we will find a way to replace them uh with the help of our partners to pick another winner or if somebody was part of the pool price category and they're removed or somebody's added then the average amounts that you receive for a pool prize will also change accordingly so keep that in mind and that's just a notice and the other thing is all the prizes that are not delivered by the protocol Labs which is the ipfs and Falcon prize will be delivered by 8th Global but ipfs and popcorn prizes specifically will be delivered by protocol lab so you'll be getting two emails from both of the the organizations telling you what the next steps are and if Global will not be delivering the ipfs and the Falcon specific prices so you'll be hearing separately with a separate process to get the next steps so you'll get that email very soon as well and shortly after everything is finalized and everything is reviewed we'll be releasing all the prizes to all of you directly now I also want to make sure we talk about what comes next we talked about all the prizes we saw some nine amazing finalists and the goal here is to talk about and really make sure we highlight how do you actually continue to keep on building uh hackathons are meant to be a quick way for you to help prototype something validate an idea or even see if a proof of concept is something that goes really well and we want to do something to make sure that you will have the support here so there's a lot of support especially in this ecosystem to get the next help and steps going for your project there's a lot of accelerators that are available we'll talk about how you can kind of get all these things there's a lot of other hackathons that we're hosting in person online that you can join globally and sort of get to learn more about this ecosystem you can also join the pl Launchpad to get directly the the right support you need to actually Fast Track and and launch your project and make this more than just a hackathon project and also if you are coming to Paris in a few weeks to either attend ECC or youth Global Paris there's also a lot of other events going Phil Paris where you can actually come and learn about everybody else in this community and showcase and get the right right out so these are just the four quick things that you can do as immediately next if you want to build your project more but I also want to take on a second to kind of actually introduce somebody special here uh Juan Bonet to uh to kind of take a few minutes and share what is it that you can do here from if we ran to actually turn this project into a startup this is something that we've done in the past and is an amazing talk that I'd love for him to kind of talk about again so without further Ado let's welcome Juan to actually tell us about what it means to take something from an idea to something that all of us can use every day one welcome hey thank you so much uh and super honored to be here uh really it's been awesome to follow along with on everything happening around across uh hackathfest uh uh it's great to be in this in this final moment um I just want to talk briefly about uh what it takes to start a startup in this uh broader ecosystem and some of the you know kind of a quick overview of like different kinds of resources available to you that you know you'll hear in more detail um uh about later uh and so I'm gonna share my screen briefly uh let me know if you can see that once again yeah there we go awesome so uh it's really exciting to see uh and this might be an updated screenshot so there might be yeah there might be something nice here but it's really awesome to see so many um startups that uh actually started in uh through either hacker class or other youth Global um hackathons not coming back to uh actually sponsor prices and uh with really strong Dev tools and so on um there might be other a whole range of other groups that you've gone to know over over the month um but it's really a testament to uh the entire flow of how hackers get used to new technologies um build new products get new ideas and then some of those end up turning into um really successful uh projects and really successful startups um so uh I want to kind of go through the different stages that it that kind of startups uh are kind of grow from and not all sort of paths are are look like this um startups in general are tend to be these uh kinds of entities and organizations that are um uh unconventional they tend to push uh different they push their own paths no no two startups are exactly the same uh but there tends to be some kind of common similarities across many of them and some trajectories that that um that have worked well for for a lot of teams and so uh that's kind of what I what I want to talk about today so you know the the kind of startup Journey starts initially with the kind of the founding team uh learning a ton about the world and so this could be through through uh School through jobs through kind of reading online um through participating in in different kinds of programs so there's an enormous amount of learning that goes um into uh the the building the skill sets and and learning rate um and knowledge knowledge Gathering acquisition skills and um just kind of everything that makes you you um and puts you in the right position to be able to notice problems and be able to have the skill sets required to uh to build something so the good news here is like all of you have been preparing for this for like your whole life since we were uh babies and you were just growing uh you were already kind of learning an enormous amount about the world to to be able to kind of solve problems um now kind of the the what I think is like a really important first big step that a lot of um uh groups take is to then start experimenting with ideas um and that that experimentation is partly thinking about some problem space partly thinking about potential products that could be uh built around uh solving that problem part understanding the problem in depth like really figuring out why the problem exists why it hasn't been solved already why other groups um haven't haven't uh solved them yet um and so on and a huge key component of that experimentation is actually trying to build products end to end and this is where hackathons uh offer an a real tremendous opportunity for for everybody to keep refining that and um it's not every uh it's not just kind of one hackathon you can think of this as uh using multiple hackathons over time to keep having multiple experimentation shots uh to be able to try build try understanding some problem space try building a solution try building a product fully end-to-end um to then kind of see whether it has uh potentially whether it has Legacy whether you want to take it on uh in kind of in a bigger way um and so you really see kind of the the uh hackathon stage is kind of a really important experimentation Loop um whether it's kind of the current project that you just built that you feel super excited about taking on and turning into a startup or whether it's um a feature project that you do through a hackathon hackathons give you this really really great experimental Loop where you know you you really have to come up with a product ideas design the whole thing end to end um the deadline of the hackathon itself forces you to kind of pull it pull the whole thing together in kind of a short time frame uh it gives you enough time to go in depth into one um range of uh uh some parts of the product and actually solve some hard problems uh there you know kind of um and also even short hackathons like a weekend hackathon uh you can get like that the you can really test an idea um even in kind of a very short uh short hackathon where you um are just kind of plugging a lot of pieces together or kind of seeing if some concept uh would work um my favorite uh I think are like a three to four week um hackathon speakers I think those give teams enough time and space to actually solve like hard problems and and so and get the whole product um kind of built end-to-end fully working and so on so like that that and having the the um uh requirement of showcasing and demoing and presenting the hack um also stress uh uh trains a lot of your skills in terms of being able to articulate what this thing is uh telling other people about um about it uh describing the problem that you're solving describing the solution space that you're exploring um and so it really kind of uh forces you to to understand that problem well enough and and how to sell the product and how to sell the idea um and then what comes sort of comes after that is that a lot of people as they encounter your idea and encounter your um uh your your demo and so on will then start flowing feedback back to you uh some people will try it some people will um like it some people won't um you know new products you know primarily just get you know tons of negative feedback because you know new products tend to be very very early very rough and so on so uh that's totally fine totally good and like um that's kind of how new products are are born um but that feedback is crucial and essential in giving you kind of a um more understanding about the problem more understanding about the clients and and what they would want out of out of that product and so really hackathons are this great moment to be able to kind of experiment with all this that's sort of like what comes after that is that you as you whether it's kind of again this project that you have uh with you now or a project in the future that you um uh build on a future hackathon or or even a kind of on your own um you can then start connecting that to um uh other uh uh either programs or or if the product is ready enough you can like launch it and see if um people start using it and so on um and so this whole set of resources and tools kind of after the kind of very early phase of building a product that can be useful uh and you kind of jump into this moment of kind of early validation of whether or not this idea has strong strong potential so this face is really about kind of uh you you have a an idea formed up about financial problem space you have an idea formed up about what the potential solution would be you have a a working component or or a working demo or or even a working product sometimes um and you're kind of validating whether or not that product is going to work in the market and it's going to work with a set of clients and a set of users and and so on and I sort of try to describe this space as kind of having like a minimum product it's not yet viable you're so you're kind of figuring out what are the the details about it that could make it viable um and in this period it's it um it's a lot about kind of positioning of the product really figuring out what are the key features that would really matter to the to the end users what what must exist in this um for this product to be successful and and so it's a lot about learning so so you're trying to build things and trying to put them in front of people and trying to to get insights from them to inform what what will produce an actual valuable product um and many times a lot of the projects here kind of actually find out that like hey this idea won't be viable uh and that's fine like you know most most startups um uh or most projects don't don't make it into a big a big thing um it's good to kind of even that learning is a really useful thing that lets you kind of um move on to to the next idea or something like that but this kind of early validation phase is really key that helps you um figure out whether the project is is going to work in in the long term or um how it must be shaped in order to work right so you might get a bunch of insights and learnings there that that tune the kinds of things that are that are um that the product has to have in order to be successful so that kind of feedback cycle um Gathering Gathering feedback from from users analyzing the feedback acting on those insights um refining the product over time and so on is really key and in this phase I would strongly encourage you to like just take an enormous amount of shortcuts just you're trying to get the the shape of the product right to be successful and you're trying to get information about what is going to make it viable you're not trying to build a full solution that works for everything kind of like the common mistake that I tend to see a lot of teams and a lot of startups make is that um they think that kind of building the first version of the product requires building in full and in detail like every single possible thing that um that that uh that product will require in the long term and in reality you can start uh a very different way which is kind of you get enough of it working uh just to show like the very core um functionality like the very core value proposition to to the end user and focus on that and kind of driving that as a product and seeing if that is going to work in the market and so this this is this kind of approach can point to you like what what is what is a potential viable product and in this area uh here's where kind of Grants become extremely useful so uh kind of before that when you're learning um you either are at school or you have some other job or or you're uh on your own and you're not yet funded through hackathons you start potentially having the opportunity to start winning some prizes to help fund your team and this kind of early validation period you now especially we're going to be working on this um uh full time then you start needing um some way of sustaining the project and sustaining the the product and so on sometimes this might be too early for accelerators sometimes accelerates are really good for this uh this moment uh this is where I think like micro grants can are extremely useful there's a number of programs that that do these kinds of prices and these kinds of Grants um that can be extremely helpful for teams here though kind of want to want to get some early validation and figure out whether that product is going to work on kind of the next step after that is once you kind of have a sense of what will actually make a minimum viable product even if you haven't fully been able to build it yet or deliver it uh you have a lot more insight into what will um be a viable product that that I think is like the right moment to fully kind of like start a startup uh uh so to speak and this is where accelerated programs are extremely useful they can help guide you uh in terms of um how how to work how to start a service in the first place like what does that mean in terms of incorporating entities what does that mean in terms of um actually being able to kind of um employ people what does that mean in terms of getting racing funding and and so on so this is kind of like where you go from hey you have an idea for a minimum viable product to a building that minimum of Iowa product and testing it out in the market and starting to get uh strong users and B creating the organism the structure of the entity and so on that is going to be able to build that product over time that's going to make it sustainable and so that entity is um you know in many times this could be a company this could be a foundation this could be um Network it could be there are many different kinds of um this could also be an open source project sometimes it doesn't follow the the the path of a of a company or something like that um the the point though is that you need some kind of organizational structure to to organize the people that are going to be working on on producing this this minimum viable product uh and there's a ton of accelerators in in in in the network that are um that are there uh uh for you uh to be able to apply to and and work with and and so on uh that could be could be helpful uh and then kind of after the accelerator programs once you uh are working on that minimum vital product once you've kind of uh validated it with actually users and actual customers and so on you're starting to get like traction on that mvp and you're starting to get cycles of users and in that area is when you kind of start going from an early potential product into now a product of starting to get users and starting to get clients and um is becoming um a thing that people can depend on um you you go from kind of um having an MVP like the minimum viable product into starting to get product Market fit which is kind of the key thing that you need for for kind of scaling scaling the use of a product product Market Fitness is when a product um has the required features and uh price points and distribution and so on to be kind of understood by the broader Market especially the broader Market starts selecting that product and using it at larger scale and so that kind of transition point is it goes from hey you have an idea that you're contesting out and trying to tell the world to once you start achieving product Market fit and the world starts finding out about your product and and if the product fits the requirements of the market um then you get this transition that happens when suddenly the growth accelerates and and you get kind of like this this big scale up and it tends to be that product Market fit isn't like a binary thing where like whether you don't have it or you have it it's more of a spectrum or Continuum and it really applies to the shape of the product at the time um and so you can think of a very large long-term product as being built in a series of like successively larger versions of the product um you know one example here is like you can think of social networks where you know many social networks started by um first creating a very lightweight social network tuned to our specific market and kind of famously this might be like um Facebook starting with with um with universities or something like that or or um uh a a messenger app that like starts with just one-on-one DMS uh and then over time you know once you get kind of like that mvp working well enough and you get some early product Market fit and you get a number of users then you start kind of expanding the product into kind of like the next MVP open like a different size where you suddenly start adding um you know another range of features or you sort of start scaling scaling what that product means and each of those kind of sequential um ranges of the product or the sequential levels of the product has its own notion of product Market fit of whether or not like the feature status is is the right fit for for the market and so on and and this point in time is kind of where you potentially start getting early um early indication of whether or not the business model is going to work um so uh there are some kinds of startups that defer the monetization until like much later and those tend to create like work business models in some cases this is kind of where a lot of social networks in my View kind of went wrong with they sort of turned into into primarily advertising driven businesses uh if you can kind of figure out the sustainability path for a product or very early on you can figure out a good monetization path that aligns the incentives of the users with the product Builders and the participants so on and makes it a very good sustainable um uh kind of regenerative structure like that that can be a much much better way so in this period when you know in accelerated stages and early tractions as you're kind of starting to raise raise funding or Um this can be a great moment to then really figure out what the what the business model should be um how to structure monetization how to how to make the whole product sustainable because at the end of the day a product requires um a whole range of uh people building that product uh refining it over time improving it over time and all of that costs significant amount of amount of money and resources so creating a structure that is sustainable that has a strong Revenue flow is critical to to making sure that products serve their customers really well and are able to scale so you kind of want to figure out that out and sort of get it right you might have inklings of what the right business model is very early on but you should be ready to kind of experiment with that along the way change it um to kind of really figure out what makes sense in the market sometimes Innovations are about figuring out the right business model to support a product uh the right way and and there are many products out there that haven't quite actually figured out like the right way to create a business as well aligned with with their users um in this period kind of like after accelerators this is kind of like the pre-seed sort of range this used to be called seed many many years ago but you kind of get this Behavior where like the seed in series a and series being like all those terms about uh fundraising rounds just kind of keep increasing in scale and people tend to invent like new words that come before so you know back in the day seed funding might have been like you know a thousand dollars or something like that these days like that that's you know pre-seed is kind of like you know sub a million dollars or something like that and then see if it starts looking into into millions and this area is great for say angel investors um and early you know uh small VC funds and so on you're not quite yet ready for for like the larger scale large-scale we see that kind of kind of comes in in the later stage once you have a a sense of strong product Market fail and a strong business model and you have a lot of indications like this is going to be like a highly scalable thing um then some startups versus the path of like they're good for VC um in terms of like the potential return multiples then the and the scale of business and and so on um and then at that point kind of uh is is the right time to kind of think about um whether or not this is there should be a VC funded um effort effort or not and so this kind of like the pathway there's of course many more stages that come after that like see this kind of many people regard to see it as just like the beginning of the of the journey there's you know many more years and many more work um ahead after this uh but this is a kind of like giving an inside view here because for you at this stage or kind of where you are these are the stages sort of will matter uh to you over the next few months uh or or over the next year or two um and the and these are the the ones that are that will be will be useful to you uh kind of later on uh once the company starts growing then you know there's many more stages there and you can think of those as kind of the traditional um you know seed series a series B and so on where they're different kind of um uh gates in terms of the scale of the business the the um the strength of the the product the strength of the revenue and and all that kind of stuff um and so across all of these stages there are many different kinds of resources uh that can be helpful to you many different scales of funding um we've tried uh through the pl Network to create um so to work with a lot of Partners and create Solutions for people going across these stages um and so you know things from Grants at the right times accelerator programs uh investor Network and so on you'll hear about uh more in detail later on but just I'll just flash out um a couple uh in a kind of like a high level high level way uh you can think of appeal Network being an organization a kind of network of organizations that is trying to help a lot of startup builders start their startups uh Access Capital um find talent to help staff their projects get access to knowledge and get access to services that can help them grow I started to be able to create this kind of easier and faster and better way to to do stronger r d especially in like deep technical domains that are they tend to be underfunded by uh by traditional VC and uh and so we can be helpful like definitely um you know reach out and use the the resources of the network um everything from kind of uh microgrants um the accelerator programs that have been like you know tremendously successful for so many teams um the broader investor Network you know there's many constants of investors in in the broader appeal Network um and even things like Phil VC which are kind of a program that that helped connect startups that are um starting their fundraising rounds to a whole range of investors so to try and accelerate the fundraising uh period and and then of course um many kind of uh service providers for many kinds of uh problem spaces so things like Legal Services people Services accounting finance and so on and these are of course like will be useful like once you get you know post the seed stage and so on you start sort of growing uh but so that's more tuned for for those groups uh but that's it uh thank you uh so much for the time uh really excited about uh everything that everybody has been working on uh really excited for for the um this latest version of hack FS hack FS is super near idea uh to my heart is the first hackathon that we started working on with youth Global it's been so awesome to see the um success over time in the last few years of the program uh it's been so inspiring to me personally to see so many people come through um hack Fest and get to start learning about the systems trying out a bunch of ideas sometimes those projects themselves from hack Fest turn into startups themselves and grew and now we're back here uh sponsoring hack Fest in other cases those teams went on to build other projects through other hackathons and got started a different different way so it's just really awesome to to be part of this and
