welcome to hack fs or hack file system um [Music] today we had 650 hackers from 61 different countries and 18 time zones for this event and we're going to be judging based off of this format with four minutes of demo three minutes for questions and feedback with the judges and a 10 minute break in between and the criteria for judging is based on technicality originality practicality the ui design and of course the wow factor just to my just mind you that this is not a competition and we are here to learn here to explore what's possible we're not aiming to become businesses and hackers are here to get feedback from the judges in those three minutes and i'd like to introduce our judges we have jeff and sophia thank you very much for your time and we could go ahead and get started if the first team is ready please share your screen i'm sorry is this etho step is the first one [Music] yes yes okay sure i'll share my screen can you see my screen yes okay we can see it great so yeah ethostep ethostep is a madras gesture torx for planet and people repair and empowerment preface i'm no expert just a curious mystic for alternative modes of communication and most the visuals you see in the demo are made from codepen artists i was very inspired by juan bennett said about crafting spells at near zero costs with software and i like to think about it as alchemy bringing new light into hackathons and software development to create new creation abundance it tends to lean on various dynamics we may look at in the contents of the trinity symbol of karma to drive human progress between human earth machine and spirit and dating back to group like rituals the software approaches these abstractions in a mechanistic way to gather connect and grow altogether really realizing traditional morality and coining a new term ritual reality we can take a page out of the locomotive as thinking about a collective signification as a type of machine or movement but it can be done periodically in gateways forms and curing pods the goal is to make accessible distributed participation for one-to-one planet health and the use of these madras hand gestures as a communication tool makes it accessible for all those to participate and feed dataflow to reverse by organizations output it to something like the eden project where a collective groove can make and feed data from the right sources spoke cognition or data simple gestures stream payment reimbursed to plant trees in an acro across the world and the significations are representing certain trackers in certain uh cultures and again i'm not expert just a curious mystic the use cases encompass possibly two or three different areas one would be community the elderly or other rituals in community you might be seeing bcis being performed in let's say unison across specific culturally you know open public festivals or trees whereby the future uses of this data gets produced and presented in type of fiance etching and artists representations in the elderly the gestures or exercises for the elderly of the paraplegic sometimes as physical activity can be difficult so the movement of hands and has tasks or other symbolic gestures might yield productive and connected hearts and minds and then finally other ritualistic movements whether it's data scientific redemption or other caring pods in longevity research the ideal computing stack has data with different types of shapes so i tried to incorporate different types of technology stacks here in the project but for the time being this is the ideal stack and the implementation is quite minimal at this point ideally i'd like to be able to have a minting model where group computer vision entities are sold as a grudem as a group kind of like a totem and that becomes a sort of mechanistic model for the economic ways that things are generated the architecture might look like you would have a group with a single host and that host would stream payments to those that are participating in amongst the group and i'd like to get to the point where there's a data metric where the flow coming from bci headset coming to the point where trees get planted considering the fluence api as the main source of technological innovation here it's a type of in-between computing os between the typical tree structures that we see that can be woven together across the new new tree formations that we might see from earth and people and this external input can be also mapped from external let's say frequency sources in a type of sound bath and whatnot and the ideal architecture would be that these minting moments or collective totems would be minted to a gnosis safe down and the data would be stored on textile and now work in progress demo sorry the thing up here is just a little bit so i like to think about the gears as sort of like this mechanistic new clock that we're forming and we're winding the time on longevity and human planet repair and so people would gather and connect across these different type of gestures where they would perform them together in a type of ritualistic activity and also representing a type of hand to mind connectivity so here i'm performing a transaction here to stream payments and the computation would be performed in the fluence api and the data set or at least the computation would be performed also within the fluence api in terms of how much data is flowing through the fluence api to the ipfs and you'd have a counter with the trees being planted and that's the end be happy to open with the questions thank you so much so now your three minutes for judges feedback and questions begins right now wow that is super cool so um in the demo as we stated our next presentation uh comes from alan uh he needs no introduction but i'll give him one anyway he's a software engineer working with protocol labs uh currently working to make this distributive web more accessible to developers where that came from sorry that's just a pre yeah oh no no worries yeah i was just gonna say that's really cool how so what you're doing is you're performing these hand gestures and that um connects to your meta mask you know the hand gestures would ideally be picked up by computer vision and the metamask would be stream payments coming from the host to the people that would be gathering um and so the person that would be the host would stream those payments let's say if there was a donation or let's say there was a post mint coming from the collective generation of the group photo or the group let's say collective uh video how do you know how does the group gets connected um is it also through like a computer vision where you unlock the connection with them through performance of some ritualistic movements yeah ideally it would be let's say picked up with you know computer vision ai but for the time being doing it in a simple way would be using a bci headset where the stream stream data is sort of like collected over the frequencies and you can possibly map that to some type of you know t sne visualization of showing the visualizations of each frequencies together would that be very unique to each user and therefore it's very secure and unchangeable uh in terms of the signature of each frequency it's it's not as like um it's pretty delicate with like how you might think about it being unique but you might see it as like finding group similarities and i'd like to see where different people with the same type of frequency would be mapped to the same type of gathers so those people would have the same type of asset since their totems in their nft minting monuments gotcha very cool jeff over to you yeah thanks i mean just like fascinating this is uh like such a unique uh project um how did the um actually i want to ask you something so so i think sophie covered a lot of the other aspects i was interested in but on the technical side like what were some of the challenges that you ran into and like what is sort of the next step so for example i mean what i'm thinking is like how do you connect to tree planting i think is there is there sort of like some off off chain or is that like a human like a very human connection at the end yeah it would be pretty off chain as long as there's stream payments coming from the host to the to the gathers ideally i'd like to use something like ave as a type of delegated credit or the person as the host let's say would have a donation or let's say funds allocated from a longevity research institution and the interest would then get streamed down to the sort of trickle-down effect and then there's an organization called the eden project where i could send crypto or i can send a donation to them and then they would plant trees so they're sort of like this you know um i guess middle ground where there has to be a little bit of man in the middle there but eventually this organization is able to plan trees based on a 10 cent model great thank you really appreciate it yep i hope you enjoyed thank you so much team ethos set for your presentation we'll now be moving on to team spect if a representative from your team is ready to share your screen please hey guys we are picked in this hackathon we built a reputation-based team making protocol it makes it easy for contributors to contribute to web3 projects and projects to find contributors our team saw a problem with the way uh work is currently done in web3 currently the most common way for people to contribute to web3 projects and dows is through grants they're a good way to build out an ecosystem on top of an existing project but most grant applications currently are submitted by people who have already been involved with the project's community for some time and have a good understanding about the project web3 projects therefore don't readily have access to a large global brands work well for larger projects and contributions however it is somewhat hard for smaller bite-sized work to get done in an early stage project without the same amount of capital or community especially when they are trying to build their core product for newcomers looking to contribute the plethora of web 3 projects to pick from can be overwhelming contributors also need to spend upfront time without an income to get a understanding of the project's ecosystem before they can meaningfully contribute spec makes it possible for contributors to start contributing meaningful work to web 3 projects and earning an income the day they set up a metamask wallet spec also makes it possible for projects to complete bite-sized work by hiring the best person for the job from a global talent pool now aditya parmar is going to do a demo of our platform hi so i'll be giving the demo for our project this is the first page we see when we open our app so for the sake of the demo i'm going to assume the role of a contributor and apply for this logo design job so here we can see the job description assets and most importantly these parameters so first is the price range creator is willing to pay in dollars next is the lock stake which is the amount of dollars i need to stake for this work this is to ensure that i complete the job is in the set time next is the completion days the number of days i need to complete the job by next is acceptance days the number of days the creator needs to review and accept the job the number of religion decide and finally how much percentage of fees the creator is willing to lock in the escrow so before i submit the proposal i'll go to my profile page and i'll add some spec to my stick so yeah my stake has been updated now i'll go back to the project and i'll submit a proposal all these values are pre-filled and i'll submit a proposal has been submitted now let's see what the creator sees so on the creator page we can go to the proposals and see that okay he has received a proposal for his project so i'll go to this proposal i will verify all this it looks good so i can accept it so yeah the proposal has been accepted but it needs to be confirmed from the contributor side so i'll go to the contributor go to the proposals tab and see that my proposal was accepted i will just confirm again all these parameters are right and confirm and start to sign the transaction so yeah the project has been started now i can see i have one day left to complete this project so i'll go to the project page go to the submissions and submit a logo and i'll submit the logo has been submitted from my site so i'll go to the creator site go to the projects tab i will see that this has gone to awaiting acceptance one day left to accept i'll go to the project go to submissions yeah so i can download this and verify it i'll just complete it now so yeah the project has been successfully completed now we can see on the contributor side and go to the profile and see that the balance has been updated thank you in summary spec makes it very easy for people to find meaningful work to do in a web 3 world it also lowers the barrier to entry in web3 projects by providing a way to make steady income it empowers website projects by creating a large talent pool of contributors with diverse skill sets it also strives to build tools and protocols that make it possible for larger teams of freelancer and projects to collaborate with each other in a trustless way in a highly customizable fashion thank you we'll now be moving on to the three-minute judge feedback and q a first sure i'll go first this time thanks thanks jovia um yeah super super uh slick ui was my first thinking like it just um uh it it it seemed to work really really well and i was taking a look at your live demo also um i guess two questions the first is where are the files stored and then second is you know one of the issues i think with these sorts of platforms is always like how are disputes handled especially in sort of like a web 3 or decentralized uh way like you know the work that was uploaded it was no good and and uh you know or it didn't didn't match what my expectations were so if you can just comment on those two two things what you know i'm curious to know how how you're actually uh handling the storage of files uh especially when there could be like private uh data involved like i don't want the world to see my logo yet and then also how disputes are handled uh yeah those are those are really good questions so currently the the files are stored on web3 storage and um that is uh currently publicly stored and we are assuming because uh the nature of web3 is a lot of it is open source uh right now we are assuming that a lot of it would like people would be okay with uh open source storage uh but also we are looking into stuff like end-to-end uh encryption and all that um right and in terms of dispute yeah that that's and that's a great question because that's something that uh we're trying to figure out so right now the main point of dispute is deadlines so let's say if some sort of like some someone doesn't uh like complete a project and submit it in time uh that is actually being uh like stored on chain like the deadline for it and that can be triggered by the other party who can actually call that deadline violation and because we have a next state collateral so we actually like to incentivize that uh but in terms of the quality of the work again like because it's qualitative it's hard to figure out but uh there are things like argan aragon uh codes and like other like jewelry mechanisms so uh something something often like um like a jewelry consisting of experts for the specific subject matter is something like we we want to look at in the future uh but we had to figure out the qualitative uh sort of disputes got it yeah but great great job looks really good sophia uh over to you yeah slick hey uh slick ux ui like really nice uh curious how did this problem how did you identify this problem did you run into yourself uh yes yeah we we actually ran it ran into it ourselves we were actually taking part in another hackathon and we had a hard time uh and at that time we were actually like uh trying to build out a whole project and we had a hard time finding someone who could uh help us with design and like logo designer it was me and aditya parmar and we actually were both developers and we we didn't really like we weren't even able to make a very good video because of that so at that time uh we realized that many small teams because we see the future in a way that uh like there'll be more more of like smaller project teams that are targeting very specific um like uh like specific problems and these small teams have like trouble uh finding uh like like specific expert expertise in roles so that's something we face so that's why like we uh we actually went ahead and built something like this for people like us sort of you know yeah there's definitely a need for this a lot of our portfolio companies within our fund have trouble accessing uh good talents good engineers but at the same time they just don't want to go out and hire full-time engineers without going through a testing and getting to know each other process to understand your capabilities so this is super useful thank you very much for putting this together thank you thank you for your questions thank you so much specs um we'll now be moving on to team five token so you're already please share your screen if until this year let me share my screen now sorry wait a minute we'll have deflated body hello everyone this is v1 from five token a brief introduction about our products and showcase what we have developed within the two weeks phi token team is formed from a group of people who have deployed body into blockchain industry for years and five token targets to create a bridge tool to implement the whole id information including payment identity and reputation system and now i'll show you the development status about our id information storage within the two weeks let me introduce the identity framework of five token to use five token can transformate it into web2 method of almost the app into web3 method five token provides users with an independent data repository in the web stream storage section on the right user data is divided into public info and private info or in for support question optimization nadf can read the data according to the protocol provided everything will be completely defined by the users in conclusion we target to be the primary to let users own and use their identity information by themselves so here it's a good github demo link about the api and the interface to let you know the whole picture of the id centralized storage and management you can briefly read the introduction of our projects here and we need to mention that we also support multiple blockchains into finance marching ethereum dfinity and so on and the apis we show you is about how to management the public user information but about private part is due under the development so the for the first one the df link request for the different link request it's supposed five token apps to link between the apps and watch three storage and they can get user information in the whole uploading process on web stream storage and for the second one let's start with the app link a message the api is about listen to function to get user information mostly and the whole process is we guarantee and their users also routine and to let you get a whole picture of the api call we've designed a five token id information storage demo here so first connect the wallet and on the extension page you can see that we create a five token well a wallet account it's about five token dress and also the ethereum address and you'll click connect here and now you've just upload the information on the website so to define the id account you can upload a series of different information first the profile picture this is the mastercard of five token named picture we named it as pixel here we have import a simple definition mascot of web token and when you click modify your id information the data just being saved on the network and it will ask you whether you'd like to have the authority to help us access your information and you can click confirm here and all the information just being uploaded successfully and if you refresh the website or you just logged out all the data is being saved on the background and so you just need to click at your id information and give the authority and access to your account again and confirm so all since you've imported into website pages we show again it is the whole thing about our demo so thanks for listening yeah that's all about oh i i think i think we might have lost faye can you hear us oh no oh no um that was that was a very cool demo yeah well since this is recorded i hope when faye reviews the uh recording she'll see our hear our comments um i guess my question um i don't know if you're able to answer right now is why did you choose filecoin um to start um out of all the other ecosystem out there i think that would be my first question um and then jeff did you have any follow-up questions yeah i mean mine again were sort of on the like uh the comment leading into the question is you know there is a real challenge around um you know any of these ecosystems including file coin around usability on sort of the infrastructure side and i think that five token is really seems to be aiming to solve that and i just wanted to dive in a little bit more as to um like kind of the next steps on that and then how they how they like what are the next things that the kind of road map that could be done and then also how do they how do they come up with this this idea so um in abstentia fay maybe maybe we'll get you back in a little bit and then we can we can have a further chat if there's time yeah but but they thank you for tackling the reliable id management problem because definitely that's a need to be solved and one of the decks that came across our desk includes something like this but not in the way that you've tackled the problem the other way of tackling the problem would be kind of like having your own name um and tied to like an address and then we use that like for example my name is sophia does out at whatever the url and then i can just use that url to more conveniently sign in um into different platforms so thank you for creating this uh really cool idea yeah thank you thank you faye and team great job thank you five token um so we'll now be moving on to team easy web three please share your screen when you are ready hey uh yeah i'm going to share my screen can you guys see my screen yes thank you we can see okay i'm going to play the video create a simple website application the project is called easy at website which is a website builder for non-coder to create a simple website application as crypto get popular more and more people want to get into web's ecosystem however most people do not how to code even though people with coding experience still hard to learn the website development ecosystem and to develop actual website enabled application therefore we block a lot of people out of the web's ecosystem with easy website people can simply use jack jack and the job website enabled component to create a website enabled sites i'm going to do a quick demo to see how easy website works first create a navigator i'm going to name it easy website and if you i'm going to show uh some website component that developed uh say we want to listen to some music we can drop drop the drag and drop the audios music component here is where surely the music in this tracks and you can click this button to listen to the music and if you want to uh listen to different uh checklist you can uh customize the check url here for example if you update the list here it will automatically update the component list you can also put some nft you want to show off for example we can drop drag and drop some zoro component here see we got nice uh doji and we can choose a sec id here you can also live stream video so live and you can set the playback id here website behind the paywall so unlock for example you want only people who buy the unlocked membership to view the live stream so you can add unlock content class here and add another um locked class favorite crypto or price to your website you can customize the here by providing covering key as a ticker click on this button here and you can type in your website title easy website demo and you can put a website storage token here and click deploy and after a while it will show up the decoy site link here click on it it will link you to the website you just created you will see the live stream uh live peer stream video exploration app here i'll be here click unlock button and i'll buy the membership this will show up here yep that's a demo video thank you we'll now be moving on to the three minute judge feedback and q a uh amazing that had a pretty big pretty big wow factor for me um i mean great use of grapes js and um like the the website builder um you know i mean i i i think a simple solution to this would have been just doing one component but you added like unlock zora bitcoin price um the the live pier so so very very cool great great job um you know great great job without it you know and also the the deployment to ipfs sort of like end-to-end um you know front-end building for for web 3. um like what what do you think it would take to productionize this like what's what you know where do you see the gaps with what you've got now to sort of like where you want to go with this um yeah i think definitely uh one thing is to integrate more components uh and also i think there are some small bugs like the for the rose or components uh currently i need to manually refresh the page to if i want to change you change the zero id we need to manually refresh the page in order to reflect the new change um i'm not i'm still trying to figure out why it happened uh yeah i think that's the main issue and also maybe currently it still requires some for example when users want to hide the like if they want to hide the content behind the unlock they need to uh update the class for the for the special component you want to hide so maybe it's not very friendly for user who is not familiar how the css class works um yeah i think basically it still requires some i think the major usually still requires some knowledge for user to use this application uh so maybe we need to add better guidance for the application to teach people to basically to let people know how each component works and uh to make sure that yeah great thank you sophie over to you oh thank you jeff thank you shifong uh i mean yeah this is definitely my a product bill for me because i feel left out for not being able to code anything so with so many possibilities on what you've created what do you think would be the most easy to use or what what would be the entry angle would it be people who want to use it to build nft would it be people that wants to i don't know uh launch their ideo or ieo or launch their products like what would be the the first kind of like use case for this use case adoption uh yeah see the maybe use case uh for example like you are hosting or i think for example the integration with the live peers quite interesting you are hosting uh like live streaming you want to people who pay for the live streaming uh you can easily use this tool to uh basically to uh integrate with live peer we unlock so people can play with unlock and they upset they make the payment they're able to see the live stream so i think this is a nice and also this is totally decentralized based on the ipf so no one can censorship or block your site away yeah cool awesome thank you so much for sharing this thanks thank you [Laughter] thank you thank you thanks okay so thank you very much we'll now be moving on to team docs if you're ready to present please share your screen hey everyone can you see me hey connor hello alrighty hi hack up us i'm excited to show you what i've been working on for the last few weeks it's a web3 notebook app called docs so ducks is a web3 notebook linked to your ens name or ethereum address it uses idx ceramic ipfs and web3 storage to publish your documents on the decentralized web i was heavily inspired by notions seamless editor and data model and especially interested in exploring the challenges of building a responsive real-time app backed by decentralized storage it was definitely a challenge you can use docs as a blog profile journal home page wiki test tracker and more the block based editor lets you edit text upload files and images and embed content that's all stored on ceramic and ipfs the documents you create on docs are linked to your ethereum address or ens name using idx and of course all those documents are public so take care if you dock yourself here's how it works everything in docs is a block pages text content blocks are all tile documents written to ceramic streams that means each block has an immutable version history here's an example block representing a page ducks uses idx to link your ens name or ethereum address to your documents maintains an idx index of blocks and pages that are linked to your idx profile profile pages read data from both idx and ens text records dots itself is a typescript and react app hosted on ens and ipfs you can access it through a web 2 gateway or directly if your browser supports ens name resolution at any of the links below finally image and file uploads are all stored on ipfs using web3 storage here's a demo so you've already seen pages text blocks support inline markdown like bold italic and strikethrough you can add inline emoji with emoji shortcodes lists code blocks and lots of other markdown elements work too you can embed images which are uploaded directly to ipfs and files like the ethialo paper here it also supports a number of other rich content blocks like bookmarks embedded media and even embeddable nfts to view a published doc click copy link in the upper right to get a public link to your page here's an example you can see there's a nice clean reading experience and the author of the doc is linked in the upper right this link will take you to their profile you can click your address or ens name in the upper right to view your profile these read information from your idx basic profile and from text records associated with your ens address here's my profile for horsefacts.eath there's a link out here to etherscan you can see my display name the emoji i've chosen cover image some of my social accounts over here most important you can see and view all my docs here on the left including the docs we've been looking at for this demo so go check them out afterwards you can edit your profile update all this information and store it on idx including this supplementary username information which is stored in a separate schema and for users who don't even have any docs but do have records on on ens you can read their ens metadata here's an example for santi i give him a blue check because he's verified on proof of humanity that's the demo here's what i learned first working with decentralized storage means getting used to a different set of trade-offs than working in web 2. you get really great guarantees about immutability versioning and verification but you have to think a lot more about stuff like latency and serializability that's docs it's all often available at docs.link docs.youth.link check out my profile docs dot link slash horse facts and you can see all the docs you see in this demo today thank you we'll now be moving on to three minutes of feedback and q a hey connor thank you so much for sharing that first of all love your bookshelf well-read impressive um i guess that ties into you know you're creating this to store documents to store images and files um curious to understand like who do you think your target audience would be who will be using your product the most uh yeah i mean you'll probably tell it's like super inspired by notion um and i think sort of the idea of something like notion in a personal notebook with like self-sovereign data and self-sovereign identity is really interesting um especially because it gives you that opportunity to like take the data that you put into into your notion and display it in different ways and different services um sort of different views on on owning that data and uh taking it around the internet um i was also sort of just inspired by seeing people share their eth usernames on twitter like to sort of become an identifier for folks um i think having kind of a place to build a community around folks using that that username as an identifier is really interesting you know i see these interesting people on twitter with their.eth linkedin a profile and would love a place where i can go and learn a little bit more about them and connect with them so i think those are the two the two groups at target with us cool thank you over to you jeff yeah very cool i was just trying to log in and i like the little icon you've got in the lower right the ceramic and idx with the like and then the different colors as it like cycle through and i haven't seen that before i don't know if that's something we built or or from somewhere else but um very cool um yeah i i'm i'm gonna ask one of sort of the the kind of immoral questions for this kind of thing like how do you ensure content stays for the right amount of time right especially when you've got so many different blocks and your you know like different protocols you're using sort of like where where is my data right if there's sort of one one place to look it can be easy but uh but you know it's um uh not say i think it's a i think it's great what you're doing in terms of integrating these different protocols but then how do you sort of like in you know handle and handle that make sure that the the data is not getting deleted or is getting deleted after you know when you want it to yeah it's a really interesting problem i i mean i don't think i nailed it in this right it's really difficult so the blocks are pinned on ceramic and documents are pinned on uh uh on web three storage right but um yeah you do have to think a lot more carefully right about when i delete a block i need to go sort of recursively delete all the parent blocks all the child blocks something like that unpin that data um i think when i was was experimenting with it at one point i found i had like thirteen thousand didn't document it i didn't clean up and delete it so yeah that can grow uh if you're not careful and um yeah it's definitely a challenge right and there's this sort of fragmentation that can happen the more complex your data model is right on some of these protocols so uh it's a good question i don't know if i have a great answer no i mean as like forward forward looking forward thinking question um but yeah great great job with this super slick um and and yeah i love love the user experience love the the technical integration as well awesome thank you thank you very much thank you team dog um we'll now be moving on to team certificate maker nft so if you're ready to show your screen please do and i'll begin your four minutes when you're ready all right let's meet my certificate in the t um okay i will now show my screen um so i think the video is uh on mute or something you can't hear the video i'm sorry about that zone and i'm a full-size developer i build a dab where users can create certificate and upload it to ipfs and users can also mint the certificate as nft so the problem is that is difficult and time consuming when you are carrying a good certificate storing it online and sending it to someone else the app that i created solves these problems by allowing the user to create the certificate and uploading it to ipfs where the certificate cannot be lost and users can choose a certificate template created by the designers and designers can earn cryptos when someone use their design template here are the technologies that i use for this step it's time for the demo so here is a list of certificate bars that you can choose from and if you want to see more certificate borders you can you will need to purchase a membership so you click this button this will open up the unlock model and purchase and then connect emboss about it and then click on wallet and then confirm so now we so now we purchased the membership and now you can see all the certificate borders that you can choose from if you want to upload your own certificate border you can click on this link and then unload the certificate border on the the image is stored on snakes.host where it will store the image on ipfs then here is the certificate and then you can connect your wallet and then set the price so to 0.3 e so if someone uses your certificate border you can earn some some cryptos and then you click on submit and then confirm if you want to create a certificate and send to someone else i say nft you can send out one of the certificate borders and then enter the following details and this one was 72 and then you can click on min nfts and there is the certificate has been generated and minted as an nft so here's the link to the certificate in ipfs and here's the transaction hash to on paragon scan and to see that it was successful maintained as an nmt i will add more features for customizing certificate allow the user to send out multiple certificate and now the user to share their certificate on social media that's it thank you for watching thank you i'll be moving on to three minutes of feedback in q a sophie you want to go first oh sure i went last time first oh did you okay i'll go first i'll go first sorry i lost track i lost track uh song that was i think except uh that that was super cool um i l i love the fact that it was just like working end to end you know right from uh like you've got the certificate borders that you purchase to generate and then you enter the details it generates a pdf uploads it to ipfs um it's it's very slick and i think that um that sometimes like the those like very straightforward uh applications um are solving uh kind of the key problem with one of the key problems with with blockchain which is just usability so so great uh great work there um i guess i guess the uh the question i i might have is um uh yeah like like what's what's next where did you like what did you learn from this and what do you want to do next with with a project like this oh i think uh one nurse i know how to use unlock so basically um i'm trying like the user won't need to like purchase a membership uh i did that because um sometimes i don't want that user to see all the all the designs created by the designers until until they pay just to avoid like i don't know maybe copying makes sense and what's next is um maybe add more features on this on the certificate generator um i kind of ran out of time i'll try to add more features but very ability to have to use another user to uh maybe add more text or add next to the chair like the issue will like like do like signature and then issue to someone else but today we get yeah makes sense great great job great job sophie over over to you yeah thanks jeff you asked my question sorry hey sam nice to meet you that's interesting angle well um can you tell me like how did you come to this idea like why did you wanted to use this certificate template and certificate generation for your project okay well when i came up with the ideal certificate it was on one of those hackathons when when i saw someone that um one of those participants they asked like the hackathon organizer are there any certificate and most of the time they say no like some hackers they do but once i don't say no i was wondering why then i was thinking about why do i make it easy for them the organizer to send a certificate by creating this application and then the design temporary um sometimes not every hacker knows a great design so it'll be nice to have some good design design some beautiful certificate and then basically make it easier for hacker monster issues to dedicate to to the hackers or the participant yeah well i i totally agree with you i think you know we we are living in a society where a lot of times showing branded items or certificates is a signal that you've done something um so yeah i mean if there is a certificate for this hackathon totally share it on social media and just say you know i put in the work and this is this is a proof of it so yeah that definitely solves the need thank you very much for sharing this i i hope i hope the organization adopts it that'll be fun that would be fun great work song oh thank you everyone thank you for the inspiration so now i'll be moving on to our 10 minute break um in the timer right now and if the following team team yoss can raise their hands so they could present right after that would be wonderful see you in 10. thank you very much thanks see you in 10. okay so 10 minutes is up judges if you're ready we could resume when you are you can give it a few more minutes i'm back awesome okay so now we'll be moving on to team nft aftermarket when you're ready please share your screen and i'll begin your four minutes hello everyone uh this is winter when um i'm glad to be here to present our second version of superzero superzoom is a copy nfp copy machine and you can as long as you can you you own the nfd and you can copy as many as you want and this time we not only team under how to make a copy we present the whole sdk in javascript so developer can make their own copy machine and make different application we also bought into polygon network test net and also supports um lobster and wrinkly has named for his hysteria in order to make the metadata of nfd copy we put the backup to ipfs and now you can not only copy cryptokitty you can copy any kind of um nfd theoretically if you only know need to know api for the metadata um you also can use any kind of erc20 token to pay for it um this time also support token streaming from superfluid i don't have any application demo but i can show you a document this is this is the major command you can use to do the copy we call it nft copy and the parameter you can see why you can choose any kind of token for payment and an nft you only need to have the payment token contra address and nfp contact address and the nfp id which which one you want to make the coffee and how many coffee you want to make so that's it thank you thank you so much so we'll begin the three minute q a and feedback with the judges hello ming how are you nice to uh nice to meet you thank you very much for taking the time and share with us your creations um i guess first question would be like what inspired you um to to tackle it from this angle to make nfc copies um because this is second time i'm i'm i present my super zero because i vary uh think that the nft is just one copy and you can resell the uh that's why i call is aftermarket then you can print uh as many as you want either because um for example if you have a copy of uh uh a write or book then you just resell that uh copyright to the publisher or transfer to others right then you have right to make a copy from it and the other and many many other examples then you can replicate nft right and certified that you have right to print and resell the copy like you have a if you have a print a very famous uh painting then you can make a painting up to your uh t-shirt or mac then you can use my solution then this time i'm making sdk not just an application or demo sdk can that many people meant to do any application and run on any use case yeah i well when i speak to some of the um startups and they definitely feel there's a need for a more usable set of stk to allow people to continue the build and i think that is a very important feature to have um and then yeah in terms of nft well that's interesting that you thought about this angle because um i think there's some um debates about you know what like the legal rights and the ip rights attached to these non-fungible tokens um and that will that may impede people from copying it um but that is still an area that is still being explored um but that's that's very interesting that your angle um thank you yeah thank you jeff over to you yeah no thanks i guess i guess sort of building a little bit on what sofia is saying like how how do you deal with um copyright claims like more directly you know like like the xerox uh uh and and it might not even be like take down my work it could be uh you know you're copying somebody else's nft and then you want to give that like you want to basically license it from them so you can make make copies of it sort of like how you know you might copy an article a professor might copy an article for a class and then you know have to pay some small amount of money to the publisher yeah i think um the wording of nft copy or use it it's not really appropriate you know actually you are on the right of the nft you can prove it because you have the nfp target then actually also my solution is to just like you to get people to pay for your royalty to pay any view of their content if that is a movie so actually it's overcome it's replaced the whole media right management so it's pretty easy to to approach that uh the the royalty payment and then how many you want to distribute and then it redistribute their you the copyright to the other guy because they have the copyright just like if you can rent a house and you actually have nfd just like the owner of radarski but you can rent you can prove that you are the owner of the house so then you can send the copy of the the your uh house at the state and to the the vendor right so it's fun it's a many applications and wrong eye i just waiting for to make it open more open and then the only problem is currently i only have to manually add the new nft for for for copy and then eventually uh it can be automatically scan all the nfp contracts and find out his api of metadata and automatically make it available for all people to make copies thank you that's it's very cool megan it's great to see you building on this i know i i saw it i think in a previous hackathon love the sdk focus now like and it's great to see this sort of like incremental like uh you know continuing continuing a great idea so congrats great work okay thank you thank you thank you team um nft aftermarket we'll now be moving on to team chill with audius api if you are ready please share your screen and i'll be giving you four minutes yes i'm here let's see looks like i'm sharing so i'm starting the video now hey everyone my name is raz and i have been working on this project called shield with audios um and it utilizes the audios http api to get trending tracks i didn't really have an idea to start with so i was just playing around with the api and see what i could come up with so the goal with this project was to showcase some of the music that's available on audios so i decided to pick a couple of genres i started out with electronic and rock in this case tie them to two buttons and the user then selects what genre they want to listen to with these buttons and then down at the bottom we have our player and it's actually playing right now and this is one of the electronic songs and you can also shuffle and that will just play any random another random turning song in the same genre so what i did is i implemented a continuous mode it will keep on playing one song after the other so we have the song here and it's about to finish and then the next one stops playing straight away [Music] and then if you want to listen to some rock music we can just go up to the top left and click on the rock button and then we get all of a sudden the trending training tracks in brock instead of electronic and we can see that the information here from wikipedia has been updated thanks for showing interest in my project yeah oh sorry we'll now be moving on to the three-minute q a and feedback with the judges me right all right thanks uh yeah this is this is super cool uh ras uh i was getting uh like my myspace vibes from it and i mean that in the complimentary way because my space started out as like a you know music sharing platform um and i like the the like kind of minimalistic uh idea behind it that you just go and you listen you pick three artists or three genres and like it cycles through the music for you i understand you know for the the description you have on your your page it's more of a traditional uh dap uh sorry a web app but if you were to add web3 features to it you know i don't know um i have some ideas but i'm curious to know what what what you might what you might add like where you would want to take this yeah and and the thing is because this is like the first hackathon i've done in so long like so nice stepped out of development for a while and then i'm back into it so uh welcome back yeah so this was like my first and i'm very new to that development and everything so i'm just starting to learn like solitary and everything from the ground up uh web3.js and stuff so so with this project it was like i guess uh like a conscious decision to go web 2 and just play around with this api rather than trying to build up that completely from scratch all by myself while i'm learning uh all this stuff so so i don't really have any like ideas where i could take this to make it into like a dab but uh [Music] well i was i was i i was thinking of maybe like a like an unstoppable domain or something like in that kind of realm uh but i have to look into that more so maybe like yeah no it's great i i just just one comment on one suggestion so the comment is i think that that's totally valid uh to do something that's like a little bit more web 2.0 even though this is a web 3 hackathon i think it speaks to the fact that the apis are getting to the point where people can do that right and and uh you know like interact with the blockchain but we don't have to always like the metamask and pop-ups and things like that so that's great you know the one idea i have is is like being able to tip the artist or like the artist like even not not necessarily pay the money but like you know record on jane that like yeah the legitimate interest in it and then you know maybe plugging in record labels or a r or something like that to come in and say oh yeah like this has gotten verified likes or plays or something like that anyway great job over to sofia thanks thank you roz yeah curious uh to hear like how do you select your i guess the music playlist are these well i'm not familiar with any of the artists that you have demoed in in the video um are you curating this selection and if so how are you going about choosing these artists uh no in this in this version like my proof of concept it's very primitive so audios have their own they have a trending endpoint uh and then they have like a flag or in the query you can select what genre you want within the trending uh within the trending tracks so i'm just pointing it to the it's like on load um because i'm using react so it's like a use effect so when it's that like renders the components um it points to the it fetches data from the end point that's like slash trending and then i have my parameter query my parameter genre which is like highly rock or electronics so it just fetches like a hundred tracks uh puts them in an array and then it's like a random function that pretty much just picks uh any element out of this array uh and puts that as the current playing track uh and then if you use the shuffle button or if you like to manually say you listen for like five seconds and you're like i don't like this song so you just hit hit each shuffle and it just gives you another next random uh from that same array or when the unended event hits um the player itself will actually like call that same random function so it's basically it's very primitive implemented at this stage but uh yeah well i definitely appreciate that you're giving you're allowing artists an additional channel and medium to express their creativity and to potentially reach more um audiences so thank you very much for sharing that with us yeah thanks and welcome back to uh hackathons yeah man great job great job brass cheers thank you team shill with audi's api we'll now be moving on to team checkout fs please share your screen when you're ready and i will begin your four minutes whenever you are ready hello how's it going guys hey chris nice to meet you good hi chris how are you should i just jump into it or what's the format and then you just jump right in yeah if you have a video to play if you've recorded a video you can play that or if you don't have a video then you can just talk live for four minutes and then after that we'll do three minute q a sweet uh i have a video so let's just go with that all right my name is chris and for the hack fs challenge i put together an app called checkout fs now some of you may be familiar with the app called shopify and what shopify really excels at is enabling anyone anywhere in the world to create a product page without necessarily knowing how to code or being able to check out uh or set up a checkout system now shopify works well for a lot of use cases but it has its drawbacks in particular you're paying a subscription fee every month regardless of volume to host your website credit card fees happen on every transaction which are variable and might have a indeterminate turnaround time for you to get paid crypto allows you to get paid faster and potentially with lower fees lastly any sas vendor is also highly centralized and can be attacked or suffer an outage so we wanted to create a platform using some of the newer technologies like filecoin to avoid some of these issues so what i want to do is create a very easy platform to enable anybody to create an instant checkout experience without necessarily signing up for a centralized platform company and be able to accept cryptocurrency as the primary payment let me show you how this works so i'm already logged in with my ethereum account on the testnet i can go ahead and create an example storefront uh what products are going to be in my store so i can upload multiple images but i have this example of sunglasses and what what happens is when i upload it it's going to connect to ipfs and store those assets and that metadata using ceramic streams to facilitate and render any checkout page that was created with this app so i'm just going to enter in some example data and set the price at 0.01 click done give it a few minutes ipfs and filecoin are really at the core of this and after this is completed you'll take note that there's a bunch of data lists here but in particular we want to take a note of the cid and the ipfs url so the ipfs url is essentially the storage for this particular storefront that was created that image that i uploaded as well as the metadata are there for the stream id if you take the cid and go to the embed page you can generate a qr code that is scannable and would take any user to be able to access your storefront and images but let me show you how that storefront looks like based on the data that i uploaded give it a few moments you can see that images that the image or the multiple images in the case of the multiple items and the ability to purchase any of those items to send them to this url so purchase now uh this is using unlock protocol which enables anybody that visits this page so if i logged out and connected with a customer's account i can check out with my wallet and go through any sort of digital process to collect the address and ultimately send those sunglasses lastly for any business that doesn't necessarily have a wallet uh we use etherspot to verify that their wallet is ready to go and they're able to accept humans so uh pillar is the primary facilitator for that but it could also be used to send payments during that checkout screen i just showed lastly we want to be able to use checkout fs for any sort of digital sales as well so obviously we are leveraging uh with a playlist id instead of a cid and if i click that that cid is actually pulled against their api and we now have a playlist that people can purchase and check out just like before but for music and digital files now all that code there is uh available on my github i encourage you to check it out but that's pretty much check out fs project and thanks for your time thank you we'll now be moving on to your three minutes where um the judges for q a and feedback i forgot whose turn is it jeff i think it's yours i think it's yours yeah yeah i got it cool awesome chris super cool um yeah um so um i'm part of a blockchain fund and we've been looking at a lot of deals where they're trying to make it easier for people to integrate which shopify um to really basically remove the friction of people purchasing nfts whether it's music files or merchandises leveraging existing infrastructure so i think this idea is fantastic it is definitely very much needed for wider adoption so thank you for tackling this problem very interesting cool yeah and i would say just just on that um i i think that we're trying to tackle e-commerce cryptocurrency lower the fees with credit cards uh compared to that i think credit cards do serve a valid purpose like for for sort of like buyer confidence in case there is fraud and things like that um so initially this platform could be used you know with nft digital assets but ultimately expand into physical things if you were collecting addresses to mail to mail these sort of uh products but i think ipfs actually is pretty useful to provide a platform to host all of these things in a distributed nature such that you don't have a single source of failure because i think that is a a big proponent of like decentralized model over uh you know your single entity kind of owning everything and sorry just to follow up on that then how would you would you is it something that you want to move forward with as a potential business idea um what did what did you come out what did you get out of this experience yeah so i i to further develop this idea i definitely need more backup like i think i'm good at prototyping like i can build uis and stuff like that um but the initial concept would probably be similar to in flavor to what you were talking about with uh nfts and digital digital products but be a no-code platform as well i think that's starting to pick up popularity um so that would be the first the first step is to just make it work with music digital files and then expand into uh physical products potentially where anybody can shut up a storefront cool very cool um if you ever do you want to take this forward um do check out like the different foundations of different protocols they have a lot of grants so if you want to build this marketplace on flow for example um you can definitely check out for some additional resources support sweet hey chris uh great great work just just super fast question for me you know um in e-commerce right oftentimes you want to update like the metadata related to an item uh its description or price or even like we're no longer selling this version of it how would that work in a kind of the you know with ipfs and immutable storage like how might you solve that in the future yeah so um that was actually a very a problem that i ran into while i was building this is uh the example for ipfs had like storing json data where you would upload a json file and it would just be like a raw object yeah uh ceramic worked great uh actually to solve that problem in the form of a stream because that's actually mutable and we can mutate the stream for a given cid so the cid was the lookup key for the storefront so every storefront would be identified by a cid and it could have a custom domain on ipns i didn't demo that but you could set up custom domains for the storefronts and then ceramic actually would hold potentially inventory uh the description of the product uh and things like that more or less like a distributed store um but ipfs was purely just for all the visual uh files and documents associated with the products got it got it yeah that makes sense again great work great thank you team check out fs we'll now be moving on to team project infinity when you're right please please share your screen hi this is project infiniti my name is victor and i worked on this project as a solo developer i built an application that allowed users to create nfts within nfts allowing users to traverse through portals of collective nfts so how does it work well the user can select a block mentor block and enter blocks to make more nfts here's a quick demo you the project was bootstrapped from scaffolding and uses nft storage to store and retrieve data from the ipfs network things we might have in the future payment options and different tokens social features customization and deployment menu if you like our project you can check it out on github in the link above thank you okay your three minutes with the judges for q and feedback begins now uh this is super cool uh victor it's it's like one of those um ideas that's like so simple uh looking but just turns mesmerizing for me so quickly um and um it reminds me i mean like the first thing that came to mind is that there's like pixel matrixes matrices like there's one on reddit a few years ago where you can like change change pixels and and it like eventually gets stuck in in some shape at the end and i think there's another one that's going on right now on as an nft i like this sort of like interactive like community social feature where you go down this rabbit hole of like what's the next one gonna be or it's almost like a choose your own adventure book if you're if you're familiar with those i can also see artists using this for like very creative things like you draw you know it's almost turned into like a story or a narrative and like exploring like you know the different aspects of it and you know you could do things like all the pixels of the same color or similar color but like where's the hidden one to take you to the next um you know the next the next uh uh the next um step so yeah uh very very cool um like what of those sort of like four things that you mentioned at the end for like next step like what do you think with the top one be and where what would you where would you go with this i think you're muted i think the next step would really be integrating it with um social profiles so if you've heard of the concept of um kevin kelly's a thousand true fans um i don't know that yes yeah it's a thesis or concept that a creator only needs a thousand supporters to actually be financially sustainable to pursue their passions so for any creator who has some level of influence they should be able to have the online communities contribute to one of these portals or blocks that they've created so you'd have the communities developing whatever comes to their mind whatever ideas whatever imaginations or creations that they come up with and it's really up to the communities decide um how this thing pieces together so like there's endless possibilities um you could have um things for events fundraisers um or just social profiles in general but if you can even try to be even more imaginative and think about like um how this could be applicable to things like the metaverse for example if you see um websites like um cryptovoxels for example you have um many ghost towns where um there aren't really any communities filling these different um land parcels that are being created and there's um [Music] these nfc galleries that are actually popping up in the middle verse as well so you can think of it as like a place where people could actually like link a um 2d portal of these blocks to somewhere in the midverse and actually be able to teleport between different locations within these nfts in those places so um yeah it's really um endless possibilities from there wonderful very cool so sophia over to you yeah i was going to ask you for for you to clarify what does it mean by um to trans to traverse through different protocols and i think you just answered it so if you were to build like an ecosystem partnership or transfers to a different protocol what would that be or if you have like a particular nft slash gaming type of startups that you like could you name a couple that if you were to take this project to actualization that you would love to partner with right um i think at the moment we probably just want to um keep it with within our ecosystem so um i kind of already have like a different startup that i'm working on as well and i want to integrate it into my existing platform and then um kind of collaborate with more um individual creators to adopt this kind of um technology and then start experimenting with what kind of creations that they can make from there and then from there on we could possibly um partner with you know um metaverse companies that need an entry point into um nft art galleries and things like that so there's um various decimal things to start exploring would you say this portal was more of like mobile-based or would it be a web-based how do you see it being carried around or you know how do you see people using it right um i think at the moment it's probably more web-based because it's more accessible so you'll be able to um you know somebody could share it on like twitter or one of their social profiles and then um jump into one of these creations and then keep like exploring different creations within that um uh yeah there's really no limits thank you very much for sharing this much appreciate your time and effort it's very cool yeah thank you victor thanks okay so we'll be moving on to our final team see if they're responsive um team yoss if this is your last chance to present in front of the judges and get that feedback we'll give it maybe like 30 seconds and they don't respond judges are you comfortable with um hosting oh never mind ask the question after they present so please raise your hand so we could promote you as panelists and please start sharing your screen when you are ready alejandra we can't hear you or the video just fyi if you want to try and you know i think you're muted uh to start and i don't i don't know if you're playing a video or um just showing you pbs can you can you see it now okay yeah we can see and hear you now okay perfect excellent um so yes so perfect so i am alejandra and um my background is actually so i'm a little bit kind of like in the in the realm of like sofia that is like i'm actually trying to train myself and to learn how to code just like still really understand like the technology behind it i've been more obviously like involved always like in strategy and and uh and in the product development so um i've been solo hacking this summer just for kind of fun um so in short what i wanted to build um for this um i wanted to so um even like the the sponsors that we that we had the opportunity to like collaborate with um i was thinking how can we empower and um what is the problem so the problem that i was trying to address is um the centralization of an artist so artists are artists and they're supposed to be creative by the way i'm not an artist but i i leave for art like so but so it's it's so for me it's like it feels like they are curated they are managed they are so they just feel like they they're they're not the ones that are always like being able to even have be in control so um i'm also um i believe in entrepreneurship so i was thinking well how about empowering by the power of like either a co-op in addition to um like power of negotiation together to manage a business so burning a small business where you're like an artist or anybody it could be fairly difficult so um the solution for the entrepreneurial economy then um i was prepa i proposed um the like a appear to like a peer-to-peer creator-to-peer relationship where the value um you think of lifestyle value of the relationship and not only the relationship of the asset so now instead of being like a middle person is like the actual nft that is getting accreted with value by different interactions so uh i was looking at like the data how it gets like transaction caches additional data fields that could be uh proposed and uh thinking about like ways to enhance the data so that you could actually track that information and know that in the lifetime value of when i was holding that nft in addition to that and that i participated in an event or i or or even i did borrow or lend or whichever transaction so it the the whole providence becomes a true provenance of everything that happens in the life of the nfd um so and i created with like um the the create like of mine in particular for like uh the woman's in crypto art just because um i was working on another project and then since i'm a rookie at that study i know that like last minute you can use the same project as before so i had to i came up with another one which was i was very happy that i had something else that i was going to do later in the summer so oh and let me walk you really quick so design principles decentralized scalable affordable sexible um what i was aiming for is like look what how it benefits the creator um considerations i was thinking from like idx to ceramic so uh so the security of the data so everything that they have is ip right so it's like is that intellectual property is uh how do we make sure that goes i mean you can't really reach file coin non-encrypted because then you can encrypt it when it reaches there so really understanding like the flow of the data the security that it needed to be like the persistence and understanding even the pinning along to the way like what you well what is required um again next steps for me will be um i loved a lot of the people i heard today because i could see a lot of like the like the e-commerce so for example so what i'm proposing here is like each person in this web in this dab is like um each creator can have like their website that has like a store and it's 24 7 so it's like 24 7 global access um in addition to that um is um you you um so in addition to the store as a gallery you can start thinking of partnerships as well i always think of like it's always like in addition to and not like versus and against so i i actually have not that one tv but something very similar from like samsung frame so and and samsung is like also very big in like while a digital while it's in crypto so i was thinking well how will it be to be like you as an artist and you're the business then you could also have partnerships with like other type of businesses even though the model for this is like purely decentralized it's like having that flexibility to uh collaborate as well the same thing for merchandise is like you could have like supply chain uh without having to have the inventory at hand just be an on-demand it's like oh i want to create that nft of the artist i want to have the hat the t-shirt or whichever things that you want and the idea will be personalizing and and this will have this um this this um images are like 3d um galleries so you could actually do even virtual reality as well so they're pretty cool so they're for somebody more technical than me they have apis that you can integrate it for me so but i was thinking of that entire experience from from protecting the data from having a way for the artists to be empowered to curate the experience to um enrich the experience to have real data that is not just number of dollar amount sold but it's just the additional value of the true artist thank you so i'm sorry to cut you off but you are two minutes over time and i want to start there for the other teams um so we'll be moving on to the three-minute feedback and q a with judges starting right now um well thank you so much for sharing this i totally hear you on the whole partnership and creating that ecosystem and empowering people to create these experiences artworks um to enrich our lives and i think that that's something i think that's part of the reason why i'm i'm in the world of crypto is is to help bring people together um hope to make some tangible impact and how we change and live and appreciate our lives so thank you very much for sharing this um i don't have any questions but i i really appreciate you taking the time to share with us how you envision um you know your your your uh your creativity well yeah well right thanks yeah great it's inspiring to hear alejandra you know thank you thank you for sharing and and um you know kudos to you on on getting uh involved and learning uh about uh development as well you know i guess what what could the what could the web3 community do to make that even easier like as you're learning about it as you're as you're coming into it so you talked about some of the tech stack here but like you know what what how how could how could we as a community i mean all of us help oh that's that's very kind but like i think that um i'm a very self-starter like i teach myself so it's like i i have like and the super when i appreciate my help like if you had to ask me uh i think that the one thing that i will say is um what's new to me so i'm coming from corporate for like um for a long time and uh so for me there's a lot of new things in the ecosystem so um i think those that's what i'm going to be focusing on next for me is going to be like how does the ground like i'm i've been in academia just like when i was in school but i never uh targeted grants or never um i've been considering i have like four ideas right now that i'm kind of cooking and i'm trying to see which one is the one that has legs and uh i think that they almost i want to clone myself because i think they almost have like they will have legs so i just have to see how that path of like how do you get grants how do you apply to grants that is very new to me because i come from the world of corporates and um so that's great that's great feedback yeah and i i was i was speaking more of uh how how could we help as in what additional resources could there be for somebody who's in self-starter uh but but i think i think your your your answer on like grants and help with applying for grants because there's a ton of grants out there to your point right and and sometimes i know we've applied for some in the past they they're sometimes in like a little bit hard or inaccessible so that's that's a really good uh point um and and you know thanks for your comments on that again great work best of luck uh on on continuing to explore in this space and uh um yeah i look forward to seeing to following you and seeing what great things you're going to do thank you thank you so much for your presentation so judges i now have a question for you so team five token from before had technical difficulties and was not able to hear their feedback and they have stayed this entire time um and we're wondering yeah it's no problem there's no quantum pattern absolutely absolutely perfect thank you so um if we could invite up five token once again to have your three minutes and then we could close a session and yeah thank you for staying all this time hello hey thank you no thank you for staying this whole time wow i'm glad we can hear you now it's our problem first so i think it's it's very important to stay all the time and uh shall i uh repeat your question or should i just answer answer about your question before or you have any new ideas or you new opinions that you you want to share yeah if you uh could share your feedback on what was asked as a starting point that'd be really helpful yeah i think your first question is why we choose firecone to be the base technical of our products because firstly uh the former version of uh five token is fico wallet we have a kind of three years experience in developed bicone wallet to help provide with a professional service to the miners but actually we have catched the trends of web3 and we think there is a kind of lag products that can contain different service including identity payment and the reputation system so we want to move forward to this step and i think uh five will have a very mature system to keep all the id and the data be safe and internally on the line so we think the technology is what we have confidence in so we choose this one yeah gotcha yeah i know filecoin has quite a large ecosystem of projects and developers building on top of it and therefore you'll be able to have you know access to resources and and support um as you continue to build so thank you for the for the context yeah yeah thank you and also i want to i want to look at it is we we although we're based on fico ecosystem but we'd like to uh get involved with different blockchains including dfinity uh ethereum also and we want to uh add the smart contract features of ethereum in our network to perfume or have a con comprehensive service of the whole five token so uh it will be a start of our long term roadmap yeah why do you choose dfinity or why don't you mention dfinity first why not solana why not matic or polygon um or harmony or cosmos um that would be kind of two reasons the first thing is we have a kind of connection with dfinity and we have read about their whole whole system um we think if there is a big band of applications dfinity will be definitely a good choice compared with other ones so it will be quite efficient to develop any kind of different apps so we just choose this kind of network to our network but if we uh collect different feedback from our customers and we'd like to get involved with different blockchains also because we have a plan to develop our rpc networks and the customers can choose their supported blockchain in our system by themselves yeah that's a really good feature yeah i'm just to share um what i've seen from from my line of work so i work at a blockchain fund and we fund startups that build different products and services and different protocols so for us we've seen an increased interest in activity around the solata ecosystem polygon and um a dot as well so i was quite surprised to hear dfinity because that's not really on a radar um just because the projects that we look at are mostly building on those those three uh protocols yeah thank you um yeah i don't have any additional questions uh they just just great work um yeah very interested to see where you go from here and and um you know how you bring your file code and your your extensive file coin experience into the web3 ecosystem so you're taking a look at the chrome extension you put together and and uh yeah yeah continue to check it out great work thank you i have a question for kalyn if faye can stick around so if the um startups want to get in touch with us afterwards or vice versa is there a way for us to connect yes so um after this session you'll be receiving an email regarding any further steps from kartik and in that email you could always respond to him asking about the particular startups like in your roster of point tallies then you could try to get in touch with them through him and i'm sure you could figure out the next steps from there through kartik i think that is very possible okay great thank you very much very nice meeting you faye and thank you for uh staying all this time yeah thank you for sticking around great to speak with you great great to meet you thank you so much um so thank you hackers for participating in hack fest and thank you judges for your time and everybody's patience um this is pretty much over so follow up with kartik after you'll receive an email and will notify that this session is over thank you once again great thank you so much thank you again hope you get some rest yeah have a great day everyone have a great evening bye-bye
