foreign [Applause] [Music] to talk about how do we actually help more people get onboarded into web3 through down participation so uh welcome and uh excited to have you uh here at the summit thank you so much for the intro um hello everyone I'm just gonna get my slides shared here and presented and then we're ready to go everything so hopefully everyone can see my screen but welcome so I'll be chatting about the web 3D Balancing Act which is pretty common in blockchain and web3 to be balancing a bunch of different projects at once and I just want to talk a little bit more about why you might want to do that and how that can actually benefit you in your career in participating in Dallas or launching other projects in blockchain so just introducing myself who am I why am I talking about this so I am Daphne and I'm a governor of blue Dao and I'm going to talk a little bit more about blue dial later but um basically we Empower women web 3 and we love to sponsor talented Builders to attend um hackathons and especially equal hackathons um I'm also the co-founder of black leaders Dao so really passionate about diversity equity and inclusion in the web free space um I'm a startup founder of key week which I actually launched at the East Mexico City hackathon and I'm a senior software engineer a hackathon veteran so good luck to everyone in their hackathon projects I've been there before and I know how stressful it can be but I think East Global does an amazing job with all the speakers and panelists that they're able to share knowledge with you um and yeah just some things like doing on the side is I love to travel and I'm a cat lover so I have a cat named baby he's 12 years old and adorable and yeah so you might be thinking that is a lot going on like how are you doing so many things at once I know it sounds crazy um how do I do this and more importantly on that why am I interested in in doing all these things um and yeah let's dive right into it so I just want to talk about the beauty of dows and participating in daos so I think most people maybe they've seen kind of the textbook definition of dows um you know decentralized autonomous organizations you know on-chain voting governance all those things and that's great that's a great way to to look at things um but I like to um visualize daos as being like living pieces of Art and where every member of a Dao is contributing and putting the pieces together to contribute to um to the unity and to the overall mission of that Dao and I think that's a really fun way to to look at it and in pieces of art you have you know all these different colors and textures and materials that went into creating that piece of art and that's how I look at Dao's Dao's being a diverse community group where people can come together and rally around you know one specific thing that you know we want to solve in the world one specific problem that we all really care about and that we all really want to see solutions to and so that's how I think of Dao's um and there's a lot of different types of dows out there that you can get involved with um there's Dows more on the technical side of things doing um you know D5 protocols refi things there's media Dows focused on you know news and articles and podcasts which are super fun like bankless um there are social Dows there's you know FWB board ape of course we know these these communities quite well and then there are more dials on the social impact and philanthropy side of things and that is the category that I love and I'm really passionate about making a real impact on people and communities and especially in local communities and so that's the categories that blue Dao and black leader style fall under and so I definitely urge everyone who maybe hasn't already participated in a dow to to do some research and check out what's available for you I think you know in joining a dow you really kind of have to see what is the best fit for you and you know are the the values of that Dow aligned with yours I think that's a really important part because um I'll talk about this a bit later but when you join a Dao as a member you know maybe you don't have that much responsibility but if you want to move upwards in the in the chain the down chain as um becoming a contributor or a co-lead or core team um then you can really see uh how important having matching values is because um you know sometimes at the bottom level things seem okay but you know further than top level things might get a little bit hectic and a little bit messy so it's really important to find a community that you're passionate about and so that is what I found luckily in blue Dao so diving right into that what is blue Dow so for those of you who are not aware um blue Dao is on a mission to empower women in web 3 to Achieve Financial Freedom by building their careers in this space and we're all about making the impossible possible and so we believe if you have a goal an idea a project that you want to launch we believe that it's possible and we want to help you out in any way to get you to that place and we're a all-inclusive and intersectional women focused owl but everyone is welcome to participate in blue so allies are definitely very welcome of course non-binary people and you know however you identify you are welcome at Blue um and with that our three mandates are learn earn and play so these mandates actually tie um quite well with the programs that we're excited to be launching over this year and next year so some highlights of blue Dow just at a glance so you can see how we're currently structured and the things that we're accomplishing so we have over 850 Dow members around the world and growing rapidly which is amazing and we also have 40 core team members and that is a mixture of what we would call contributors and co-leads and we kind of divide our Dao rules up by the number of hours that you can or are willing to contribute to the Dow itself and so co-leads is about you know 10 20 hours a week and contributors is around five to ten hours a week um at a glance we have around 4K followers on social media and we've sent over 150 women at this point to hackathons all around the world which we are so ecstatic and proud of um it uh has made a big impact on a lot of women and we've been able to kind of get rid of the stigma that hackathons are only for developers and only for technical technical people and only for certain demographics of people and you know that's simply not true and that's definitely a message that we're trying to push at out there um we've sent over 25 hackathon teams out there um our hackers really love our program and our Hands-On mentorship and coaching that we're able to provide and we are Global so we have uh communities and core team members All Around the World in Latin America Europe Asia Africa and some really cool Street teams in some of the major cities in the USA as well of course and with our mission we're actually building out one main program which is called our blue Builders program and I'll actually touch on that later towards the end but this is meant to be our end-to-end ecosystem to support an individual's of metamorphosis in web3 so you know blue Dao our our mascot is a butterfly and we essentially want to help people you know grow from this egg phase where they don't really know what they're doing in web 3 on to becoming caterpillar and then into a cocoon and then to a butterfly and we have programs to support each step of that and so yeah we're really excited about that and my participation in blue Dow has honestly been a whirlwind journey and I wanted to share this with you all just so you can kind of see where doubt participation can actually take you and what Dows can help you with uh depending on what industry you're in so blue Dow actually we started just in February of this year and we've grown a lot since then um but my particular Journey with blue started in March where I was selected to be a blue Dow hacker at ethereo and this was my first time ever attending and competing into web 3 hackathon and I honestly didn't really know what I was doing but the community at Blue kind of welcomed me with open arms and were able to teach and Mentor me along the way and I think what's what's cool is that um you know our dial recognizes that learning happens in in phases right you don't just um you know step by step get to where you're going you might have to backtrack in some places you might you know go forward and then hit a roadblock and that's all okay and uh blue dials really um understanding of that as well um and in March at ethereum Rio I was able to co-found um black leaders Dao along with um a lot of the amazing Brazilian Community there and that was my first time ever co-founding a project in web3 and I learned a lot from that experience and following that in April um I actually decided to join onto the blue dial core team because I saw the work that they were doing and the impact they were having in different communities and I wanted to be a part of that and one thing I did want to highlight is that um what's cool about like participating in Dallas right now is dowels are so new as an organization type that you can kind of be the leader of your your story the leader of your journey and in that you can start to become a leader in that Dao story as well and change the direction of what that Dao is doing and what that Dao's mission is and I think that's a really cool opportunity that isn't um maybe that well known in terms of dows but um it allows you to become a leader in whatever respect that it looks like for you and in joining the blue dot core team in April um I was given the task to lead our youth Amsterdam trip and that ended with great success and we had one of our hack teams be um a finalists at that event which was crazy and super super exciting um and so every step along in this journey with blue Dao and just individually myself I'm kind of realizing that with every problem that we're solving with every kind of mission that we're accomplishing for our community for women in web 3 a new problem arises so again the journey is not linear the journey is about going back and reiterating and seeing what works seeing how you can improve on that and then going back at it and trying to to solve those problems and we've really been able to do that throughout this year um later in may we had another blue hacks program at activate Wormhole a lot more winning projects there um moved on to nftnyc and East New York in June um a lot of success there with our hackers and then we hit a a little bit of a pause in our in our Dow structure and our Dow roadmap and we were able to kind of have a big core team meeting here in July where we reiterated on our roadmap and redefined what success looks like for our members um because being part of a dial core team is really about learning from your members who you know if we were a product our members would be our users right but our product is our community our product is our Dao and so we want to learn from our members and their Journeys and what challenges they're having and a lot of the things that we learned throughout the first couple months of this year is that you know people you know are excited to get into web 3 they want to be on board to web3 but okay now they know a little bit about web3 what are the paths that they can take what are the final destinations that people can arrive at and people needed more clarity in those areas and in discovering that we decided to um build the blue Builders program which I'll talk I'll touch on later so July was a big step to kind of redefine um the path of our Dao um then later in August we moved on to East Mexico City again very successful program we had quite a few teams being finalists and other teams winning multiple bounties and then this is where I personally co-founded my own startup called kiweek and um that has been another Journey all on its own and that has also provided a lot of great teachings and learnings and we discovered that there's you know kind of too clear career paths in in web3 you can kind of be you know more on the technical side developer or just looking for for a job at a web food company right or you could be more on the founders path wanting to launch your own thing or maybe you already have your own business or idea or project in web 2 and you kind of just want to transition that into web3 and so uh me myself I saw those two clear paths defined and I brought that into blue and I said hey this is what I've experienced this is what a lot of other other members in Blue Dot have experienced how can we work this into the roadmap and that is how um our blue Builders program has been accelerated since then um and now that brings us to September so um our blue boot camp which is the second step of our Billy's program is forming secretly Under Wraps um we're iterating on that and we're really excited to hopefully launch that by the end of this year and we're also going to be hosting blue merch parties around the world so in New York in LA in Ottawa Mexico Argentina um maybe a few other cities in there um definitely uh check us out and get involved if you would like uh and then finally next month we are embarking on a journey to eth Bogota and Devcon for another blue hacks program which our applications are actually still open for that program and so with this journey with my Dow journey in in web 3 with blue Dao you know what was the purpose of doing all that what's what was the purpose of you know founding all these projects becoming a startup founding doing this and downs doing that well the purpose is you get all these amazing benefits by participating in Dows and the number one benefit that I want to touch on first is the human capital aspect of dial participation so as being part of a dow because um like I mentioned earlier it's such a new category of business organization um it's still quite small the web3 space is still still quite small and so by becoming a leader in a dow you are carving out your space in the industry and um basically allow yourself to become industry leader uh by putting on all these amazing programs that help to support your missions your Dao's Mission um and I have seen firsthand the power of human capital the power of human connection and where that can get you so um you know meeting one person can kind of open so many doors for you in in web 3 and I definitely don't want that to be understated so definitely join whatever Community is calling out to you and see how you can make those connections work towards your personal missions and your personal career goals um second benefit of participating in a dow would be that you get to grow expertise and you actually get to grow expertise in areas that maybe you would never have considered so like me for example you know I'm a software engineer mainly just been doing coding for the entirety of my career but with blue Dow I saw an opportunity to actually lead Partnerships and did I know anything about Partnerships before I decided to do that no but I got to learn along the way and I think that's such a cool thing that you know in your free time you can build expertise in a different role and this is what I love about web 3 and dial participation is that you know in more traditional work environments you're kind of siled in in your role in what you do if you're a software engineer you know you're a software engineer maybe you transition to product management or Engineering Management but you don't really really go outside of that that would you know take you know maybe going back to University or getting a certificate in order to transition into a different field but because Dows and the way they're organized are so flexible you're able to take on ownership in areas that maybe you never thought you could and I think that's really really cool so contributing to a dial is a little bit like building a startup because you will wear many different hats and you will work with a lot of different teams and individuals who are trying to contribute to the same Mission you are and you all have to come together and figure that out and I think that coordination is beautiful another benefit of participating in a dow would be token nft and Equity rewards so at Blue Dow we do have our own native token we have our blue OG tokens who for people who are contributing to us early um and I think it's really cool that uh you're able to earn a type of income a type of equity type of stock in an organization that you really are passionate about and you really believe in and so I think that is uh something that is really cool tokenomic certainly as a region you know needs a lot more research but there are experts that can can help in that respect and one cool thing I wanted to mention here is that with blue Dao um as we're taking on new contributors throughout this year we have begun to go open up spots on our co-founding team to anyone who becomes a co-lead by the end of the year and our main goal with that is basically to have blue Dow be owned by everyone who who made it you know not just you know maybe the two people in the beginning who had the idea but the people who were there in the initial stages that really made ardao what it is and so I think that's really cool I think opportunities similar to that also exists in other doubts um yeah and then the last benefit I did want to touch on as well is uh participating in Dows uh can be quite quite crazy quite hectic I will say it's not for everyone but it's definitely worthwhile and to me the thing that makes it the most worthwhile is that you get to make lifelong friends along the way and for me with blue dye I think it's been incredible that now my closest friends are people who don't even live in the same city as me um you know they're people that I work closely with online trying to put together our programs there are people I see maybe you know once every other month when we're putting on our programs in different cities um but I've been able to create really incredible and intimate bonds with people that I haven't experienced in web 2 to be honest and um yeah there's something about web3 that makes people really want to connect on a deeper deeper level with each other and I think that is absolutely fantastic so those are the benefits of contributing to a Dao and the benefits that I've seen throughout my journey with blue Dow and all of this effort all of these benefits have culminated in what I would love to introduce to the crowd as our blue Builders program and this is the program that we are launching over this year and next year to again support an individual's metamorphosis in web3 and because we are so passionate and that we believing that anyone can accomplish whatever they put their mind to and that limiting beliefs should not exist as part of our bowel so um the first step in our blue Builders program is our blue hacks program and that is the program that we've been running throughout this um year that's kind of what we're known for is being able to onboard and educate people who have no knowledge of web3 but coach and Mentor them during a web free hackathon and essentially enable them to be winners and finalists and Bounty winners of that said hackathon and so we have programs all around the world mainly following the youth Global hackathon schedule um and we do have applications open for our uh eth Bogota and Defcon open so definitely check it check that out um you can find that on our Twitter as well now again in building our outer blue hacks program we we felt that you know it was a great program but what's next what is after that you know our members were looking for more Stepping Stones to continue their journey in web 3. and these are the programs that kind of hit all of our members needs and desires and the Second Step which is the caterpillar phase of our blue Builders program is our blue boot camp and this is something we're really excited to be launching by the end of this year it's going to be a four to six week cohort based educational program for both non-technical and Technical individuals in web 3 to learn the basics web3 learn the basics of blockchain and onboard into web3 in a more Academic Way and be able to earn certificates and nft badges that serve as their proof of skill proof of knowledge um identifiers then after that we are launching our blue incubator program which is where we really want to help support uh local communities who you know maybe they already have an idea that works in web 2 and they're now exploring how blockchain Technologies and how cryptocurrency can integrate with their webview idea or it's an individual that you know maybe is just starting out in web 3 and wants to launch something in web 3 be a web 3 native project and our incubator program aims to turn those ideas into Venture scalable products and companies because it's one thing to be passionate about um you know web 3 passionate about your idea but it's another thing to actually turn that into a product an idea that is attractive to the VC industry and investors and that is what the incubator program is aimed at and that is the little cocoon phase then our last phase of our program is our blue accelerator program and this is where blue aims to be uh the provider of talented Builders first check we want to highlight and uplift underrepresented Builders and give them the capital that they need to keep building their projects and to also start putting together um the details that would give them that um really great opportunity to get investment so helping put putting together pitch tags cap tables incorporating as a startup all of those things we want to be the helping hand with that and that is our blue Builders program so definitely very excited to be launching this program this year and next year and yeah with that I kind of just wanted to highlight a few things so one like I mentioned throughout this talk our applications are all open if you would like to become a blue hacker and attend East Bogota with us and Devcon with us so you can go to Blue Dow on Twitter to check that out all the links are actually in this QR code if you want to check it out um and blue dial is also live on bitcoin so if you want to support a lot of great communities in web 3 who are doing you know diversity Equity inclusion work you can go to gitcoin and support blue Dao you can go and get coin and support women in web 3 surge women metagamma Delta minority programmers 40 acres now there's just so many incredible projects that are looking for the funding to be able to put on programs that help uh underrepresented underrepresented Builders similar to what blue dot does with our blue Builders program so definitely contribute if you can even a dollar five dollars ten dollars helps it's all about the power of community and how many people actually are backing your mission rather than the amount of the donation so definitely check out get coin and learn more about quadratic voting and yeah I am on Twitter at davichar if you want to talk more if you're interested in blue if you're interested in contributing to Blue feel free to send me a DM and reach out I'd be more than happy to talk to you and yes they rode to Defcon is in full effect so definitely join us in our journey to there where we have a lot of exciting events planned so that's all I have for you today thank you all so much for having me awesome well thank you for that uh amazing talk um we had a couple questions um I think we have a little bit of time for and then we can uh start with the next talk but um kind of speaking of coordination can you talk about how decisions are made at uh kind of your Dao and sort of what the process is how it's structured how has it changed um maybe just good to get a few more insights in there yeah absolutely I think this is something that is continuing to change and evolve at Blue um but we do vote both off chain and on chain we vote off chain with snapshot and we vote on chain with Aragon and the structure of voting in our Dow right now is uh for major decisions it's for uh Governors and core teams and our wider contributor team um but we are hoping to put public votes out to our entire Community um quite soon that's just something we haven't figured out on how to scale and definitely open to to any tips there but it's something that's evolving and we're excited to to bring governance to The Wider community that's uh how uh maybe a little bit digging a little bit more how big is the the team that is usually voting on these things relative to kind of I think you said about 900 um I may have misheard but 900 were the members uh usually kind of how often are you doing uh votes and how often are uh I guess more like what's the the complexity of a decision that requires a vote versus people just kind of leading something yeah we honestly put things to votes when we can clearly see in our like core contributor chats that there is some um you know disconnect where people aren't agreeing and we're just like hey you know we're a Dao instead of this back and forth let's just put it to a vote let's just see what everyone thinks what is the consensus of this decision and so our poor team like I mentioned on a slide earlier we have about um 40 Main Quark contributors that are making bigger decisions for our wider community and we're definitely hoping to um open up voting and governance to everyone else soon awesome and then uh last question what are kind of some of the challenges that you're running into in terms of kind of growing uh the the community and uh you kind of talked about some of the things that you are doing but overall like how do you how do you count what successful growth is like is is a number to get to like 10 000 and that's what you would call good or is it like consistently growing or the quality like what do you actually measure um as you think about this community yeah that's a really interesting question because um I think at the Inception of our Dao we were thinking that you know we have this goal of sending a hundred a thousand hackers to web3 hackathons and then our mission would be complete and then maybe our Dao wouldn't need to exist anymore that's honestly what we were thinking in the beginning um but now as we've kind of dived deeper into providing these programs for our members we've realized that we would like the blue Builders program to be a program that lives on and uh with that that program has a lot of moving parts and so we do require um you know a large Court team to be able to pull those things off and so we're not trying to grow our Dao to like thousands and thousands of members but we are mainly trying to grow our core team and more people who are really passionate about leading our mission and uh the main challenge with that is getting keeping people engaged after our in-person events because people love our blue hacks program they love coming in person to hackathons but then after that maybe they fall off the wagon and they're busy and you know maybe the online method doesn't really work for them absolutely um awesome well thank you so much again and that was an amazing talk and uh if you're able to share the slide type will also make that available for our attendees and uh yeah I really appreciate this awesome thank you thank you see you in Bogota
