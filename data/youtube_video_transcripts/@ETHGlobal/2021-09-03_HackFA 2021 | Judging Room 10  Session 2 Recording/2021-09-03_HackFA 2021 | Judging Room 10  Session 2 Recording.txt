miracle uh hey hackers welcome to hackfest 2021 my name is abbas salami i'll be your mc for today's session and i'm here joined by kartik from youth global team and maddie who's going to be our zoom admin good day the this hack fest we have 650 hackers from 61 different countries in 18 different time zones all participating in a one month long hackathon for its global the judging format is simple each team will have four minutes to present their demos and after that we'll have three minutes for questions and after six or eighteen we'll have like a 10-minute break to you know regenerate after all those presentations judging criteria is also simple well the judges will be evaluating your technicality originality practicality ui uxbx and the wow factor of your presentation remember guys this is not a competition we're all here to learn explore what's possible and just so you guys know not everybody here has become aiming to become a business but we all are we but we are all here to get feedback and learn on the way we are judges we have james zaki from ethereum foundation and we have g meta from orca protocol let's get started with the demos so can team give me a second here canteen nets cpu hop on and presenter screens for the demo hello let me just see on the screen whenever you're ready hello everyone my name is sachin today i am delighted to present your project net cpr which is an all-in-one solution for your safe internet browsing experience cyber security has been a long-standing global issue that affects millions of people and countless businesses as we have seen during the pandemic there has been a rise in cyber threats ranging from adware malware to even phishing and scam attacks to counter these challenges we created net cpu to provide a safe internet browsing experience giving user insight on the websites they browse and allow them to categorize into safe or unsafe content we use blockchain based smart contract to store ratings for each websites and ipfs ceramic network for storing the metadata this enables them making information accessible for further analysis without any bottlenecks there is also a watcher uh which which checks whether about whether a particular vote is genuine or fake and scrapes the content of the website archiving it onto the ipfs network creating a snapshot of a particular review now let's see the demo so we have built our chromium extension using jquery bootstrap ethers ceramic api and we have also created uh a schema for storage of reviews um ended up deploying our smart contract to polymon test net uh somehow we were having issues with graph so we ended up deploying the graph on regular test net as well we've also got a scraping bot which is written in golang which describes the website based on review submitted and its content is pushed to ipfs network um after we have uh loaded an unpacked extension um working with it is as easy as flicking it up selecting a particular language um since i already have a mnemonic i'll get the wallet address uh submitting a review would include writing about this website and there are multiple categories and options to select the moment we proceed with submit we see that the ceramic api was being hit we got a stream id that we can copy our review submission was successful we can also check so this is the state of the particular steam id and we can also see the full screenshot for that particular and of the particular website and we can also see the the details about it so if we encounter a particular website which is kind of fake or scam we can go ahead and continue putting a review where we say it's a scam website it's a common website but it's not genuine it's a scam particularly might be fishing for information and we can submit that and that transaction will be going into the polygon testnet as well where we can also see the metadata hash for this is going to be a ceramic stream id so that was the demo um we aim to bring accountability to the domain and website owners to watch for harmful content and enable a safe browsing experience we want to gamify the voting and rewards option in encourage safe browsing experience in a community driven way so currently we have completed the voting and web archive functionality to spot fake and scam and biased content and we continue to work with our our stack to launch it in the main net and also integrate now and browser based vpns i was supported by steve and henry who helped us with smart contract development and back in uiux testing lastly i want to thank you for watching and we welcome you to join us in enabling safe and secure browsing experience thank you awesome great great presentation now we are going to the q a with the judges so three minutes on the clocks right now yeah this is great thanks for the presentation um i had a few quick questions so i'm not sure if you covered this but how do you sift through malicious reviews so we have got a bot which basically uh checks whether the domain is a valid domain and the domain is accessible so we're able to get the html content and uh for now there is no uh such uh nlp engine or any kind of engine which checks whether this particular content on the website is kind of scam or is it promoting hate or discrimination but later on we'll build that and as well there is a community option driven option where you can raise a dispute about an ft which is minted so of all the reviews you can see the list of all the websites uh which are scam or fake or are having descriptor jacking kind of a tag and you can see the list of the uh the entities which have admitted and also the reviewer can submit further analysis on why he feels that okay that makes sense and kind of on the other side of that uh what if the reviewer is trying to submit uh negative comments that aren't actually true about that particular website in terms of uh just giving false information so is there are there any checks and balances in that situation so um while you're submitting a review then of course i mean there are none but if you get three strikes like if they are getting three disputes which have not been resolved uh then you will basically be not allowed to submit any further reviews until you clear them management system uh which basically so you come in you will be able to submit 10 reviews a day and then later on yeah based on how would you have been performing your reviews that's right yeah so we got one minute um yeah so it's a nice flyby it's good to see uh yeah all the pieces come together for that using um your ipfs for the metadata as well as these nfts you're talking about um i guess along the same lines as um sorry question this question um like yeah what is there to stop sort of like civil attacks in it and i guess my question is more specifically what is your unique user like if someone's restricted per day um is that just based on an address and wants to stop someone from creating many addresses uh yeah so we will be having a verification so right during this hackathon we were thinking of integrating twitter just like how you do on uh mirror so just think like that you have to verify either with your social media account or anything like that for search and uh if we find that you're an unverified account and you are submitting to new reviews probably that's a one of the biggest know that you will have and later on uh this whole thing will be become like a portal where you can also stake your nfps where people can stick their nfps and other people could like that would be like acting like as a block list of sorts but loud risks great i think that's all for me cool great job team sorry i forgot uh nets appeal uh next up we'll be having team ethblox so whenever you guys are ready my mc my sorry my admin will promote you guys and feel free to share your screen hey everyone how's it going um i'm dylan from eblox uh and so i think uh still waiting on one more guy from my team to join sorry about that yeah sorry sorry uh real real if blocks yeah [Music] all right cool yeah okay um i'm just going to show my screen all right foreign hey everyone we're about to bring you a next generation social network first of all this idea is brought to life by the three of us chad palm and myself i'm a year one college undergraduate and developer on the team chad is our team's coordinator and developer and palms developer as well as a hated nfd collector we wanted to explore the boundaries of integrating decentralization to a social media space if it's actually necessary are we familiar with facebook and twitter but we're not about to build a massive social media webpage we wanted to have our own space in a social media industry without the noise as well as to give nft collectors their own space to discuss their nfts we believe that this is an innovation like no other well we are a long way from a finished product but here's a demo to demonstrate our prototype so here we're on the main webpage of our site and the main feature is that each nft will have a unique chat room powered by combo space you're free to join any chat room of your choice as long as you have the eve address of a fan owner of the token and here are some featured chat rooms that you would like to explore before moving on to the rest of the application so here is a discover page where you can discover featured collections here's a chat room where you can talk to anyone and everyone so let's get started shall we um we're gonna just create a new account sorry we're just gonna connect our wallet um you can either connect your wallet or search for an address um but here we're gonna collect the wallet so first a user will connect to a profile or search usage address if you have seen now at the collections page you can either view your ethereum collections or polygon collections a selling point here is that collections and nfps have their individual chat rooms you can create and edit custom descriptions of the nfps using a did of your own which is mapped to your eve address and hence your custom description these global descriptions can be viewed by anyone who searches your collection so here is a description to enable all walls and when you edit the description you'll be greeted by this page and over here it also says this is encryption all walls so you have to authenticate on the authenticate and create a did of your own in order to create customized descriptions for your nfps so basically when you have the ability to converse with another on a particular nft the possibilities are just endless so here's how we built it now the front end is being built with nexus react and no the chat rooms are powered by combo space the ui by material ui and ui neomorphism for the backend covalent openc api access we use these applications to query nft metadata for the images etc and the custom descriptions are built with ceramic and idx always private is also hosted and published with flick so moving on what's next for us we intend to have user profiles powered by ceramic giving users to link their dids to a plot to a profile um we also intend to incentivize users to use this platform um by having our limited collections which are currently in development using nfp storage so because this is a social app what's the social app without notifications from your friends right so we intend to implement ets as well in the future now there's so much more planned such as friends and groups but due to the time that we have all i can say is that there's a famous executive day involved so do look out for what's next and thank you for your time awesome job so now we'll be going over to the q a with the judges so whenever you guys are ready yeah no great projects um yeah i was just thinking with the uh nfts how um how do people start with the discovery part how do they know which nfts are uh have their social media attached to them um so basically if you uh um so from this from from when you enter the webpage uh your user and you connect your wallet so uh a check room will be automatically assigned to an nfc so the moment that you create a wallet so you connect your account or search up an address uh it will basically uh so this application platform that we're using combo space we've actually managed to link nfts using a trend id for the conversations the chat rooms so every nft would have a chat room for them yeah regardless this also includes collections yeah great how do you kind of imagine incentives working on your platform what's the user incentive to share their collection is it bragging right bragging rights or what are you incentivizing these as well uh yeah i think pretty much bragging rights uh also as a platform to talk about the collection talk about nfts um the reason we created this application in first place was because we felt that a lot of entities are moving to discord or nfp discussions are moving it's called pretty much kind of fragmented right so we basically wanted to be on a single platform uh where you can discuss nfts also we are exposed to other collections and see what people have going on and uh in some case question we actually have a limited collection that we're looking into right now so um yeah so this limited collections probably will also tie into uh uh regulation moderation so probably uh we haven't really looked into it but we're trying to see if there's any way to combat things like cyber attacks and stuff like that which are pretty much prevalent in the social media space i got another question um if i've created an nft and i want to create my own social space for it do i have to do some extra steps for that um so you've created nft uh so extra steps no i don't think you have to do any extra steps for ethereum you don't have to do extra steps but for polygon um so basically uh the steps are a bit uh just as what i've shown you guys so connect your wallet um right basically see your collections on the ethereum polygon but for polygon um we've got issues querying images from polygon itself so um you probably won't see your images there but for ethereum we did it with opencv so everything should be working just fine for you okay sounds good all right great job these blocks uh hello you're welcome uh so can uh maddie uh demote blocks and promote the next team luca pissani to so that they can present their screens hello i share my screen can you see the screen yeah yep whenever you're hi there i'm luca and i'm presenting the ipf s4 like google forms on interference system this is made using the reactor efficient codes and web website storage let's share my screen and basically i have a form editor [Music] so let's refresh i have four manager i have a phone title let's say that's demo [Music] let's create the former is we will create the form and save in my vision driver under the public folder so now let's go to the render application let's paste the url the form url here let's say let's go to the render refresh [Music] thanks for submitting okay so these uh the format results are encrypted with the composer publicly okay and actually that's it i mean at this time i made the as a concept the editor in the render what is still missing is uh for myself they have to take and from the web the form result they printed and showed the user okay thanks for your attention that's it i'm cool great job on that presentation so now i'm be moving over to the community of the judges so whenever you guys are ready i'm just curious why did you choose forms and why do you create why did you create forms um because i saw that um i think his ayah i don't know how to pronounce his name from ips says that some use cases he wants to see in on ipfs was a forms like google forms so i picked the suggestion i tried to implement it okay um i've got a question about you mentioned the public key i couldn't quite hear um do they need an ethereum address and it was was your tool using their ethereum public address for the form uh yeah actually about that i had the discussion because uh i thought that if the person that needs to fill the forms needs to be authenticated it could be a bad user cases so no i don't want to fill the form i want to quit that so i the the user that creates the forms uh has to be authenticated with phishing also and they have uh they make me available the public key so i import the actual encode the password with the public key so then the composer can can read back the results and the ceramic because the beginner was taking ceramic as i chose with their ids index system but then i need the i needed the both users to be authenticated so also the user that feels the former and i thought maybe i can in the future i can do both child users that are not uh authenticated and user that will be authenticated also ceramic got a little mad at me so like that you you're just going to do like a centralized system what's the point of doing that and i told them uh okay maybe in the future we'll do that but i think will be uh it will be some blocking some users to to fill some form if they have to authenticate okay uh grisha did you have another question i was wondering if you thought about uh you know since you mentioned google forms they kind of make it uh super easy to kind of take that data from the form and then uh let users use it in the form of a spreadsheet so have you thought about uh what you would add to this form other than i saw any other documentation you said you need to add the form result right yes i think then you have to render the informa in a spreadsheet or maybe also some visual stuff like how many users have responded to the form or stuff like that yeah makes sense yeah i also thought the maybe i could also carry i can create uh some token and they can give talk and if if the people fix the form but then the token has to be some utility but just a thought i don't know yeah that makes sense thank you okay thank you all right so awesome job uh so now we'll be moving over to team med award so far really good presentations guys yep thank you sorry for the problem um i'm from a towards then could you hear my voice yeah yep okay so i'm gonna share my screen and then okay this one oh sorry the video can can you skip me first let me sit again okay okay thank you sorry all right i guess we'll get the next team next team is midtracker trap chain hey how's it going okay let me show my screen and let's go over here okay so yeah hi my name is jasmine patterson and my project title is traction [Music] so um i built this in django and react and i'm using um tourists google authentication to create wallets in the backend [Music] so at this point you just log in using oauth i'm just using gmail because it's really quick you can be able to click gmail and then i'm using um the email to send metadata to the token curated playlist so i'm actually um using um tcr's and adding um music metadata to a flashback via messaging just case email [Music] so let's see if i can get my [Music] i'm gonna pass over here because yeah the [Music] sharing in this this other screen here because i was prepared in case this happens because it always happens when you come home um but yeah so [Music] basically this is my localhost um in the background i'm sending transfers um [Music] from one account to the next and i minted these nfcs here takashi six 69 amigos and a few others and [Music] yeah this is basically my project in a nutshell oops i know i got a lot of stuff going [Music] uh let me just move that out of the way [Music] yeah this is on the nft maintaining and transfer um i plan to keep working on this this is an actual startup that i'm the solo founder one and yeah so the idea is to create spotify playlists um as nfcs and this is leveraging flashbots so [Music] yeah that's where i got during this process um for the past i guess what like whatever days we're on um so i mean i submitted to so yeah i was um i've been in like all of these hackathons since um chain link i've just been in back-to-back hackathons and hacking so i have different portions of the project built so i have like um chain-link for off-chain data i'm also working on polygon for layer 2 with our minting and then we have a token trap token and then we also are doing some layer 1 stuff with scale chains and i also have a name space called rap name service but that's actually built um on ether mint um so yeah i'm building an ecosystem out it's just me a solo founder and uh it's around like music and nfc specifically and you know these particular genres so yep that's my project awesome awesome it's a social network so um there'll be profile pages set up and um everyone be able to interact via their profiles we can follow and like and so forth cool all right so now we'll move on over here to uh carrying out the judges okay so three minutes on the clocks right now oh and i i'm using um ipfs in the background with um like radar storage that was that was super great um i was wondering if you looked into the legality behind using spotify in the back end like can you do that legally or uh dude you have to would people need to own the music to be able to post it there um yeah well my process about it is um make a private playlist and so um we just serve the the songs through like local and then it gets uploaded to their private playlist though um you know we'll have in our terms of service that you must you know own the licensing and copyrights for the music that you upload okay so potentially like the artist would be able to create playlists and then you directly give money to artists not someone like me who i just collect a lot of players from uh okay well that makes sense yeah because a lot of times the artist links you know we're like curating and making a playlist and so forth so that was the thought behind it and then hey there's like a gray market where people pay like 250 bucks to get on cool yeah i'm yeah i was trying to put a few of the pieces together that you've got the um yeah you're using email to send metadata for use in a token created registry is that with your your trap token yeah for the registry yep and then you mentioned a flashback somewhere i'm curious where the flashback fitted in oh the flashbuy um it basically allows us to send like a bundle transaction so it gets in like um a meta transaction so uh that's what creates the playlist and it goes through without um you know it current so much gas costs okay and then the last question to fit the other piece together was uh at the end you mentioned ipfs for web3 storage um is that for hosting the website or for other things as well um well mostly it's for um the media files themselves awesome okay that sounds pretty good yeah a lot a lot of pieces come together pretty well there thank you um if we uh christian did you have another question or i thought we were out of time but uh yeah i think the monetization thing was my only question cool yeah i i was just given the last 30 seconds um is it kind of like mixtapes in a way like is it one nft for the list or is it an nft per song that you put together as a bundle that would be my last question i think he dropped oh we lost him sorry yeah oh um all right that's okay um good job team trap chain so can team can show hop on and present your projects oh hey guys hi we're can show um sharing my screen all right hi we are kensho and we are solving the issue of trust that exists in the education system every year millions of students apply for higher education and during the process they need to submit transcripts mock sheets degree certificates and all of them need to be stamped and sent by the applicant to the university as hardcopy this is primarily an issue of trust because the recipient university has no way of validating these documents online in a secure fashion during the course of this hackathon saurabh and i came up with the idea of kensho kensho enables organizations not just universities but other organizations like coursera and khan academy to upload transcripts of each student or an applicant as an nft on the blockchain each credential is basically a non-fungible token and the crux of our idea lies in the fact that we give issuer universities a way by which these nfts can be transferred in a cryptographically secure manner to the recipient the verifying university can easily verify the authenticity of the certificates without even interacting with the issuer let's take a look at how we made this possible great so so basically we have like two different stakeholders here one is the issuing university and the other is a recipient so i'm logging in to the issuing university uh i click on the university page i now can issue a certificate i specify the recipient name and address let me give it a title [Music] a period and then i upload the actual actual certificate when i click save this is where the actual minting of the nfd is happening and uh this happens on the rinkebee ethereum network so as you can see i'm on the harry potter's personal page now and i can see all the degrees that have been minted for harry potter and the last one is the one that we just mentioned if you click on the token address you can see uh the chain of events that happened from the issuing university to to to the recipient recipient's address i can i can even because this is encrypted in ipfs i can even decrypt it to the recipient using the recipient's private key so i just press decrypt it decrypted the certificate and when i click on it this shows the actual certificate given to the recipient so so this was a demo uh we used a couple of different technologies we use ens web3.storage smart contracts and chain link vrf the key innovation that we thought about and implemented was non-transferable nfps which is basically the idea that once these degrees have been minted we don't really want to transfer these minted nfps to other other accounts right uh now if you see this page this looks a lot like the linkedin profile phrase and that's what our mission is uh our vision is that kencho is laying the foundation for a decentralized linkedin and we would love for you guys to help us with that thank you awesome all right so now we'll be moving over to king of the judges three minutes on the clock starting right now super awesome presentation um i have a few questions about the adoption process that i'm assuming at first it's not like linked into the nerd office right away so you're gonna first send it to admissions uh like universities first so who might not be super technical so how are you going to onboard them and how are you going to train them or make them even understand what nfds are uh yeah so good question we spoke to a couple of universities uh and uh during our q a previously last week uh we realized that it's probably easier to get speak to somebody from khan academy and coursera that's what we did our strategy essentially is going to be to identify those guys uh khan academy and coursera already have these things because they know about this uh an indian indian university uh got on board uh and they already knew about this because they were using open certs uh from singapore university so they gave us they gave us some interesting ideas as to how we can make it better uh but the idea is that we will essentially create an onboarding document for all universities who want to do this on a grander scale and we will essentially show them that they can trust us first before we engage in any sort of uh monetary business transaction that happens but you're right this this will require some time and so we have started creating a document around that for the universities to to start understanding this and uh the good thing is we already have open search so the government of singapore has already started doing this with open a test that makes sense i've got a question about um uh people who are i guess students of different universities um is the student expected to have one address that they will use for each institution like to use across all the institutions uh yes so the idea is that i am the student and james you are the you're the issuing university so you'll be like hey shabo which address do you want me to send it to and uh shibo would then be like hey this is my address and then it's up to the university to issue that so now i can basically say it's shibo at university.edu or shibo at gmail.com but we are guessing that since james hockey university already knows that this is a trusted university um that that part is taken care of yeah okay and from the other way around i guess i'm wondering um is it possible for yeah one person to have a certificate on an address but then actually be able to sell that address or if it's regarding ans can they point it to a different yeah no no so uh as part of the smart contract we have written that once uh once hogwarts uh sent it to harry potter harry potter can't direct it uh to someone else yeah and and that is that is the whole idea behind it we don't want it to sell uh so it's up to the verifying university so for example i am applying and universities like we want to check yours i will be giving permission to the university that hey now you can check the thing and that is the whole purpose of linkedin as well where we certain nfts would be for the public or the university other nfts uh would depend upon if i'm giving permission or not okay great thank you awesome thank you guys did we lose um abbas you're still there uh boss is on you oh there he is he's back hello oh yeah i was bugging out so can team thank you obviously great job to uh that came right there so can team upld come up and uh there's on your screens hey everyone can you see me all right it's a little dark here apparently um let me share my screen all right cool one second okay those would sound okay i'm gonna play the video hi everyone my name is sergio and this is upload youtube is the second most popular search engine in the world and it's for a website that specializes in videos not even general information content creators can monetize their content and when they reach a certain amount of followers and views they can earn decent money the problem is that this ends up coming from ads which are real news songs and more so now that youtube doesn't even enforce time limits for those ads so if you're letting your kids watch hours of songs they can end up listening for a half an hour sermon by the local church not great the drawback is that without those ads youtube's income would severely reduce and so would the content creators income upload is here to fix that we're changing the way we look and organize our videos for the better taking advantage of decentralized weather in upload channels can upload their videos to ipfs and just as with youtube manage their views and likes but here there is no need for ads as content creators can leverage unlocked protocol to create subscriptions that would otherwise go into a completely separate website we also wanted to feature musicians that are part of the videos uploaded so we connect with the audios api to provide a direct connection moderation is a big concern in centralized media aggregation platforms and it's even more complex when there is a decentralized data set channels are incentivized to keep their content adjusted to the rules by staking the operating token output when they open the channel if they are subject to multiple strikes as voted by the community they lose their stake and their videos are blocked from the platform community moderators are incentivized to participate by paying them rewards using the upload token upload uses a smart contract as a general registry of channels and videos and it also uses an off-chain database to serve as an index during the project we ended up not being able to work as much as we would have wanted so the number of features we ended up having was severely reduced from the original plan the main thing that is missing right now is the main page which would have featured the index results and the search page super important we think the graph would have been very useful for this functionality but we weren't able to code it in time this was upload thanks for watching cool all right since you finished early you have more time for a q a so that is where you're ready yeah so can you explain the monetization process again and is it so is the user thing to view this content or is it like a creative fund where that's how creators make money right so the users will not pay to view content uh they can choose to tip their creators that's not something that i built on hackathon it's just like idea but um they can uh the the main monetization uh platform that there is right now coded is unlock so basically what they would do is just as they do right now in patreon they would be able to create different layers of subscription to the channel so you can go to the same channel where everything free is uploaded and if you purchase one subscription you would be able to access more material and the next subscription will even give you more material so uh everything that's kind of like spread out where you have to uh promote promote your patreon on your youtube page that will be all in the same place thanks for clarifying great um i guess they're trying to understand where um yeah so you have uh the files being uploaded to ipfs and um what was the did you say you had a token as part of that the app id token or upload token yeah so the ablo token would serve as kind of what keeps everyone honest so whenever you have whenever you create a channel uh you would have to pay a stake that you can get on return if you close your channel basically as long as you're staking your channel is valid and that will let you monetize your content and the way it works is this will prevent like low effort creators are just uploading copyrighted material from entering and if you stake and then you submit content that is not allowed by the rules uh community moderators can come in and say hey like this is bad and once that activates and if you like like the content can be brought down but if you commit a couple like violations then your uh stake would be slash and you will lose it so that's why content creators should like kind of stay on the right side of the law and the community is empowered and like incentivized to participate by giving them rewards with the same token so the community enters without tokens and they can participate and aaron tokens and the channels enter with the tokens and they can lose them if they don't stay uh committed to the platform okay great and uh since like what's stopping other competitors to come or coming out and doing the same thing because there are a lot of web tool platforms like this like you mentioned patreon there's youtube that kind of has had the subscription service um so how would you be your edge over these other companies so i think that's a very interesting question i do see this being on the open source kind of uh side of the world uh i would be okay if companies have like uh i don't know i don't know i don't want to say clones but like similar platforms or even the same platform just re revamp uh for their own profit as the platform is going to be the same right and even then i think the whole staking mechanism mechanism and the way it works with the token could be a benefit if they didn't want to create their own uh but as you know like many web 2 video platforms do the same thing and there are use cases for any of those so uh i think uh being kind of the open source one and being very open to the community it's very good okay yeah i think i recently i recently heard about new pipe new pipes like an open source uh video service i guess trying to compete with youtube so that could be an interesting one maybe pair up with them next yeah maybe that was all the questions on my end super nice presentation all right cool actually we'll be going on a 10 minute break right now i know everybody everything's been going real quickly but this has been our eighth team so we're going to be taking a quick timer break so judges feel free to turn off your cameras everybody just okay thanks all right guys so it's time to come back from the break hey judges i'll just give everybody like a couple seconds to come fully come back from the break and then we get started with the next team [Music] all right cool um so can team meme x hop on the panel and present your screens hey everyone can hear me yo okay awesome um so we're me max which is basically nft d5 powered nft lotteries and at a high level mi max is just a d5 platform that rewards users with nfts basically to mint nfts users will stake their memex token to accrue reward points and then once they've accrued enough points they can pick and choose what lotteries they want to enter and they can also boost the odds at winning winning a rare nft by paying for a boost in dying and our team consists of daniel dante pat and subic who are all software engineers and our tech stack is for ui we use next.js ether.js for build employees fleek tooling we use node for our data layer we use nft.storage we're also hosting our site on ipfs um for oracle we're using chain link and obviously it's literally in brownie for smart contract and i'm just going to go through the demo real quick and to start um it'll just show like the home page of the site with all the existing drops and basically if we want to add a drop we're going to go on the back end which is the next part here and we are using a script called megazord.js which we wrote and it takes the path of all of the artist data and megazorb will process and upload the images and metadata to nft.storage and give us an output in the form of drops.json and then we take uh drops.json and uh push it to our app uh via git to our ui repo and then afterwards you'll see fleek automatically pick up the change and start a new build and deploy and then after the ploy we can go back to the landing page and then we'll have a drop called artist for demo with the drop name demo drop and then if you click on the drop you can basically see a gallery view of the nft is available within the lottery along with nft rarities and buttons for smart contract functions and then it is a bit responsive and we're building for desktop and mobile and for the smart contract side we're just going to demo the functionality basically this test creates lottery adds three participants and also shows a participant boosting their odds of winning and we're using chain link to determine the random number for the lottery math and this this test just basically shows um the contract assigning winners and minting the prizes they won um and then you can see the lottery basically picking the winners and minting the prizes and then right here is basically our figma basically a future state of what the site will look like once it's complete um and that's that part and basically what our road map looks like um post the hackathon basically we want to finish out um the lottery drop and connect it to the ui right now it's not connected uh completely yet um we're going to do reserve auctions for artist drops once that's complete we're going to do layer two on arbitrary palm or palm and then once we've had all of those um done we're going to release a second token fork of ample fourth that we use as the platform currency so basically you'd stake the max token and instead of recruiting you know points that have no value you would accrue um uh basically a dollar uh rebasing coin and then we're going to work on fractional nfts built out of marketplace engine so we don't need to use something like open suite open c and remove their fees and then the last thing um also we're going to be building a mobile app so someone with fiat so basically someone like maybe a steve aoki can tell their fans just to download the app and it'll be just like a closed app platform for um new new to nft users and that that's pretty much us all right cool great presentation uh all right so yeah uh let's move over to uh three minute q a judges right now i just had a quick question about the um the on-chain lottery component is it possible for there to be a minor extracted value like can the miners do anything regarding timing or regarding the blocks they choose to mine um to affect the randomness um so from the way i understand and i think daniel's not on the call right now um but basically the way i understand it working is uh chain link will pull the rng number first right users have seven days to enter the lottery and then the smart contract will generate the number and then assign it to the winners at the beginning of of of the draw if that makes sense and how do you earn points because you kind of need to earn points to enter the lottery right yeah um so so basically they're earning points uh by staking the token so this mimex token um we'd have a max stake of five tokens um and you basically earn one point per token and with a max of five tokens a day and then we're also doing liquidity as well so if you stake you know the e max pair you'll get points more points than you know standard user okay uh and in the presentation you kind of mentioned that you can boost your odds of winning did i hear that right yeah correct how do you do that um it's probably harder for me to explain and then i don't i'm not sure why daniel's not on the call right now um but he probably understands the logic uh better than i do okay i guess i got yes similar to that i guess um there seems to be a lot of token mechanics going on um where did you come up with the design to have say the staking token and then points as decoupled from then the um the randomness oh sorry then from the odds for the nft and then you were talking about an additional token after that yeah like uh yeah i'm just curious how you came to the design yeah i mean some of it was inspiration from the existing meme project where basically that team kind of left the project and we've pretty much built this new platform from scratch um so there was some inspiration from there so and on that platform it's a similar system they don't have lotteries it's unfair um there's lots of gas wars so we're solving a lot of problems and we basically built this new platform from scratch so we we've taken some inspiration from them okay and do you think that there'll be um a particular theme for the nfts or is it sort of just means kind of interesting so we'll be doing uh different types of drops where our first drops are going to be free genesis cards so be like collectible cards um we'll bring in people like pack or people um i have relationships with a lot of the top artists um we're going to bring artists on the platform too but first we want to create a mechanism to create basically give free art to community and then if a user kind of you know wants to support an artist they can you know give them 100 booster odds at a rare piece and it's a way to you know maybe getting a lesser-known artist paid and also providing free art to community and then that ample fork token is also another interesting mechanism because um it's another way to provide free art because if you have overall free in quotations because you need the meme token but basically um you stake it you get this ample coin and if you look at apple for it the project can go in a bear market for four months and get like stuck um like sub a dollar where this could be solved if we bring in a big artist like pack or people and it's platform currency so it because that you need to put that currency to get into the drop it would cause a lot of demand and price and then bring the the token price back to peg so it kind of fixes ample forth in a way in an interesting way because you could kind of like basically cause a bull market from from hype yep thanks all right unfortunately we don't have a lot of time so we're gonna have to wrap up this presentation great job uh new max thank you uh all right cool so we're gonna be moving over to the next team crypto shooters you guys please uh oh can y'all please hop on hello hi hey thank you for having us let me go ahead and share my screen here all right all right cool whenever you're ready earn cyberpunk rpg battler crypto shooters is a play to earn cyberpunk rpg battler we believe in true digital ownership for gamers where the items and currencies you earn in the metaverse belong to you and you should be able to buy sell and trade them as you wish the world of crypto shooters takes place in cypher city where you're leading the revolution against the ai corporate overlords by recruiting operators and crafting weapons to go to battle with the enemy droids winning battles grants you tag tokens which you can use to recruit more operators craft better weapons or cash out into other cryptos or fiat currencies to recruit an operator you head over to the barracks and speak to the drill sergeant in basic training from here you commit an operator in this current state cryptoshooters offers two different operator classes scouts and heavies and each one can come in one of four elements fire water or for lightning every time you recruit you have a chance of minting one of these eight options we plan on creating new operator classes and rotating them in and out as possible mints in the future each operator class has special proficiencies of certain gun types increasing the damage they can do when combined with the proper gear in addition to classes and elements operators have the following stats as well levels which increase uh their power as they gain more experience experience which is earned as you battle and leads up to more level ups power which is the base damage for your operator and increases as you level stamina which determines how many battles they can engage in a day and accuracy which increases the probability of getting head shots and reduces the probability of hitting enemies in the leg next you'll want to visit the armory you can't go to battle fight a weapon especially not in cypher city in its current state cryptoshooters has five different gun types snipers assaults smg's shotguns and pistols and four different elements and five different qualities common normal rare epic and legendary allowing for a hundred different potential minting possibilities but the weapon customization doesn't stop there each weapon has the following stats which are randomized within a variable range based on the weapon type and quality power weapon power is combined with your operator power when battling fire rate determines how many shots your weapon gets off in a single battle accuracy multiplier increases your operator's ability to take better shots and durability it determines how often you can use a weapon a day now that you have an operator and a weapon it's time to battle each operator and weapon presents a unique set of four enemies to battle they rotate every hour upon winning a battle you gain exp and tags to calculate battle we start by seeing how many shots your weapon can take in a single battle we then use your weapon's power and operator power to calculate the damage done per shot and then we used your accuracy to determine if you hit the enemy in the head body or legs which may amplify or reduce the damage you do for more information on these calculations you can check out our get book when we look at the technologies we used we use ens for pretty names we use chain links to be able to peg the entry price of the game at a stable usd price and randomization we use ipfs for nft storage for hosting our nft images fleek for hosting our website and we use polygon for our smart contracts we also took extensive measures to make sure we have a stable and sustainable economy by taking a close look at economic inflows and outflows and economic incentives we create and destroy vra game design and native token this is just the beginning we have an extensive list of ideas that we want to implement in the future most notably bring your 2d operators and weapons into a 3d world worldwide large-scale battles against powerful enemies a campaign with a powerful storyline an nft marketplace cross-integration with other games such as decentralized and much much more we invite you to join the battle against the ai overlords and come save cypher city we need you if you'd like to learn more about our project feel free to check out our git book our hosted demo on mumbai testnet or join our discord thank you and that's it awesome awesome alright so now i'll be going over to uh the q and a of the daughters jimin starting right now yeah that was a solid uh question did you have a question yeah i was wondering uh were you thinking about offering this to current game developers like naughty dog who developed a playstation and then setting down the idea about having digital nfps if you're buying gear in a game or are you just trying to use just use this product yeah we wanted to make something that we would have fun playing ourselves and something that we could kind of drive we found that kind of exploring uh different game designs and what sort of economic incentives they created was pretty fun for us so it's not something that we're looking to sell but something we're looking to build moving forward okay interesting and quick clarifying question did you do all of that during this hackathon or did you just build upon something yeah we we did all of it during the hackathon um we did a conception starting from figma designs and you know ideas and weapons all this started this hackathon so yeah yeah we worked a lot and slept a little yeah i going to say it's really yeah really solid um yeah presentation and it looks really good um i was going to ask um a couple of questions on the tech the the logic for the game i guess the the game um mechanics or dynamics i should say the stats and all that is that all on chain yeah so we have everything stored on chain so if your old weapon whatever stats it has get transferred i also remember the operators have like a stamina that basically limits how many battles they could do a day so if you waste all the stamina on your nft and you transfer it the other person will get it when they'll stamina as well and they'll have to wait for it to recharge so all the calculations are done okay and for the ipfs use i think you were saying that's just for the image assets yeah so all our all our images are stored on ipfs we attach it as a redirect uh uri on the nft itself so that you can see those images on like other marketplaces like rare pro and openc and then the website the web app itself is hosted on fleek okay uh last question i had um what would you say was the most complicated tech component of the web three part what was what was your biggest learning curve or or most challenging part yeah i think the the hardest part was really getting the the combat together because the combat brings in both nfts so we had to have both of those ready already and then just kind of running all the calculations for calculating combat was pretty difficult we used some bit wise stuff in there to allocate data in very specific ways and that was completely new to us so it took us some time to learn excellent no no i really like that space i've done a bit of a very similar thing in a while ago just um yeah i think that's i'll stop there uh yes last quadrant question is there any possibility for uh multiplayer games right now or is it just all like single player mode yeah right now it's all single player mode uh but we've had some ideas for like doing large scale battles where multiple players can come together to fight one strong opponent i don't know if ryan you also wanted to add something in there yeah i'm happy to add more like i think one thing is like in all these metadata and steps that we have right now um these are titan nfcs but you know we have circular uh some gameplay that that we have planned out as a demo but beyond that we also want to extend into like other forms of gameplay using the same nfcs and different ways in which you can make that for example we have a decentralized laser tag signed up with uh last size collective and then another another might be uh like moving more into uh more more complicated 2d game mechanics beyond beyond just uh this sort of simple bachelor using power yeah so this is kind of like a proof of concept that we built during the text on but beyond that we want to extend it to like more more kind of uh gamified experiences all right thank you awesome um all right cool so next one well we already went through these ones but it appears they're missing so we'll just check if they're here again so is teen matter ward here okay just raise your hands all right cool all right so uh two men award whenever you're ready okay so can you hear me yeah okay then i will share my screen um [Music] right now well okay so because is an app for creating awards or certificate certificate of appreciation for everyone by everyone and this is the decentralized version of application that could generate and manage your digital certificate and could be validated on nft on the blockchain the file the certificate files that could be printed is safe on the interplanetary file system or ipfs so what you could do with metalwork it's simple it's create words it's create awards to people organization or anything that could receive the awards you can create a word pledge at first uh it's like if you have a competition or even you can create awards for the champion then you can read the pledge for the event for the example you create award for uh eating competition on 21 2021 then you create the pledge first and then you could generate the award certificate for champion one you can convert the awards for the second place champion and etc so you can have awards many awards on one award splits template that's the first thing then uh it could list a word split that you have been created before you can create not only for even it can even something like a word for best friend of john do 2021 you can generate the awards for john to friends that the best friends that should receive that kind of awards okay and it's all backed by decentralized technology it use web3.storage with storage to save the template of pledge so you can create template different even or different needs of awards need different templates so the templates is safe on for json files like this one oops like this one and uh it has the cid for the template content itself on ipfs and then it has a word title like the best friend of john the year 2021 this is the public address of the owner the creator of this award page and it has two fields on the certificates it's a name and is the epithet the things that you can work it's it's could be anything you can make like the grids or scores something like that but for best friend of two of gendu uh it's only name and epithet like for example andy and then that is uh the best friend that treat me a foot something like that it's unlimited let's use your imagination okay so uh the template are killed on web3 storage and then after the awards are generated you can generate the awards and then it saves the files the certificate on nfd storage with the metadata saved on the blockchain okay then the template ourselves on the ipfs the awards are saved on the ipfs by nft storage and you can create one awards or limited awards and if you want to create more you should unblock the future with unblock protocol okay the application from right there like this uh it creates with few tree with the tailwind css framework and fight with book templating so let's go to the apps okay here's how the app will look it's not finished yet but you get the point and then we could go to the award page after the user authenticated with the mendamas and the user created new plates of template best friend of june 2 year 2021 this is the cid and this is how many awards have been granted from this place category and this is the button to to mean or can generate new over or certificate well i think that's it okay i think that's uh the presentation yeah one since you went over by three minutes you we won't be able to get some q a so we'll just move over to the next game okay yeah this is the the last team so we can we can spend about a minute or two on questions and uh okay thank you thank you great yeah so you put that together yourself that's um yeah that's that's a fair bit to do in one like did had you already done a bit of um uh yeah web3 development before uh yeah uh i've been participating in for a second actually i create some uh contact apps okay okay and yeah with ipfs the ui was really good uh i think super impressive that you managed to put that all together all by yourself um thank you yeah yeah i was curious if uh you had any plans about who might be using this uh particular tool and that's how you thought about the particular user group uh so people could create their awards and uh then the awards could be it's like certificate like if you joining some course and then uh you accomplish some course and then you you can get that kind of certificate it could be used like that uh like if you have some course on youtube but you want to create a certificate of accomplishment for your for your participant you can use this maybe we could make some api so if they make their own website for the course if the participant had done the has accomplished the course then it can automatically generate the certificate and then send to the participant wallet something like that so it could be business or business or it could be uh directly created by individual personnel yeah makes sense um or anything else yeah i guess just quickly yeah i think the openness you said how anyone can give a award um to anyone is is interesting and i guess the next part would be to see how the curation can kind of work to say you know one thing is we know our friends but then after that if we say this is a you know a youtube producer that is reputable then maybe there'll be some you know way to find those ones more than others that's very interesting yeah okay that's interesting and that's why i i try to uh maybe we could use eid for this the id with a ceramic or with tree box to make the the certificate publisher is certified uh i mean i mean like yeah the uh verified something like that yeah sounds good thanks great um so thank you thank you we actually have thank you thank you thanks for that this was a really great and congrats okay thank you so much i get then great um so we actually have one last team that ended up uh coming in last minute so we have will here and uh we'll demo hotties tip so whenever you're ready we'll we'll watch the video and then this is the last time for today i we don't have audio would you mind uh doing the screen shadow again with the checkbox service that allows mission and fans to communicate more closely so missions can issue their own tokens based on years 20 and fans can purchase them so fans can purchase premium music or goods for missions with this token and the higher the scarcity the higher the price of the token due to the higher the musician's value or the smaller amount of token issues this token uh provides unity swap with liquidity to make it available for purchase and sale immediately so through other audios protocol the tracking trend track and vision information were taken and the unisa protocol was integrated into a smart contract the contract was distributed on the guard test net using heart attack so in this graph you can see how to interact simply let me show the demo so you can see the trend tracks are from audience protocol so in create token page the mission can create owned tokens so fill in the token name and symbol the articular one for mint initial price so you can see the total estimation fee so once you click the submit button then you just send the transaction to a method mask so once you confirm it so yeah it succeeded so yeah after confirm transactions so you can see in either scan there are some events and yeah so in the view page so the fan can uh buy the tokens so this is the the raymond's pants token eng we already created so you can see the detail of the tokens it's current price total of tokens so once you the buy token just confirm it yeah so the buying token is completed so uh you can see the logs so yeah so we already though one token so especially the eng token so in either scan you can see the the detail of the contracts process so once you create the energy so you can see the contract address so you can add the token um yeah based on the talking control address so yeah so you can see the attack on dng so this is uh with the smart contract uh we already implemented the manager factory and token provider and uh the ibm is also built with the react and it is planned to link this the the support t finalize with zero evaluation contract on its profile page all right cool since you finished earlier you'll have extra time for q a so that is wherever you guys get ready yeah thanks for that presentation and you said uh uh artists can be able to put items up for sale does that include uh just the songs that they're producing on the album or uh a different artwork or any of the s5 what is what are you thinking about yeah of course so every other platform also working all the history in this platform but especially i just want to focus on just position so that's why i want to connect with the audio sport actually yeah or just protocol but yeah because a lot of time just only used with the trend that trendy track actually for me information yeah so um i know did you say that you'll enable each musician to create their own erc20 token is that right yep and um have you had thoughts about conversions between them or is the idea that each musician has their own unique token and they have to if if someone wants to sell one and move to another they have to sort of uh yeah sell it to ether and then go back to the other token or is there anything between tokens um i don't think that's great so because i just just i wanna just want the connector unit swap so that's why so every musician can sell their own tokens with other fans so actually of course maybe i can just imagine or my own token on this platform but i just wanna yeah maybe you wanna just utilize the units file for this headphone so that's why okay yeah so good and i guess the last one i have um which part of the audio tip um was on ipfs like what are you storing on decentralized storage um so we didn't uh actually uh use it the ipfs actually so only just we use just audio and protocol and units of protocol so yeah and then you see okay ipfs right now yeah and uh you kind of mentioned that you want musicians and fans to communicate more closely and other than them other than fans buying music from these artists uh what other ideas do you have about connecting the fans to the musicians i'm sorry where is your point so uh other than since you kind of mentioned that the point is that you want musicians and fans to be more closely connected right um other than just buying their music or buying their work what are they can either fan talk to the musician is like would that be a future implementation or is there any other ideas you might have had about that connection yeah actually that's a great idea actually but and also um maybe actually musicians have already have owned the premium music and there are his own goals so actually it's everyone so the fan can really so by the items so with their tokens so i think that will be one of the idea about that and okay yeah thanks very cool great job everybody on completing the hack fest 2021 hackathon that is our final presentation so i just want to take the time to thank our judges for taking the time out of their days to rate and judge all of your presentations in this session and i want to thank the youth global team for having those guys all here and i want to thank all you guys for working so hard to produce awesome content to show these are just you guys really deserve like a pound on the back that was pretty good yeah all right so you guys could uh head out if you want my zuma will end the meeting and have a great rest of your day
