foreign [Applause] [Music] like to welcome our first Speaker Molly to Talk About Kevin happy New Year Molly and welcome hey Kar dick also so excited to be here thank you so much for having us um can't wait to talk to folks about all of the exciting stuff that's happening with fem so maybe Paul starts sharing my slides we can jump right into it sounds perfect I'm pumped to be here uh for the space War hackathon uh hopefully we have a couple of folks who are returning from uh our hack them hackathon back in November so we have a few folks who have iterated on ideas and are improving even further and we also have a lot of new people who are jumping in to fvm for the first time and we are so excited to have you I'm going to give you a high level overview of what is febum what are the really exciting opportunities that this makes available with filecoin with evm bringing these things together and then also what are some of the really cool things early preview into what our early Builders have already been building over the past couple of months and our timeline and roadmap to mainnet launch you are perfectly positioned right now you are in our have last 40 day run up to main net launch now is the perfect time to be building the new first you know exciting businesses smart contracts l2s use cases that are going to launch on Falcon with fevm and so um excited to have you here let's dive in um so for anyone who's who's new to fbm and just peaking their interest this delivers on-chain programmability to the Falcon Network this allows you to write smart contracts but interact with filecoin State and lets you deploy new upgrades new capabilities tokens layer twos onto the Falcon Network for the first time we've been working on fvm now for about a year and a half and there's been a number of Milestones that have brought us to this point and this is the big one this brings that user programmability that we're also excited about empowering all of you as Builders and developers to bring your special sauce your improvements to Falcon itself and really unlocked on the creativity um so we're just so excited for the various different use cases that are now possible to build with fem um and this goes from new things that have never been possible before things like data Dows where you have uh contracts that are also thinking about data storage verifiably improvably over time um and communities of people getting together trustlessly to back up and authenticate and verify uh data sets together and store them long term so we're really excited about those use cases but there's so many more there's also new capabilities that are going to improve filecoin for storage providers for storage clients um reputation systems layer choose they're harnessing Falcon storage but then adding new capabilities like retrievability compute and more we can have on-chain voting we're gonna definitely have a ton of tokens nfts uh auctions for for data storage improvements to the quality of service that can hey you have programmability you can now automate the annoying rough edges and pain points of filecoin to make it more user friendly and painless so we are so excited I would love to talk to you through maybe some of some of my favorites just to give you a little bit more visibility into some of the things that become possible um so one of those that's very timely is storage provider long markets one of the big challenges in the Falcon ecosystem right now is that storage providers have to commit collateral to secure new data and new capacity that they add to the filecoin network but getting access to the falcoin for that collateral is a challenge and on the flip side you have filecoin token holders investors folks participating in that ecosystem who'd love to find opportunities for yield on on their falcoid by collaborating with story providers but there's no Market that's enabling these two groups to interact with each other so this is a huge area for folks who are experienced in D5 or folks who really want to get involved to start mediating and creating marketplaces Lending pools liquid staking things that held both sides really unlock what they're looking for token holders to find this opportunity for sharing some of those SP returns and storage providers SPS to get the collateral that they need to scale their operations bring even more useful data and capacity to the filecoin network then you have Perpetual storage deals Falcon right now operates on top of some anywhere between six months to one and a half year storage deals that's kind of our our like fundamental component or unit of Falcon storage but you can always make a new storage deal or renew a storage deal over time and Perpetual storage deals can automate that process for the user so the users can store once never have to go back and they actually get verifiable proofs over time that their data is being stored that your sectors are still being checked and audited by the ecosystem and you have these real proofs of data persistence which is not true about other Perpetual storage programs you kind of stick your data in there and really hope that you know your your data uh you know continues to be available and and here you actually get to harness those verifiable proofs along with your Perpetual storage deals so you could have you know 10-year 20-year 50-year storage contracts and that can hit someone of those really you know human valuable information that we want to make sure is stored forever archives or other groups that want to make sure their data is persisted they don't have to worry about remaking a storage deal every five years they can use this contract and have that automated for them and so it's programming over those core storage components that you know is now unlocked with the programmability of fvm some groups are actually already starting to do this so highlighting Lighthouse as a group who started doing this on evm and is now able to bring their evm smart contract to fvm because again we've made it fully seamless incompatible for you to move an existing EDM smart contract into Falcon land and so that you can have these long-term storage deals like you know our seed Vault persisting Humanities most important information so definitely check out what Lighthouse has been doing so far in the Perpetual storage deal space we also have a number of groups who are thinking about how to bring layer 2 Data privacy into Falcon and smart contracts that can bring new capabilities that for example encrypt and have uh private data that no one party has the keys to access but that are split up across say something like Medusa's threshold encryption Network or you can have projects like lurk which are going to let you to do ZK snarks over top of private encrypted data without actually having to um to decrypt that data at the storage provider side so new tools to interact with private data which is definitely a big demand for for folks who are using Falcon they want to store encrypted data that's not um you know visible to the parties who are storing it and they want to still be able to have useful interactions with that data over time share it with new people update permissions things like that a really exciting new opportunity within fvm that as far as I know has never existed before is this opportunity for data Dows um so data Dows combine you know the storage um existing and falcoin with the new Innovations happening with Collective governance around decentralized autonomous organizations so what this can allow you to do is have a collectively curated useful data set so your Dow can um you know start thinking about maybe uh you know collection of important scientific Works research papers um you know Wikipedia Pages you know whatever whatever collection of data nfts is important to this community you can curate this useful data set you can govern that data set you can govern say the privacy and access to that data set using some of those privacy controls you could potentially even have a way to sell access to that data over time where you're unlocking that for users who have say paid into the Dow and then you can have this shared treasury within the data Dao that can be used partially for that data preservation and and growing adding new data to the collection but also maybe making that data more useful transforming that data through compute or um you know marketing that data or finding new clients and users for that data and this can become a whole life cycle and system which is smart contract can even work on automating which is finding new highly valuable data sets over time bringing them into the Dow Community you know adding the the revenue from that sort contract into the treasury repeat and cycle and that's actually a really really exciting opportunity where you can do that without having to have any Central intermediary any single point of control in that system last but not least very excited about the new compute over data use cases especially when combined with things like data Dows there's a ton of New Primitives being created for compute over data in ipfs and filecoin if you go and check out the bakla Yao project this allows you to run distributed ml compute jobs do job orchestration bid for for which job which node wants to take on and run and really assemble an ecosystem and L2 of compute nodes that can provide additional services and additional functionality over top of Falcon storage layer so think of this like you know great you have your Glacier and S3 of filecoin and now you're adding your ec2 compute layer over top and so this is you know going from the l0 file coin storage layer to that L1 fvm computation over the state in Falcon iterating over that metadata on chain how having those smart contracts and then you can have l2s and we actually expect to have many l2s who are adding that those different computation layers or other new capabilities on top of the the data and metadata in Falcon um so this is part of our file coin master plan step one was to build the world's largest decentralized storage Network which we achieved within the first year of filecoin which is amazing and huge thanks to all storage provider community and really assembling to make that happen it's blown past everyone's expectations and phenomenal step two is to onboard and Safeguard Humanities data we're now I think we've just crossed 500 petabytes of Humanity's most valuable information stored on filecoin which is nuts that's like you know a 95 increase year over year it's just you know totally impressive and crazy um and now we're working on also adding new capabilities bringing compute to that data to enable web scale applications and that breaks down into a couple different pieces we've already talked about Cod compute over data this large-scale computation we think that storage is just the start that we're going to be able to unlock the hundreds of data sets stored in Falcon to all sorts of exciting transformation stations um you know doing you know distributed data science over these data sets making them accessible to you know run your own language model on top of all sorts of interesting machine learning opportunities as well um and to really interact with these more more seamlessly we also see a really amazing opportunity to bring this to other web 3 networks so filecoin gives you this proof of storage also bringing you now kind of the the kind of compute and transformation of that there's a great opportunity to connect filecoin in with other web 3 ecosystems to do things like store the state and chain and messages of all their web 3 blockchains so that you can start using Falcon as a data availability layer where you can start indexing all of that data inside of Falcon storage deals and then you can have metadata and data Dows that are say governing the um you know the the preservation and accessibility of something like Solana state which actually I believe Salon is actually already storing um their their messages and some of their their state on filecoin which is pretty exciting so really really a great opportunity for this cross chain interoperability bring all of the capabilities of filecoin to these other networks as well um as I mentioned we really believe there's going to be a lot of different compute networks on top of filecoin because there's a lot to optimize for in this space and they are different constraints that you're going to prioritize whether that's performance trying to have really really efficient compute jobs whether that's more verifiability more in the ZK space or really focusing on privacy which lurk and Zama and other groups are thinking more about with fully homomorphic encryption or things that try and balance these different constraints and have a kind of general purpose compute Network and so we think Falcon is going to be a great home for many of these networks to flourish and we're excited to support many different groups going after uh this this domain and using building blocks to get there um and so that that's why you see filecoin and the whole DSi Community working super closely together to unlock massive scale data science to enable all sorts of developers to ingest store um compute over X board collaborate on large scale outputs of that research and make it accessible to their communities and so we see we see this really as a huge opportunity for for Falcon and for the whole d-side community so with all of this new activity you might be asking yourselves how is filecoin going to scale when we have all of these amazing l2s compute networks um you know smart contracts and running on fvm inside Falcon there's some really really exciting work in progress that I want to point to that's working on unlocking subnets on filecoin in a really scalable way it's called interplanetary consensus there's some really great talks from Lab week in Lisbon that I highly recommend you go and learn about you can Google interplanetary consensus we'll take you right there but this is a scalability solution for blockchain sharding focused on having a root chain that then has these scalable subnets and child chains that can still move data or move transactions between them and so this is kind of the a great opportunity for folks that are really excited about l2s take a look at the work that IPC is doing which can then be a building block to enable folks that want to have their own chain that you know uses Falcon as that root chain or that that you know overall security layer for new things like retrievability networks or compute networks or other things like that um and and the aim of this is that this can support they have a test net up right now called spacenet which has one second block times and so it's aiming to support the the sorts of scalability and Speed and Performance that we need to really get web scale applications and so that's our our goal is to actually bring the infrastructure demands of web 2 and help web3 Primitives and fundamental building blocks support that scale of performance activity and usage and help all of web 3 across the chasm to to those users so um you're part of this now and we're excited to have you so maybe to dive into the things that people have been building to help us get a step closer to that a step closer to web scale compute um there were a ton of awesome projects from hack fathom in November I really recommend checking out the eth global Showcase of all of these as you can see there were tons of data Dows lots of uh smart contracts from ethereum being brought into stylecoin things like voting or things like liquid staking and also lots of new things being created that hadn't existed before that really bring together the capabilities of doing you know on-chain smart contracts with being able to access those core storage Primitives in Falcon so to uh you can also take a look at the set of Foundry early Builders um and the Showcase there there's a ton of groups that have been working in this area for months now building out new applications and I'll highlight just a couple of them just to spark your interest but I know folks are going to go into this more a little bit later so one to highlight is the glyph staking Market this is super exciting new opportunity both for uh token holders and for folks that are you know acting as storage providers and looking to gain access to Falcon collateral they've been building this out and also building a lot of Primitives that other folks might want to utilize harness collaborate with and so if you're excited about staking markets or getting a valve to D5 definitely check out the work that glyph has been doing glyph.io I believe and you can go and take a look at all of this and if you're a token holder get excited to uh you know have that opportunity for for yield in the Falcon ecosystem as well um there's a lot of groups getting involved with retrieval l2s a few to point out there's the Falcon Saturn team which has been pushing this forward there's retrieve.org which is looking at retrievability Assurance so having storage providers kind of guarantee and put up collateral for their returnability um and flow Shield which is working on building a private retrieval Network as well there's a ton of groups working on various kinds of defy loans so there's fillet and then there's a ton of groups that that worked on this in hack febum um that some that were focused more on the storage provider experienced I'm focused more on the token holder experience so some great examples to lean on there as I mentioned Lighthouse is an awesome example to lean on for Perpetual storage we think there's a lot more tooling um to be built here in addition or collaboratively with Lighthouse storage and so would love to see groups lean in here thinking about uh repair miners or kind of like automated deal um you know can emulate a deal across many different storage providers so that you can automatically instead of just storing with one storage provider store with 12 storage providers or have an auction for storage providers to kind of take take your deal from you and those who fit your criteria can can make that happen and so really excited to to see this as a a really you know much improved user experience for clients who want to store their data in Falcon uh we mentioned data dials two to point out are the LaGrange Dao and spindao which are both two amazing projects that are thinking about um how to have a community governing the long-term Persistence of data um and having members that maybe are earning rewards from doing a good job of curating really useful data sets then there's a ton of compute l2s there's the fill station work um there's this awesome way that you can participate in the Saturn L2 Network and join the Falcon economy and start running Falcon through station as well so definitely there's a lot of opportunities here to take advantage of and that none of those spark your interest pair is a whole request for startups that you can start start losing grab this uh QR code here it's rfs.fvm.dev but there's a ton of ideas many of these no one's working on yet no one's actually made these exist but there's huge opportunities for each of these in the Falcon ecosystem and can spark your interest and help you start generating some cool ideas um for the folks that get involved in this hackathon a reminder that there is an impact evaluator that's running every week during this space war program until we get to mainnet launch that's rewarding the most exciting fvm projects that we're aware of so in addition to all of this awesome hacking that we're going to be doing as part of the hackathon and the hackathon prizes you can also add yourself to the fbm builders leaderboard um so we have a you know you can see what place you're in you can see how many votes you're getting and there is a prize pool for this as well so uh the next uh impact evaluator vote is January 25th so it's next week um so start your project get up and running and you can submit yourself even for this next about round or you can vote on the projects that you're finding really useful as you get onboarded and gives them back to those amazing folks who are helping you out and presenting and getting you onboarded into this ecosystem last but not least here is our roadmap we are so close to fvm main net launch we're so excited this brings all of this evm compatibility into filecoin it brings user programmability into the Falcon mainnet um and we are so excited to have you with us in these last 40 days as we build up to this mainnet launch we hope to see many of your contracts being deployed on maidenet you know we'll have a running shot clock of who gets their contract up there first after mainnet the the target launch date is somewhere between March 1st and 7th so we're really in the home stretch now um and we're we're pumped to have you there's been a long road to get here and we do have future exciting Milestones that are going to be coming later things like adding native wasm smart contracts into sem and then adding even deeper protocol improvements that can enhance programmability but right now our laser focused on mainnet launched and we're excited to have you be a part of it so happy hacking um please get in touch with me on on Twitter I'm lomac28 I'm happy to chat with anyone brainstorm design ideas whatever you have I'm excited to help out and can't can't wait to see what you all build this judging is going to be super tricky so uh you know make it hard for us we can't wait thank you awesome thanks Molly that was awesome that was a great overview on everything that's happening and I am uh generally surprised that I missed so late because that happened like a month and a half so that's a lot of things that just happened that's it's uh the last event but this is fantastic and uh this is about two two three x in the next few weeks so can't wait
