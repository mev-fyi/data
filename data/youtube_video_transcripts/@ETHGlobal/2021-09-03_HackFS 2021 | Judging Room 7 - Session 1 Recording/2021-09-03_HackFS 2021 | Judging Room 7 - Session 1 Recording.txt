hello yes so yeah now that both judges are here um feel free to turn on your cameras and then oh we're going to get started with the webinar okay my camera is on yeah yes you're good okay okay good so i'll just get a few seconds for uh teams to filter in nice to meet you hey nice to meet you too all right so i'll get started now so hello everyone uh welcome to hack fs uh judging session after nearly a month of working and over 650 hackers from 61 different countries and 18 time zones we're finally at the home stretch uh but before we get into the judging i just want to tell you a bit about what's going to happen today so the judging format will be as follows uh each team will get four minutes for the demo followed by three minutes of q a uh which means seven minutes total uh and teams while you're presenting try to keep your eyes on the chat because i'll be giving you one minute warning and telling you when the time is up for each section uh after approximately six to eight teams we will take a ten minute break so judges get a break from judging um and then each team will be evaluated on five aspects of their project the technicality originality practicality ui ux and dx and just the overall wow factor but i'd like to stress that this is not a competition you're here to learn explore what's possible show off your own projects and take advantage of any and all feedback you might receive finally let's introduce our judges so with us today we have swarup from power loom and anwar from swap x a huge thank you to both of them for taking the time out of their schedules to volunteer as judges now we can go ahead and get started with demos so as soon as the first team is ready to go and promote it you feel free to turn on your cameras and start your presentation hello hello this is our hakka fest 2021 submission we've created radha the events driven payments protocol let's introduce the rotted team this is jordan levi franz and kevin we've worked together over the last few weeks to bring you the ronda pay dab and the rada protocol we start our story off with mark and kerry mark the buyer has a great startup idea but not enough money to fund sorry not enough money to fund someone to build it carrie the seller is a professional developer and really like likes mark's idea but she wants to make sure she gets paid for her work we will now explain how the wrong protocol solves mark's cash flow funds while also simultaneously guaranteeing carrie's payment mark and carry use a rotten paid dap which provides an interface for decentralized event-driven payments on broadpay mark can create a job and carry can connect with mark to agree on submission and payment terms after the job is posted the run of smart contracts act as an escrow between mark and gary once carrie submits her work and mark agrees a payment stream is automatically set up through superfluid router will track the chosen events such as downloads from mark's tab and will pay carry based on the frequency of chosen events if the admitted events increase payment is increased if they decrease payment is decreased then using the graph marking carry can query their payment streams see how much they're getting paid and when they're getting paid now let's take closer look into how those events are tracked again we have mark and kerry here using the raw to pay data to track events rotopay connects to an event tracker api the api will listen for events based on mark's job and change the payment stream on superfluid per the terms negotiated between market and carry from there the api connects to textiles throughout db where log data is sent and uploaded to ipfs ipfs is then able to show every event that is registered so mark and kerry or others such as potential investors can easily access all the information from their deal now we will move on to a video demonstration of the protocol and the interface before mark can get carries assistance he has to use the rider app to set up some basic info about the job he sets a description and a down payment of 1000 ether then he connects the writer app to listen for downloads of his soon to be published application he sets a target of 10 app downloads after which point the payment streams carry will be increased by 20 finally he has some final basic details including the final contract value he clicks next and waits for the submission on kerry's side she can now see mark's job from the table below she can review the terms and click apply this will create a transaction which will on the blockchain confirm that kerry is an applicant for the job there are several stages to this job but for brevity we will skip to the final stage where mark has the final sign off and starts to pay midfield mark now has to choose the job from the payments section and here he's taken to the payment flow screen which after a short delay shows that he is streaming 750 to carry per month he clicks start flow and the router application along with superfluid will handle the setting up of all the required payment streams between him and kerry there is nothing more afraid of them to do now after the stream has started we can see money streaming between mark and kerry this is thanks to the graph and the subgraph integration between rada and superfluid showing the streams between mark and kerry we can also see the thread db textile integration with ipfs showing that mark currently has zero events recorded for his app downloads in order to increase these up downloads we must imagine a hypothetical scenario where someone wants to download mark's app they go onto the app store and click download and rather listens to the number of events that are downloaded to check whether or not the payment streams carry needs to be adjusted returning back to the dashboard we can see 11 downloads for mark's application over the threshold of 10 but he said before we should increase the payment streams to gary moving on to the payments dashboard we can check this as mark navigates to the dashboard his original 750 per month stream to carry has in fact increased to 900 per month so we can see that the protocol has successfully worked very cool uh do you uh does your uh this project accept different cryptocurrency at the moment we've only tested it with ax using superfluid flow good job guys um there was a lot of different integrations which is very impressive uh what was the most or you can answer any of them either what was the most challenging one to implement or what did you have the most fun doing um i can start very quickly um i worked a lot on the front end of integrating with the super fluid contracts and we thought it was a really powerful tool um but we've said this to sue fluid we had a couple of challenges getting everything set up and working uh in a seamless way um there's a lot of smart contract work to do and a lot of small gotchas that we had to work through before we got it working effectively uh yeah uh what what do you think is the next step of this project um like what what do you think in the future as a future plan what's the next step you want to open what's missing you want to focus in the future if you want to support um we think that we can build a protocol that can be taken forward in the future to be extended to not just app downloads and not just one currency but to basically listen to any stream of events and connect it to any stream of payments at the moment superfood have done a really good job with payments and we think this can be extended to make proper event-driven payment systems like you might see in google pay-per-click or similar situations we think that could be something that we would like to take forward and explore further past this level i don't know if you'd like to add anything uh no you took my answer right on my uh my mind here so okay uh another question is i saw that when do uh the manager job and there is multiple buttons there when you show a demo uh is these all these to interact with the with the smart contract or okay yeah um essentially um for for the job there there has to be uh multiple signings between the uh carrie and mark in that example and then that just shows all the different signings that they have to do in a quick and easy presentable way for the hackathon and with each signing it limits the number or which specific methods they can call like for example when a job is created the um job creator can set a bunch of different parameters but once they choose a final applicant to that job um they get locked out of them editing any of those parameters and then they do a sign on that job and then um the developer can submit the work before both of them do a final sign or actually just a job creator does a final sign off on it to confirm everything yeah further um just few things that i noticed as you guys were showing the demo is it like 100 decentralized or there's a little bit of centralization right now for convenience uh for the sake of user that you guys have yeah there's a small centralization piece on the api that caches events and that's the exact thing that we'd like to research how to decentralize the entire data structure all the data is decentralized um it's just that one bit of logic that we didn't want to run on a smart contract makes sense yeah good job guys thank you all right thank you so thank you so much uh now we'll be moving on to the next team so teamwriter pay uh please turn off your cameras and microphones you'll be demoted back to attendees soon and uh team sprout feel free to begin your presentation whenever you're ready okay sprout is a decentralized content platform just going to talk over the video here it's best thought of as a combination of medium and twitter powered by smart contracts on polygon and with content hosted on ipfs so here's the demo so you start by connecting your wallet once you connect you're asked to create a new garden which is a smart contract that's what's happening here notice that it costs 0.1 matic which goes to the treasury for the creation of the garden once the smart contract has been deployed you're asked to plan something this is a content piece like a tweet a blog post or book the sprout is equivalent to a tweet it's a short message and then there's an image and a title optional title and a plant which is a longer form post like a medium post once the image has uploaded to ipfs then you can plant it and that requires another transaction only gas here which on polygon is less than a penny to mint your nft and there it is so here you can see a few features get exposed here one is uh you can follow all of this and following currently costs 0.1 matic 90 of that goes to the creator and 10 to the treasury you can also like posts that's also controlled by the factory contract that's point zero one matic it costs you less it's a bit of a micropayment tip that are going to the creators here uh and a small amount to the treasury for future development another button here you'll see is the sell button now openc doesn't typically index new nfps that fast that's why we got the 404 page here but i'll show an example of one that was minted a little bit earlier here it's going to switch accounts you can see when i switched accounts like i got to a different uh publication here and here we are in open c and we can see the infinite gardens post there's the image and here you can it's already recognized that it's owned by you and you can you can sell it create an option if you want maybe as a sponsorship uh i think that would be a unique way um to do selling the fts of your posts and your your sprouts here's an example front end uh based on medium i call it sprodium uh but just all the content from these smart contracts stored in ipfs shown in a medium type of a format uh you know you have the long form post you can click through to and read them you can follow etc and finally there's a twitter example uh same content but shown as a shorter sprouts here like tweets you can like you have the images here those images included and you can even post short sprouts here and again less than a penny in gas to mint that and we'll post and that's i think that's basically the end of the video so in general i think this is a proof of concept of you know combining things like blockchain smart contracts distributed file systems like ipss this post to ipfs via the nfp.storage service i think it's just a good example of how in the near future we can combine all these things to do things that weren't possible before um and i'm really excited about the possibilities i hope this example sort of shows one vision of how that that might go in the future oh yeah very cool uh how uh how can you how did you manage the data you did you store them in uh decent lives or see twitter oh yeah sorry so the way the flow works is you know you first you create this smart contract gets deployed and the smart contract holds the nft tokens uh including the token uri and that is basically a link an ipfs link to a json file that is the content of the post so the json file in ipfs has a link to the image and the short short message the long message which is included a markdown report is included for that and stored on ipfs in a decentralized manner yeah oh nice yeah this is pretty cool i think i've seen a lot of implementations it's it's awesome that you've i mean it looks like you're a solo hacker on this project right uh yes i am yeah two different things great use of uh ipfs plus matic uh and getting these themes in place which is i think more important to attract people um so i'm curious about like where do you do you wish to pursue this and would you sort of work on it by yourself sort of get community involved i'm very curious about that i think technically i sort of understood most of it but yeah i think uh uh you know as i said it's a proof of concept and if people are interested i'd really like to to to have others join like my vision for it could be sort of an open source uh software project you know i sort of give examples of medium and twitter but it's also like wordpress in a way uh but a decentralized way wordpress so i can see a even a dao operating sort of managing and governing both the software development as well as the factory contract and it's a defy component here uh where you can i call it yield uh yield gardening so that's a unique aspect here where you can publish you can earn maddox for your when people follow you and like your content and you can claim that uh i didn't do a claim uh transaction in the demo but that all works as well so i think that you know one thing it needs for sure is uh web design i've leveraged some web templates and frameworks here to show the proof of concept but uh definitely uh you know with a team of people it can be expanded uh you know a better ui with a proper markdown editor and there are other features and uh you know tokenomics to consider right now it's it's it's matic and the prices are fixed that's probably not uh feasible in production maybe it's an erc20 token rather than sort of the base the base currency of the chain um and that the dow would sort of manage that and govern the prices and things like that so i think there's yeah that's pretty cool yeah i have a question is when you clicked like you said you took the who post the article or the tweet uh like if if i uh press like can i modify the tip or it's uh it's like a fixed number is it in the in the demo and the prototype is fixed but uh you know that's an interesting question i thought about uh you know and it's an open question i mean should creators be able to set this uh or should it be fixed but set by the dao um you know i'm not sure what the answer to those are but you know those are things that would probably need to be discussed and figure out uh but yeah it's an interesting consideration nice all right so that was that's seven minutes up so i have to stop there uh representation though um so uh team sprout if you can turn off your cameras and your microphone uh and then we'll move on to defy glock 1.0 all right hello i'm audible yes you are hi guys hi so let me share my screen so should i start with first video right d5 project okay while playing the video because there's a little bit of feedback so there's an echo okay when you start playing the video just beat your microphone that's okay okay [Music] sure that's too difficult don't worry yeah yeah yeah sure i understand holding is approved on our best related you can create one so yeah because you can see the what is the price before fourier if you have the holding power then you can so basically we will give that to you so let's go to what are the tools and technology we have used actually so we have created a smart contract basically here so we can see what is it if i look we have defining our link and he has a token to zoom quite earlier okay so the smart contract is here we have tested actually and we have get the reference pumps several other projects here also so yeah this project is a factory contract and yes i can factor contact basically create oh good luck to us okay so it is deploy on the polygon scan it is also the one also we have created a sub graph for that particular contract so here is the graph and yeah yeah you can see the sub graph yeah here it currently proved it i think now it should come like three detail yeah yeah here it is so you can see the address of the contract and all that we can check also over the polygon scan so yeah let's let's go to the website yeah we can see on the homepage basically we can see different currency what price so if you want to create for that or be five bit easy quick and these are the ones which currently we are giving on the polygon scan networks okay so let's let's see uh yeah so first do the transaction also okay so currently we are get here the transaction okay that you can create your ini wallet so let's create one of the let's create for why bts because i think why would this we don't have maybe because yeah it's great we could quickly i think we'd not register click and you can select the date okay and you can select the bonus token maybe you've got bonus okay let's create this so pop up sorry for that yeah i think my box will pop up it should come so let's go to empire and come again maybe we can find this data which is coming from subgroup actually currently i think that there is a internet connection issue so we are opening the website previously we are getting 3d then now i think it is coming for okay okay you can see new yeah your transaction is going from here also you can see new yeah that's it actually video is little bit i have recorded late night demo office somewhere that we can see later maybe not right now i'll i have a question but i was just wondering since it looks like you've completed some parts of it but the video wasn't very clear uh yeah i have the link on demo link okay i'll check it out awesome uh just like basic questions how you sort of uh analyzing the uh apis on these things especially when you go into production what do you have in mind to solve that currently we actually the taking the results of whatever the token which user give based on the reserve like if the good luck size is very large according to that people get more rewarded based on that more people can join more uh reward and more uh that fight and other ill part currently we had not decided as a smart as hackathon project because but we can try to do the farming on the compound and other projects so we can earn more money without holding that on the smart contract only but that part which not done it but because just to as a currently that we have the concept uh for the like holding part because i i i am in crypto like from the like uh following like 2018 the prices keep moving fast but um people don't have a patient right now to holding their currency on their wallet on meta marketing if you have having a metamask you can spend anyway on any idea or somehow but if you can keep on smart contract and hold it for some and get extra other token also so it will be reworded actually yeah uh yeah how is it the can be this modifier or manageable or just 30 that means it's 30 days no then it will it is locked for the the amount and duration which has applied for that you cannot hold uh withdraw in between so that though actually the holding part so yeah before the starting the website you get the like uh info where you can see that you can hold that particular amount and it will have the expire amount of this date it will expire but i'm thinking about the reading amount also read him um part also like people can read him in between like 30 that they don't have to hold but in between they have to redeem their amounts so i think they have to pay the extra fee that concern i i came into my mind after uh seeing other apps also so yeah that in we can add in the future project currently it is a fix if it is a 30 days good luck anyone can create on good luck so yeah you can invite your family member to hold the crypto on that particular wallet for some particular amount of time and can reserve their token or there but here currently not in between you can get that amount and do you wish what is that right now one minute [Music] sorry actually i'm living near the airport uh i have an airbase close to me as well uh what is it that's uh missing let's say before you maybe can launch this in production i'm very curious about it uh yeah i have two three things like i have to create our own token like where people can earn that token as a initial whoever the joining the projects so means as a reward we they can get extra uh token so that more people can get uh with with holding the creating good luck also get like currently you get other token so instead of in that token you can all extra get the other token also there [Music] excuse me i uh how is that reward system works when you say reward how does it work like we have the reserve tokens on the other part so currently um like we have two three good luck on the platform right so that multiple so suppose currently i am thinking this way like uh we have the good luck of quick they have the expiry in 30 days for example and other have the good luck of like expiring 20 days so i have already have the that uh token in my hold which i have have to give after they and previously i have to give the 20 day people that are reward token so i will take the token from that there and for them i can give their like yield whatever the extra yield generated from there the for longer period tokens i will give them them to smaller period of two holders to them whatever the small it is not a small big gum bonus but it is a little bit bonus like uh like you can say like for if you're holding a 10 token you can get 0.1 quick only like it is currently the small yeah but it will get from reward from the vet we have the larger bullock and so based on that some of the uh thing which we get i think so all the pressure as the user who uh i'm sorry sorry to cut you off but we uh i've gone uh over the timeline already so i'll have to stop right there sorry about that okay um but yeah thank you so much for your presentation um if you can turn off your camera and microphone uh we'll move on to team bliss hey hello okay hi let's start hi we have listing we are a company that helps game developers to integrate nfts into the games and in this hack we are going to show you our latest development an nfc that can evolve ready to use in the video in video games so let's start to see what is what is an nft account involved we are going to create an nfp so we are going to start creating a regular entry so we are going to create the energy with the image the scripting the quantity and now we are going to add evolution to this activity so we are creating the first evolution and we are going to create a second evolution so this is our nft with the evolutions we are going to meet then as a regular nft in the blockchain we confirm the transaction and these energies we are going to see right now how to evolve nfps so there are two models two ways to evolve this and we try to simulate two business models in the game industry first first way to evolve the nft is playing we are we want to simulate a free-to-play mode so imagine the player has this energy he's in a game he's gay he's playing with his energy and when he achieves a mission get some gold the game rewards the pleasure with an evolution code this is an evolution goal this is just an ipfs has so with this evolution code that the meringue gives to the player after they achieve some gold the player goes to our webpage and with this code he can evolve the rft so as you see we are going to launch one transaction and this nft now with this evolution code is going to evolve to another nft that have a different properties is most powerful so is increasing in value and utility into the game so this is a good way to create a free-to-play model with energies but this is a second way to involve my team that is paying this is the pay to win business model in games so to pay for a world disenfee we need a painting code this payment code can be get in the video games webpage so we are going to use one of them so imagine you go to the game and in the main lesson i say okay with this code if you pay one you are going to evolve this nft to the most powerful version so we get the evolution code the payment code and in our web page just lansa transaction with this evolution group and the nft is going to change to the most powerful version so we are waiting while this is about me and we see the nft has evolved so these nfds we think we can use them in the video game industry and this is a way to encourage a video main creators to use ipfs and blockchain technologies so we hope you've liked this demo and thank you very much bye okay yeah uh very cool uh and when you say uh that like uh liar achieves some goals is it based and yeah faced in uh other platform games or oh imagine you're playing yes imagine you connect to a game you get the best the basic nfp and you start to play and the game say okay the ten first players who defeat this monster in these conditions i'm going to give them an evolution code to reward them and then this only these these templates can evolve the nft and the other players have to pay if they want to evolve the energy this is why it is to encourage the free-to-play model in video games oh nice did you uh with your team developer good so the game developer is generating these unique codes right that you're ages how we used to do it for skins yes the game has an api or sdk we write them so in that moment they generate they sign a message and generate evolution code is just sign a message and store the result in the in ipfs so in in this moment of life they give you the code but you have to pay the ass to evolve the nft and how are you preventing i mean these quotes can't be on on the blockchain right because anyone can say the code only works for the player the address of the player is is inside the message we signed the the regulator sign so if you pay the rest of the message you are going to evolve the nfd of this player not your nfp have you tried that game we are trying we are trying we are talking with lane developers and we have a company that use nft and interracing games and we are just looking for a game that wants to try this technology awesome nice it's a very nice use case uh when if you can get it to ship and then sort of you're trying to do the evolution around it yeah it's fun nice good job okay thank you thank you [Music] okay so if there's no more questions um then i guess feel free to turn out thank you so much for presentation uh feel free to turn off your cameras and microphones and we'll move on to the next team so yeah uh next team is bald nft storage um so as soon as you are ready to go feel free to present your screen all right how's it going a back-end system for storing nft metadata on nft dot storage we use a local http server to serve the data then we use the nft storage client to serve up that data and push it up to nft.storage so you can see we've now pushed the data up to nft.storage and refreshing the browser we can see our asset created an arc720 derivative and upload it to rinkp test network using ethers okay you can see now the contract has been deployed on ether scan so the next step is to try minting a token using javascript okay so we can see the token has been minted see it on the rigby ether scan and we can now go and see if it will show up on openc it turns out that our nft.storage nft is now listed on openc and all of the properties also went through uh good job uh i was curious um uh sort of is technically like the most challenging part here for you guys like uh i saw you guys use hard at a bit of solidity and then sort of pushing things to ipfs and i i think i also saw deals so which means you're using uh five coins right behind the scenes yeah um so it actually wasn't that hard because like the first thing i went to was the uh protocol labs talk and they talked about nft storage so like all the stuff that i thought i was going to have to build just kind of existed so i just you know upload everything to there and then yeah so um yeah i work i'm a really demanding job so this is i just kind of use this as more of a way to build out the systems i need them you know uh helping some friends launch this nft collection so uh kind of the goal was just a way to sort of automate that that process what was the part that you had to sort of work on and it's actually a good thing if you're able to reuse existing services because then you're reducing the complexity of let's say verifying what you've done but what i'm trying to also understand is like what makes you different so that you can launch this as a actual platform for uh many others right uh well i don't know if that that's not my goal so and maybe i'm maybe that's wrong for me to be here i mean it's all on on github but you know just like it's there an easy way to just you know a template that people could go up that's awesome that's even better yeah and just load up uh you know basically all they would have to do is fill um a json with or sorry just a directory with the images they want and also metadata and then yeah run that server and run those three scripts and you know it would deploy all the stuff so if someone wants to yeah is is this limited just to upload file like with that i mean yeah yeah i mean i made a custom smart contract so the bigger thing here is like you know i want a gumball machine effect so people you can't so they they have like a limited set of of characters and you want it to mean in a random way so kind of like you're opening a you know a pack of cards so you know there's a lot of custom stuff in the smart contract that i'm working on to do that but yeah this but mostly you know i just wanted i didn't know how to store nft securely that so i joined this and you know now that's why i made yeah i don't think it's like groundbreaking nice what what are the next step for this uh uh desktop project what do you think it's really nice uh oh project i really liked what yeah oh um well i guess the project is the nfts the greek kids imts are kind of this set of characters based off like you know classic american horror movies but they're they're kids kind of trying to match that gap between like garbage pail kids and sort of crypto punks um so that's like the big project and that will get lots of promotion and all that stuff um but i'm still you know i just needed to build a kind of back-end system for that so you see it like a developer tool i'm sorry do you see it as a developer tool that you would want to publish on i mean you've already pushed it on github so i was curious how do you want to maintain it i think that's what onward oh yeah i definitely would like to clean it up more and just have it be more something people can just can just use uh you know swap it out with any erc 721 in there um and like i said they just pop the stuff in the directory and then it all happens so yeah just try and you know keep the open source community alive so yeah good job thanks yeah all right if there are no more questions we'll move on to the next team uh thank you so much to this for your presentation take it easy yeah um so now see uh team saturn feel free to present your screen and start your presentation whenever you're ready yes hello there introducing saturn appear a peer-to-peer file sharing application without any limits i think we transfer but way better the problem is that today's file sharing system is broken in web 2 authenticating the provenance of a file is impossible without relying on trusted and siloed third party but webtree is bringing new opportunities with new infrastructures like ipfs a peer-to-peer storage system based on content identifiers therefore providing immutable addressable data we have falcons which is a new economic incentive layer for data to be stored on ipfs and we have decentralized identity protocol such as three id connects from ceramic which allows the creation of a generalized trustless identity with any blockchain wallets to authenticate as a user this is why we are introducing saturn the simplest way to send unlimited files around the world in a trustless way and with a certified provenance to use saturn a user needs to connect to the three id connect system with a signature from their ethereum wallet to create an account they then sign a second proof that links their ethereum address to the id they can then upload the file and enter a list of intended receivers to lock the content this is optional and the file will get applauded on ipfs through web restoration this upload will be signed with his ethereum address and accessible by anyone with the transfer link the file transfer history is tracked using ceramics streams streams that are linked to the user the id and therefore to their ethereum address let's see that in practice okay so here we are on our website which is deployed on click on ipfs where you can just connect the wallet so metamask for example it will then be printed to connect to the three id so we can connect with a new id because i have don't have one with this mathematical account or sign to control my entity through this destructively identity protocol and now um i can link my end identity to my ethereum address through my metamask once finished and i can do the final signature and now that i'm connected i can start uploading a file let's for example upload my beautiful penguin can i title penguin [Music] with my message hey check this out and then transfer so very simple very similar to we transfer will be uploaded and once uploaded on ipfs through the web3 storage a link is then created and this thing can be copied and shared so for example if i open a new tab you can then go there say okay here over here is the penguin i check this out what's interesting is i can have the um the white address sent me this file so i can improve check the provenance i can have the ceramic link proving the stream of information and then we can just download the files and there we go we have it nice uh uh does the file did you encrypt the file or just transfer the us you know the the file is not encrypted uh so it's a publicly uploaded only on ipfs uh it is uh one of the next steps is to have a full encryption uh using ceramic and ipfs they are providing tools for this uh but uh we are we have added the features where you can add the lists of of um intended receiver and uh and then the file is locked to only the people who has the right ethereum address but this lock is only on our um on our website uh directly to lock the contents but it's still a new cool feature that we didn't show in the video sorry okay uh yeah that looked pretty cool in terms of i think i was trying to see how the recipient check is done so is that something because we have to look at how end users want to use it right who don't really understand wallets uh so the easiest one is an email correct like that's generally how we transfer things anyway uh like the first thing i do is i take a dropbox link and then i share with people that's the easiest thing i do these days um so is that something you guys can prevent i think with an email link with a unique link it's fine because it's secret enough and you can have a timer or something uh but i think how onward said about encryption and then how do you make that i'm very curious how you plan on making it easier for end users to sort of uh have something private even if it's not fully encrypted yeah the for for the privacy means that the user has a blockchain wallet in some ways we anyone can connect on the website and still use it download files and share it but it will not be encrypted but for the encryption uh with ceramic and in the ipfs you have a way to include the the blockchain wireless address public wallets uh in uh when downloading the files and therefore it will be encrypted with this public key uh and and there are only them connected with the right accounts can decrypt the files so this is the the main requirements it's uh and uh and this is the main features that we have with her american ipfs nice yeah uh uh also you know it's interesting to work now uh sharing something like file or like that for um like considering also uh the time limit for sharing something if you sign it i mean if it's still and it's it's it's a lot it's a big topic it's also depend in a decentralized storage itself can handle these things with the signature yes it's really cool do you guys plan on monetizing the service or would it be something fully decentralized for now it's something that can be fully decentralized and because ficon is fairly new and everything is we we we can also most of the thing on ipfs and for not that much uh so we don't have a lot of costs so no much communication but there is an id where you also include in for the receiver a signing of the document kind of a proof of downloading the files and there you start to having a kind of a business contract features for daos to utilize where the dow sending the files will authenticate the sending and the dials receiving the files will also authenticate the receiving so you we we had some idea of starting in this direction it could be quite interesting like providing utility good luck guys that was pretty good demo very nice thanks all right thank you so much uh so after yeah so feel free to turn off your cameras and microphones um after this team uh we're gonna take our 10 minute break so um yeah see you guys back here in ten minutes i'll put a two minute warning in the chat just like so everyone's uh is aware yeah all right hello everyone uh 10 minute break is over so uh judges if you could yeah turn on your cameras turn your microphones and we'll start with the next team who should be um let me check real quick uh team out of the ether if you could please raise your hands all right so you've been promoted to panelists feel free to present your screen and start your presentation whenever you're ready yes hi i'm going to be speaking over the video if that's okay so you should be able to see my screen so out of the ether is just a proof of concept for one click nft minting of the current application state excuse me so what you see here is just scaling rectangles out of an ethereum logo it's more so just meant to convey that there's this animation taking place and you can one-click mint uh a static nft of the current animation state so in the application you can um as you see you can click mint you can complete the transaction excuse me through a injected wallet and um the [Music] the image data is stored in ipfs and an nft is minted and also in this application there's just a a wallet basically just to see your collection of minted nfts for the for the address so you see there that's the entry that was just minted and that's about it [Music] i'll stop sharing uh any challenge of difficulties you faced sure yeah uh right so um i just for what it's worth i i started the hackathon a little bit late and i was working alone but uh so i'm i'm uh pretty comfortable the front end development i have a lot of experience in d5 et cetera but um i'm new to solidity so this was sort of uh first my first step to just get uh to get moving so i use scaffolding um and a bit of my time was just spent getting comfortable with the code base learning the integration et cetera um and uh so i supposed to answer your question uh just sort of the full integration of yeah cool do you enjoy it work on that uh i see the front end it's beautiful uh an internal fork uh and the smart contract do you enjoy it definitely yeah i mean there wasn't too much actual solidity work here smart contractor it was literally just the minting of the nfts um but uh yeah so it was just the so that just fur for what it's worth uh so the canvas itself is being converted to a data uri and then that's being stored in ipfs really uh it was high very cool demo uh i was it is so it's completely random right like you're just like sort of uh whenever i meant the chances of what i'm generating is most probably unique because what you're generating using canvas exactly so it tries to cut it's whenever the interaction actually gets propagated yeah it'll go into one and uh since you mentioned i guess you didn't have much time i was curious about um the user interface since you're a front-end designer uh are you planning on sort of improving that because this looks more like one of those fun hacks uh which is more about less about like trying to prove a point like that's and that's kind of how nfts are popular too right like because a lot of people started having fun with it so i could see that element so i was very curious if you had more time so let's say post the hackathon what would you want to sort of improve on yeah i appreciate it um so the next iterations to speak so this was sort of more so a proof of concept the next iteration would be to actually create a little bit more of an evolved game and basically implement this as a feature to allow capturing screenshots of the game state um and suppose and perhaps more generally just taking that principle of um for example just like that's a chrome extension for uh being able to mend an nft or whatever the window the browser window state is um but that would be the next uh so just actually creating a game and then implementing this sort of as a quote-unquote feature would be one um what i do that you used for this part of me what tools did you end up using to get the hack to work i used scaffolding uh yeah boilerplate and um expanded from there so i mean that includes hard hat ether.js et cetera but yeah just uh now when we when you do screenshot uh and you meant it is there a way to modify the screenshot or it's it's run with the mint when uh when you capture a tournament yeah so from actual event propagation in the browser to conclusion it's straight through the pipeline of converting the to converting the image and minting the nft um so there's no opportunity here to to edit the image okay okay yeah which i think is the fun part right like you're just capturing the area yeah i mean the animation is uh too involved at the moment uh and what you know what you saw but yeah it is uh but it could be like gamified like i was thinking of like how you could have like certain more randomness that's basically what you're trying to create here right sort of so for example let's say in the next implementation it's like uh creating a conway's game of life and being able to take a screenshot of like the tick states of because that's a little bit more of an intricate yeah um ui makes more sense yeah pretty cool all right appreciate it all right thank you so if there's no more questions uh we're going to move on to the next team thank you for your presentation uh and then the next team will be internal story so i believe you already promoted balance so feel free to turn on your camera or microphone and then present your screen whenever you're ready so i'm sorry excuse me okay there you go yeah yeah hi uh so i'm from the team internal story and our idea is um to provide us a platform of decentralized inventory management system kind of like shopify so um the plan is to help move from web 2 to web3 and we we see a lot of stories in news that amazon servers went down and some of the businesses were totally affected and they incurred a lot of losses so in order to avoid that we my plan was to uh provide some alternative or kind of like a clone of shopify in decentralized world um okay so let me get started with the presentation okay so here's the video that we made give me a second please um i can't hear any audio from the video um make sure to check uh share sound when presenting your screen yeah i did i did uh let me try that again simple platform for shop owners to manage their store and sell uh their products and uh make transactions and using crypto so here we have created a simple website where this is a simple um landing page and [Music] in this we have three pages which is where they can manage products we are using textile so in order to uh each each owner will have their own bucket in which all of their data is stored in that thread in threaddb database provided by textile so here you we can see um the owner can add a product name brand image url for the thumbnail and product id they can create a product update the product and delete product in order to update and delete product they would need to provide a product id which is provided by the owner and here all the products are listed which are uploaded in the threaddb database and you can see all of the we have used dummy data happy socks so all of the different socks are here and this is a payment window where we ask our buyers to pay make transactions to this wallet address and they can copy it and paste it in that wallet to make transactions we verify this transactions using etherspot sdk event and we can make sure whether the user transaction went through or not so that's our project thank you yeah uh yeah it's it's kind of a shipping mark or something like this um when you when you say there is two things he said uh uh delete from when you say delete you mean delete it from way when you say there is a button for deleting i cannot read so good you're muted okay thank you uh so deleted from the database so there are two parts to for this project and one is uh kind of like the admin thing and uh another front will be front end where buyers can view the all the items that they can buy and make a transaction send the transaction to the wallet address and so what you saw is was the kind of like admin based where people can add in their products and update it and then delete it from the database if the item is no longer made available for users to buy for buyers to buy and we have still more milestones to achieve in this the admin board needs to be added more more features needs to be added and kind of like is polished a bit and also a front-end uh thing should be added so that's the plan for the next uh features yeah i think i missed the part about uh how you guys were collecting payments is this some third party that you were using um we we use uh etherspot stk so we're generating uh wallet address and we would be using events for that uh kind of like a third party we didn't create any wallet or payment contracts so yeah and another feature yeah they've been changed and stuff i guess because you you want to support all kinds of crypto payments i'm just curious uh not not that it was core focus of the project but did you guys figure out if you could sort of use like a either an erc20 or maybe even the native token i i was trying to check what's the stack you guys used okay you guys are using polygon so uh there was maric which is the de facto token or you could go with a more stable uh stable coin payments to collect that as well right yeah so first initially we plan just to use some stable coins like tire ustc so it would make it easier to um keep it in sync with the real world right now because we haven't transitioned whole to web 3 crypto world so yeah first we plan on using some streaming coins and then maybe support some tokens which we would want to about uh what kind of database do you use when you say database is it center or law just like yeah we are using 3db from textile so one of the challenges which we faced was to implement the cart system we were figuring out how do we how do we add on schema how do we design schema for that because uh when we add and cart and the transaction comes to place the whole in the whole e-commerce thing um we can manage all the products uh database intellectual card but when we add transactions non-asset-based uh databases shouldn't be used to manage transactions so um it wouldn't make sense for us to use non-asset compliant databases like because thread db is document based uh kind of like mongodb so we kind of got lost and um took us a while to figure out but we still implemented it in 3dp but the functionality is still to be fine-tuned on very nice uh just a quick one is it the id the product id is in a smart contract also uh we we haven't implemented any smart contracts yet okay yeah okay yeah okay no it makes sense okay yeah okay all right thanks yeah thank you any other questions uh actually i'll have to stop it sorry so because it's uh sevens are up so i'll have to stop it there but thank you so much for your presentation though okay yeah thank you see you guys bye so we will now start with the next team um which will be team free nft um i the air table says to ask you to add subtitles to your video when you presented can you turn on the subtitles please sorry uh would you be able to turn on the subtitles yeah all right thank you reimagine st is an nft reusable tool currently nft like photo videos audios and other digital files are only useful in our personal entertainment or either inside water or blockchain nft can achieve more than that use it for daily life embed the photo music video into the invitation email digital postcard or zoom virtual background and more and share the beautiful nfd with friends and family and after connect the wallet you can burn a ft or create a new design into a instagram post postcard or whatever from here you can see your nfp collection you retrieve from the corvalent api instead of direct burn the nft user can create a memo of lsd before burn it may vary worse but it's still fun to do it in this demo there are two sides of frame for the nft memento after done editing you can click on the button burn admin and the new nfd is created next we can create an instagram post or postcard with nfp it's like a kanwa for nerdy [Music] this image editor you are free to edit your nft app you can add in text on it after complete the editing you can win a new nft send to your friend directly or let them redeem with a unique link free nft we imagine nft thank you so that was a good demo i was curious so is that editor that you seem to have built uh is that something you built from scratch for creating all the nfts oh no the this uh data is an open source point nice and it can sort of do multiple things is it like yeah uh is it only for pictures or is it also like uh i was trying to understand what uh currently i think it's only for picture got it yeah and how are you connecting that to the um like what other stack are you using to connect this um just uh react and ethereum currently i'm using the hotpad template did you store this the nft4 tools somewhere where did you finally not yet because i'm starting this project quite late so i i'm not i only around half day to compete oh nice that's good that's really good did you enjoy working and sorry did you enjoy your canon test project oh yeah okay what is it that you wanted to add to it i think i saw in your notes that uh you the deadline uh you were not fully sure and so you had to uh implement whatever you had made so if you had a little more time or let's say beyond the hackathon what would you want to work on actually i think there is a one more interesting feature which is like integrate that audios the music music sharing protocol so when you create a postcard you can create a postcard with music so there is a what i'll say the postcard nft can combine with your own nfd and the music from marketplace so so this idea come up and um because uh recently uh there are many type of avatar nft so i'm thinking is it is there any new usage for nfd other than just for our tag so this idea come up cool all right if there are no more questions then i guess we'll move on yeah thank you so much for your presentation thanks all right and that was actually our last team for the day so um we're just gonna wrap up now thank you again so much uh judges for taking your time taking the time to come uh give feedback to the projects um hopefully you enjoyed seeing some of them as well um and yeah that is it feel free to uh leave the call now and then uh thank you yeah all right see you everyone
