okay just give me a sec all right all right we're good good morning afternoon evening everyone it seems like this is the common thing of this face right wherever you are anyway hello um my name is lei bing i'm joined by my colleague leilani we've both got very similar names at the start uh hi we're going to give you a talk today on how you can use covalent api to build your depth or nft project it's gonna be quite exciting hope you're having fun hacking away today so i'll briefly touch on the um web 3 trends lately before going into what how we solve uh the problems that you might face as an analyst or as a developer in this space using covalent api uh how to access the nft data using the api as well as linnani will be going through some resources that you can use as well as the taking you through some of the bounties that we put up for this hackathon and the project demos [Music] okay if you're in this hackathon you would already know right that crypto and nft are the big thing within the last one or two years not just one or two years but for a while but it basically exploded in the last one or two years right we saw like fintech and crypto merging um we saw big nft drops by global brands like nba and adidas and we saw governments really taking the step to understand it further even though they hold quite a skeptical view towards it most governments of course there are those that you know fully went on with adopting it as their main currency right so but within the general trend of its technological development it is we're still pretty much in the early stages um whereas some has argued that we've moved away from the early adopters to the early mainstream stage i believe that's the phrase that they're using right now and if you see the adoption of technology in the us chart um you know it paints quite a good picture as to how long it takes for some some of these key things that we've already taken for granted nowadays to become mainstream and to become normalized right last year of course was a huge year for nfts um after the 69 million dollar sales by people uh it basically jotted everyone into you know waking up to this thing right and we saw the average bought ape selling for 200 000 usd we saw the explosion of pudgy penguins and last year alone the nft market became a 40 billion market right and to give a bit of context the global art market something that has existed for centuries like a global institution was uh 50 billion dollars in market size so within just one or two years we see this you know a couple of jpegs i don't know whether you can call them that to basically rivaling the global art market and we believe at covalent right that the future is a multi-chain one there's gonna be billions of data points on blockchains and it's gonna be dozens of blockchains and there will be thousands of applications like how we're using now but on chain and there'll be billions of users on chain there's some problems with that future though because one thing as you would know when you're working in this space is data interoperability sometimes it's hard to for ecosystems to talk to each other that's why they're building bridges and stuff right but bridge technology is still maturing um and uh blockchains produce lots of data the problem is a lot of them are disorganized hard to navigate and hard to understand [Music] so what is the covalent api what do we help you solve we are basically an api endpoint service and if you're familiar with that that just means that we give you a endpoint a url and then you can just use the endpoint to access all the blockchain data right we are one unified api meaning that you can use one endpoint to access up to around 26 27 blockchains that we are currently like indexing that means all you need to do is to change one digit within the endpoint to switch from let's say ethereum to uh clayton or solana and you'll be able to get the same kind of data of course we have lots of different kinds of endpoints for different kinds of needs and today i think our focus will be talking about the nft endpoints and the kinds of like nft data that you'll be able to get and of course you can uh just key in the endpoint to that browser to pull all the data that you need or you if you code you can put it in your python script or your javascript code and everything will come out nicely so where do we come in this crypto stack of course blockchains themselves host and produce data they're the distributed ledgers we are the data layer that uh packages up this data uh makes it easier for you as a dev or analyst to not need to host the node whenever you just want to like get some data and lots of times when developers are building apps they need multi-chain data right they just they don't want to just host one node for one blockchain you're just gonna be it's just gonna be tough right and uh so they use us our endpoints to power their applications some of our clients have built uh wallets uh nft galleries um dashboards etc anything that requires blockchain data on chain data and our users mainly comprise of as i mentioned earlier analysts and developers [Music] and our endpoints have been currently being used by some of the big names in this space i'll be handing it over now to leilani who will be going through our nft endpoints in particular as well as taking you through some of the bounties and the demos leilani please do you want to sauce it over to me so i can screen share mine uh yes yes hold on there you go okay cool you should be able to see that um yeah so within the past year um kind of was like being mentioned with the rise of nfts and popularity there uh we've been adding a lot more nft end coins just because we're seeing some really cool use cases come out of that and actually hackathons such as this one that are particularly focused on the nft space um so we actually released two new endpoints to that list yesterday and those are some of the ones that i'm going to showcase later but i'll give you an overview of what's kind of currently available um so as we kind of touched on the problem the problem with blockchain data in general is this like lack of standardization and it's a bit messy and it's kind of hard to obtain that's made a lot worse even when it comes to the nft space um because it's a bunch of individual contracts um and there aren't really common standards um so it's hard to just obtain collection data um and also a lot of nft marketplaces although the major dominant one is openc some have their own apis but you don't get anything across markets so there isn't really a way to aggregate that data and that's what our latest release was kind of aiming to solve so some of those data points that people are interested in include like comparing historical price and volume or understanding the market market cap across like more than one market so um yeah we're really excited about what's coming up next and continuing to add markets to these and i'll show you like a walkthrough of our docs and some of the use cases in a little bit um so this is the current kind of state of the nftn points in our docs so this is if you went to our api reference page you'd be able to try all these in the browser um so the first one is actually our balances endpoint um but this fetches erc2721s as well so for any address you could pull all of your token balances but you can also pull your nfts uh that way as well and then the second one uh one and the third one and the fourth one and that top chunk are basically things that have been around since sort of like the nft boom in the summer so this is where we saw a lot of cool galleries come out and people building like 3d walkthroughs of your wallet so you can display your nfts so this kind of returns like all of the metadata that you need and it gives you the collection the token id displays the image or the gif or whatever it is um and yeah we saw really a lot of interesting things that you could do with this um but there was still kind of that gap in like aggregating the data and that's been something that we've been working on for quite a few months now and really really excited to be releasing the nft market global view and then the nft uh historical data per collection so basically um we have an nft endpoint now that gives you like a snapshot of the entire blockchain that you're searching all of the marketplaces that we support on that and then it aggregates like market cap data and floor prices um and it ranks all of these different collections by name and by their market cap so this is super cool and we'll be showing like a replit template that we made that you can also fork and use later on um and then if you want to drill down into particular collections you can see all of that data historically and you can actually like display a sample array of those images um so it's a really really powerful tool and still kind of in beta too so um keep that in mind but we're like really excited to be seeing what people can already get started with so yeah those are the nftn points um yeah as i mentioned these are the new ones and then our bounties for the hackathon um so we are oops come on there we go um so we have a four thousand dollar usdt prize pool um so we were requiring specific endpoints to be used in this and i think we just opened it up so it's broad but these are probably the ones that are the most relevant but definitely just take a look through the hackathon resources which i'll go through next uh to see which things might interest you to build because there's a lot of ways you can combine endpoints and you're not really limited here but yeah again those are the uh those are some of the project ideas that we've commonly seen so like nfp storefronts um or marketplaces or wallets um i think in this space particularly like the visual element is kind of cool and important and sets you apart so a lot of people like to use their creativity with these builds because uh you can you can build like a whole bunch of wallets but you can make them all look different and you can set your own unique spin on it so that's kind of something to keep in mind um there we go and then onto the resources so i'll go through these in depth for a little bit um so there's two primary places that you need to go for all of the information on covalent so one is our knowledge base that's the covalent hq.com docs and then the other is our api reference page so this is actually where you can try the 10 points live um and i'll just do a quick walkthrough of both of those actually so should be able to see this now um so this is covalent hq dot com docs this is where you would go for all of the more in-depth information that you want or to see a little bit of a better description on all of the different supported networks so you can start up here at the overview and this kind of just describes in general a little bit of what we covered at the beginning of this presentation and an overview of the whole thing and then if you click on developer and expand that you can check out some of the other tools that are available to you so like primer it's kind of a way to add an extra layer of filtering over some of your api requests um and then you can check out the project showcases in here too for more inspiration and ideas i think this is a really useful resource for hackathons or just like all the time to kind of see what people are building and these are broken down into categories so pretty commonly we see like deck solutions um nft solutions wallet solutions and then some of the other things in here um but yeah definitely check some of these out there's like always um a little bit more detail in these and then usually a link to the project so yeah and then if you wanted to go through our supported networks um you can expand on this so we are up to basically a 26-ish if you include all the test nets for these so that's another thing to play around with um and then you can click on any particular network it'll give you a little bit of an overview and chain id all of this is primarily available in the api reference as well but it's useful to just check which endpoints are supported and if you just want a little bit more information for whatever network you're planning on building on or if you're going to build on multiple because that's the magic of the unified api uh and then yeah lastly this alchemist section that's our community um so we do have kind of some more like tutorials and stuff that we're working on adding to this point um but if you're interested in anything community related i just recommend joining covalent discord so without further ado um let's go to the api reference page so it looks pretty similar to the knowledge base um when you arrive you're gonna just get greeted with the same overview and then all of our end points are listed here on the left column so you can peruse them so class a endpoints um these are broad like queries across any chain that you can make so just a lot of transactional data um you can segment these by like contracts or by the topic or this is where all of our nft endpoints live which you can see here on the side and these bottom two are the ones that are newly released so um then below that less relevant i think for this hackathon but these are class b endpoints so these are protocol specific um so things that are like specific to uniswap or something but if you want to go check these out um you can go down here and when you click try it live you can actually do this with any of our endpoints and you can basically get like a sample response and this just allows you to know um yeah what the response is going to look like and what format the data is in so when you do our latest one for nft market global view um it's just going to batch like all of the responses like this to make it a little lighter and then you can expand those and basically you'll see like the collection name the address and then all of the market data basically so like the volume of the exchange and like the prices the floor prices so we're able to calculate that across all of the marketplaces that are currently supported which is awesome and you can see that if you expand the supported markets tab right here um yeah and then if you wanted to drill down so you could you could peruse these basically it shows you all of these collections um and then if you wanted to drill down into a particular one that's where you'd use this get historical data for nft collection so that's um going to just give you more specific data into one of those basically so you can fill it in here you can just try the sample live and it's going to give you a response like this and then you know yeah for all of these different individual board apes basically like their particular on-chain sales data which is really cool because a lot of nft data is like off-chain so far um also if you want we have a global navbar if you haven't been through our api docs before so you can pre-configure like the chain that you want to work on and the response currency um and then you can set these developer and analyst modes so that'll populate like throughout this entire documentation and then right now i'm in developer mode so this is returning all these responses to me in json format but you can also do analyst mode and then it'll give you a tabular response like this so this is super useful again for like analysts which are the other large component of people that use us and i'm more on that side as well so i like to see a spreadsheet um and yeah this is really great for like ranking and uh perusing market caps so along those lines um we're developing a code template right now that you can actually use during this hackathon so if you go to our covalent replit um you can see our nft market cap demo so this is something that we're building and kind of in beta but like uh if you you can open it directly in here you can open this site um but basically uh this shows you um like a tabular view that's a stylized view of our global endpoint response so in this case the chain is ethereum and this is all of the collections on ethereum ranked by market cap so it's pretty cool um and pretty powerful so far because i haven't really been able to play around with it before uh before we release this and then it shows you some other stats like this and right now we just have ethereum and polygon on here um but you can check like both of these things polygon will typically give you slightly faster responses because um there's like a little bit less on there in the history of crypto uh yeah you can see all the like funny names of a lot of the nft collections which is always fun for me but then you could actually click on like a particular nft collection and it should load uh the symbol the 24 hour hour volume you can adjust like this uh time frame here to see these floor prices that we've calculated um and then it should actually give you like a preview so these are things that you can directly like fork and build on uh you just have to click for grapple here so yeah we're trying to make it like really as easy as possible to get started with this stuff um and on that note just some of the other like uh demos or projects that have been using the nft apis like not the ones we just released because that was yesterday but the other ones um you can see what some people are able to build so this is pandora express they're part of pandora finance and they use our apis to basically like display all the metadata in this way um same with binance nft marketplace actually they're using covalent so um it's a pretty useful tool if you want to create a marketplace or create a gallery which we'll go to next this one is like the uh you've probably seen this if you've been to any of our workshops because we always showcase this one because it's pretty cool but it's a 3d gallery so basically you like drop into this little metaverse situation after inputting a wallet address that's just holding an fts and then you enter the door if you can make it and then it just displays the same kind of metadata but in a creative way and some of these are taking longer to load i think it depends on the chain or whatever the call is doing but uh yeah and if you had a lot like you can walk through and you should be able to see like it should fill up the walls basically um with whatever's being held in that wallet so we just really like this example because this is like kind of what i was mentioning before it's a cool way to set yourself apart from the crowd i think um and along those lines we're also seeing some more people using like gaming tools um so like unity for this one um they just created this sample where you can basically input like a random id and it'll show you a 3d version from this one collection that they've inputted here which is sweet um and then yeah this is actually something that our head of developer relations was just playing around with the other day but i thought it was really cool so i wanted to show it but using that same or i'm gonna quit worlds because the sound using that same uh like kind of drag and drop sort of like gaming tools um you can create like little worlds like this but we're seeing more and more use cases where people basically can like add in points to walk through your own world and showcase the visuals um through like uploading that metadata so yeah it's a super super powerful tool at this point and we're just like really happy to be unveiling it and seeing what people are able to do and i think there's a lot in the chat and only a couple minutes so i'm going to stop sharing i think we can talk about it but yeah thanks okay thanks guys for listening and thanks leilani um shout out harish at the end forward so we'll be entertaining more questions how much time do we have left uh we've got four minutes right to feel free to post your questions in the chat and uh yeah if if you guys want i i guess come out for mute and ask away i see this question by enoko um you know asked can you fetch a number of assets for sale for each collection and don't mean sold for sale currently okay i get what you mean yeah so though because we're only on chain data so or well you can fetch um you can fetch that in other ways i don't think you you can use it particularly when we're calculating like our price data in the new endpoints because that's all based on sales that have happened um but if you want to list like a different topic hash like if a call is made that's um like a listing or like put for sale you can you can go through those using topic hashes or something like that um do nfts need to be 3d files oh that's a good question um i haven't played around with it but i don't believe so because our it's directly connected to the api which basically just like gives you a url that like displays that image or gif and everything in those worlds is just kind of like flat but i'm not sure how that's happened actually that's a good question we can add some of these into our discord afterwards because our other teammates are playing around with the 3d animations themselves great thank you thanks is it possible to create and run custom queries using covalent data would you like to take this they yeah i think i'm not exactly sure which point you're asking because you can like create custom queries within the parameters but then if you want to create custom endpoints um that's something that we're actually working on this year so um i think you can use primer for that right too yeah yeah you can use my filter wait let me just get you the link for primer and you can play around with it basically allows you to slice up the data a bit more and get the return that you want documentation developer primer okay there you go is one form of custom query i think that you might want to check out uh but i don't think it is like completely customized it can be completely customizable most of most of the time what i and i'm doing is just taking a look at the return response and seeing if my data is uh kind of there and if it's there i'll do some cleaning up with javascript or whatever front end that you're using okay if there's no more questions i believe it's time right luke yeah yeah yeah um maybe one more question if if anyone's feeling adventurous but i think if we're ready to go we'll end the session here um thank you both of you for being here and thanks to our audience for participating the questions have been really great it's been a great session so super stoked to see what you all build over the weekend and um if you want continue the conversation in discord i highly recommend reaching out to leilani and making uh both uh great great teammates to work with so we will see you guys here thanks for joining thank you guys
