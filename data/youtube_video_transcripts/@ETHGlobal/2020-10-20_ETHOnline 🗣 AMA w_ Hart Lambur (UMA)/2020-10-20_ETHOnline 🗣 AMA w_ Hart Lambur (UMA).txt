it's okay the awkward pause is good i mean we could just always just power through the awkward pause but then the one time we do it's gonna be the time that didn't end up working so murphy's law will be applied yeah always it's very close and okay we're good all right let's get this thing started then um awesome well you know first of all i'm really excited to have heart here from the human uma team uh you know we've had at uma as a sponsor of our events for for now a very very long time um and they've been a huge supporter of ours uh no matter if that's us starting hack money from scratch or just kind of our typical in-person events uh you know they've been kind of a mainstay and we're very very thankful for their support and of course it's been amazing to watch them grow as a company and as a protocol over all these years as well um so yeah well long story short you know very happy to have you here heart and excited to be uh chatting and having this nice anime conversation yeah thanks jacob i mean uh it goes without saying that it's been really amazing to watch you guys you and kartik and andrew like your whole team um grow the eth community um and you know it's funny man i'm not a hackathon or a guy i've never really been active on a guy before but these events the in-person events were like energetic man they're they're cool and um i think it's been pretty wild to watch you guys try to bring some of that same energy in a different format right to online online events during covet times so it's great it's great to talk to you as always appreciate it man um awesome so yeah so i like to start these people who are who have watched some of these now are getting used to the formula like i'll have to start but kind of chatting a bit before puma right before you may and before you work on what you're doing now um we'd like to kind of get an idea of sort of like where did you first what did you first start working on and then sort of what were sort of the first things that you you started your career on and and would love to kind of know a little bit more about that that journey that process from uh from getting to to where you started to to you know eventually founding uma and working on that project yeah man um so i started in toronto like you uh i'm a canadian as well and i went to high school there um and i went to university in the states and studied computer science um because i've been a computer nerd for a long time um and then actually you'll find this funny and it maybe has something a little bit to do with um some of the the ethan crypto stuff i actually um when i graduated from university i wanted to get a job in technology in new york city and there was no tech scene at that time in new york like none whatsoever and so i needed to get a job with a big company to get me a visa and the banks were the only ones that were hiring and then i got hired by goldman sachs which i never expected and ended up working not in technology but in their front office as a bond trader so i traded interest rate swaps and government bonds for eight years sitting beside my co-founder alice allison for five of those eight years and that was through the financial crisis and i did like all this crazy finance that i never expected to do um and so that got me deep into finance um and how markets work um and then i left in 2013 to start a fintech company called openfolio um which was sort of this it was a it was an interesting play to try to aggregate data around how people invested to help use this aggregated data set to help people make better investment decisions um and what was really interesting about that is we could actually see that people made all the same mistakes um they were they day traded too much they speculated they should have just been long-term investors um and it was interesting thing that that got acquired by a company um uh in 2017 and left me free to work in crypto which is what i should have done all along but left me free to work in crypto and that's been really fun and again because i have a finance background and i knew crypto stuff from early on in 2013 i shouldn't have started open folio i should have started crypto company but i've been following it for a while and the thing that's been really cool is like like taking all of my finance knowledge along with allison's and applying it to helping um helping the ethereum community mainly um understand crypto financial concepts and how to build uh financial products um here so long answer awesome no i the long answers are what i'm looking for so that's perfect um i mean so you mentioned you should have started your crypto startup instead of open folio i guess kind of um so i mean i guess obviously openfolio worked out pretty well so i mean that's not not to say that that didn't go well but um what was sort of your aha moment on crypto then like it seems like it happened pretty early like you know when did you realize that like oh this is actually something really cool that i should spend at least some portion of my time and now almost you know all your your time in uh when did it click for you and then what was that click the click i think is so i look at economics as like the study of uh uh human decisions like how do you and how do you compel somebody to make a decision and then i look at crypto as really kind of being this way where you can program incentive structures and to me that's kind of where things clicked where um i love the idea of programming like things programming logic i think that's really cool but nothing has really allowed you to program incentive structures or program like economic incentives the way crypto has and when that kind of clicked and that by the way i mean give a shout out to ethereum bitcoin didn't make that click ethereum made that click ethereum once you got to smart contracts and you could actually like program these things this is kind of wild where it's like okay cool i can straight up program incentive structures for actors individuals participants to do things um yeah right and i guess you know as a key to that it's like have those structures be publicly available and visible and trustless and you know etc etc right because i mean you can do some level of this in web 2 but not in a way that is you know as obviously transparent right like you know there's just no way that you can actually have this guarantee right there's always going to be a shred of doubt if you will um yeah exactly yeah makes a lot of sense no totally totally like like you could imagine you create your own centralized fake money in a web 2 center service and you like build like to some extent you can think of like um in-app game gaming or in-app monetary systems is kind of a version of this right but it could never really get big because you know zynga or whatever farmville like you you could lose all your wealth i think doesn't vitalik tell a story right where it's like you know he had his favorite video game and then all of a sudden like they changed the rules of it and it was heartbroken or there's some story like that right um yeah i think that's right yeah yeah there's some story like that um so i think that's part of it like it needs to be something that's solid and credible and that can't be taken away from you which is why you know crypto is core to this the other way i kind of look at it to kind of go slightly like philosophical for a second um you know you have incentive structures can be kind of thought of as contracts like your contracts that compel people to do things um and financial products you can go to this whole defy thing financial products all the traditional financial products we look at are really contracts they're financial contracts that say hey some financial service provider is going to pay you jacob this thing if these events happen think of insurance or even the stocks you have a brokerage account or whatever um the problem with that enforcement mechanism is that it's all rooted in your legal infrastructure so you jacob have pretty good access to how those contracts and incentive structures can be written because you're in canada and it's pretty incredible like legal system and but that's not true globally right right um a lot of and it's also siloed like the contracts that can get written to compel you to do things in canada are actually different than the contracts in the u.s or in south africa or wherever you want to pick um and so this idea of using crypto to build a completely alternative enforcement mechanism um for how you enforce incentive structures i think is super compelling and then it's like a global like internet native incentive structure for how you compel incentives i think that's really cool awesome yeah and i think you know we're probably going to talk about how that works on the actual uma platform in a minute um and because i mean obviously that's like what we're leading up towards here but i guess kind of you know the step back here would be um okay so uh to kind of restate where we are so you know you've sort of been thinking a lot you worked a lot in markets um with allison actually your co-founder as well um you know started something new um then exited that that new thing and then like you said you now had time to think about crypto and blockchain right um let's kind of know a little bit more about that time obviously there was a bit of time where you know probably things were in flux and you weren't totally sure on what to do how did you settle on you know uma like what was that thought process was there kind of anything else you tried in between uh that might not show up on your linkedin but you know we'd love to just kind of get an idea of like how you came to this idea yeah totally um so the thought process here actually i was trying to be relatively structured about it where this crypto stuff was really interesting um to me uh it really is a natural infrastructure for finance so to me kind of like i have had this d5 thesis for a while since like call it mid mid to early 2017. the finance just seems like where energy should be focused on um and some people might disagree with me on this but i just i think it makes sense given that crypto is all about economics um and i started thinking through like what were the inventions what's the history of inventions in um traditional finance that led to the well-developed financial system we have today in the fiat world and what do the crypto equivalents look like um and you start to get you when you go down that process you have like lending right so compound and ave um are really important stepping stones and then you start to have ideas of like okay like trading uh derivatives or futures or um that type of thing and this is very like according to kind of what my background was of um interest rate swaps and derivatives and how that could work um and so the first thing that i we wrote um was a paper about how to build uh total return swaps so basically how to create a contract that would let you um create a exchange value transfer risk um bet on things um and our thought process actually here was okay swaps and these types of over-the-counter contracts bespoke contracts make a lot of sense in traditional finance but in crypto people like tokens this erc20 standard is really useful and really valuable so let's look at trying to tokenize these things um and then in the process of trying to design really secure and flexible and extendable uh tokens we came across like the oracle problem right like hey we need to know whether these things are enforced or not and we spent a lot of time thinking through methodologies on how to approach this and we kind of came up with this idea that that's very much parallels on traditional contracts of like priceless contracts where we try to use the oracle as rarely as possible um is sort of this uh this dispute resolution layer which we can talk more about too so that's kind of the history of how we ended up where we are and now we we basically got this platform that lets us create synthetic assets right now expiring synthetic assets you can make out of the box for anything pricelessly um and jacob like to zoom out i think it's kind of wild like right now we've got more than 40 million bucks secured uh pricelessly with no oracle calls whatsoever like there'll be two oracle calls in a three month period and i think that's really interesting which we could talk about um and then we've got a perpetual design that's going to be ready um in a couple months i've how to create perpetual not expiring synthetic tokens and we're trying to make it really easy to have people spin up synthetic assets and i'll stop there right yeah no i mean this priceless piece is like i do want to dig into because i think it's like you know one of the things that i think ny is quite unique to to your design and of course like a really i think novel implementation to it to enable these types of assets so i guess like um yeah i mean like we we had actually the teller ama where we talked actually quite a lot about the oracle problem and how kind of their their approach to solving it and they actually hinted at your approach as well um so yeah so i i mean maybe uh i would love to kind of get an idea about like how do these priceless contracts work and sort of like how can we apply these um like even like if you wanted first of all how does it work and what does that look like and then maybe a quick kind of note about how you can use these in kind of any project that you're building right you know i think it's just key to kind of pull that back to to how this talk connects to the event if you will um but but yeah i would love to know a little bit around kind of the the actual thought process behind priceless contracts yeah so so first thing to note is like the actual oil oracle problem can be contentious right there's lots of ways to solve this um and what i'm what we mean by the oracle problem like i'm gonna define it as this where we need uh to know some bit of information happening off the blockchain so let's call it in the real world we need that to be reported to the blockchain and so to to just abstract away let's forget about how we get that bit of information on chain um in its entirety instead let's talk about like when do we need that information when we need that bit of information about what the price of something is and um the way i like to explain it is just to go back to traditional real world legal contracts and so like jacob like you and i can write a contract um under you know the laws of the province of ontario right that say hey at the end of the month um we're gonna make a bet on whether bitcoin's above ten thousand or below ten thousand and uh we gotta pay each other a million bucks you make a million bucks above i make it if it's below we write this down it's a private contract nobody even needs to know it exists right we both sign it right and um at the end of the month if we don't do what we say we're gonna do um i can sue you or you can sue me and the way that i think it's kind of interesting here is if you think of that contract we don't need an oracle for us to pay out that contract right if we both if we just do what the contract says and we both agree that the contract was fulfilled we don't need to call any oracle at all we don't need to sue anybody we don't need to talk to any lawyers we don't need to talk to any court system um right we only use the court system in the traditional contra in the traditional setup to enforce it if you don't do what you say you're gonna do so another way to look at it is like this is all written optimistically so think like layer two think like what the optimism team is doing with like layer two scaling um you you assume that people do what they're supposed to do and you only use the exit game as this enforcement mechanism to to to kind of compel them to do the right thing if they are misbehaving and the priceless idea is designed to do exactly the same thing where we can watch this contract which is written on the blockchain so we see exactly what the contract is supposed to do everyone that has access to the blockchain can observe the contract and say like hey is this being followed and then we design a system in the economic economic incentives where if a participant doesn't follow it they'll get liquidated and if they just if they disagree with that liquidation they can appeal it to the oracle so it's the oracle is only used to resolve disputes about whether people did what they said they were gonna do and right the biggest reason for this that's like makes us so um i i think i i personally think that um i'll look like d5 contracts in the future will be written this way is just scalability man like you can't have you know thousands or millions or hundreds of millions of contracts written where you're like getting these price feeds pushed chain all the time you instead want to have millions of contracts written though optimistically similar to how they're written like millions of contracts are written in the traditional legal system the oracle should be an enforcement mechanism it shouldn't be like the default thing you look to and then i can talk to other stuff about like you know if you want to make this thing be scalable and fast um like right now with an on-chain price feed kind of the way stuff is written currently you can't do a lot of high speed applications you can't have a lot of leverage because there's a gap between when prices are reported on chain and in that gap like a lot of stuff could happen so you need to weigh over collateralize things and becomes capital efficient it becomes problematic in the design so this priceless idea is basically saying hey let's write everything optimistically let's assume people do what the contract says they're going to do and let's only use the oracle if people disagree um so what can you do today to answer your question and make it more relevant to like you know this ama and the event um the the uma infrastructure can let anyone um define what we call a price identifier that um the the oracle we'll call this dispute resolution system will respond to and once that price identifier exists and is approved which is like a on-chain governance process then you can deploy a contract today that can create synthetic tokens that reference that that price identifier so let's call it synthetic gold or whatever and you can deploy um you can create synthetic gold synthetic apples synthetic whatever you want to do um you can create those on-chain today where there is no need for an on-chain price feed we don't need to push data all the time for what the price of this thing is it's enforced off-chain pricelessly um and it works the crazy thing is that it actually works that we can secure large numbers of large amounts of value without actually requiring any like oracle prices on chain and so um yeah it's kind of only been really man in the last three or four months we've proven that this works in reality and that's been kind of exciting for us no i mean it's been awesome to see like like i said at the beginning i mean um it's been amazing to see kind of the project progress over the years right from very much like uh this i think kind of idea for securing value to now this like actual system that is implemented and securing actual value right like i mean it's been pretty amazing to see that progression um so no it's i think it's very exciting um i did have a question around sort of like uh the the synthetic or the priceless contract design like you said that you know um sort of like in in the real world like you know all contracts don't need to go to the judge um unless there's a dispute right um do you have any kind of like secondary systems in a way that prevent people from griefing the system right like you could kind of see that there would be like an example where um people may just kind of optimistically say that all of these uh things are out of out of black and you know maybe that ends up having pushing all the contracts over to oracle's right um for for dispute resolution like is there sort of like a mechanism inside the protocol that um kind of disable or kind of economically disadvantages briefers and that sort of thing yeah totally um like you know you could say hey don't be an  and don't like trigger this stuff but it that doesn't work and it doesn't work like that environment yeah yeah it doesn't work like that um it's got to be costly so we've looked at these the cost pretty carefully and very carefully um and it made it made sure that it's not economically profitable to just go and like trigger a bunch of disputes if you will um and again to extend the analogy um to the legal system it's it's like saying you don't want to make it um cheap or free to sue people because then you probably would have a bunch of suing people and right now um you can argue that the incentive structure in the legal system is broken it's too expensive to trigger a dispute right if if lots of small guys get screwed over because they don't have the legal resources to go and fight for what they're owed and time and all that kind of stuff so we think about this pretty pretty carefully um and the other way to think to kind of detail that ad is it really is like an escalation game so the logic here um actually the way it works is um uh off you're observing these positions off chain and then the moment somebody dips below their collateralization requirement or aren't doing what they say they're gonna do um they get liquidated so they get instantaneously liquidated they don't have to wait for a price update um but that liquidation and that liquidation will pay a reward to the liquidator but that reward doesn't go out immediately it goes it gets delayed time locked for a period of time during which somebody could dispute it and say hey that's wrong and so then we have these incentives done that if you improperly liquidate somebody it's costly to you you'll make money if you're right you'll lose money if you're wrong and the same with the dispute if you dispute somebody you'll actually make money if you're right and you'll lose money if you're wrong so that we don't have this griefing problem um and yeah and then i'll go back to the fact that like in theory most people have thought that in theory this is really cool and like it's all kind of interesting but they wanted to see it in practice and now we have a few months of data of it in practice and it shockingly works right so liquidations happen they're not really invalid the one invalid liquidation that someone did as i think a test just to see what would happen um got disputed um and we're able to have this whole thing secure a lot of value with like minimal transactions and minimal or actually minimal usage of the blockchain itself right yeah and i mean that's critical right from the scalability and just like cost perspective as well right um okay cool um awesome and then let's see i have a couple more questions let's see how we're doing on time um and then carl i see you have a question in there too um but let's see so i what would be sort of you know you you have this experience of like on the one hand you know working quite quite like a lot of years really as a trader right in the centralized finance world and kind of traditional finance if you will um and now you have these years of like thinking quite deeply about these kind of decentralized finance situations um well like what can d5 contracts do um and like what does defy enable i know we've talked on a little bit from like the legal perspective the contract side of things like that you just can't do like in in the traditional finance world like what is kind of the case for d5 being strictly better right than than what's currently existing you know maybe scale aside but you know basically what can we do i think the most powerful argument is just um it's just all around barriers to entropy or costing entry so if you think about like let's use the example of publishing publishing anything pre-internet to publish something pre-internet you either needed to be like a journalist and a newspaper or like got a publisher to print your book and just cost a lot to actually get information out there and then you lower the barrier to producing information by creating this internet thing and blogs emerge and like podcasts emerge and like all these other alternative forms of creating information and media coming to existence and the cost of disseminating information because the barrier to create it goes way down the same thing is completely true with finance so like financial innovation or new financial ideas um it's extremely extremely expensive to create a new financial product in the traditional financial system um somebody that tried to start a mutual fund told me once you know you need to have 100 million dollars of assets under management to create a new mutual fund that's going to be at all profitable right um d5 completely changes those economics so that people can create new products or new financial ideas at extremely low cost and that to me is the most promising or exciting or interesting thing alive and so it's hard to imagine what's going to emerge out of that but the fact that you can create a new financial product at you know three four orders magnitude cheaper cost than you could in the traditional financial world there's something big there awesome yeah no i think it's uh i think that that's definitely true right like i mean there's so many in a way barriers not just from the financial perspective of being able to take part in these markets but even just from like a regulatory perspective right whether that's like the accredited investor model in the us that restrict certain asset classes or like that like like the scene from like the big short where the guys need to try to get their like isda agreement and they can't get it because they don't have the capital requirements like i mean these are the things that restrict people from being able to trade um and otherwise take part in sort of these markets um and of course none of this is going to exist in this like trustless permissionless model of d5 that we're building um so i think it's i think it's really exciting and a great case for really opening this up and democratizing it for everybody um awesome okay there are a lot of questions coming in so i will start reading some of these off so first question is from carl carl says does uma provide any tools for dow management right now uh i'd probably say no carl like um i look at the the token and the uma token as really being a it is a voting token excuse me where people vote on price requests like the kind of oracle function the the j you're a judge in the system um and it also is a token for changing certain parameters um but i wouldn't say that we're uh we're a dow management platform cool um question from vince i don't know vince do you want to ask this directly are you available sure so my question i was asking based off that that assertion you're making about avoiding um actually making transactions on the blockchain still enforcing um some consensus on what the real world information is so i think the term counterfactual plays here where you're basically the credible threat of bringing in the real world data to enforce the transaction that you're not actually doing it so i'm kind of curious if there's any good examples of that that you have i don't think that's very popular yet uh let me just explain because you you kind of let me just explain like our current system of how that kind of works and then you know you can push me if i'm not quite getting at your question um but basically let's take like the maker dow system um where if you have a maker cdp right now you're pushing um you push data on chain that ensures that that cdp is correctly collateralized and our basic argument here is saying okay let's not have any on-chain data let's just have all the observers off-chain so you could be one observer off-chain saying hey the cdp needs to be 150 collateralized uh i know what the price of eth in dollar terms is over here i can observe this and say whether it's collateralized or not and so literally like as long as nobody is saying it's under collateralized the system assumes it is valid and then you're free to liquidate that position at the moment you choose to at whenever you choose to but if you're wrong it's costly to you so that's like the whole kind of way we look at this where everything is assumed to be correctly collateralized until somebody says otherwise and it's enforced that way does that kind of answer your question yeah i mean well so so that's like an example of one where it can play in you can be basically you're like i call it university cdp being popped by someone who just shows up because the enforcement mechanism was there in the first place so it's a good example of one um but that's yeah it's one example i was just wondering if there's other examples like that one maker that's worked pretty well for them so far uh especially with off-chain data that's more specific and maybe further away from my price data from price pairing so maker is just pairs but what about you know feeding in temperature or something like that is that something you guys have considered uh yeah i mean we are specifically trying to keep our our system fairly narrowly focused on price data on stuff that you can observe and we're specifically doing that just because we want to constrain the problem you know auger is an example of actually like i would say auger we're very inspired by auger in many ways but augur is an example of something else that does kind of follow the same methodology where um you have this escalation game that keeps going up until you have like a fork in the universe right but it's generalized and what they can support and so you could actually argue that auger augers never hit the fork in the universe kind of final step of their process because it's just more and more expensive they figure out truth along the way up um so yeah to answer your question and we're trying to stay narrowly focused around price data because it just constrains the problem and we think we can execute better um in that more narrow scope and it makes it clearer to on the system about what the truth is when you start having stuff that's very ambiguous um it it becomes more of a governance issue or more of like a consent more of a true kind of consensus within a community makes sense yeah you're trying to define it more specifically so you can just go ahead and solve that problem augers trying to keep it wide open and yeah there's but they they still are kind of limited i guess what they've been putting up markets for so far that makes sense though yeah to actually solve the problem thank you awesome um looks like we have a question from the youtube stream from george charles um he's asking about uh the expiring multi-party contracts that uma provides i think in general he's looking for an explanation of sort of what these actually are and uh i guess how maybe you could use them so it says the emp cut yeah this just is our own kind of code that comes from just the history of how we got there so if you start um jacob going back to like the idea of a derivative between two people that is like a bilateral contract between two people um and we had a version with synthetic token where only one person could meet the synthetic token so you had one creator that created all these tokens and the tokens could be traded around here the multi-party refers to the fact that anybody can become a mentor of these synthetic tokens so there's multiple sponsors and multiple creators which meek or die looks this way too where you have multiple cdp creators and multiple lots of tokens so many people on both both sides both sponsors and and token holders and then the expiring is because we have an expert date on it um and i can talk for a long time about um the financial engineering behind why an expiry date um makes for a simpler synthetic asset that will um uh expire to be worth um uh what it what it's tracking um the flip side of that would be making a perpetual version that has no expiry date um and we are actually currently in development on that um we're building in public so it's on our github we're going to have that version audited later this year but it's a very it's a different type of contract so yeah emp is our code name for expiring it has a next predate multi-party multiple token sponsors token holders and we might have something else maybe we'll call the pmp as for the perpetual multi-party contract in the future nice awesome uh cool we're going to hold you to the pmp name it's named here um awesome cool and then another question from carl um says like how is uma's uh uma's governance uh what's it like sorry what is uma's governance like and then how has it performed so far i know you said it's been maybe about four months or so since everything's been going down how's that been so far um i i would say good not not perfect by any means um so we want more voter participation um when gas fees were really high uh you know it actually created a disincentive small voters it actually we pay um one important point here is we pay rewards to voters um who who participate in voting so this is part of the economics around um our whole dispute resolution system that if you're if you're one of the judges here you get paid rewards if you vote and vote correctly where you where correctly is defined as voting with the majority um and so we had a problem right when gas prices were really high that voting actually cost more than the rewards people were getting uh to to vote and so we actually kind of came up with a voter rebate system where we're rebating those transaction fees that's one thing that we came up with in terms of uma tokens you get back your voter fees um as a kind of token reward but generally speaking um uh we are relatively governance minimized so we're trying to have uh we're trying to not do too much on the governance side um it's basically been fairly limited scoped functions and that part has actually worked pretty well so i'm fairly pleased with uh keeping the questions we're asking our community or asking our token holders to be pretty narrow and relatively infrequent gotcha cool and then i think kind of carl's next question touches on i think overall an interesting topic here which is um you know as a rule uma is like trying to touch the chain as least frequently as possible right and of course you also just mentioned another situation where um you know even kind of a unique economic model where that encourages participation couldn't even then clear the hurdle of gas prices and an overcrowded chain so i guess sort of kind of an overall question around scalability you know um so carl's question in particular is you know are you using zk proofs um for the off chain component are you using anything for the off chain component are you considering moving to l2 or anything on l2 just kind of i guess a broad scalability question so i i think it's important to split uh the kind of the transactions our protocol uses into two parts so you have the financial contracts themselves so in this case the emp and what transactions it has and then if there is a dispute and it goes to the oracle what are the transactions that have to happen to resolve that that dispute how do you get the voters happening there so if we split the transactions between those two um the emp contracts or the financial contracts themselves are really designed to minimize oracle usage and truly minimize the number of transactions that have to happen on the blockchain itself and so we don't need a scalability solution that actually works better for now um if we're on the base layer because transactions should be so rare um so there is no zk proofs or anything like that we're literally just observing the blockchain and we're only touching it when um when a contract needs to get liquidated on the oracle side now switching gears to the other side like when there is a dispute or some governance action that needs to get voted on um right now that is being done on the base layer and it's kind of expensive and we we are curious are looking at in a v2 how we could scale those votes uh to make it be more efficient but it's kind of like a separate problem it's like how do we make the we call the dvm the data verification mechanism how do we make that more efficient is a separate problem from how do we make the contracts uh more efficient and i actually think our contracts are super efficient as is and fit very well in a high fee environment gotcha awesome um okay great we're nearing the end of our scheduled time so i'm gonna i'm gonna give the question that i give to everybody at the end um which i know you preface this almost entirely um saying you're not a big hackathon guy or at least not previously to this um but you know given that we've exposed you heavily to the to the hackathon environment i wonder if you'll have a great answer to this question but um if you were taking part in in etho online um right now as a hacker what would you be building and or kind of what areas are you most curious about and um you know what what are kind of the ideas that are floating around your head that you you wish you had time uh to take a look at and that the hackathon would be a great opportunity for that yeah jacob i mean i i i do when i go to your on in-person events i do want to hack on this stuff and i'll be clear i'm going to be like an eath global loyalist i'm only going to hack at east global events that'll be my promise i appreciate that but i i effectively have way too many ideas floating around the back of my head of um how we can make financial products that i'll say for the most part mirror things that exist in traditional finance structures that exist in traditional finance but how we can make those now and today and it's only really been in the last last few months i think that a lot of the stuff has become possible so um creating options and creating structured notes and um this perpetual synthetic contract we're creating and uh just all sorts of other ideas i think they're all possible now um what i'd say as a concrete idea that i think is really cool um our team or this kind of coming out of the community is building um ethereum gas futures so these are going to be synthetic tokens that say have monthly x-rays that will settle to be whatever the average gas price is that month um and so i actually would love to be working on this at a hackathon right now because i think it's a very useful and usable product where you could imagine you have a strip you have like going in the next year january february march april may june and you can see where people are predicting average gas prices to be each of those months and projects like like projects like ours that or rather say some of the high you go to the east gas station leaderboard and some of the projects that are really using a lot of gas they could actually hedge their gas exposure by buying those tokens um i think that'd be really cool that makes sense oil features for gas yeah cool love it um awesome okay well heart thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us and share your views on these things and of course i think you know really excited as i've mentioned to just kind of continue to see uh the progression and what you're building and looking forward to the perpetual uh contracts um and and i mean so much more right so uh yeah big big thank you um both for for doing this and as well as you know supporting uh not just this event but you know many in the past and um you know we've really really enjoyed working with you and um i think you know massive ad to the event and anybody who's looking to uh build with you know really any exposure to the real world as part of their hacks uh take a look at uma they have prizes at the event and of course a workshop and everything on the pages like you'd expect so uh take a look might be a great fit for your hack and thanks again heart thanks jacob pleasure to be here awesome all right take care everybody
