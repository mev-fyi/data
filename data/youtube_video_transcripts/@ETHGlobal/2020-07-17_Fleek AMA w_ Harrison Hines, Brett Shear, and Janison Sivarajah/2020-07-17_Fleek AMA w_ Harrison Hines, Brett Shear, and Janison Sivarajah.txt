thanks guys and bye on the stream okay we're good awesome sweet well let's kick this thing off then great well you know we're really excited starting say MA for hack FS with the fleet team here we have with Bret if Jensen and then we have Harrison kind of all co-founders from from the weak side we're really excited be working with sleep for the hack of s event I you know providing really key I think infrastructure and technology to allow people to build really awesome projects prints event so yeah so you know obviously thanks so much for for being here just so that everybody kind of knows the format you know I'll start off with kind of a little bit sort of early probing questions and then after that we'll move into actual questions from the audience so would probably be about 20 minutes 20 minutes and then probably wrap up after about 45 minutes so cool so with that being said let's kick this thing off um maybe maybe we'll start with bread and then we can just move down the list on your end but I don't look to kind of know a little bit more about just like your early early career like you know if you if you went to school like what did you study what were some of the first things you worked on just kind of get a sense of you know basically where you started yeah sure should we start with just like intros from three of us real quick yeah sure yeah Harrison you want to start are you oh yeah you can go first okay yeah so I'm one of the co-founders in the CEO at fleek doing a whole bunch of different kind of stuff we're pretty still pretty small team relatively speaking so we definitely pitch him a lot of different areas yeah maybe Harrison's sure so um Harrison also co-founder at fleek before this started a company in the space called token and foundry that I worked on with Jennison as well and that's where we met Brett at consensus who's working on another project they're called balance theory and we decided to start a company together in late summer of 2018 we were originally called terminal and then given we've come from like an aetherium background we had started with a focus on the etherium space and then after about a year we decided to focus on the distributed web aspect of web 3 and really focus on ipfs and textile foul coin and so that's where when we decided to rebrand to fleek early this year and and that's about it and when Jonathan nice to meet you all also co-founder CTO and I met red and Harrison while we were at Oakland boundary so yeah very cool awesome so maybe maybe we'll jump back to Brett Brett maybe you want to speak to a little bit about sort of your background and how you got into everything and I guess you know more specifically you know if you you know where you first started your career and as well probably your first maybe aha moment in the crypto space I think that'd be cool here yeah sure all right so I went to school for accounting I studied accounting and I went to graduate school for accounting as well in New York at Fordham and before I even started my graduate program I've learned about aetherium and was meeting people in the New York area especially consensus and that's where the idea like kind of around balance was starting up and so kind of instead of graduating and going to work I'd like a big four accounting firm well I guess I'd my aha moment already just around like aetherium and smart contracts and being able to build new types of applications so I was really excited about that I knew I wanted to get into the space so took the opportunity to go right out of school to consensus and start the balanced project with a couple other guys and yeah so that was like instead of going to take a big four accounting type thing so we built built balance for about a year and a half or so before I decided to leave and go with Harrison and Jameson to start fleek or to terminal at the time but yeah balance was like QuickBooks for crypto type thing helped like having a background accounting I I pretty much like manage all the product and engineers so like you know from like UX to execution of actually building a software and testing it and releasing it and as well as like the business developments as well so like getting like a lot of our customers were like token so companies like a lot of the apps in space like our first three customers were like aragon gnosis and digit style is like 2017 pretty early on so we just like want one by one and got all the different dabs that did like token sales to do their accounting on the platform and then yeah very cool how about maybe Tennyson maybe similar question to you yeah so I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo here in Canada a while ago seems and then I was doing enterprise consulting Deloitte on like very legacy old-fashioned software and then there was a block rumblings around the blockchain aetherium space so when I started looking at it just blew my mind from a distributed smart contracting perspective and that's when I started playing around with it and then we kind of grew the practice there and started doing like VOCs and presentations for a client and then I think I was hitting a plateau there in terms of being able to like a release product and you know things in a consulting environment so that was when I made the switch to consensus and token foundry and that's kind of where I started more on the startup venture kind of side side of things and building a product and it was quite the learning curve at first but yeah and now now here with the terminal and sleek so that's that's been my journey okay cool awesome and then you'll pass them at least in your Harrison a little I think you already tried a little bit of evident in the intro but if you want to add a little bit more color - sure well I'd say as an aha moment I was watching the space I was very interested in the token sales that were happening because before token foundry I had helped early on with a company called seed invest which was big in the crowdfunding world so I lived through the JOBS Act and like that whole regulation and trying to make crowdfunding become a thing and it just never really took off because of the regulations and a few other factors but then when I saw the token sales I kind of had this aha moment that this is what crowdfunding was supposed to be and and after the DAO hack the real aha moment I believe the next sale that happened was singular DTV in like October or November of 2016 and that was the first post Dow hack sale you know it was not sure how it was gonna go and I think it's sold out in like six seconds or something crazy and they raised like I think seven and a half million dollars and that what made me rise like okay this that hack didn't scare that many people away and this is gonna become a big thing and that's when I decided I wanted to start a business around legitimate isin token sales and that's where I met Joe and and started token boundary and then the rest how we got here Brett and Jamison kind of covered yeah also cool not sure who to turn this question over to but you know you know we've chatted about sort of you've all met at consensus you know working on maybe some different projects and then all joining up for fruit hook and foundry at one point how does the idea for sleek then terminal how do you guys kind of get to that idea and and kind of what about that idea is really I guess what would had you pursue it as a full-time company yeah I think after building token foundry and Brett building balance I think we had similar thoughts and ideas there's a lot of people who were building in the space in 20 like 16 17 18 which was like the infrastructure and the process of building on this new infrastructure was pretty difficult and so a lot of the issues and pain points we were dealing with ourselves building companies on top of aetherium we thought you know it would be a good idea to try to make that an easier process and build tools to make the process and running products that utilize these new types of infrastructure are easy and so that was the original sort of idea was to build tools and products that make it easier for people to adopt and utilize web 3 technologies I would say as I mentioned before we started on aetherium because that's where our background was but after sort of like just understanding the whole web 3 landscape and how things we're gonna play out we kind of just went down I would say the ipfs rabbit-hole and like fall of last year and i think you know it was a similar feeling to going down the etherium rabbit hole in 2016 where it was just like wow this what role this could play in the web could be enormous in terms of like how many like its potential and and like being a replacement for tcp/ip or HTTP and we just felt like not many people were paying attention a lot of people are paying attention to aetherium now and what the potential was in the different use cases but we felt given IP FS was launched around the same time as aetherium and given the web stack and you know where our different pieces of it fit in we just felt like there was a lot that like if there's a distributed web ipfs felt like it would be the base and everything else would kind of be on top of that and so we felt at this stage of the market and where we felt like we could like build value was really on top of that so that's kind of how we arrived here from that previous experience gotcha very cool and I think I really want to chat about you know that transition to the ipfs ecosystem maybe in a couple questions from now but I guess maybe I'm curious what did you guys first start with when you first started building out terminal at the point at that time well this is kind of the core features that you guys first built and and kind of what but at that time made it so that the market was like really looking for those types of features so we started as pretty much an infrastructure provider kind of like in fira Alchemy's of the world and we were focused like I think we were a little early but I'm glad to see it's starting to take off now but sort of like trying to abstract away from Mike the smart contract layer and creating like custom api's and things beyond just like a node endpoint so people could do some of the crazy magic they're doing across protocols now with like yield farming and like what defy SAP is doing and stuff like that but in a generalized way but the infrastructure space I would say was quite crowded and the DAP market just isn't that big even still and we saw a lot of people who maybe failed at their first idea as adapt or as a protocol kind of pivot into the infrastructure space so we just felt like it wasn't a battle we wanted to fight there seemed to be some pretty good infrastructure players out there so then we actually pivoted to analytics because we said infrastructure is getting pretty competitive and we're not sure how it's gonna play out maybe it goes more decentralized with things like pocket network and the graph and and people leveraging more like decentralized networks for the infrastructure needs you know there's companies providing the centralized options but what would be something that regardless of whose infrastructure they're using something they're all gonna need and what we saw trend Wireless was that like as in 2017 you have maybe just in fira and like meta mask today's DAPs are way more advanced you're using tons of and one contract back then like a sale contract now yet 10 contracts 15 different wallet providers a few different infrastructure providers so we thought all this data is either with the wallet providers because it's being submitted through their node or their infrastructure providers so the daps didn't really have insight into what was going on and a lot of them are using the same contract so you can't just go to ether scan and like look at what specific activity is coming from your specific front end so we then pivoted from infrastructure to analytics we built an analytics platform that one actually went well we had like 30 or 40 daps using it and it was integrated it was like an SDK they just wrapped all their sources and we would just funnel it all in and decode it and make it super nice and like easy to use but again we just felt that market timing and sizing wise it was hard to justify a business that we felt like we could grow and sustain in the next 1 2 3 years so that's when we really took a step back and started to rethink like what are gaps you know what constitutes adapt is that the correct way to think about gaps is that definition of adapt gonna evolve over time what my taps look like in the future and kind of what we like the aha moment for us was thinking about most of the products we use today and really struggling to understand for 90% of them we're smart contracts might fit in because if you think about Twitter Facebook any social platform any blog or new site you read pretty much anything it's not it's not like initially apparent we're smart contracts might fit in maybe for payments maybe for all but the site experience itself we just felt like you know there are other things that might make sense to distribute or decentralize first maybe it's the host thing maybe it's the storage maybe it's the data there's huge I think pushed with user data issues with the Twitter hack this week with Reddit censoring certain subreddits like it's becoming an issue so we just felt like that was potentially a bigger market and easier transition from web to the web 3 for people to get behind and so that was kind of what made us then finally switch from analytics to ipfs base products and fleek and so yeah it was a quite the journey a few pivots involved we're not done yet but especially in this space it's I feel like what you have to do to survive definitely I think the flexibility I think you know the space moving so quickly being able to be flexible and adapt that you know that's I think the best way to survive cool maybe we'll bring it over Brett you know we keep mentioning terminal which was the old name for fleek maybe would be good to get an idea behind like how you guys came up with I guess first of all the the idea behind rebranding why you felt that that was the right time to do so and and also like maybe just a little bit inside of like what that process was like okay yeah well we're still called terminal we launched the hosting ipfs product so we had stuck with a name we liked the name a lot I guess since the beginning though it was always a bit of confusion slightly where terminals are already a common developer tool and we were building developer tools so we always kind of had on the back of our head but we did like the name and it resonated well for the majority of people and it only we figured it only makes sense to maybe change the name if we were like going to completely focus on something different new so once we launch the hosting product like the immediate feedback was like pretty resounding there was like a lot of beta signups even before we made it public and we one-by-one on-boarded each developer in the beginning like the first hundred to two hundred to get like a ton of feedback and during that process there was like a few articles that when we announced that were shared across a few channels like one of them was hyper news and like some of the comments over there were like talking about our name like eternal name had been confusing they didn't understand it you know I mean I think it was a small amount but like it was at that point we were seeing that this product was definitely the direction that like was working and made sense so that we should double down and really push that way so that's when we were like okay we can we can kind of take the opportunity to go for a rebrand and the naming I think we went through a few different names before we chose fleek try remember the name that we were thinking about before fleek that we almost settled on but we like look remember it just go disco yeah disco because it's like short for distributed computing or like not computing uh I'm blanking I don't remember but anyways yeah there should be two computers maybe but yeah cuz it was kind of like nodes and like weird we were always thinking like that like long term the octopus plot like I BFS protocol a platform like the the way it would grow would be like it would enable like peer-to-peer apps so that like this kind of like distributed like computers or computing or everyone a call would be like you know like a delivery network of apps like so when users use apps like they can deliver each other's content so that was kinda like the long-term thinking we're going for and we thought this goes super cool and it sounded kind of like funky in just exciting but I think we looked it up and family a company that was called disco and and then we were like actually legally changing our name and we had already start talking to lawyers so we kind of had like we were like at last minute like oh we should we should not go with this name we should go the different name and then we fate we came up with a name in like one and one sitting like an hour I think we like went through like a bunch of different names Harrison Harrison's one I threw out the name fleek he said it and then we kind of all just like wow it's be cool and it's short it's five letters like what's like what's all these different or zoom and slack and or does all of them even mean like they're just short and they didn't really have like common uses and and software yet and they're easy to remember and kind of verbs or like easy to talk about so we brought it back and also we thought of the consequence it's hosting if your site is on fleek it's like a cool term and exciting for people to be able to say that their site is like really cool so that was kind of the process of the rebrand the sweet I think just goes a pretty solid into but I think fleex got a pretty cool ring to it um also maybe I kind of love to get a sense of maybe you know the latest launch that you guys had which you also have a bounty attached to for this event which is the space to add Damon I guess you know I'd love to kind of get a quick intro to like what that is and and also just like what what excites you about it maybe I'll go to Jennison for this yeah so it come about because you know as we are moving into our next product around desktop storage called space we needed a place to have a peer-to-peer node and you know do the heavy lifting and it's parallel to like if you download Dropbox and there's the system tray in the corner that sits at the back as like a local back-end for your app and you know your like UI is whether it's the electron app or a browser can interact with it so that's kind of how it came about and then what really excites me about it is you know two things one is you know the ability to gain network effect if it's bundled up with a really popular app now everyone has a note in it and now other apps and web apps can leverage it and then you know the optimizations from that like you know if there's many different apps using textiles falcone ipfs this ability to kind of synergize that computation into one unit and you know if maybe it's one little p2p host that all of them share instead of each one having its own you know being able to share research other resources between those components and just debs being able to quickly start developing on this with a simple API and configuration but the ability to kind of go deeper and extended and add stuff to it and I guess the third thing that's also really exciting is this is kind of how we entered into the open-source community so all things space is open source and I think that's super like the team super excited about it and we've already started getting like outside kind of input on it and so that's the great sighting for me and the team awesome I guess that also means that you know people that are hacking on it over the next month or so have a good opportunity to just make PRS and then fix it themselves if they're having any issues [Music] sounds good awesome and then maybe just like a last question for me and I'll turn it over to the crowd here you know like what what is kind of the next maybe five or even ten years I know it's hard to say especially if you've got you know two pivots under your belts already you know like what's that gonna look like for fleek do you think like you know are you excited about the current track are there other things you're considering adding on top of things you know obviously space you mentioned if you're able to chat about that but just kind of get a sense for kind of you know what the future for fleek holds sure so we are definitely set in this direction for now I don't know if I could swing a fourth pivot and frame it as a positive thing but now we feel good about this direction with each product the traction has come quicker and our potential market is bigger and so that's a framework I think being in web 3 you kind of are just praying you know it's gonna have this explosive growth and you could grow it with it and and create a sustainable business but you know we we want to make sure we survive those five to ten years and really help web 3 hop in and play apartment and so with the moves we're making now it's it's both what we feel could make the biggest impact for helping get web 3 adoption but in like very nice packaged ways that it's irrelevant what's happening under the hood we're really not trying to sell like protocol like features we're trying to sell like value propositions that make sense to end consumers or businesses and so what we are focused on now is like we basically have two different I I wouldn't two different buckets of activity that we're focused on one is the fleek platform which is the developer platform and the goal there is to make it super easy for people to build p2p private encrypted first apps whether they're native apps or web apps and kind of like a firebase for those type of apps and make it just super simple to kind of get and use all these different things you need to create an app or integrate this functionality into an app or a site and take advantage of the benefits and the main benefits we're focused on to start with are the privacy encryption p2p benefits then we did release the space daemon and that is a sort of a prequel or a preview of we're releasing in a few weeks we'll probably announce it next week space desktop app which is essentially a Dropbox alternatives so like what signal is for messaging space is for cloud storage so storing files in the cloud is very web to storing files in space is very web 3 and space is a combination of ipfs textile and optionally file point so if you don't want like you store the the files on your machine or machines you can share and collaborate on files and documents with your team it works with all existing tools but everything is private encrypted by default and when you send or share something with someone it's completely peer-to-peer there's no third party Google or Dropbox or anyone playing gatekeeper and so we just and we use the space daemon to build that app and so what we are showing with the space desktop app is a what you could use the space daemon to build that's just one example it's just basic storage but be what the goal is is that now people could use the daemon or space to build whatever front-ends they want off of like the heavy lifting the daemon does so you could bill it a private user own github or slack or reddit or whatever you want and use these open source frameworks to kind of like do it super easily and now you have a fleet platform that makes it easy to build them and then we kind of are focused on besides the platform like I said the space desktop app and really trying to uh sure in a new generation of apps that do put privacy and user on data first and use your own accounts first and kind of like we feel that's a pretty good like road into getting web to people to use web 3 and it's not like necessarily everyone knows how signals encryption work they just kind of understand the value proposition and use it and so that's what we're trying to accomplish with space is not necessarily need someone to know how ipfs works or falcone works or textile works they just know I could use this instead of using Dropbox or Google Drive and now I am a hundred percent certain that only me and the people I share these files with are the people who have access to these files and no one's spying on me and so on and so forth so that's kind of like what we're focused on and are good and we are hopeful that a product like that could pick up very quickly in terms of use Dropbox alone has 500 million users cloud storage is something most people in the world are familiar with using and we do feel that a good portion of people do you care about the privacy and if you have a product that is private by default or you have someone spying on you by default and both products are pretty similar feature wise and what you do with them that people will especially with everything going on in the world this week in this past few months we feel that privacy and encryption and M p2p are gonna be like sought-after features and benefits of not only cloud storage but other products that we hope people build using the daemon we just used to build space and that's kind of what we're betting on for the next 12 to 18 months but that space app will be out next month so we hope by September October we have a pretty good idea of that if the market agrees with our assessment of product market fit very cool that's awesome I yeah I mean as somebody who uses cloud storage every day as the key functionality would be great for that piece of my my life and my stack if you will to also be decentralized so you've got a user here so just let me know when it's that amazing we will definitely get you on video list and it sounds good sweet awesome so maybe I'll turn over here you just want to see as anybody in here I have a question for about fleek to the fleek team if so you can either raise your hand or just unmute that would help to if not I can keep asking questions you all right maybe I'll just keep asking questions um awesome like I guess I asked question the last one I think it was pretty interesting to hear you know what I guess early stage when you were building out terminal at that time they look to kind of know about some of the kind of best decisions you made kind of early on that you think kind of led you to success or otherwise cut things going and then sort of like some of the kind of tougher decisions that didn't pan out the way you expected he great to kind of hear a little bit about those those early days and some of those tough decisions yeah for sure so I would say I'll start with the mistakes coming off of the token foundry success and the craziness of the market we definitely hired too quickly and grew too fast before proving anything in the market and we took way too long to launch our first product without getting any feedback and like you know kind of just thinking we knew what was right and what was best and we were pretty wrong and we like wasted a lot of time and a lot of money and early on figuring that out that was the biggest mistake the best thing we did right is not a being too married to our own original ideas putting ego aside being able to say all right we were wrong what's wrong here let's figure it out and let's fix it not once but twice and continually we're always relooking at what are we doing does it make sense like can we believe this story cuz if we can ourselves believe this story it's gonna be very hard to convince other people whether it's investors or users of the product or what-have-you so I would say the best decision we made was we had some pretty good success with the analytics product I mean we had 30 or 40 integrations within three months of launching it we launched it I believe October like first and by the end of the year we had 30 or 40 integrations but it was really at that point I think most people would have said alright this is working let's keep going and instead we kind of extrapolate it out and said where could this be and twelve months from now you know instead of thirty dots maybe we have a hundred or you know two hundred how quickly is this market gonna grow and is this gonna be something where we could get to cash flow breakeven with the money we still have just to be able to control our own destiny and not have to rely on venture capital because we don't know how long this market is gonna play take to play out and so we made the tough decision to not only not continue to focus on analytics and do something new but also make the decision that running this analytics product is a waste of resources and infrastructure cost so let's just completely shut it down and so we did from like new idea launch product get traction and shut it down all within like a four month time span but it focused us it allowed us to downsize it cut our infrastructure costs and it allowed us to put all of our attention on to the new ipfs direction which we inside believed was the right move so it was a tough few months it was hard to convince investors and people what we were doing wasn't insane but luckily we were right and we came out of the other on the other side of it at least okay for now still have a lot of work to do to really you know make it but you kind of have to trust trust your own gut because as the entrepreneur and the co-founders you're it's really like investors can give you guidance but they don't know at the end of the day what's best and no one will really know besides you what's best and sometimes you're wrong sometimes you're right but I think Nepal says it a lot but the biggest indicator of startup success is how quickly a team can iterate and I think that's very true so we kind of live by that motto that's awesome that's a super bold decision I you know I'm happy to see that that panned out for you yeah that is a very tough choice so the good answer yeah cool so I guess you said like you said you guys are kind of very focused on on fleek and everything but you know if you were to put yourself in the position of some of the people hacking like basically if you had a month of free time and resources and people to help you out what do you think you'd built for hack FS like what like what are some of the ideas you've been playing around with yeah what would you build so we're of the opinion that there could be a new renaissance in terms of DAPs that is about to happen and we think like it'll basically be not like the token sales and t5 but it'll be applications that are built on top of this distributed web stack where privacy and encryption p2p focused apps are built and so that's really what I think is most exciting because none of this was possible six months ago I mean textiles work that they've done to actually make like encryption on top of IP FS possible with their you know just threads and buckets and their whole protocol and infrastructure set up and how that benefits using IP FS and what's possible and now with the launch of file coin it's like you know you you it's really like you know privacy encryption is a big trend and p2p you know slack Spotify some of these zoom these big companies are already already leveraging some of these technologies but they're just doing it for their own internal benefit now with things like power gate with textile with the space daemon which makes it super easy to just access all those things and a few API calls you can make a private like basically all you have to do now is build a front-end and you could build a private p2p version of github of slack of you know a product Instagram reddit whatever YouTube whatever you could possibly imagine is a big product in web 2 now the stack is ready to actually build that on a web 3 user own p2p stack where they use its on the user's machine they have their own keys they own their account they own all the data but they could log in and access you know this application and not need to worry about a big company spying on them or censoring them or doing whatever so really when you think about that stack and what it enables anything is possible so I think there are easy low-hanging fruit of web 2 products that are popular and work but have censorship issues or user data privacy issues like the hack that happened with Twitter this week that can happen with any company that can happen with github and there's articles people were writing about how depth like dangerous that is where you could pay an employee to go delete some repo code and your entire organization could be really like really embed like it just if you have the option of not sharing your data with someone else if you don't have to why would you and so if you take that value proposition you could pretty much apply it to any use case of the internet or product that people use on the internet or on their phones and so it's really I would pick something that you're personally interested in because startups always work out better when you're working on a personal like passion project but leverage these new technologies to create that product but with privacy encryption and p2p first so like that's literally I think what most apps will be in five to ten years so and we just released the daemon it makes it super easy textiles releasing a bunch of cool stuff file coins about to launch so now is the perfect time to be like the you know first mover potentially leader in that product but you know taking privacy and user data seriously I think will be a winning formula this deck and people like Fred Wilson agree and you know it seems like privacy encryption p2p will be the trend of this decade so now is literally the perfect time okay agree more zombies Brett as far as like building like in the hackathon to like how like how could you like kind of show this off I think that you know like Harrah's something like be pick like a use case you picked like some sort of app that you think should have user controlled accounts and data whatever that is like and apply this kind of like data structure to its architecture to it where you know whatever whatever the app is maybe it's like a youtube app or so like whatever files you up the user uploads or you know videos that are uploaded etc like they can be the app itself can actually point to the users local like space like they're there Damon on their machine and they can the user can like store all the data that they upload all his data that they interact with through the application and that really is like I mean we've been talking about what's the centralized web users story on data for years and like this is like a really tangible way to attack it it's like alright let the user actually like if he's running a daemon on the machine can just store all that locally and then actually build and have an interface where the app as they need the data can like interface with them there looks like having a sort of API where the app can say all right as we need data or information to to surface more to make you know experiences with the app we can like request that from the user and let the and sort of like via interface and but the actual like data the repository the data is on the user's machine and it's as private as they want it to be so like being able to show that off is like I think a huge milestone and if you could like even just POC that with with some sort of app and the hackathon would be like I think mind-blowing and then just to think about it like you know you the daemon itself sure like it's it's right now it works best with like native apps so like if you have a native app if you're building native app and that's where the experience is built around it's really perfect if you're building around a web app the user does like what we'll need to have like the daemon like locally however like we do we are creating making it so that the daemon can like so that the actual it can kind of be like hosted as a service instill trust las' so you can provide a web app experience without the user having necessarily have like the daemon locally on the machine as well as obviously when the space app comes out like that will be an option for apps you'll to point to it's like a directory to store app data so like those are both coming out like very soon I'm so like thinking about I'll be able to hit like it really stalled POC that like really shows off like this D web ethos where the user is controls or account interacting with an app and all the data that they they interact with that app is stored like locally and let's the app use it as they please and then realizing okay this is a really good POC even if it's locally on the machine and that you know this can be hosted for the user so they don't ever have to download anything or also that like they could have a space app they could have this kind of Dropbox clip on we're like they can store all their app data in one place but even more like so that's kind of like thinking long-term it works out and even so like once the use of any desktop app uses a daemon like as there's like more of an ecosystem around this daemon and like there's more desktop apps using it or just like any type of app using it other apps and websites can take advantage of that so it really just needs to get in there once so the space app is probably is one way but other popular apps can also bring this to more users and bring this kind of like a sort of like operating system or way that apps can interact and a more like peer-to-peer privacy focused away so long term it I think yeah the experience is definitely going in the right direction awesome turn it over to Jennison maybe for the last word on this and really wrap up after that yeah I think as far as like hackathon projects like Harrison and Brett mentioned definitely around like the existing apps like Reddit and Twitter you know those are proven ideas but obviously have the issues of censorship and and data but then I think one idea that our technique Daniel mentioned which I thought was great um was just having like a way to share schemas and and between apps because like if you make a health app and you know you're storing the users data on that you want another help tap to leverage that instead of recreating it so the ability to discover different data sets and the schemas and then you know it have make sure that they're I think that's the foundation to make them interoperable between different apps so that would be a that was a cool one we didn't pursue that one but that's another cool idea yeah that's kind of jump soda in addition to the other ideas Brett and Harrison mentioned yeah that it's cool I think that they'll probably be like like we wanted to be an app ecosystem for sure around this obviously and and you know as an as apps make like the interfaces of how they want to like request data from user is like another is an aspect to it we're like yeah being able to have like plug-ins for different types of apps like I think you know you could take current web to app that isn't as you know like a reddit etc could could use it now like they could say all right we're done storing user data like let's just create the proper interface to to direct everything to like a local space and but like for users right and then we'll like I also have his interface to be able to read data as we need and want but not actually have to store it on our server etc so yeah I think like it could be it could be put in now I want to Janice's point like the hopefully will be an ecosystem around like the bright schemas interfaces for apps like interact with users being able to store things locally and interact with very cool awesome well I hope everybody on this call you guys are taking notes just saw you know like like I think what Harrison said like you know this is really the perfect timing I think for a lot of people to be the first more movers and whatever they build and I think that's gonna be a really big deal so awesome so you know I think I speak for everybody a big thank you to the fleet team for for coming out and chatting with us and you know like I said at the beginning we're really excited to have you guys on board of course everybody in the chat you know look into what they're offering as their prizes you know just from the hosting perspective or whether that's using this space taemin they've done a lot of cool tech that'll make your project a lot faster to build so take a look at that and again thank you so much gentlemen for coming out and we will end it here thanks a lot thank you for that take everybody
