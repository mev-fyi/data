it takes a few seconds sorry stand by no problem hi everyone welcome back to the web3 jam my name is michelle lee um i lead the builders funnel group at falcon project and protocol labs that spans the gamut from hackathons grants accelerators devrel basically we're here to make your builders and entrepreneurs dreams come true i have some fantastic builders with me today they're working on some of the most interesting and powerful media tools for web 3. um we have devgatt from videocoin eric tang from live pier and roneill romberg from audies why don't we start by having each of them tell us their name quick one-liner about their project and why it is they you know that you do what you do um can we start with div hey guys um so glad to be here uh my name is dev uh i go by deva or there but uh i'm from videocoin i'm the cto at live planet where we build videocoin network our goal is to empower nfts for everyone especially uh the media kind so like if you see nfts presently they're all either some jpegs or any sort of still experience our goal is to make take that experience to the next level and enable nfts for everyone [Music] thank you um eric all right hi everybody i am eric tang i am the co-founder and cto at life here um lifehere's mission is uh we are building the world's open video infrastructure and that means you know this is something that never existed before and it's going to be a common good uh amongst all the users of the internet so that applications can be built on top of decentralized video infrastructures that can be much more scalable than current centralized infrastructures i'm really happy to be here thanks and uh last but not least ronniel hey everyone i'm roneill rumberg i'm one of the co-founders of audios and audience is a digital streaming service that connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music and that direct piece is really what we see the key differentiator here being and and the way audience achieves that is by being fully decentralized thanks um so i have a few uh prepared questions for um these fantastic panelists but please drop your questions as well um from the audience really like to know what's on your mind what you'd like to know so um please drop those questions in and we'll we'll get to them um throughout the course of our chat today so the first thing i'd like to start with you know stepping back from your software is that really you're all building networks for other creators whether it's software makers or vloggers or musicians artists can you tell us about a creator or group of creators using your stuff for doing something really powerful or mesmerizing something that really made you proud or inspired we'll go backwards maybe ronnielle can step in first sure yeah i think one of the most fun things about working on audience is that um yeah we what we think people will use these tools for is often not uh what they actually end up using them for and people will come up with uh some of the most creative and interesting ways to kind of you know engage their fans and engage their audience um using the tools that audience provides in ways we've just never conceived of an example of that is uh one of our artists like a year and a half ago or so named lido um created a uh uh track that you know he really liked and and decided hey i want to upload all the stems and all the kind of like the bits of the track that i used in my uh um in my ableton or whatever to make the track to uh to my fans and tell them hey like anyone make your own variation of this um as a remix and oh i'll uh listen to all of them in a live stream like next week at this time right um so uh uh he uploaded all those stems as separate tracks on audience he said you know tag your track as uh uh you know i forget what the hashtag was but um that at least gave him the ability to search by that tag and then listen to all the tracks um in order and then he ended up uh picking a few to to kind of you know repost and elevate to uh the broader fan community as things that uh you know he he really he felt you know did did honor to his original work um well it's so cool about that like that was not you know a feature of audios or anything else it was just you know him having direct access to fans was like hey i'm gonna try this and see what happens um the community ended up building like a formal kind of feature around that later but i i think that's where kind of the best features have come from right is when you look at the emergent behavior that uh the community is using the tool for and say hey like you know people are jumping through 15 hoops to do it maybe we can make it like two hoops or one hoop or uh whatever instead right so now there's actually a little like remixes section on on every track and if an artist tags their track as being remixable and uploads the stems that that actually shows up in like a little section on on the ui so um so yeah it's been really cool to that's just one example that comes to mind but it's been really cool to see uh uh you know how people will use these these tools in ways that you just never could predict yeah i can go next you know like uh we we don't directly work with creators and uh people who use our tools uh because we work with other people who create marketplaces and tools for creators but one of the companies that we recently started working with um is called mint works they have some really really interesting clients and it um it's really fascinating to see how far they take the nft concept um so in our case you know we power nft experiences that are primarily focused on videos and um media media files right like let's say audio file or a video file or or or document files or anything that um is a rich experience um vpar and fds are on that but when we started working with them it was really cool to see that they have this holographic video format literally uh it it becomes uh you get a small device um it's like it just comes in a mailer uh it's like a small thing that pops up if you put it on your phone you can actually see a video um pop up and uh um visible in 3d uh like a hologram right and they're trying to make nfts out of that so it is super cool to see how far they're taking our platform and what they're applying the uh tech that we have so we um you know it's kind of really hard to describe that thing but like once it uh once it's out there it's really cool let's say you have a sports um somebody playing uh some sport and then that video was captured you can actually relive that moment in 3d i thought it was super cool for the many things that going on right now sounds like a really incredible like expansion of pokemon go yeah exactly well and and i can go next um so um when i think about creators in um in the live your ecosystem i also think about creators who use all these cool platforms that are built in our ecosystem um you know there's there's on average over two and a half million minutes of video that's being broadcasted on the live your network today so on a weekly basis so so there's so much going on my i think my personal favorite is um there's this dj booth in brooklyn called the lot radio and the live radio is kind of like a pretty famous um booth around the world right they have they invite djs that come from all over the world to do this like 24 7 live stream uh that you know this is non-stop uh and they use life here to power that so so anytime you go to the lot radio um you know the everything above the fold is just this live stream of dj's going um you know doing their sets in that booth and um and that's that's life care powering it and you know sometimes i i'd like walk by the booth uh because you know i go see a friend in brooklyn or something and i'll be like oh like life here is powering that that gives me gives me a lot of satisfaction really good vibes um awesome so it's 2021 it's almost 2022. nfts are really widely known in pop culture now if not fully understood i'd argue um today they're collectibles though it's like how majority of people view them but if you like dig unpack nft's non-fungible token the the t stands for token right and wikipedia defines token as something which represents the right to perform an operation and the dictionary says it's a piece you can use instead of money in some machine so these words like use perform operate that's a lot of action verbs so i want to ask you all like what's around the corner for nfts like how do we get them off the shelf um stop collecting dust and and turn them into some you know an an object or passport that really um you know transports you to new web3 interactions yeah no i can go first um i think in terms of nft uh it started off with um uh you know when crypto punks and other crypto kitties and other nfts launched i think it was like it started off as collectibles but as we see the industry mature around nfts and and the applications that we're seeing it's quite fascinating to see what creators are doing you know like for example on on our platform [Music] you can for example take an nft and apply drm on it so we have certain musicians and music artists who are looking at launching their albums as if it is uh a key to access the album right like so they want to sell um their album and you can hear that album if you have access to that nft so in this in this case you know like it applies to that token methodology where okay by the virtue of you holding that token you can listen to that album and then there are other other creators that we're um and uh partners that we're exploring pay-per-view videos right like you know like let's say if you see typically uh the way videos work and pay-per-view works is like you go rent a video and then you view it if you don't view it within 48 hours then the rental expires but people are exploring use cases where you have an ft that gives you rights to watching that video and let's say you don't want to watch it you can actually transfer that right to somebody else because um arguably because you did not watch it you still have the rights or let's say you purchase the video and then you want to transmit over you still have the rights uh to do that and then there's another partner company that that we're exploring uh working with where they're actually trying to take legal agreements and convert and convert them into nfts so like let's say you had some sort of uh any docusign type of scenario where you you signed an agreement with somebody presently all those documents live on um live on uh you know the centralized cloud but imagine that docusign document actually happening on on the on web3 infrastructures like let's say the um the agreement itself was written up in nft and um the document was written down to decentralized file systems like filecoin so those documents can live on in an encrypted format in a decentralized fashion for a long time so we're seeing even more uh exciting use cases about nfts where the tea party the token part is used for access used for rights management and use for other applications way beyond just being a digital collectible yeah i think that's a really good really good uh lens into like kind of the future dev um and and you know the way i i kind of think about nfts is it's kind of this like blockchain native content publishing right so you're publishing a piece of content before when you do that you put it into someone's database and you know it lives in that database and people can query it now when you publish a piece of content it it is publicly available and is rooted on the blockchain so that people can identify and associate that identifier with anything that they want right so i really think like that like the design space is so big that you know we're not we're like barely scratching the surface right now even with you know the use cases that we're seeing now beyond collectibles right it's just so um so early um and and so that's why like i'm so excited about this uh like a few things that that i've seen recently that that are pretty interesting um one is like i think we're starting to see nfts representing memberships in community online communities right and and you know whether it's like board apes or um or you know friends with benefits right um i guess friends will benefit it's not exactly nft it's more like a actual token but uh kind of representing membership in uh in communities and that's i think like a building block that can be um that can be used to build all kinds of experiences on top right so this is it's kind of like an open invitation for um developers to build uh tools for these communities that exist and they're like franchises right uh we're starting to see uh people turning nfts into comic books into tv series right like oh like and and these are all kind of like derivatives that are built built on top of the nfts that i think is really really powerful uh some of the things that people are kind of experi experimenting on using live pier for example like doing like token gated live streams right and and that can be applied into so many different areas whether it's you know kind of the token representing an event ticket for a virtual event that people need to you know get access in order to watch the video or it's um it's you know i'm i'm doing a performance and the performance is only going out to like the board of apes so you need to own a board a be able to watch my performance right and um and if you think about the incentives behind these types of behavior um you know you like just just from token getting experience uh live streaming alone you can start to design all these different um interesting applications for different purposes yeah and happy happy to finish off here uh i definitely would echo a lot of what uh eric and dave has said um i think uh we're on the cusp of so much more utility being available for uh uh for these nfts and and really excited to kind of see that tool chain flourish um i i think that's that's also where you know we've we've seen audio so far fitting into uh this kind of picture similar to to what eric said about live pier um audios has been used by our creators as like a distribution channel to get nfts into the hands of uh some of their fans like by uh you know minting to uh the addresses that follow them for example or or things along those lines um but over time and and you know already there are folks in our community working on building uh a specific tooling to do things like token gated access to content um things like uh consumable nfts i think are very interesting right like what if you could mint uh a given number of listens on a track and there's like a market of those like listens that could trade and as they dwindle over time as people cash them in to hear the content um you know you can see some really interesting kind of crypto economic uh things happening around that so um you know more philosophically we're just very excited to see uh uh the continued exploration that like creators building in in this space will have now that these tools are are available for them um and uh uh i think we're all gonna be very surprised by the things they come up with over time um it's it's gonna be really fun but uh but i will say too i think there's um you know nfts as as they are today i think still do serve a purpose and have a utility to the users buying them even if they can't actually necessarily use them for for anything right um you know i would define that utility almost in in a similar way to uh the way that folks who would um i don't know like collect pokemon cards or or things like that might get uh some you know value from that act of collecting and engaging with uh the creator that created that piece of art or that asset um you know i i i yeah i feel like there's so much there's such a push in crypto right now more broadly to like try and add all this functionality and and whatnot to nfts um which you know i think it's great that there are more tools available but i don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with an ft that's just purely a piece of art that's cool right um i i um i think there is still value in that for uh the right creators and for the right communities so yes it's um it is a really interesting time though obviously from a kind of cultural awareness perspective michelle as you mentioned nfts are having a moment right now and i hope our whole community can leverage that moment to create some long-term durable uh sustainable kind of value accrual to creators and uh you know kind of uh create sustainable channels for distributing and reselling and sustaining markets around these things but uh uh you know it's been definitely looking forward to uh uh you know what's what's going to continue to come here and um yeah it's it's uh yeah we should all count ourselves very fortunate to get to uh to live through this time in in uh crypto and in nft land specifically because it's it's really special so renewal i want to um dig in a little more on on yeah this word you said simple um audience has a beautiful web-based media player right um and yet i think if i remember correctly you said recently on on a podcast that more than 50 of your listens don't come through that media player they come through embeds and and other um you know other api access how how do you ride the line between you know um and this goes to an audience question from colin stipeman do creators have to be tech savvy to get into this space do listeners have to be tech savvy do they have to care you know if they've used up eight of ten allowable listens like how do you wrap amazing user experiences around the complexity and the possibilities yeah we we think a lot about this um at audience i think this has been kind of the being able to walk this line between you know providing the the kind of value propositions that decentralized uh decentralized products can can offer that centralized ones can't namely you know like this complete access to the relationship with the fan uh uh that kind of security and safety from uh you know everything from the platforming to like the you know changing out of the api as you know we've seen on twitter and soundcloud and most other centralized services that have a robust api they leverage to grow and then ultimately pull the rug on later as as they've reached some some level of scale um yeah we can i think provide those value propositions without necessarily having to re-educate users on how to use these products right um the vast majority of audience users don't have a crypto wallet um installed and are able to use audios just fine with without that and we can see that in in the analytics that we get right from uh what chrome extensions they have exposed to to the page and whatnot so um you know you can it is possible to to provide these value props to users um like in in audience you can sign up with a username and password and uh have a wallet generated for you that's non-custodial and custody on on your browser but still gives you the ability to engage with and access all these cool things uh without ever even knowing that that's happening right like you're just clicking play on tracks and reposting things and um you know having having a good time so i think that um you know we we got started in 2018 right that was a different world it was much harder to thread that needle i think the quality of tools available today make it a lot easier right and and i think we've predictably seen a massive uptick in growth across the crypto ecosystem as a result of things getting easier but uh it's still hard still certainly hard to engage with a lot of these crypto native um assets like nfts and whatnot so um i think that's where kind of the next uphill battle for our community is right i think there's something like 600 000 odd people have purchased an nft before uh via openc and that's i feel like a relatively good you know high high water mark for like what is the you know entirety of the nft ecosystem community and that's like you know that's teeny tiny right audience has about seven million people listening to to content on a monthly basis right now which is great but um uh you know and and people are are often uh excited to hear that number in crypto ranks that's like a that's a big number but uh you know there are hundreds of millions of people that listen to content on uh on other platforms and you know i don't think our community doesn't see uh crypto as as uh you know the the bar that we should measure ourselves by from a usage perspective we see these large consumer scale products being uh you know being being the realm that we we play in so um i think there's a whole lot more work to do there um but i i do think the the key to hitting that scale is to help users bridge their way into this um you know when you use facebook uh for example you don't have to know that they use like my sequel and you know cassandra and like god knows what other like hundreds of different things are in their tech stack right like no no one cares right the the tool does a job for you and you're happy with it um over time i think crypto will come to that stage as well right where where uh you don't have to understand how to bridge assets between chains and you don't have to understand how to you know set up a self-custody wallet and put a key in a safe deposit box and go buy some ethereum on coinbase just to uh interact with like a you know a product right uh it's kind of um uh kind of a uh a big ask to make of the user i i've even heard um there's one uh uh i i won't name who because they're they're you know known but there's a you know product building for uh consumers a couple of years ago that would uh prompt folks to install metamask in their onboarding flow right um you know if they didn't have the chrome extension already and they saw over a 97 drop off in uh their sign up funnel at that step like 97 of the people who don't have metamask and get to that step of sign up like never finish uh uh which is you know it's pretty wild to think about right uh so yeah i think our our work is cut out for us as a as a community but um i've been really encouraged to see especially over the last 18 months or two years how many like more kind of consumer product people are getting excited about building here because there's so a lot of green field uh i don't think there's much green field left in in consumer and traditional tech but um in in this landscape there's you know no one's really built anything yet right uh uh greenfield is is everywhere if you're able to kind of put up with the brain damage of building in in this space right um yeah so rooney i think you just gave all these hackers and builders like some free tips for great project ideas it's like translating the complexities of everything here into beautiful user experiences um and speaking of users eric i want to jump to you so live pier has platforms or solutions for developers and users and broadcasters channels that's that's a really that's really cool rainbow of uh participants in this decentralized network can you tell us about how these you know these different segments come together into a peer-to-peer network how they how they're combining to save the world from video bandwidth overload and and also for hackers and builders who are just starting a project um what's your advice on how they should think about scale because when you're building something at home for yourself or for hackathon submission like they're not quite at scale yet but um when do those roadblocks happen how should people think about that yeah yeah those are a great question like i'll i'll give you an example um this is a interesting case study um so what at the at the beginning of covet um you know everyone started you know working from home and no one can go and go outside anymore uh so um and and so there was uh there was a group of guys who started this um this project called play dj tv uh and and their goal is like oh like all the djs are stuck at home they can't play their sets at clubs anymore so that's let's create a platform so they can stream from home that project uh got like 2 000 3 000 djs to sign up within the first couple weeks uh and all of a sudden just took off and immediately had to shut down because um the the cost of maintaining that infrastructure was just too much they were using kind of traditional web 2 infrastructure um this was early days in in life here where where you know our hosted gateway service wasn't working so well yet they somehow found out about us uh and we started working together and and you know we kind of worked together for about three weeks uh to to relaunch their site right um and and now you know play dj is up and running and you know it's been running for throughout the whole pandemic they've been providing this great service for djs all around the world um i think i think that's a that's a really interesting example to share here because um when you're working with video like scaling problems come at you real fast uh it's it's much faster than um than you know like when you're serving a web page right because the the amount of data that's required to process the uh to proc for for delivery but also the amount of computation um capacity required to process the video is is tremendous um youtube is by far the biggest computation consumer inside the google infrastructure exactly because of this reason right because it's it's so it's so power hungry um so um you know i guess as builders i think like the the the problem of scale is is real and and especially when you're building a video application um it really is important to make sure that the video infrastructure is scalable so that you can deliver this a good watch viewing experience to the to the viewers right we all know there's like the the watch rate drop off dramatically even after a single buffering event so really just trying to make sure that don't don't hit any buffer event at all and in terms of life here um well life here is a decentralized um marketplace almost for for infrastructure and application developers to come together right and there's this simple set of incentives that incentivizes um this marketplace to emerge that then uh also serves as an infrastructure uh so and in the live here protocol it's you know just a set of smart contracts that's deployed on ethereum right it just gives kind of security guarantees to all these parties so that when they're participating uh in this decentralized marketplace uh they can they can trust that um they're not gonna be cheated because there is kind of economic um there's economic security in place that guarantees good behavior and disencourages bad behavior right and i think from there the beautiful thing is that um you like but the lesson that we learned here is really from kind of the early bitcoin world right where uh big uh very early days people were mining bitcoin on their laptops uh and then very soon people realized oh i can write if i know how to program a gpu i can like write a gpu program to put it to binding on gpus and that lasted for about three months until someone realized oh i can do like fpgas that would be much faster right and people did fpgas and then very shortly people realize oh you know what basics is the way to go right now we're just going to create uh special hardware to mine right and and all of that happened not because satoshi nakamoto said everybody needs to build asic miners in order to mine bitcoin right it's just it's a simple um economic incentive and it just triggered all these things so so we kind of follow the same principle in that we just set up this incentive mechanism and and it's it's pretty incredible how like this this network has formed around uh this incentive in order to stream video which is like a pretty complex thing to to do from an infrastructure perspective right people figured out oh like uh gpus uh that are mining cryptocurrency you can actually also transcode video at the same time right because you know there's like different parts of the ship do different things uh and and that's like something that um that's a a thing that people discovered along the way and and i think there's there's all these different pockets of resources on the internet that's not being used right now like similar to file coin right like people are building file coin miners but i think it'd also be interesting to think about like there's all these different um unused storage around the world just sitting there doing nothing um it will be it will be awesome for for smart people to figure out how to tap into that those resources and put it all together and actually serve users in a more peer-to-peer way um so so yeah so that's kind of how how things all fit together now um yeah now with you know there's about a hundred nodes on the life here network um all already transcoding and there's acts uh for those among those hundred nodes uh there's access to you know i think uh 50 to 100 000 gpus around the world uh all all kind of doing uh doing transcoding and rhodial you've also chosen a you know decentralized and sort of tiered approach to to network and bandwidth and audience um can you talk to us about your peer-to-peer architecture yeah so uh uh you know we um uh audios is is built to kind of host and distribute content right uh first and foremost and uh that means you need to store the content you need to be able to look up the content um and you need to be able to discover the content right um and and find a way to discover that metadata so um those are kind of the three principal problems that uh kind of the the audience network architecture was designed to solve for um and uh i i think we were very fortunate that um ipfs kind of for us solved uh uh that center or that second piece that i just mentioned which is how do you actually look up the content once you know what you need how do you get it and and how do you do so in a performant and low latency way that's still fully decentralized right so um uh now with the launch of filecoin as well uh uh you know that potentially solves the uh uh the first piece there as well especially as as filecoin is able to serve you know smaller requests and smaller file sizes with lower latency so we're really excited about that um but uh the way the audience network is laid out there's kind of uh a set of of layer one blockchains um ethereum poa network and solana that the network uses that the audience network uses to coordinate on various things like you know who uploaded what content and what who has permission to change what and um uh uh you know what actually is that content but uh what's being written on chain is just a multi-hash reference to uh you know blob of metadata that lives off chain and then within that metadata is actually references to the specific uh content that you know that is attached to that track so if i upload a track to audios um i'm actually uploading that track to one of um these third-party nodes that run on the audio network that help transcode audio and then also pin it on ipfs and keep it available over time um that node will return back to my browser you know a multi-hash reference to uh you know that that track um i would submit a my browser submits a transaction on chain to say hey i'm publishing this track like great um that gets picked up by uh these indexing nodes that are native to the audience network um and that you know fetches some metadata indexes in it into like a more typical postgres database kind of structure and then produces a uh an api on top of it for querying and looking up that that data so um putting all those pieces together what you get is uh at the end of it a workflow both for you know uploading content to a decentralized kind of hosting network uh and a way to search and retrieve that content afterwards right um and and uh we were able to kind of build this architecture of um uh you know semi-trusted or you know semi-trusted through the staking mechanics around them that enforce trust uh third-party nodes that are hosting that content and indexing that metadata um and and the way that that all kind of is powered is with ipfs at the center right being able to know that uh uh you know once you know what you need to find there's a way to look it up without knowing where on the network it is um and then there's a way to validate that you're actually getting what you think you're getting uh once you get it through content-based addressing right so um so yeah it's been it's been really cool to see this work in in practice i think the network today uh stores over 600 000 tracks and like something on the order of uh 25 30 terabytes or so of of data backing those um but uh uh you know there's there's a reason i think this could work for audio and and probably wouldn't really work today for for storing video i'm i'm curious uh eric for your take on that like uh uh streaming video is is different from from storing it obviously and just the uh storage requirements and and everything else that would come from storing like you know 4k 60hz uh uh or 60fps like uh uh content for the same amount of you know audio that we have would just get to a level very quickly that's like you know that these tools may not be able to keep up with right um but uh compressed audio is pretty small actually like folks don't realize that you know uh uh compressed audios like uh you know a megabyte or so per minute uh even if you're doing like 320 kbps uh like the you know kind of the the maximum that you can with uh uh you know most codecs that are available right now so it's it's interesting that like you know i i think we saw this play out with the early internet as well right where music was the first uh uh kind of um uh uh like the first the first kind of pioneer market that started to create a use case for the internet and then over time you know that expanded out but uh uh storing video online took another seven eight nine years after uh music being distributed online became the norm so it's interesting um it's really cool to see live peer proof that out on uh on the streaming side like that's that's working and it's working really well um so i'm excited to see you know the eventual like youtube decentralized youtube equivalent uh come up sometime in in the future yeah rene you're just like you're just giving away hackathon project ideas left and right the um yeah it's funny you mentioned that storage storage becomes a huge problem because alpine's name one of the the biggest decentralized storage network in the world right now i think it's that we're close to 13 exabytes and growing um and so you know project to pair up live peer streaming and then also archive all your streaming to filepoint um would would be awesome to see right um and i think web3.storage is a really simple easy to use api and then estuary.tech is another great service that you know both of them wrap ipfs and filecoin together under the hood you make a single api call and you know then a lot of it is down to like the user experience or creator experience of how you slice videos how you want to archive them name them store them yeah we use both of them to store videos on our uh on our platform that hits us right like uh one of the things that we get uh out of these decentralized storage platforms especially falcon is resilient right like uh these videos that we store using either estuary or nfd storage or or textile textile is one of the other things that we use to access into file coin um it gives us resilience right now so when it's archived down into file coins um we know that the video file will live on forever or at least as long as python's around and as long as we have the minor deals ongoing but where we do see certain challenges is when you're retrieving from filecoin um you definitely cannot do videos like uh um it's just not even possible because of the retrieval times so um it takes time so we know that there are a lot of innovations coming up in falcon itself around the retrieval markets until that happens we have a different caching layer mechanism where we cache stuff in ipfs um and then also add another layer on top of ipfs because if in case the ipfs gateways are down uh we pull video content from our third level cache so it's almost like we do a cdn like infrastructure where okay we try to hit our first layer of cache if it misses um and then we hit ipfs if it misses then we hit filecoin um that seems to work really well for us and also works well for our uh decentralized uh workers that are that do the actual work for us right like we have about 1200 workers registered on our platform um and then they accept uh video workloads from us when we especially when we do drm for nfts etc all the encryption re-encoding and re-encryption etc the drm methodologies are actually done by the workers and after that they transmit it over to the first level cache and from there we uh layer it down to the further levels of cache so it helps us uh fix some of the problems we're dealing with video right now but yeah you know there's so much innovation that can be done in terms of how video is stored in decentralized networks how it's accessed how it's pulled um how it's distributed i think yeah there's just this is not hackathon ideas here but they're lacking billion dollar company ideas here um especially on the heels of something like five coin people can build massive massive businesses yeah and i just want to put in a plug here if you go to hackathons and scroll to the bottom we have a number of grants programs and accelerator programs and really here you know we don't bite we want to hear from you happy to chat you don't have to have like the perfect application the first time around so um anyone who sees this the potential here and wants to build an incredible project or business around it um myself my team all these founders here are are here to help you um deva you i i think uh if i remember correctly videocoin launched in may of 2020 right and that's like a few hundred crypto years after eric and ronielle launched their companies and projects um i want to go to an audience question uh which is how do we get your 3 projects noticed and used what what was your marketing did you have a marketing strategy um how does adoption work today um i think for us uh we're more like a b2b company where we we try to find all of these companies that are trying to access let's say the nft ecosystem so one of the things that we do is we build a nft marketplace in a box you know like uh you run a few commands and then uh nfd marketplace comes up in 15 minutes it's kind of it it gives you everything that you need you need a react app you need a back end for you know creating minting the nft storing it on uh transcoding transcoding and encrypting it on the videocoin network and then storing it on filecoin right um so we have that whole stack that comes up and running and then people can use it to deploy marketplaces so for us it's traditionally been doing business and business development with other corporations and other um entities so it's it's honestly as we started off although we launched the product in production in 2020 where we were in alpha in 2019 so um to say the least it's it's a it's a very challenging environment right like it's one thing to get um some cool web 3d developers to start using our our platform but as soon as you start pitching it to fortune 500 companies or companies that have real you know massive customer bases uh a lot of the problems that start coming up around some of the ux stuff that you brought up previously right like how do you get people to even buy nft or interact with our platform um so we throughout the company's history which we've tried to do things that simplify stuff for us like for example we added fiat payments very early in the game um so people did not have to deal with crypto uh we also implemented fiat compensation for our workers as well so like the workers who mine uh video coin on on our network get compensated in fiat um so all of this was done try to uh to deal with um the adoption problems right like when when fortune 500 companies or companies that look at our platform um it's gotten way easier though i think as as we have uh faced the battles in these uh in these marketing uh areas where we're trying to convince people that hey web3 is a real thing decentralized platforms actually work um you know these uh these are not just um ideas in a laboratory right like these are real things that actually happen so it's been a process for us but uh for us what has worked is you know like um getting really cool demos you know like that the people can actually play with and uh that really helps with that option so like when people see the thing work it really helps and then the second thing that has really worked for us is again try to remove barriers um so one of the things that we tried really early on was with fiat payments we also started giving out some free credits so people can start using the network um that really helped people try to turn our networks out i think yeah for us removing barriers making everything easy making it really simple and and making it making the stakeholders understand that a decentralized web 3 protocol is no longer something just a white paper but it actually works has been working for us great eric raniel your thoughts yeah i i i think of um like marketing in web 3 as like very similar to like community building right because because you know like web 3 the web 3 world is so community driven and and you know we the thing that the special thing that we have is like tokens right so what do tokens represent tokens represent ownership they represent like skin in a game right once once somebody has a token um they become a community member and their behavior changed because of that um so so at life here we really try to understand okay why are people in our community like what are they doing here and how can we create things for uh create a space or create tools for for people in our community so that we can turn them not just turn them into like active community members turn them into evangelists turn them into builders right so uh we even go as far as like we recently acquired a company uh that uh that creates this awesome media server uh and we're in the process of open sourcing that media server uh and in order to uh and and you know the reason we do that is because we want to make a you know make a contribution to to this through the video infrastructure to the video developer space um you know so that you know there's people who hear about this open source software and they use it and they feel like it's a good tool and that's like a form of marketing for us well so for both of you marketing is not about what announcements you put out or what events you put on but really how you speak through your code and your software products right um and speaking of community uh legend of mar wants to know what kind of impact can a person with just one or two gpus make in transcoding or mining or participating in all three of your networks is it feasible to be a solo small-time participant yes on our platform yes so our the way we have set up our workers like you know you can start off with something as simple as a raspberry pi because the raspberry pi has a video encoder on it um most people don't know about it but you know with adjusted raspberry pi you can get on our network uh and then if you are a bigger miner and you have a lot of compute power um if your gpu if your cpu is doing something then you can still use the gpu to do our network and then we have certain um partners who try to combine filecoin and videocoin so there's a lot of things you can do with just a raspberry pi and getting all the networks yeah same for for a live peer um they're you know they're like at the very beginning everybody everybody was a small miner right and over time people have grown and the mining like the mining operations have grown bigger and bigger um and and so there's been um mining pools that have uh popped up in um in in the life of ecosystem not this similar to kind of a ethereum bitcoin mining pool where solo miners can join these mining pools uh and and still um still participate and uh in audience actually unfortunately you can't really participate from home the way things are set up these the nodes that are on the audio network need to be reachable from browsers that users are using right so that means there needs to be some dns name for reaching it and there needs to be like an ssl cert provision and and some stuff like that so uh uh right now that's very quite limited to you know professional node operators folks who are in data centers etc or are consuming uh space in data centers by aws or things like that um but there is an effort in the community uh underway to kind of um especially on the file storage and and replication side to be able to leverage you know you can separate like the cdn piece of audience where content needs to be able to be fetchable and fetchable quickly from archivally where it may be stored um that's also where tools like filecoin come in right and and uh uh serve a great value as as kind of an archival backing of uh sort of cdn but um but yeah the constraints and needs of of uh audios today unfortunately mean that that um you know it's it's kind of a professional game for now great well um thank you so much to all of our panels for this great discuss great discussion um clearly you you're you know some of the biggest pioneers in the space of of how web 3 and media intersect and and innovate um what's the best way for builders to learn more about your networks or get help or you know start building on your platforms you've all got great talks and documentation online are you in the youth global discord where else should they find find out about your tools yeah i'm personally available on the filecoin slack as well as you can hit me on our video coin telegram as well as on twitter those are the three best ways and we also have a forum but real-time communication happens on telegram our discord as well as our twitter yeah for uh for audience i think the uh the best source of docs resources information is uh audious.org that's kind of the developer uh a home for for getting engaged with and learning about uh audience and uh you can come find our team in the audience discord as well uh that's that's the best place to you know reach out hang out uh uh you know meet your 25 000 odd other uh friends in in the community or whatever and uh yeah uh uh yo for updates etc where audience project on on twitter is the handle so give us a follow and and follow along yeah and for life here um our a bunch of our team will be active in the eve online discord throughout the hackathon so if you're if you're hacking definitely come and say hi there life here has a really active discord and that's where a lot of the communities hang out twitter is also a great place to kind of follow about the latest and greatest of the project great well thank you again and uh to everyone who's out in the audience can't wait to see what you have to build inspired by these amazing speakers and um everything that's uh you know all these new tools resources frameworks that are available for you thank you and have a great rest of your day thank you michelle great everybody you
