thank you good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of eth global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to scaling ethereum all of you are watching this on eat global.tv for those of you who are joining us for the first time this is the platform we'll be using for the rest of this month to host all of our talks workshops and Summits and you're in for a amazing time learning about everything that's happening in the world of scaling ethereum all right let's get started this hackathon is brought to you by Heath global if Global is an organization with a very simple Mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web 3 ecosystem and we do this by running two things hackathons and Summits and scaling ethereum is no different we have an amazing next few weeks planned where we're going to host three summits two of which I can talk about the first one is a kickoff Summit you're going to talk about you're going to learn about all the amazing things happening in the world of Roll-Ups right after we cover the hackathon logistics then on March 24th the Friday we're going to talk about what's happening in the world of Mev with the flashbots summit and a super secret announcement coming in on March 27th the Monday a few days after the flashbot Summits about something that this entire ecosystem has been eagerly waiting for we're going to release what those announcements are and what the summit and those speakers are uh very soon so stay tuned for the next few weeks to learn about all the impressive progress we've made as an industry in the last couple of years all this will be on e-global.tv and today we have a summit that's going to cover all the things that's kind of set the theme for what everybody's doing to scale ethereum but the next 30 minutes are about the hackathon we have so much going on for this event and I want to make sure we take the time to talk about everything that we're going to do to structure the next few weeks for U.S hackers and for those of you joining us for the first time tell you how everything works and for those of you who are coming back welcome back and stay tuned for a few changes we've made to our previous formats so this is already an impressive and massive event we have over 1200 people from 89 different countries participating in working on projects related to scaling ethereum and building on how twos and they are from 24 time zones we finally managed to cover whole time zones and I can't wait to meet all of you here and see what everybody's excited about I also put everybody on a map to see where everybody was coming from and it just continues to blow us away because we have representation from six continents at so many cities around the world the last time we counted this a few days ago that number was closer to 500 unique cities so that's awesome to see and welcome everybody and thank you for staying up or staying late early everything from all these time zones we really appreciate this not only just that we have 107 mentors who are going to be here helping you over the next three weeks to make sure that you your project comes to life and 19 amazing partners that are getting at help guidance prizes and mentorship to make sure that you succeed in building on top of ethereum and layer twos and they're also going to be giving out over two hundred thousand dollars worth of prizes so there's a lot of prizes that we can do and we will be doing and talking about so not only can you learn everything that's happening in this world you also get to win some amazing amount of prizes for building interesting and useful things I want to give a quick shout out to some of our amazing partners with optimism polygon scroll gnosis chain ethereum Foundation awkward virtual machine hyperlane apecoin fuel Uma connects polybase PSE the graph it Max zq6 era mantle Tycho and push protocol all these companies and our partners are here with us for this entire month helping out talking to all of you telling you about how you can simplify your life by using a lot of these sdks and not Reinventing the wheel and also giving out a lot of prizes but enough of that let's talk about some of the stuff that you all need to know specifically about the hackathon logistics the most common question we've gotten is what can I build uh there's a lot of you who are joining us for the first time there's a lot of you who are seasoned engineers in big companies that are trying to understand what's possible in crypto and some of the themes that we think are going to be very helpful for you and also what others have said they're going to do is is on this slide people are very excited to play with different D5 Primitives and dowels and nfts on different l2s so you get to take advantage of a lot of the scalability benefits and low gas costs for making those type of transactions and you can do a lot more interesting stuff or a lot more stuff that can be corrected on chain if if something requires higher transaction amounts uh not from a dollar standpoint but just from the number of edits or comments needed to get to any outcome we have a lot of support for building on ZK Roll-Ups there's a lot of things you can do in terms of understanding how we can add anywhere from privacy to some more guarantees to just hiding some information that should be not needed or must be publicly available for somebody to act on and you have a lot of support for doing this for anywhere from account abstraction to D5 to nfts to Simply making just better tooling for the next wave of people to do all these things more efficiently and faster of course the reason why we're doing this event for the second time is because we feel like the the layer 2 ecosystem is still lacking really really good developer tools and we want to really get thousands of more people to build on top of these scaling Solutions and even if you can find an app or you realize that something was really hard as you were doing your app you get to take some time and make a tool that makes it easier for yourself and somebody else and let them make applications on top of these Solutions better or faster and and more quickly and of course it's okay to not work on an app there's so much to do here in this entire ecosystem that you can also take the time to build some guides or documentation or simply clarify how somebody can use it and help educate everybody else on how they can be in this ecosystem faster quicker or just really get into some of the nuances that everybody needs to know to build on top of any of these Solutions uh if you are one of the teams who's working on making easy to understand how to do something or how something works you also have the option to submit those guides to youth Global guides or be more than happy to publish one of these guides here and if you do end up writing something that can help thousands of people uh we'd love to make that an official guide on youth global.com guides all right now let's talk about the next three weeks and how all the logistics is set up for everything I'm going to cover what you can do to find a team member how you can get any help all the prizes of course we're going to talk about all of our Summits and I'm going to talk about the most important thing which is how judging and project submission is set up so the most important thing is communication so let's Dive In everything is going to be on Discord that means if you are a confirmed hacker you would have seen a connect Discord button on your hacker dashboard on Eep global.com and you should be able to see a scaling ethereum section up here on your Discord sidebar that means that only people who are participating at the hackathon are going to be able to see those channels so really make sure that you see that and you are actively connected to Discord because that's where all the announcements talks prizes help all that will be managed there including talking to all of our mentors and these are private sales which means that if you're not part of the hackathon you will not be able to get access to them and and it helps us understand how do we make sure we effectively communicate things precisely to everybody who should hear about those announcements and that's also where all of our partner channels are which means if you're working on any of the protocols out there whether it's on an optimistic roll-up or is it your roll up or some Dev tool or some dap or any push notification service you can message anybody on that team through those channels so please make sure you're connected to slack and also make sure that your team members are there because you also get to talk to each other there and that's where you can just make sure you can ping anybody including the global team and our partners and our mentors and all the other hackers too on top of that we'll also be sending out calendar invites for all talks and workshops you would have seen a calendar invite today for for this very session uh there's a handful of other talking workshops happening some of them already happened yesterday we have a lot more next week all that is going to be notified to you on your calendar so it normalizes itself for the different time zones everybody's in and as a note all this is meant to be very asynchronous which means that we try our best to do things multiple times over the course of the hackathon and repeat this so we can optimize for multiple time zone overlaps but even if you have other obligations whether it's school or work or or something else everything is going to be recorded so even if you missed something it'll be available on youtube.com it's Global immediately after it ends and we make sure that everybody can catch up and watch things at their own pace or their own speed limit and and really understand what's going on and not miss out anything and to see what's happening everything is going to be on our website you can just head over to ethical.com scaling there you'll see the full schedule if anything changes you'll see that reflected there they will what's on the website is going to be the source of Truth so we make sure that everything whether it's your calendar invites whether it's the top titles whether it's a five minute delay all that is reflected properly on our hackathon website so the most other common question of gun is how does this hackathon work for those of you joining us for the first time uh it is fairly straightforward the hackathon officially begins now and you can start working on your projects you can work with them uh with the team and you can have a team of up to five members and you have the next two and a half weeks to hack that means that whole thing is about three weeks long as an event that includes some of the extra time we have for judging and doing the closing ceremonies and going through all the Prize winners but you have the next little while to talk about all these things and work on our projects so I'm going to spend a bit more time here on all the things that matter here for project submission and other things that you need to know so the rules and criteria is the most important thing everything that you're doing must start today and must be done from scratch which means that you cannot work on a pre-existing project you cannot add features to something you've done and you also cannot just deploy something you've done in the past to some Layer Two and call that a valid submission on top of that only people who have successfully rsvp'd are eligible to win prizes which means that if you're working on a team of five and three of the people are listed as your team members at the point of submission and the other two were accepted but did an RSVP properly or didn't join your team if you win a prize in this situation only those three people will receive the prizes not all five so please please please make sure that all of your team members are rsvp'd and listed and confirmed on your hacker dashboard and also there's going to be a lot of edge cases and we totally understand that so if you have a situation where you want to clarify something you can just message us on Discord or email or direct message or Twitter whatever it is uh we'll be able to understand what your unique situation is and help clarify and address any any issues so don't hesitate to Ping us and if you have anything that comes up you can let us know and we'll be able to get to it immediately next and the most important piece is judging so here is something that we're changing for those of you who've joined us in the past submissions are due on Sunday March 26th at noon eastern time everything we're going to do is default to Eastern time which is Eastern time New York and you have until March 26 to work on your projects after that we'll kind of talk about how judging works but what it means on that Sunday is you will have to create a four-minute demo video to submit what you've worked on over the past few weeks this four minute is what's going to be a snapshot of what you've done and what everybody will look at to review your submission for any prizes or any counts this video is required this video is also very strict on the time so you cannot go over we will the dashboard will automatically prevent you from submitting something that's longer than four minutes and we also review all these videos individually to make sure that everything is as part of the rules so if you speed it up that also gets you disqualified if you try to make it too long you'll just be stuck on being able to submit your project and if it's too short that also helps you not convey what you built on properly so please make sure that it's appropriately and as close to four minutes as possible to really lighting or Enlighten everybody on what you worked on for the past few weeks and please please please please please please don't prepare this last minute we see everybody realize that they need more time to make it better to make the demos work really well to sometimes focus on conveying the right messaging all that takes time we recommend you block at least two hours to do this even though it's four minutes it will take you a few revisions to get things right or make sure that everything's under the time limits and all these details are going to be on your dashboard right now you're only going to be able to see how to create a project but next week onwards you'll be able to see all the specific things that you need to do to submit your project and how the video works and some previous good videos that we recommend using as a reference for what a great submission looks like all those things are going to be made visible to you on your hacker dashboard very soon and let's talk about what's changing forward judging and how everything is going to be set up after your subject project we have two tracks of judging the first one is main judging which helps you become a finalist for this hackathon and the other one is a partner price judging which is only if you are interested in submitting for a prize but not anything else for those of you who've been part of our events before uh the format's the same but we're adding an additional step moving forward so I'm going to talk about what the main judging looks like and how it's going to work it's going to be set up in two rounds and this is how the first round looks like when you submit your project on Sunday the next day is when we're going to do round one of judging which means that instead of joining a live call which is how things were done before there will be a asynchronous round with our judges who will review your video submissions and we'll also be checking anywhere from your git history to the quality of what you submitted to the live demo links that you published to everything around your submission and qualifying you for the next round for the live demos that you are used to this means that not every project will move on even if you wanted to be part of the finalist track and within 24 hours of submission our goal is to notify the teams that are moving on to the next round to default to a live demo to our judges where they get to have a conversation and talk about what they built so as our judges look at all the submissions on that Monday we'll be notifying the teams to admitted to the next round and that judging happens on Tuesday for round two the way round two is set up is fairly straightforward all those teams will be sent a zoom link you will then be able to go on that call and simply demo what you built uh you'll still get four minutes and we default to playing the video that you submitted to our judges it'll be a different set of Judges as well and in addition to the demo you'll also then get a few minutes for a q a after that is what we'll have to determine who our finalists are and that's what sets up for the closing ceremonies where we're going to demo some of our top teams to share what they built and what they were excited about as some of these teams so the zoom call will be synchronous and this will happen from 12 pm to 2 30 PM eastern time and this will allow all of us to be on the call synchronously and chat about everything that you're excited about everything you built or any questions our judges have about your submission so that's the net difference we'll notify this again to everybody over email and all this information will also be available on your hacker dashboard as soon as submission opens in about 10 days and then for those of you who are not interested in the finalist track and want to just go for partner prizes That Remains the Same as before which is the partners will look at your four minute video and your source code and your live Demos in the project description to determine what is the best team that represents the values that they're trying to accomplish for that price they will look at this at their own pace asynchronously and contact you on Discord or email if they have any questions so this means that as long as you specify during your submission process that you are trying to go for X prize the partners will be notified that you are one of the teams and this is your submission and they'll be able to look at this and over the same window before the closing ceremony they'll be able to tell all of us who the winners are for their projects this also means that if you forget to notify in your submission process that he wanted to go for x or some some specific prize then we have no way of knowing that this is what we wanted so please make sure that you select the actual prize you are trying to qualify for otherwise we won't be notified the partners will be notified and if you say I how come I didn't get this provider how come someone else was chosen over me it means that nobody had the information that you wanted to be part of that price so you'll get to do all that through your dashboard and all that will be available to you very soon but in summary you have to make sure that you take the time and make the video good that is the best advice we could give you which is that foreman represents three weeks of work and making sure you get the time to highlight why you're doing this thing who you are why it matters and why you're excited about it is going to be very critical that video is what determines you receiving a prize you're you're going to round two of judging and also being a finalist for This Global event so make sure you take the time and don't ignore the work you need to do to make your submission look amazing and of course I don't want this to be intimidating to all of you the biggest question is well what if I'm new to all of this well not to worry this event is designed for a lot of beginners and our goal is to make sure that we do everything we can to make it really easy for everybody to understand what's going on and really take the time to learn and use the next few weeks instead of just a hackathon weekend to make this useful and knowledgeable and a good learning experience for them so a lot of content for beginners and experts no matter what your skill set is you have things to catch up on here and you can watch those talks you can watch historical talks on our YouTube or learn about any protocol that's out there in this space and get a guided tutorial or even talk to the people who builds it directly so a lot of these talks and workshops are available if you want to just understand what's happening thematically that's where the Summits come in we're going to start off with our first summit in 20 minutes and our goal is to tell you at a high level all these things that you're excited about whether it's how optimistical levels work how Z girls work or if you saw the announcement about coinbase's new OP chain base all that will be told to you on why these things are excited very soon and there's a massive set of guides and resources available to you in your infocenter it shows up now on your nav bar on the hackathon website you will see that link on your calendar invites too you can see everything from the rules the criteria to submission guidelines to list the previous submissions that we think are really well presented all that stuff is available to you to read up on immediately and you can just go that go there by click on the info Central like and of course if you have any questions this is a live stream I can see all the questions on these global.tv chats or just ask away any of your questions and we'll be able to answer them one common question we've already gotten is do I have to decide between the main judge and track or the partner price track the answer is uh yes on just the main judging track which means that if you pick the main judging correct you are still qualifying for the partner prizes it's just that if you only picked a partner price track that means that you cannot come back and qualify for any of the main judging finalist price tracks so no matter what you choose you are still going to be looked at for all the partner prizes and make sure we make that way more obvious as well but you are not going to have to make a decision between you and one as partner Prize or not all cases you qualify for that and the last thing is everything is on our YouTube so of course there's a lot of you who are not sure what you want to build yet or you're not confident in the way you have will be accomplishable in the next few weeks or maybe you need help on specific skill sets we got you covered all that stuff is also part of the plan which is the reason why these events are multi-weets is because you really get to learn and then try it out and see how to do these things so there's a find a team channel on your Discord there you can see a couple hundred people who are also in a similar position as you where they're looking for somebody with specific skill sets or just want to pair up with somebody and you get to meet new people from across the world you get to meet really really smart people who are excited about what's happening what three and work together on a project over the next few weeks and really accomplish something amazing uh and of course because there's so many of you from literally all time zones close to 500 cities around the world we want to know who you are why you're excited about this thing and and what you really are passionate about so go to the scaling 2023 chat Channel and talk to all of us say hi to equal members uh say hi to everybody else participating and we'd love to understand how you got into this space and of course it's also possible to hack so you don't need to have a team it's just easier if you have somebody also working with you because you then don't have to do everything yourself so if you want to do something on your own that is also totally fine you can submit something individually but if you are trying to work with somebody and reduce the workload or just get complimentary skill sets involved you get to do that with a team and there's also now a tool on your dashboard to help find team members this is a double opt-in tool only which means that on your dashboard if you set that you need help or you're looking for a team member then well the second you check this off you'll be available on this tool and other members can find you based on the things that you can do for a team whether it's front-end development design back-end development solidity development all that stuff you can specify and find other potential team members who have those skills or the skills that you have that you like to contribute to another team now let's talk about check-ins this is going to be very important our goal is to make sure that you can understand what's happening in this space especially from so much information that exists out on the internet and to help simplify that process and make the best use of your next few weeks we Implement something called a checking a check-in is a simple form for lack of a better analogy a quick survey or a stand-up update that happens on a dashboard and you just get to tell us how things are going if you finally have an idea that you're excited about if you're stuck on something if you try to get an answer to something about an SDK and you didn't hear back or you couldn't get the right person to answer your technical question or you're stuck on this book and it's just really stopping you from moving forward all these things is what we use the check-ins for and from that we get to Route and triage you to the best person will be able to help or just simply help you ourselves we're excited about building a new Theory I'm really excited about the UK Technologies we're excited about optimistic Roll-Ups and we want to get people to build really really cool things and these check-ins help us get you to where you want also the check-ins are a big piece for getting to the submission piece so you do have to fill out the check-in just so we know how things are going what we can do better as a global so all this will happen via your dashboard it's a really quick form should take you no more than 10 minutes and anybody on your team can fill this out um next week and the two after the way we kind of think about this thing is that as you're thinking about your projects you should break down the work into these equally adjusted timelines you should take the first few days of next week to really brainstorm what could be possible understand some of the stuff that is also were not possible with different Technologies watch a handful of workshops and talks and talk to a lot of our mentors and see hey I'm trying to do X does this make sense or is there a better way to do this thing or is it more efficient way of doing something and as you kind of gather all of that interest use the week after to really build something that you want to submit and get people to test it out get people to give you feedback and then as you learn through that iteration finalize everything you need to do whether it's really make it nice design make it really easy and friendly work on the copy or anything that you want to do here you get to do that at the last week just before submissions on March 26th and to make the best use of all this we also are going to be doing a feedback session every week which means that as you are thinking about it brainstorming your idea or you want to see what people think or what some of our partners think or what some of these Founders who are building these Technologies they're using think you get to join these two sessions the first one is next week from 3 to 5 PM Eastern the next one is the week after from 9 A.M to 11 A.M Eastern and you can just come on a call and really just get direct feedback and this behaves like a college office hours you get to see what people think about this or if you're stuck or if you really wanted direct help on a on a call and they can anybody can help you there as their mentors or our partners to tell you what you can do to get unblocked and I also want to cover a few seconds on our code of conduct even though this is an online event uh we have a code of conduct that everybody must obey and the event rules and the code of conduct is on eveglobal.com rules you can read everything in a lot more detail but the gist of it is that please be respectful to everybody in this community and harassment and abuse will not be tolerated on any form and specifically about the event rules anything that you build here is going to be solely owned by you and your team which means that neither us as a global nor our partners or anybody else owns the IP for what comes out of this it's solely you and your team members that are the owners of everything that you built and if you need any help or if you think that what you're doing for your project might be violating some of the rules or you may get disqualified for not doing something you can just reach out to us and we'll be happy to clarify anything and let you know if something is within the guidelines of they talk about and all that information again is on the website including everything when I say after which is the price stuff all the talks all that is there and you can just go to eat global.com scaling all right so before we get to our Summit let's talk about all the stuff that you can actually win and all the prizes that everybody's giving out so I want to spend the next few minutes on the prizes and then we're going to kick off with our Summit so let's get right to it so the first one is from optimism what we asked was we asked the optimism team and Maddie to share us what optimism is doing what they're excited about and what they think you should be excited about and then also the price they're giving out so I'm going to invite Addie here on stage and tell you more about the prizes hi my name is Maddie I'm the head of developer relations at op labs and we are scaling ethereum by building optimism we're part of the optimism Collective and together we are building a lightning fast scalable ethereum equivalent layer 2 called optimism mainnet this is all built on the op stack which is our open source Dev stack that powers all the interconnected layer twos that will form the super chain the other thing you need to know about optimism is that by being part of the collective by growing the ecosystem you qualify for retroactive public goods funding which means you can earn more funding in the future for the impact you have on the ecosystem so we have three hacks for you today the first one hack the op stack show us what you would do with your own L2 take the latest release on Gurley do something cool with it past examples include a Game Boy emulator that ran in the execution environment environment or a ATM roll-up that use Bitcoin as a data layer so the top three teams will win 5K 3K and 2K respectively number two identity if you're building Identity or reputation we want to hear from you anything involving communities or badges or doubts deployed on optimism mainnet and incorporate our attestation service look for ways that you can add them to your project three teams will win two thousand dollars each and lastly the pool prize any dap any tool bring it to optimism it's an evm equivalent which means it uses the same tools and flows that you're already used to it's very easy to ship and start tapping into the optimism Community if you're looking for resources to get started we have a lot of them head to the prizes page I recommend starting with the starter kit that we just released it has support for wagme Foundry rainbow kit and more if you're looking for ideas we have an ideas list we collect hard interesting or just downright unhinged ideas and we publish them for Builders so if you're looking for inspo head to this URL and that's it I'll be in the Discord pinkscap if you have any questions and good luck and have fun awesome so you got a quick overview of all the optimism prizes are we're going to talk about a lot more on how all those work but I'll just quickly summarize which is you get to win a lot of prize for hacking on the op stack and there's a big emphasis around identity and reputation so interesting attestation ideas are going to get two thousand dollars each and up to three of those so you get to see all that very soon but let's go on to some of our other prizes oh and by the way there's also a pool prize which means that any interesting project that uses optimism or deploys on mainnet in a meaningful way is eligible to win 400 each so 10 teams will qualify for that and they'll be able to receive four thousand dollar split ten weights up to 10 ways so it could be more next up is polygon and let's go right into hearing what Steph has to say about building a polygon hey hackers I'm Steph verpilia from polygon labs and I'm here to tell you about the twenty thousand dollars in prizes we're giving away to all of the builders who are scaling ethereum during this virtual hackathon the first prize is five thousand dollars for the best web3 developer or Community tool we want you to scale ethereum by creating and documenting either a tool a dashboard a Dev Library a transaction Explorer a dow coordination tool or a general web 3 public good that will supercharge development and coordination for the web3 community and beyond our second five thousand dollar prize is for the best app deployed on polygon ZK evm get ready for our polygon ZK evm mainnet by deploying your scaling ethereum hackathon project to our polygon ZK evm testnet we've got lots of docs and tutorials to help you start building either with hard hat or remix and we even have a ZK evm full stack development tutorial that you can use to get start building your dapps now next prize is five thousand dollars for the best ux on a project using the DAP store kit this is a Community Driven toolkit that you can use to deploy successful evm compatible dap stores using the decentralized App Store kit framework we want you to build a intuitive beautiful user-centric dap using the kit and explain all of your different ux optimizations and choices within your readme check out those dap store docs to start building last but not least we have five thousand dollars in prizes for the best use of polygon ID build a full stack dat that uses polygon IDs decentralized identity solution to give your users privacy by default so that they can verify their access rights to use your dap without giving up any of your personal data check out our polygon ID Wiki and our Builder tutorials to learn how to set up your own issuer node and verifier service those are our prizes super stoked to see what you build if you have any questions at all please ask us in the Discord see you soon awesome so I'll also summarize some of these prices you can you can visually see as well so the best web3 developer Community tool will receive five thousand dollars from polygon the best app deployed on the polygon ZK evm will receive 5000 the best ux on a project using that app store kit from polygon will also receive 5000 in the best use of polygon ID will be receiving five thousand dollars so it's twenty thousand dollars in prizes for a lot of themes that you're going to see as recurring in this world of scaling ethereum and you get to check out all the specifics here on the scaling website next up is scroll and then I have high chain to talk about what you can get from scroll hello everyone we are screw we are very excited to partner with East Global and to be part of the skating instrument we all know that experim is great and has a humongous community and developers on top of the Instagram Network it is known to being decentralized by having hundreds of thousands of Geo distributed validators and then being secure and censorship resistant however due to the blockchain Palama ECM cannot achieve the scalability as they prioritize the first two properties so how to solve the scalability problems on the experience more than two years ago vitalik posted this blog post about Rob Centric grow map so they plan to scale the experims through the robs that can process more transactions on the layer 2 and have efficient settlement of analyzation on top of the svm layer 1. so scroll is committed to build an evm by code equivalent as DK evm and zkrop layer 2 to scale the experience while committed to scaling the experims we abide by the following three principles first we aim to build evm equivalent to dkrop that can achieve the Best in Class using a developer experience second we keep the security first mindset when building the layer 2 where the zero Notch protocols can explicitly prove the correctness of all execution on layer 2 and we also actively having external and internal auditing on our code base and third we believe that decentralization also matters in the layer 2 context so scroll is committed to decentralized across all different layers including a decentralized approver and sequencer Network for user and developers because of the evm equivalence using the screw is pretty much same as using the swim last let me introduce the scroll hackathon and Bounty program in this event we have total three different tracks first we just ask you to deploy your smart contract on top of the school test net the deployment process will be just like the ethereum and you only need to change the RPC endpoint and second we of zero knowledge so show us your best application building new use cases that leverages the power obviously knowledge proof and third we want to see apps taking advantage of the cheap gas fees and fast block times on the layer tubes for more information you can check out the website and hope you enjoy hacking on top of the screw thank you awesome so to repeat some of the prizes from scroll if you deploy your smart contract on scroll there's a ten thousand dollar pool price which means that any meaningful deployment on scroll will be splitting this ten thousand dollars equally and you get to really Deploy on a ZK VM and really test out what is and is impossible or what is working as advertised which should be everything um in addition there's a category for the applied CK improvements and empowerment so tool teams will get 2 500 as the winners for this and you can see the specifics on the details on the price page and there's a cheap and fast block utilizer award category track and you get to also understand how you can qualify by winning on some of those specific key points that matter to be really achieved with us on scroll so next I want to get to gnosis chain so noses chain is also giving out a lot of prizes so the most Innovative apps on office chain are qualified to win effectively twenty thousand dollars so the best price gets eight thousand the second place will get six thousand and they're going to be two runner-ups who are going to be receiving three thousands for three thousand dollars each for deploying an interesting application on gnosis chain next up is falcoin virtual machine or fpm this lets you bully add programmability to your data without having to leave the solidity world that you're already excited about and understand so if you are integrating with the filecon virtual machine you get to win prizes for all these categories so the best application for data dial is qualified to receive 2000 the most interesting application that works on storage markets is also qualified to receive 2 000 the most interesting tooling on the fem ecosystem is qualified to receive 2 000 as the best project there's so many Primitives and infrastructure missing for 51 virtual machine as they ready their mainnet next week you get to be one of the best projects making that easier for others to build on top and there's also a wild card category which means that any other project that doesn't fit all these things but it's still super interesting and impressive will receive two thousand dollars next up is hyperlane hyperlane is a permissionless interoperability layer so as you want to think about modular security between different chains you get to use hyperlane so the best interoperable solution is going to receive four thousand dollars the best use of hyperlinks warp routes SDK will receive two thousand dollars as a prize and any infrastructure project that is making the best use of hyperlade will receive two thousand dollars in terms of helping you scale things on ethereum next up is eight coins eight coin foundation and eight point out is giving out prizes for the best integration of a project into the air coin ecosystem this is the four types ecosystem if in case you uh you were not familiar from the dial side and there's also a category for the best contribution to this system so whether that's on account abstraction or anything that you're doing to scale ethereum you get to do uh those tracks and receive effectively close to ten thousand dollars each uh ten thousand in total for working on the eight coin ecosystem so if you're excited about nfcs and you want them to be more accessible and fast for everybody in the consumer world out there you have the opportunity to do so here next up is feel feel is the fastest execution layer for a modular blockchain so if you are building a smart contract that's working in sway language you get to win a thousand dollar price and a runner-up will receive 500 then if you are building a full stack tab on top of you and deploying it on the fuel Layer Two you get to qualify for three thousand dollars a prize for the best use and if you are using predicates on the field Network two teams will receive two thousand dollars for the first place and five hundred dollars for runner-up category next up is connect connects also lets you communicate cross chain and transfer assets between two different chains so the best cross chain application will receive up to three thousand dollars from connects and if you end up taking any existing protocol cross chain which means you end up bridging something that already is on one of those chains using connects and help it be available on a different chain you get to win one thousand dollars it's a very simple price contracts and if you are using The x-call Primitives SDK there's a pool prize which means that anybody who deploys and sends any data with you get to split a thousand dollars someone sees it yourself next up is polybase polybase is a web 3 equivalent of Firebase so you get to use postgres or any sort of relational database or it's a key Value Store quite easily and make your applications real time and quick to use so the best use of polybase will get fifteen hundred dollars and the runner-up will get a thousand dollars and there's also a massive Pool price which means that all interesting projects that make a meaningful integration and use of the polybase SDK in the databases will be splitting 2500 each then we have the graph graph is an indexing protocol if you want to query any of your blockchain data you get to create a subgraph or tap into an existing subgraph and request that on-chin data as really nice Json through graphql so the best New subgraph Creation will receive two thousand dollars and one thousand dollars for the runner-up and the best use of existing subgraphs will receive 1400 for the first place and 600 for the run row spot then we have intmax ink Max is a layer two that helps you make really quick and fast consumer apps the best use of MX and deployment on that protocol will receive 2500 and two projects will receive this price so you get a chance to be one of the first amazing applications on in Max up is zq6 era this is a layer to CK EDM designed to scale blockchains and they are giving out a price for the best account abstractions on top of a ZK evm you can win two thousand dollars for that and three teams will get the best developer tooling related prizes for a thousand dollars each so if you get to improve how do we make it easier to deploy more on era you get to win a thousand dollars then we have mental mantle is another layer two for building modular logic leveraging module architecture for building and scaling ethereum and uh smart contracts and best use of mantle will receive five thousand dollars in total so 2500 for the first place 500 for second place and one thousand dollars in third place in the bit tokens then we have Taiko Network and there are building a ZK evm which is of type one so the best apps on Taiko will receive 1500 for the first place and 1000 for the second place uh they are also interested in making infrastructure improvements to working with the type of protocol and the first place winner will get a thousand dollars sacrifice will get 500. uh there's also a lot of opportunities you make the CK improvements and just interesting application of CK specific Technologies or just SDK ad functions and you get to win 500 for that prize and if you are one of the team members who wants to understand how do we improve the economics of that Network you can also receive 500 prize for going a bit more into research instead of coding something on as you KVM and we have Push protocol the push protocol is a communication protocol for web3 so if you want to Ping somebody or you want to have push notifications that are native to browsers and applications and react on top of on-chain events you get to use push protocol for all these things and also to chat with people so the most Innovative use case of push across different chains will receive a thousand dollars this is all about scaling if you are using the push chat SDK the best and most interesting use case we'll get 750 and if you are making something interesting from a ux side of things for on top of the push sdks you will get 750 as well and there's a pool prize of 2500 which means that all projects that make a meaningful use of push protocol will split 2500 each those are all of our amazing prizes I know you may have a lot of questions we'll be able to answer a lot of them here on the chat if we can get to them we'll get to them on Discord but all that information is available to you on ethglobal.com scaling including very specific information about each of the prizes and what qualifies for a dozen how you can watch it Workshop of somebody telling you how to use them to the documentation links to previous examples that they see to replace all that stuff is on the website so with that I want to stop talking and wrap up with Logistics and really go into our Summit so as you get started with your projects please remember to pace yourself we really don't want this to be exhausting for you this event is meant to be intentionally multi-week so you get to really ramp up your understanding and then tackle something instead of going all in and sacrificing your sleep or health or anything else to really build something that you are excited about that could potentially be in the next few years of your life and we really want you to have fun so please uh make sure you are thinking about all these things in a calculated Manner and in a in an easy way so that you get to learn more and understand how you can be more involved in this ecosystem and remember all this thing is about experimentation and learning which means that it is totally okay if you don't get to finish what you started our goal is to help you get there and if something doesn't work out that is totally okay you can absolutely demo something that was partially done and continue working on it after this event ends and our goal is to help you get to that finish line and however possible way we can so keep all that in mind and happy hacking you can find us now on Discord by heading over to global.com Discord or your dashboard and we'll see all of us all 1200 plus of us on the scaling ethereum channels all right that was all the logistics which went a few minutes over but I am super excited to talk about what we have now planned for our intro to scaling Summit so let's go right into it I want to talk about our kickoff Summit which is we're going to highlight all the interesting themes themes and things that are happening in world of scaling ethereum so today's schedule is as follows we're going to have Kelvin talk about how Roll-Ups actually work and how potentially Ezekiel wolves may not be real we'll see about that then we're gonna have Jesse talk about bass and as you may have heard uh bass is the new OP stack chain from coinbase we're going to talk about why coinbase excited to do this and how they want to bring on the next billion users into ethereum then we're going to have portal lands that talk about EIP 4844 in 44 minutes or less uh 40 44 is a really interesting standard that simplifies so many things to help make these things really consumer friendly that haishan is going to talk about how to think about zika Roblox and the ZK evm this is obviously a really interesting topic because everybody is trying to push this into compatibility and making it easy for others to integrate to so we're going to learn a bit more specifics about all those things and lastly John from hyperlane is going to talk about how to properly think about the multi-chain feature and how you can do interesting things and build cool applications that have contacts from different chains so without further Ado let's welcome Kelvin to tell us about how Roll-Ups actually work well Kevin hello Karthik how you doing how you doing doing wonderful and I can't wait to see what you have for the next 30 minutes because I got some movies on Twitter and uh I'm excited so I'll let you take on the floor thank you thank you all right so wait are we we're good am I lagging maybe I'm lagging no I don't know whatever this is how roll ups actually work this is a talk for all of you who think you know how Roll-Ups work but you don't I know you don't because I don't even know how Roll-Ups work and I've been working on them for for far too long I've been working on them since before you were born this is a talk about how Roll-Ups actually work also known as where is it ZK Roll-Ups aren't real that's correct ZK Roll-Ups are not real I don't believe in them birds are not real ZK Roll-Ups are not real that's correct my name is Kelvin I work for op Labs I'm building the optimism Collective because I believe that we can actually change the world with the stuff that we're doing and not just build a whole bunch of garbage let's go all right I want to tell you a story I want to tell you about how you think Roll-Ups work because I know exactly how you think Roll-Ups work and I'm going to tell you in this story check it out this is you right you're happy you're on you're on ethereum and you got some money who doesn't right in this in this situation then there's this scary Bridge smart contract right and this is also on ethereum and it and and the bridge smart contract kind of gets you over to optimism land or it kind of protects optimism I don't know I know you think that this is how it works and um and so then you wanna you wanna get your money over to optimism land right so so you you know you send your your uh your money over to the bridge smart contract the scary bridge and you know it goes nom nom nom and it eats it and spits it out on the other end and it and somehow it gets over to optimism right this is how it works and boom now you know you could open up your metamask and foreign looks like we're ran into an audio issue where we lost your audio maybe let's just quickly see what happened there you can't hear me now we can but we couldn't for the last 30 seconds damn well let's try again I don't know whatever all right well I don't know what I was saying for the last 30 seconds something something uh sequencer King of the castle publishes data to some data availability layer and um and and but we know we we need to turn the uh we need to turn the the bridge smart contract into into a security guard and we need to give it and so we add these things these proofs right we had these like fault proofs that protect the role of proofs it's like you know so I'm giving the security guard an AK-47 and then everybody knows that obviously uh ZK Roll-Ups are better than optimistic Roll-Ups because because uh the marketing department told you so so that's like adding a second AK-47 but this time it's gold plated and uh and now and now we're really protecting the roll up nobody's getting past the the security guard Bridge contract with two AK-47s um and and that's and everyone knows that the bridge smart contract is how we protect the roll-up right wrong all this is wrong every single thing in here is wrong if you think that this is basically how Roll-Ups work you're wrong and that's okay because everybody is wrong they all think the role of software that work like this and they don't they don't work like this so I'm going to tell you how Roll-Ups really work all right so I want you to forget everything you've learned you know here's you I want you to take your your mind eraser and blast yourself in the face with it uh what is a roll-up what is a roll-up I'm going to tell you a roll-up is a function over an input array okay that sounds very mathy that sounds very mathy I'm using the word function in a mathy way you know function I have I kind of mean it to be equivalent uh no I'm lagging again come on where is it I kind of mean it to be equivalent to a program a piece of code right a specific you know a series of steps that takes an input and transitions it into an output so let's look at this what is a roll-up well we have an input array okay and and I'm representing this as an array to try to be you know theoretical and special and whatever but but we all know that when I'm saying it's an array I really mean it's generally a bull right they're big old chains and um what's going on uh my best guess is that you need to head over to downloadmorram.com and uh make sure that you can up your RAM or if it doesn't work then maybe just disable some local services free up some more Rams it's the buffering on the upload that's that's our best guess so maybe kill some taxes and local service I don't even have any tabs all right I killed OBS maybe it's OBS likely but uh come on task manager tell me what's going wrong it's uh I have like two tabs it's killing my memory oh it's Firefox which Firefox oh you know what I bet which which tab is doing this to me and don't worry we'll be able to edit all these I feel like I'm gonna accidentally kill my live stream that's fine it's all part of the experience you know yeah I have no clue what's doing this to me I mean it's all Firefox but Firefox what I guess we can just blame Firefox for all of our problems that usually works is it just just lagging um yeah it's just lagging in I think it's because it's not it's even happening I mean you know what like let's switch to Chrome and see what happens we can absolutely do that and uh I'll play some hold me right back be right back put some hold music and I'll speed through the rest and uh it'll be time if somebody has any questions on uh how the hackathon logistics are set up or why to really do something that uh we couldn't get to we can't take the next minute to to get there and uh I was not kidding so let's actually play some music until Kevin joins back oh actually you may be here now [Music] foreign [Music] let's see round two no audio but at least his video is not laggy we can't hear you yet Kelly ow there we go all right all right all right all right Kelvin but not laggy this time let's make it work come on all right oh man well what are you gonna do this is why we all work for tech companies so we can have technical difficulties all right let's let's do this let's do this so okay what is a roll-up what is a roll-up right a function over an input array that is a roll-up at its core right when we think about a roll-up we always have a data availability layer we have some sort of there's actually two important things about this this input array there's two really important properties there's ordering and there's data availability and those those two things are both critical ordering is really really important because if the order of my input array changes then the outputs that I get change and data availability is really really important because if I don't know what the inputs are then I can't compute over them so in a roll-up you have an input array right and we usually think that that's a blockchain but it could even be more than one blockchain put together uh but let's just say it's one blockchain for now and we run some kind of code over that input array and we generate an output array this is how a roll-up functions right so simple this is the roll up this is the roll-up and I wanna I wanna note that there's not necessarily A one-to-one correspondence between the inputs and the outputs it could be that one input produces multiple outputs or that multiple inputs are required to produce a single output but the point is that this picture right here what you are staring at right here is the roll up this is the roll-up when you think of a roll-up it's this thing right there's some inputs that's the L1 blockchain there's some code that's the roll up node software and it produces some outputs and that's the roll up blockchain itself and so there's a very important question which is how do you actually append stuff to this input array because a roll-up is not useful unless we can put data into it and add transactions to it and so we need to be able to append things to the input array so generally one way of appending inputs is to append things directly right so here's the input array you know it's the blockchain we're at the latest block here's you you're happy you want to put a transaction in depending on the capabilities of the layer 1 blockchain that we're interacting with you can usually just insert a transaction directly right so most Roll-Ups have this capability there's some sort of smart contract that you can interact with where you can send a transaction to that smart contract and you can insert a transaction into the L1 directly that adds stuff to the input array which also as we see in this picture will produce outputs right so that's approach number one and then a very common secondary approach is this thing called a sequencer now a sequencer the idea of a sequencer is that this is very inefficient posting data like this is very inefficient because there's a lot of fixed overhead when you submit transactions to to a block like ethereum in in ethereum you know specifically there's this 2100 uh gas base cost for every single transaction that's actually a lot of gas for most transactions when most transactions can be compressed down into a lot less so we tend to want to be able to batch things together which allows us to do this fancy compression stuff and really take advantage of of sort of economies of scale so we create this thing called a sequencer the sequencer is our little King of the castle and essentially all the sequencer does is that it takes user transactions and it bundles them together and and what it's going to do is it's going to create bundles of these transactions and it's going to publish them to the data availability layer to your to your L1 system but the important thing is that we want a really we want a good user experience publishing these getting these bundles together can take quite a while we don't always want to publish these bundles immediately and so what the sequencer does is the sequencer pinky promises that they're going to include this bundle in the future and you see I've I've represented this Pinky Promise by highlighting this in Gray and essentially what we can do is that we can run our rollup code over what we think the roll-up or the the the input array is going to look like in the future and we can generate these outputs and we know what the outputs are going to look like in the future and this is before the sequencer has even published anything to the L1 we just know that this is what it's going what it's going to look like assuming that the sequencer comes through on their pinky promise and eventually the sequencer sends off the transaction to the actual data availability layer and this becomes real so the inputs become real and the outputs become real right so that's the gist of the roll-up this thing that I've represented to you is the roll up and I'll note that I haven't talked about any sort of proof mechanisms or ZK Roll-Ups or optimistic Roll-Ups because all of that stuff is fake and I'll explain to you that in a minute so the next thing is well we have systems right and and we want to connect these systems with other systems because connecting with other systems is useful um you know if we just had this roll up I guess we could interact in our own little bubble here and this is what you might call a sovereign roll-up right uh it's you know you can post data to this data availability layer you can interact in your own little bubble but if we want to interact with other things we need to be able to connect with other systems so how do we connect with other systems well we have an automatic connection to the parent system where the parent system is where the L1 data lives where the inputs live because sort of whereas the I want to do the spinny Thing by definition that's how the roll-up works the roll-up is is taking its data it is defined by the data and The Ordering of that data right so we have this automatic connection to the parent system which is why I can include transactions by sending a transaction directly to the parent system because just by definition I am driving the roll up from that parent system but what about other data sources where you don't have this type of trustless connection this this definitional connection to these other data sources what if there's another blockchain there's you know there's uh you know kelvin's super roll up two and and I want to bridge kelvin's super roll up two and Kelvin super roll up one right I wanna I wanna get information from from this other roll up into my rollup well like we said anything from the input is trustless because the roll-up is defined by the input but for anything else we need a convincing argument right why should smart contracts on my roll up listen to stuff that you're saying over on your roll up or that smart contracts are saying on your roll up why should I listen because at the end of the day they are two separate independent systems and I don't have this direct connection so why should I listen to you well we need to be convinced right so how did how do we do this how do we generally be convinced of things on other chains this is just asking how bridges work how do bridge protocols work well there's a lot of different ways that we can make Bridge code protocols work uh people do authority-based bridge protocols right which is like oh where is it God coming down you know with God's little weird finger coming down and saying uh this is what the other roll-up or the other blockchain looks like right now just just trust me right listen to me and if you trust the authority if I'm a smart contract on my chain and I trust the authority and I'm like whatever you know God's not going to lie to me who cares then I'm fine then we have sort of a strengthening of this we have threshold threshold authorities so maybe you know God has three hands now and two of them have to come down we have like clients you know which is sort of the the ugly little brother of the chain coming in and saying you know good enough it's a it's a representation of the chain it's not the chain itself but it's a representation of the chain with pretty good trust assumptions where where we can say okay I I'm convinced you know that this is this is the state of the other chain we have fault proofs right fault proofs are essentially two people going back and forth saying no you repeatedly until we figure out who's right and then we have validity proofs and that's the you know that's the math nerd coming in uh with such a convincing argument that you you simply can't uh you can't reject it right uh this is how we communicate between blockchains this is how blockchain communication happens if I have a third party chain and it wants to communicate with me it has to convince me what its state is now what's the worst thing that can happen in this situation what's the worst thing that can happen when somebody is trying to communicate with me in this way well I would argue that the worst thing that can happen is that apps on our chain could be convinced of something invalid right the the mechanism by which I'm convinced of the thing that's happening on this other chain could break and it convinces it could convince me on my chain that something happened on your chain that didn't actually happen right where's my oops and and I want to put this in caps because I'm going to bring I'm going to come back to it later but this does not directly impact the other chain what has broken here is my view of the other chain the other chain is is is running independently right it could be that the other chain has absolutely no clue that I'm even trying to read data from that other chain if my view of the if that other chain breaks the other chain does not break I mean my smart contracts might break because I might be making decisions based on bad data but the other chain doesn't break all right so let's get to withdrawals right because I've talked about all this stuff and I've talked about a whole roll-up system but I haven't talked about this bridge stuff and and the proof mechanisms yet so what is it what about withdrawals right so what are withdrawals let's look at this picture again we have the roll up this is the roll-up when you think roll up I want you to think about this we're adults now so we know that that I was sort of lying to you and that these things are blockchains um what are withdrawals well I want to put these pieces back together and I want to show you something so here's you and let's say you want to send some funds from the parent chain into the child blockchain into the L2 from the L1 into the L2 what do you do well you use the mechanism that we talked about earlier to directly add inputs to the input array you send a transaction to the L1 blockchain this adds an input to the input array that tells the L2 kind of trustlessly that it can mint funds on the L2 all right so this is the same picture that we saw before it's one directional it's one directional and again there's nothing in here about proofs optimistic or ZK but now I want to get my money out so I light my money on fire on L2 and I tell the L1 that I burned it and the l1's like I have no clue I don't I I the L1 doesn't read the L2 the L1 has no clue what's happening on the L2 and so the L1 says prove it right this smart contract on L1 that is that is uh locking up these funds says prove it and so you got to put on your your judge your judge wig or your uh your lawyer wig and you have to prove it so let's go to court right here's you with your lawyer wig here's the smart contract on L1 that has the key to your safe how do you prove it well one way to prove it is you could use a proof of authority and that's God's finger coming down then there's a threshold system and that's and then there's like clients and then there's fault proofs and then there's validity proofs wait a minute this is exactly like we what we just did when we wanted to receive data on the roll up it's the same image but in Reverse just like when we want to receive data when we want to send data to the L1 we need to make a convincing argument to the L1 about what and this is this applies to any chain when we want to send data to any other chain sending data is like receiving data but in reverse that should seem obvious to us but in our mental model as it traditionally isn't but it is obvious withdrawals are just another chain receiving data from the L2 yes that's how this works withdrawals in this case the standard thing is that withdrawals on the L1 are the L is the L1 receiving data from the L2 just like how we talked about how the L2 can receive data from other Chains It's a symmetrical image and so when I if when I talked about this what's the worst thing could have that could happen it doesn't doesn't directly impact the other chain right the worst thing that can happen is that the the smart contract on L1 releases some funds that it shouldn't release which is bad but it doesn't directly impact the L2 and this is a really really really important property to understand if the bridge breaks the roll-up does not break this is such an important thing to know about Roll-Ups I think so many people have this mental model that the bridge defines the roll up but in reality the bridge does not define the roll-up at all the bridge is a view into the Roll-Up if the bridge breaks that is obviously Bad Assets on the roll-up can become under collateralized but if the bridge breaks if the bridge finalizes a state that is not what what's in the Roll-Up that is a problem for the bridge the roll-up is still going to continue operating as if nothing ever happened because just like I said in the slide many slides ago the bridge the roll-up may not even know that the bridge exists and in many cases the roll-up has absolutely no clue that the bridge exists so let me get to the second part of this talk which is that ZK Roll-Ups aren't real now obviously ZK Roll-Ups are real in the sense that people create these things and they call them CK Roll-Ups right you know we've got CK sync we've got polygon ckm evm the weight is over but I'm still waiting and then we've got scroll right um when I say ZK Roll-Ups aren't real what I really mean to say is that the ZK part is not fundamental to the Roll-Up in the way that we just described Roll-Ups there is a roll-up part and then on these other chains there's an implementation detail of a smart contract on a completely different system that has nothing to do with the roll up that either uses a ZK or an optimistic or a like client or a or if an authority proof or many different sort of things to establish a view into the roll-up on a completely different system the ZK part is not fundamental to the roll-up there is no such thing as ZK or optimistic Roll-Ups there are just roll-ups at the end of the day there are just Roll-Ups and then we create these view mechanisms on other systems completely separate systems and and they have proof systems and those things are ZK are optimistic but if you tie these things together if you think that there's a thing called a ZK roll-up or an optimistic roll-up and somehow ZK and optimistic rollups are fundamentally different you're going to be at a disadvantage in the mental model for what a roll-up is and the reality is that I think the optimistic crew gets this now but why not the ZK crew why why like what is this and and I think the answer is that ZK is really hard and people feel like they have to create the ZK proof because if you don't create a proof If you don't create a ZK proof are you really a ZK roll-up right that's sort of are you really a ZK evm if you don't have the proof so they start with the proof and they build this proof right they build this proof system and they spend all this time building this proof system and it's really really hard and then they sort of cram the evm inside of this proof system they shove it in and it sort of you know looks like this and it's kind of like it doesn't want to be in this tight little space and parts are sticking out and it's not quite the evm and then they pat it on the head and they and they say that it's just you know it's just looking extra equivalent today um you know but it's not really it's not really the evm I mean let's whatever uh but what's the correct way to do this what is the real what's the right way to build these systems the right way is to build the evm in all its Glory you know this is weight lifting evm super evm and what we want to do then is we want to build a box around it instead of cramming it cramming the group The the evm into the proof system we want to create a proof system around the ebm and this is what's really going to make it obvious that ZK Roll-Ups don't exist or is he or optimistic Roll-Ups don't exist really it's just roll-ups and then we want to make a proof system around it uh that's the gist of the talk I cut it a little bit short because we we had some technical difficulties earlier but thank you for coming to my TED Talk uh remember that ZK Roll-Ups aren't real uh optimism is not a roll-up optimism is an upgrade to capitalism join the collective change the incentives and you will change the world come check out the uh the vision of what optimism and the optimism Collective is trying to do come check out the op stack docs if you want to build your own your very own blockchain uh your very own Layer Two today and you know I just want to say understand this property about Roll-Ups understand that the proof system is not fundamental what you want to do is you want to build a really good roll up and then you want to build a proof system on top of it and if you build a roll up that way you can build a roll-up where it doesn't matter whether it's CK or optimistic you can slap a ZK proof on it later you can slap an optimistic proof on it later you can slack slap 10 different proof mechanisms at the same time that's the right way to build Roll-Ups but if you think if you tie the bridge to the roll up you're thinking about these things wrong the bridge is an independent system the bridge is a view into the Roll-Up so think about that that's how Roll-Ups really work ZK Roll-Ups aren't real optimistic Roll-Ups aren't real join the optimism Collective optimism is an upgrade to capitalism change the incentives and you change the world have fun build something cool and if you want to fight me on Twitter we can fight on Twitter thank you so much and have a wonderful day amazing well it still worked out at the end and we got everything and we'll make sure that once this goes edited out on YouTube it's smooth and perfect thank you and uh that was a really informative talk I think it's a really good way to think about those Primitives and just break them down into those smaller components that actually matter and uh personally what I got out of it was that optimism is the only real blockchain only serious blockchain only seriously there are other real there are other real watches yeah optimism is the only serious one that's correct it's amazing well Kevin thank you so much for joining us and we'll see you all on Discord hacking away on the op stack thank you bye everybody all right next up I want to bring on Jesse to talk about everything bass you probably saw a lot of this over the last week and if anything this is all Twitter and crypto Twitter was talking about so I'm gonna give him the stage here to talk about how do we bring in the next billion users into the winter ecosystem welcome Jesse thanks kartik hello everybody and two driving Applause to Kevin filcher amazing great talk really love that um we're excited and grateful to be working with the optimism team uh I'm ready to dive into how we're going to bring the next billion users to crypto um just to quickly reintroduce myself I'm Jesse I'm the kind of first contributor to base I lead All Things based day to day um and I'm gonna do kind of a high level overview of kind of what is uh our vision with bass and coinbase for kind of how the on-chain economy and architecture has been develop um then I'm going to share a little bit more detail about what is base and then I'll close with a few minutes of um uh kind of like how do you build on base how can you build on base during this hackathon over the next few months a few weeks and then if we have time which we may not uh we'll do some q a but uh excited to be here thank you Eve Global uh for having me thank you hackers around the world for um you know scaling ethereum so uh quickly just a a refresher coinbase um what is coinbase you've probably used at coinbase.com coinbase wallet um we've been building in the crypto economy for 10 years I I like to say we have 110 million users and 80 billion tvl um that TV out right now is primarily stored in off chain coinbase.com that is custodial um but one way I've increasingly been thinking about that octane custodial coinbase.com is almost like a roll-up or like an L2 it's just a really bad one it's private uh it is centralized uh it's not transparent um and a lot of what I've been thinking about for the last many years is how do we move our users our assets out of that kind of private L2 that doesn't work as well as it could and into new on-chain systems that give our users more flexibility uh more autonomy more agency and bring them into this kind of burgeoning crypto economy that we're so excited to be helping to build and I think as we're thinking about making that move for our customers the thing that's really motivating us is this thesis that on chain is the next online and so I want to kind of quickly talk about what does that actually mean uh we at a high level think about um uh kind of the last 40 Years of kind of building applications in three phases uh the first phase was kind of pre-2000 which was the offline application development phase um this is when people were writing you know code for computers or mainframes um at that point information and money was still very much managed by Central Gatekeepers uh and the folks who were building applications were moving really slowly uh and only had so much reach you know you would uh write an app you'd put it on a floppy disk or a CD and then the best you could do is distribute it to everyone and hope that they opened up that piece of mail and put it in their computer um but but for the most part they didn't and that meant that newspapers and Banks were the way you could really kind of influence people and then the internet happened and it was this crazy thing uh and for the first time information became permissionless and this created a whole new wave of innovation um we had millions of developers all over the world and anyone anywhere could build apps for the internet that anyone anywhere could access and developers started moving 10 times faster than they could before we saw the rise of uh Twitter or Facebook we saw the creation of video chat of streaming um literally what we are doing here right now is only possible because of the online era unlocking information to be a permissionless thing that anyone could build on and yet money still had Gatekeepers if you wanted to build an application that touched money or value you had to interact with banks you had to interact with the government you could not build something Global for the people and we believe that right now we are sitting on the precipice of the next big change and that is moving from an online economy into an on-chain economy and moving for the first time from a world where money has Gatekeepers and if value has Gatekeepers to a world where both money and information for the first time are permissionless and anyone can build on them and in that world anyone anywhere you wherever you are in the world are going to build applications that use value that use money that use information that anyone anywhere can access and once again we are going to see another 10x 100x growth in the amount of impact that developers like you can have on a day-to-day basis and so coinbase has been building for this on chain future for a long time we started in 2012 at the time there was no smart contract there was only Bitcoin we made it the easiest place to buy Bitcoin and then really starting in 2018 we began thinking about how do we go bigger how do we become more on chain we launched usdc we launched coinbase wallet we launched CBE we launched a Dap wallet in the coinbase app all of these things gave our customers a real on-chain experiences and and were built by developers who were writing in smart contracts building on this on-chain platform and with the launch of Base which I'll talk about in a second which is our ethereum L2 we are catapulting ourselves into the next phase of this on chain feature and starting to create a platform that makes it easy for coinbase developers and developers globally to be building on chain and as we started thinking about base the thing that actually motivated us and the thing that got us to building an L2 was a process that we ran in 2022 where we tried to say okay everything's moving on chain we see that this is going to be an incredibly high impact uh new venue for developers to build what is that actually going to look like and how does coinbase fit into it and after a year of kind of digging we took away three key takeaways the first key takeaway was that evm is going to be the primary developer platform that most developers are building applications for um this came from working with internal teams working with external teams observing that today evm has 10x the devs dapps TBL compared to any other platform and that lead is only growing and so as a result of that observation what we've decided to do internally at coinbase is build all of our on-chain products evm first both for our developer tools so our internal teams have really easy way paved Road for getting started building on chain but also for our user-facing products so everything works for all of the incredible evm power products that y'all are building so that was the first big takeaway the second big takeaway was that ethereum is going to be the primary L1 it's going to be the thing that provides security decentralization neutrality uh and it's going to be a thing that enables scaling on top of it and so for the last year coinbase and base have been investing in scaling ethereum um we've done that through contributing to something called eip4844 which is an upgrade to ethereum that's going to make it so roll up like optimism and bass and Arboretum are 10 to 100 times cheaper than they are today and get us closer to what we think about as kind of the magical Fee number which is less than a cent for the average transaction and then the Third the Third Way and this was one that was actually pretty surprising to us or different than where we started is we started thinking about this assuming that there was just gonna be one l-2 and that the most important thing for us was kind of picking the right L2 and I think after a lot of thinking and working and talking with teams we ended in a place where we believe now that there's actually going to be many of these things and that they're going to work together they're going to interoperate they're going to standardize and they're going to scale ethereum collectively and that as coinbase our duty is to contribute to that and that is why we're launching base in collaboration with optimism on the open source op stack so that we can start to have the tools that are freely available to anyone anywhere to build and scale Layer Two on top of ethereum and we can ensure that those tools work for everyone and create a platform on top of which we can have many chains that interoperate seamlessly together and so with all that context of our on-chain vision our North Star is how do we bring a million developers and a billion users on chain and base is our contribution to that and so if you haven't heard it already if you didn't see the blue dot on Twitter um bases in ethereum L2 that's built to scale the crypto economy it's powered by the op stack um it's empowered by coinbase which I'll talk about in a second it's a fully open ecosystem so anyone can build there coinbase will seed it with our users our assets our infrastructure but then the magic of what will come on base will come from all the developers everywhere including y'all it's low cost uh we're gonna have some some cool rewards that we do for developers we're building that and it's all secured by ethereum one thing that I want to dig in on is that component of empowered by coinbase what does that actually mean when I say empowered by coinbase what that actually means is if you look at the coinbase products today we are increasingly starting to um create opportunities for organic distribution of our user base those 110 million users to Applications and so this image on the left you'll see this is our new web 3 page if you go to coinbase.com web3 this is what you'll see these are it's basically an app store and it's ratings it's reviews it's uh search that allows any of our customers to start to find the best apps that they want to use and over the next year we're going to be building more and more of these tools and the goal is to make it so that any user can access any app with a safe trusted easy to use interface and that we actually bring those customers to developers like y'all so as you find product Market fit you can grow your business and so that's the organic part of uh empowered by coinbase the the other side of empowered by coinbases we're also starting to build uh what we call paid tools or acquisition tools and so on the top left you see a few ads uh that's coin Ledger that's looks rare we believe that there's an opportunity for us to rebuild the infrastructure of kind of advertising to make it more open more transplant more accessible to anyone and to use that as a way of bringing the 110 million users that we have to the incredible application developers like y'all and so the easiest way to think about it is imagine you build a lending product and you have you know 50 million tvl and your goal is to grow to a billion TBL and what you find is that there's a certain class of users maybe people who have a certain amount of money or hold a certain amount of assets um that are really High return on investment for your protocol if you can get those users they'll use your protocol they will put their Assets in it they will help you grow your business um and you're willing to pay for that and this is kind of the thing that we've seen from businesses forever if they find product Market fit when they find product Market fit uh they're willing to pay to acquire the users that are going to be incredibly valuable for them what we want to do with coinbase is we want to make it so for anyone who finds those users who starts to understand who those users are we can give you access to those users and we can do it in a way that protects their privacy we can do it in a way that uh lives up to the best kind of values of decentralization and transparency that coinbase uh has worked to embody over the last many years and we could also do it in a way that delivers real value to your business and so when we say empowered by coinbase what we mean is our goal is to through organic and paid distribution take the 110 million users that we have in the coinbase ecosystem today and bring them to developers like you so that you can grow your business you can grow your protocol and you can help us get to not 100 million users but a billion users and then 5 billion users using the on-chain crypto economy every day now a few more things that you might want to have questions about with base or or you're interested in learning the first thing is basically is going to be fully permissionless and it's going to gradually decentralize this is something that people a lot of people have asked we believe that bass must extend and inherit the permissionlessness of ethereum and so that's why we're working with optimism that's why we're prioritizing decentralization there's three big axes on top of which we think about decentralization the first is block building the second is protocol upgrades the third is validator set and we're going to be making significant progress on each of those this year and and defending the kind of permissionlessness of ethereum uh in base as a layer tube foreign talking a little bit more about that relationship with optimism um bass is built on the op stack if you haven't heard the op stack or you didn't watch Kevin's talk just now it's incredibly powerful open source toolkit it's MIT license which means that anyone can use it Fork it update it contribute to it and we are joining as the second core developer of the op stack and what that means is that bass and coinbase are going to be taking our resources and putting them into accelerating the roadmap of the op staff across things like security decentralization scalability um and what that means is you all are going to have a better toolkit for building your own chains if you want to and the chains that you Deploy on like base and optimism mainnet are going to be faster lower cost and more secure the second thing that we're doing as part of this collaboration uh is we are contributing a portion of the sequencer revenue from Faith uh to the retroactive public goods funding model that optimism has been pioneering and what this means is we're taking our money and we're putting it into funding those public goods that make base possible make ethereum possible make the internet possible and we believe that this is a critical thing for everyone to be doing uh as they're starting to contribute to their shared platform that is scaling the the on-chain crypto economy and then finally the third thing is we're going to be working with optimism and ethereum to Champion this decentralized on-chain of crypto economy I just mentioned it we're making base uh permission lists um it is a a key component of what we believe the infrastructure of this crypto economy will be and ensuring that that infrastructure means remains open to everyone in the world is is an absolute top priority for us a little bit more color on timeline if you haven't already seen it we launched the test net for base uh two weeks ago you can go start building on that today at base.org I'll share a little bit more about how to get started in a second we're working towards the mainnet in uh Q2 uh we're going to start with the Genesis that's going to be more quiet where the chain will start running and then we'll gradually build towards a more go loud launch where all the coinbase products are going to be integrated as well as a ton of other ecosystem Builders and then as we progress through Q3 um we'll have more rapid improvements uh to the security the the cost the decentralization of the chain um and the key takeaway to know there is you can start building on Base today and anything you start Building on Base today is going to be on track to launch sometime in the next few months as we bring the the test net to Maine now so now I want to dive a little bit more into how can you build on base there's a few steps the first is that you have to bridge some assets to base uh base is running on the base test net is running on Gurley uh ethereum Gurley so if you go to bridge.base.org you can take your girly assets uh and you can Bridge them it's really easy it goes pretty much instantly uh from girly to base um and at the other side you'll have ethereum on the base girly Network that you can use for gas um if you don't want a bridge that's okay too uh coinbase has faucets that you can use if you go to coinbase.com faucets you can really quickly get 0.1 girly eat per day and that will get you started with deploying contracts if you don't want to go to coinbase.com or you want more girly thin point one oh wow missing a slide where to go did it get deleted oh I gotta go back sorry there we go if you want more than one girly um let me get there again if you want more than 0.1 girly eat uh every day or most days I am tweeting saying tweet at me with your ens name uh and I'll send you one girly um and so if you go to twitter.com Jessie Pollock right now you'll see the top tweet or one of the most recent tweets uh and you can just reply to that with your ens name and I will get you started with one girly eat oh and so last kind of closing component if you're if you want more information on how to get started we have some guides you can scan this QR code and that will take you to a guide for using hard hat for using remix we're updating and improving this content every day so keep going to docs.base.org and we will make that happen and so with that I'm done five minutes early uh and I don't know if Karthik is around but we can open up for questions uh or we can wrap early now let's do questions this is uh this is a Hot Topic in the sense that there's so much chatter around it but uh everybody's just gonna been busy and just managing all the inflow so um I have a couple questions and uh as people kind of type their questions and chat I'll feel them too awesome my my first question to you is obviously you talked about how people can build and why are you doing it but how do you actually define success here is this is is this to you the fact that you get to measure coinbase brought in millions of users or is the fact that ethereum itself became bigger or or something different or makes it both is considered good yeah so if you look at the crypto on like crypto economy today I think we have a few million people who are using crypto on a daily basis or maybe less than that uh one to two million people who are using crypto on daily basis I think at the highest level success is like five billion people are using crypto on a daily basis and so how do we get there our thesis is we need to make it easier for developers to build useful applications too much of crypto has been about kind of trading historically uh speculation and we're just entering the point where we have the infrastructure to for developers to build non-speculative applications and we want to make it really really easy for developers to do that um and so our kind of North Star there is a million developers uh and I am over overly ambitious maybe but my goal is to get a million developers this year uh through working with folks like Global um third web all the incredible kind of folks we've been working with so the first measurement is like can we get to a million developers who are building on base and contributing to broader crypto economy and then the second one is can we make it really really easy for users to actually use those applications so when developers build useful applications developers can just do it without thinking and it's a no-brainer and it feels as easy as any product that they would use today and I think that's where like coinbase comes in we're working really closely with the coinbase team but also the rainbow team and the frame team and other wallet teams to make it so that the experience of users actually accessing applications on base is is my very easy and that's where the kind of billion user goal will come in and my goal is again overly ambitious about doing users next year and so that's what we're going to be looking at like when I wake up every morning I'm like what are we doing to get to a million developers and a billion users today and we want those people to be obviously coming through base but then going everywhere in the broader kind of ethereum super chain we think about base as a bridge not an island uh something that actually enables people to come from off chain to on-chain but then through interoperability at the chain level and then support across the coinbase products will make it so that users can transact wherever they want so if they say hey I want to go use this application over there we want to help them do that oh no that's amazing I I think one thing that I like already is that you are in a way baking in the fact that this has to coexist with everybody else and not uh my own thing um and yeah I mean by the way I think coinbase or we're just one part of the broader crypto economy and y'all are the people who are building we're the ones who you know have been building and we're going to create infrastructure but y'all are going to be the one who create the applications that billions of people want to use I'm so excited all of you are here today to be doing that no I think that's a I think that's a wonderful not to hand on and we kind of get to see this live over the next uh six months and uh and get more dance to build on it and see if they can break things so you can fix them and uh amazing I go faster amazing thanks everyone uh docs.base.orgbase.org if you want one free base girly test net youth find me at twitter.com jessiepalek reply to the Tweet that's right there and I will get that to you with your ens amazing well thank you so much Jesse and looking forward to seeing what people build on base thanks everyone all right see ya next up I want to talk well I want Porto to come on and talk about eip4844 and there's a lot of 4844 stuff going on here some of you may know how this helps us get you really really cheap data and transactions and there's a lot more that people don't talk about and we're going to take about 44 minutes maybe less to cover all those specifics so we'll get Porto to join us in in a second as we get to load up the slides and in the meantime if you have any other questions that come up for Proto or Jesse or anybody else please let us know and we'll be able to kind of relate those questions to you and to the speakers and get those answers so without further Ado let's welcome Proto and hi how's it going it's going very well thank you for introducing for the introduction absolutely hello everybody um Proto Lambda I work at op lumps um I'm going to present about ep44 okay so let's jump into this Ford prefer is in EIP it's about a year old Nam to start it during Eve Denver and uh well let me get started with the actual science if this works moment there we go all right it's technical issues it's like a curse starting with the presentation of golfing um so hello I'm I'm Proto um worked up elaps proto-dink sharding is kind of a meme it's this this name that's been attached to fortnite what it really is it's the first iteration of the sharding roadmap of ethereum and uh this like this long-term vision is like inspired by the work by the duncartes and by fitonic another research team um however we cannot wait we will want to leave on this charting on ethereum today like these are multi-year research processors and so instead of trying to do everything at once we as Engineers we are looking to build this first iteration and this is a collaboration between OPI lamps coinbase as well as all the different layer one client teams and the research theme of course Fleet Foundation that's putting together resources to implement the transaction pool changes the The Blob storage the syncing everything that's involved in this first iteration of sharing and so what I'm going to tell you about is really like what is this thing what this word for Fern why are we doing this like how does this work on layer one how does this work on Layer Two and then I'll talk a little bit about the fee structure of retrofer and about the clients and the progress with like made so far so models for eip4 do ep44 increases the data availability for layer 2 to about half a megabytes per layer one block for context the current data availability is around 75 70-ish gigabytes and so this this jump up in data availability increases the capacity that is there for Roll-Ups to post their data to if you've watched the talk from Kelvin about how these Roll-Ups work then you are now familiar with the concept of a data fatability layer the data availability layer is kind of hijacked on top of the Legacy ethereum we use call data which is meant to be in input to the evm but instead of using the score data but we intend to use his blog data blob data is like special specialized resource so we can have more of this without putting a lot of more strain on this these layer bomb nuts um and as you can see roller popularity has been rising like around and 2020 is when the idea of a roll-up Center roadmap started to really take off around the launch of the the beacon chain and since then the the Roll-Ups have taken more and more of data of layer one so half of the current capacity like half of the data inputs to the evm are not actually inputs to the evm their rollup contents I don't even want to change this and optimize so we can have more of these contents because why well 97 of the fees on layer 2 today are actually just paying for the call data on layer one and there are basically misusing this resource this resource is not efficiently utilized to derive the layer 2 Chain um well this is kind of what it looks like so this is where transaction fees are going and the thing we're going to try and optimize like this could be this total it could be much much smaller if the technology the largest cost Factor here like also Layer Two we're not asking a lot of fees it's primarily just data fees and we'd rather have a lot more users that can adopt ethereum through Layer Two and we can do so by utilizing short data to host all the auto contacts so this is what layer one looks like today merge is complete got to remove one slide leading up to those uh in like the modular book 10 stops we have a consensus layer and execution layer now but it's only the start of modular book two but we are looking at today if you're in breeding it's kind of this hack where we have player 2 and it's attached to the call data of the evm there's no clean separation and although we have these these fault proofs and validity proofs to verify outputs of the evm we kind of have the strong coupling idea or like how our rollup should be secured it's not efficiently attached to to layer one and so what we want to do with 44 is to model it like this where we have a consensus layer we have an execution layer and there's this layer on data which technically speaking it's part of the consensus layer the consensus layer holds onto the data and thoughts on which data is available or not and then through the execution layer the data is registered and paid for but the status really meant to provide for these these roll ups for Layer Two to scale and this is only the start like for it for far is a is an incremental step towards field starting what we're looking at after 45 is filtering sorting which basically means we can support a lot more of these data plumps and how do we plan to support this this can be supported with data availability sampling which is this this security technique for validators on the network to randomly poke others on the network to see if that is available and the the poking here the sampling can be dramatically improved using redundancy and using these efficient proofs of the data and so I'll talk a little bit more about how these blobs are structured they are structured in a very particular way where they are future compatible with this full sharding vision okay so how does emp4844 really work now there is this new blob transaction type and the blobs that are paid for these this this contents the data is held into the big note in the consensus layer for two weeks approximately and what this means is that we separate this ID of syncing and this ID of security syncing you should be able to fetch the layer to state from any place just as with layer one the critical part really is this last two weeks of data and so as intuition you could think about a CDN or some surface where it's much much cheaper to provide host and like cache the data and distribute it if the data doesn't change versus changing data and similarly like this this recent amount of data it's more unstable it's still being voted on it's in certain the layer bomb might propose it but not actually make it available to those that rely on it and what we want to secure really is that any verifier of layer 2 is able to get the data and then able to use the data on top of this this older state of layer 2. to get the very latest State the tip of the chain and then using the latest State they can produce any like with filled data they can produce any proof that they might need to counter any false claims on their one or to produce a validity proof themselves on layer one and this is what secures the Roll-Ups it's really this this recent data that's important to make available and then the older data we can optimize and so this task of ethereum changes to how can we make the data available to this these Layer Two networks that rely on it to secure all their their full assets as a threat this is a this is a special data it's not just that they cannot be can use regular storage Services it has to be available and this availability I'll talk more about this it's just a strong feature of sharding where this this type of resource that ethereum was lacking is dramatically increasing and then you ask well who's paying for this resource how does this work there's this new transaction type and similar to how you can run the evm you can now also attach data to ethereum to make it available and what this means is that there's a regular erp1559 transaction and the transaction contains some pointers and the sprinters they point to these separated blobs and the idea here is that the transaction registers the fee payment is processed by the EPM whereas the blobs they are separated and they go into the consensus layer into the beacon mode so here's the transaction in more detail the nice thing about this transaction is that it's structured using the latest encoding formats as a z that the beacon chain also uses and then the functionality is mostly the same as with erp1559 it's just strictly a small extension to express the fee payments and to register the data and so there's this Max fee per day the gas that's added and there is a a list of hashes that refer to the commitments that then refer to the full contents of the of the blob and the the pretty thing here is that the data hashes they are easily embedded into the transaction they don't take a lot of space they are 32 bytes long so they fit in the EFM very nicely whereas these commitments these are 48 bands they go into the beginning and they are kcg commitments kcg is this special commitment time type similar to what the Merkle tree does except instead of a miracle proof you have an opening to prove any particular points or multiple Burns in this set of blob data and this allows you to build an efficient proof for the contents of The Blob then you need it in the evm but otherwise basically optimizes away the the proof data and this is this is the key part for filtering sorting for this full fission of data availability sampling to have this type of commitment in there and so what this really means is that the transaction goes into the evm like At first it's generalized it's abstracted as this message just like any other transaction the EFM doesn't really know about transaction types with this additional report data the commitments and the blobs they don't go into the evm they leave the execution layer and they go into the consensus layer so how does this lifecycle work right I'm just layer 2 user I want to utilize the sharp data what does this mean though you just use ethereum as you would use it today it's a lot like just sending a layer on transaction except it's on Layer Two it's on our rollup and then the roll of operator or the sequencer that builds all the transactions and then the transaction bundle that really happens there is that needs to be submitted to layer 1 to make it available for fair fires to see and like reproduce the layer 2 stats and so this bundle of transactions it's encoded it might be split across multiple layer one transactions but really the key here is that the data is encoded into blobs and these blobs paid form have plot transactions go into the layer 1 transaction pool and then the big contain proposers can pick up on transactions from the transaction pool they can build their exclusion by a lot and then along with the execution parallels there's now this new addition of a blob sidecar this is additional data that comes with the beacon block and there's a separate syncing click syncing method to distribute the Sidecar and the beacon chain distributes the data and then everybody on the beginning for a certain amount of time so they hold on to that for like two weeks maybe a month depends on the exact parameters in EAP foreign and then the execution payout stays in there one with the fee payments but then the blobs eventually get pruned from layer one meaning that the resource usage on their bond is bounded bounded resource usage is like this long-term goal of ethereum where we shouldn't always keep drawing the state and growing the chain history we want to make this sustainable and so this is a really important feature of 424 and of sharding in general that once you start adding a lot of share data that we don't rapidly increase the resource requirements of regular layer one loads and then it's for up to the layer 2 to persist data long term and this is not at risk anymore after the the proofs that secure the assets assets have already large CPD in completed it's then up to the layer 2 Community the stakeholders of that that roll up that's the like the now fully agreed up on their two states is is there for others to sink and join this this layer to ecosystem similar to what we do another one and so this is what it looks like in terms of the network I have to see concern and this transaction pool if you could think of it just this cloud of suggestions for the layer one proposer to build the perfect block then the blobs and execution payloads make their way into the beacon chain and then the other nodes on the network they they verify the fee payments and the verify the data is there but then the data is retrieved by another layer two nodes the layer 2 verifier to reproduce the layer 2 States using this data as an input to the rollup again parts to talk back often to learn all about how the Roll-Up processes this data now how does this work between the layer bomb consensus layer and the layer bomb execution layer we used to have this API called the engine API and we have the same API right now except we are adding one method and one type we're adding this blobs bundle so that everything that comes with the transactions can be displayed for better transactions but then don'ts together and separate it from the regular execution payout and so the consensus layer can retrieve the execution payloads to embed in the beacon block and can retrieve the the bundle of blobs the Sidecar to then distribute two other big nodes for the the periods that the data needs to be available so we talked about like how 45 works on layer one and to complete the picture we also need to talk about how ep424 works on layer 2. because this data would be kind of useless if there were not all these many different Roll-Ups building ecosystems extensions of ethereum on top of this data and so what it means to update Layer Two it means to update the proof so that the inputs that we now change about the layer 2 make their way through the layer 2 State transition to produce the new layer 2 output this transition has to be proven on layer one and then we change the verifier counts to actually pick up on this data to process it in the first place and we change the battery meter to even submit the data before the verifier can pick up on it so it's really bad symmeter first then verifier and then the proof shows the full transition of processing blob data running the layer to stay transition and then producing the outputs that then is claimed or validated on their one so show a I'll show this simplified ZK validity proof zika roll ups they they all work a little bit different but if you generalize them a little bit what it looks like is that there is some form of computational layer bomb that verifies business data to show one one state route on claim going to another claim and the proof shows that that this transition is felt so how this works is that we first want to prove that we have the correct data in our system and since not every roll up is every zika run up is built with kcg but some will have to do is this proof of equivalence to show that the kcg commitments are for the data is equivalent to the commitment that they prefer to use luckily because this is a polynomial commitment this can be done rather efficiently as part of the CK proof in a way and so there's this precompile that allows you to evaluate a a polynomial do a single parent evaluation and this can be used to do a random evaluation and run them in a way that you can securely verify it against another evaluation in a more another different kind of curve or some system that the zika roll-up prefers to use and then once you have verified the inputs you can run your regular CK uh validity proof using the the same form of inputs that the ZK roll-up is already built for and then produce the the output or verify the output reading and all you need to do at the very end of this is to just persist the the outcome now um we also have optimistic rollups and they work differently however they use the same pre-compile so the additions to the layer on evm then we want to verify blob data for optimistic run-ups or for secret rooms they are the same you can have this common utility to verify a single point of blob data except that we use the precompile slightly differently where like an optimistic roll up they have the notion of this pre-image Oracle and the previous Oracle is used to access any history in the layer bomb and which could include blob data and then depending if it's a regular hash or the special case D commitments the user hash function to verify the pre-image matches the the claimed hash or we use the printer Federation pre-compile to make to verify a piece of block data at a certain position matches the commitment to the set block data and this this extended premium is Oracle we can plug into the existing single step verifier and so it doesn't matter if you're like a an awesome proof system or a mips proof system or risk 5 proof system if you have this General ID about loading inputs through pre-mich verification you can plug in this new type of pre-image backed web Loop data so this is kind of what it looks like to integrate it into the verifier so we talked about the proof part of Layer Two we also have to modify the verifier and then the batchmitter is really just the reverse system of the verifier in the talk of coffin you you have seen that there's this input stream and there's output stream now this is the process that takes the input stream and converts it into the output stream in op stack it's called the layer 2 derivation pipeline and what it really does it traverses the layer 110 the chain of inputs it retrieves the data it processes the data it might use a layer 2 execution engine to process the data that's really only the retrieval that we have to adapt to this new type of data and then the batch emitter which does the reverse process then it takes a layer 2 block that has been sequenced it is going from layer 2 block it extracts the inputs and cuts the inputs in a bench and then the batch needs to be encoded in layer 1 transactions and this layer on transaction is published now the blob data rather than call data okay so we talked about how layer one works now layer 2 works if you really want to slot them together we need the layer 2 operator to pay for this resource of layer bump this new type of resource and what this requires is a new type of gas metering except that I wouldn't even call it metering at this point because the evm does all these complex computations whereas data is just static it's very easy to meter you could look at the amount of data we can translate it to the amount of data gas that's required to pay for the the data and now this data gas it works very similar to regular gas very similar to ep1559 where we burn the the funds the burner fees if there's an excess in usage and then in the block header of the execution layer one block we maintain a special variable that can track what kind of access there is in EP 1559 we know this as the base fee the base fee goes up if there's an access it goes down if there's not an excess you could express this in many different ways it doesn't have to be a like a a floating Point like variable that moves around it could just be more discreet and say you could say oh this there's there's this much gas that's being utilized over the expected amount and so what this looks like is that the more excess there is the higher the price goes and notes the the y-axis here it's a logarithmic y-axis and so exponentially the cost goes up if there's more excess usage and so it balances itself out if the access usage goes up prices go up and then either users are willing to continue to pay elevated prices to continue to use the target usage or they compensate and they start using less for a little while and then the prices go down again so the the base fee in the EPM 159 or the excess data I guess in ep5 firm help balance out the um the resource utilization of the chain and so we target half and we have a maximum capacity of twice the target similar to the EPM of ff9 except now with data gas rather than ethm gas this is how is how this is expressed in the EIP it's a little bit hard to parse because the formula is different but it does the same properties so at just at the same rate as ep1559 a rate of 1.125 and it's it goes up exponentially this way or it goes down exponentially this depends on the resource usage and the the limits is twice as much as the the targets and the only addition that we need to maintain this state is this one field field addition to the blockadder to track the success okay B things are going well so far we've talked about how Fort works both in layer 1 in Layer Two how the fee structure works but if you are interested in like diving deeper into this to really understand it you should look at the specifications this is an EAP that spans across multiple layers of ethereum so there are consensus specs and then there are exclusion specs the consensus specs they're scheduled for their hard work they're isolated by hard work whereas in the execution specs in our Erp system they are targeting just specific features of eips now there is a new exclusion specs process that describes the evm in Python expressing further further I think will take a little bit longer but the specs are complete the Erp describes the execution changes and the consensus specs have already constants layer big contain changes and then what would things be either where not other specs repositories so we talked about the like the state transition changes but the consensus and execution there are also apis that have to be extended so that are the execution apis to support a new transaction type there's the engine API to pass along the blocks or sorry the blobs between the engine and the bigger mode and then there's the beacon API which has been modified to fetch the blob data this is the API that layer 2 clients verifiers would now start to use to pull the Deep blobs from the beacon nuts into their their two notes and then they can cross verify it against the data hashes that have been registered in the transactions that they already pass as part of the the regular pull-up traversal process now implementing all these specs is not easy that we're getting there we have five different constant Slayer teams and five different exclusionary teams actually more than this even implementing the specifications and participating in testnets so we started with just prism and Gaff as prototype a year ago during Eve Denver and since then we have improved the syncing methods improved the transaction pool and we're still polishing various different things about the Erp but the specs are stable and so clients are moving forward and now we have all clients participating on the same test Nets we have this client interoperability and then it doesn't stop with just client modifications part of erp44 requires this new KCT commitment to really be forward compatible with the long-term sharding vision and this vision requires a trusted setup or the sketch D ceremony outputs and this thing has been running for like almost two months now I believe and also there are about only two days left so if you still want to participate there's still a chance um this thing is hosted online you can use various different clients to participants um showing you this this server graph because it's kind of insane that so far we've had over 70 000 contributions and then I was sharing about 44 just two weeks ago I think we were at fifty thousand this number is rapidly increasing and the more contributions we have the better because the the more we distributes this responsibility over like not refitting all the the inputs to the ceremony and just one of the inputs has to stay like private hidden it's like toxic advanced to secure the final output and then this final output is used to secure the blob data effectively and they're very fun clients there's not just the official clients they're also like meme clients so there's this front-end that this current teams I recommend just browsing around the kcd clients and to try and participate in film new guys and after this like two months of regular participationist offer there's also a special time allocated for teams and participants to do special contributions to mix in their randomness in a different ways to create more diversity to reduce the risk even further but yes like 70 000 participants it's kind of crazy this is like already 10 times if not 100 times more than that no ceremonies are getting okay let's talk about progress so this Erp has been around for almost a year and since like last year in Denver we have achieved a lot we've worked in prototypes we've worked on the Erp drafts then transformed into more specs then there were workshops more education definite started this is something where I really appreciate the help of coinbase contributors and like other early folks like Terence from Prism who like put a lot of time into these early prototypes to show that it works to show the viability to explore optimizations but now we're at the point where we're running devnets more regularly and because ceremony is almost coming to an end and in definite in sorry in Defcon the started definite or Sergio after Defcon we started devnet3 and then earlier this year at the interrupt event there was this definite that really pulled in all the clients where like you can see that it's viable to shipping hard Fork there's this interoperability problem with many AP changes where not all clients always implement the same thing the clients are agreeing on the same Pub data and with more testing more polishing we can ship this as part of a future layer bomb artwork So currently this is scheduled for the dev artwork which is the one after the withdrawals right now we have various different testnets behind us started with version zero the agaton then there were various different death notes and increasingly we have been extending this from prototypes to something that's like adopting all the spec changes and the latest features as discussed during this interrupt testing and the latest features really there are the transactions the web the transaction pool hardening and a decoupling of blobs and once these things are finished up then we're looking at the final stretch the final like Milestone towards like a production ready for it before and then hopefully you can go live with the next hard work after the withdrawals so definite 5 is coming up this updates the transaction file primarily this is a somewhat of a breaking chance um the update here is that we want to perfect the way the structure SSC transactions and get it right um if this doesn't work out we might refer to an ROP transaction but right now there are strong proposals for SC transactions to shape the way like we sign over transaction data in a more structured format which will be very good for Layer Two long term to prove any data about any transaction and then we have some Network optimization decoupling of blobs like what this really means is that the blobs and the beacon blocks are gossed separately and so the smaller the messages the more effective gossip sub is at propagating the data efficiently without duplication so this also saves to Smart bandwidth and then we have transaction pool hardening meaning that we don't want blobs to have a negative influence on the regular ECM transaction pool so we're trying to isolate the properties of these block transactions as much as possible I have a really strong implementation that can handle the data and so this likely will be like a pull on the mechanism where the avoids putting in large amount of data if we already have the data and then there's more testing there's always Merit testing if you want to contribute this is probably the best place to contribute we are building more test vectors there's work on hive interface other things to Benchmark first before to make sure it will run well only one so if this is still not enough for you look at the emp4844.com we have a question and answer section with photonic answering things about Ford prefer um refers different resources you could read more about 34 and then if you want it gets into contracts if you want to really contribute actively to the implementation to like analysis of the kcg ceremony or like other post-processing or perhaps you just want to visualize the blob data or maybe you want to contribute to the new blog Explorer that's visualizes blobs there are all these tooling efforts as well to not it's not exclusively client development um during Defcon there was a team building a a Blog Explorer like an experimental blog Explorer specifically for this data and during the Eve online hackathon I also hope that more teams can build cool and new interesting tools that utilize this new concept of blob data so yes any questions there's time left we can go through some things Lawrence let's skill ethereum together I'm looking forward to everything that's being built during the second one thank you amazing thanks for it out there's a lot of time left for questions but uh you were surprisingly on a 44 minute Mark so I'm gonna just verify this so again I have to reach out this video but this was actually very informative and I think this is the only resource now that exists on the full depth of what 4844 is so thank you so much and this has been awesome yes my pleasure thank you for hosting this absolutely take care all right with that we are ready for our next talk and for that I'd like to invite our next speaker hi chat iTunes going to be talking about how Ezekiel roll ups and ZK VMS work especially from the context of how scroll is designing it and you can already saw him talk about all the prizes they're giving you already talked about we already saw a lot of talks around how to think about these Technologies as roloffs become more and more common and uh we're going to go into a lot more depth here now so without further Ado I'd like to welcome him on stage and uh and get started so okay my chin it's great to have you here again yeah thank you cartek for the introduction and thank you for having me here to present to all of the people event we're more excited so I'll let you take it from here and uh all the best okay cool uh yeah hello everyone I'm haichen from scroll so today I'm going to give a introduction to the ZK Rob and then the ZK event and I'm going to dive uh or just introduce like how the DK events build and then what is ckm is going to prove so give like a little bit more insights of like how we are building the ckum uh from school okay so first of all like we all know ECM is great because it's decentralized and secure and it has a humongous of community and developers are building on top of that but ECM also has its own problem that it's not built to be scalable so to handle like thousands of transactions per second so this is because of the blockchain Dilemma now when blockchain cannot achieve scalability decentralization and security at the same time and we all know like the so decentralization means that a chain cannot can run without any Trust dependencies on a small group of centralized actors and these are typically interpreters to be like the not trusted by any set of nodes and security means like you can sustain the attack from a large proportion of the nodes uh running the uh inside inside the networks and a scalar basically just means that that's the pro uh the blockchain can process more transaction than a single node and we know that the ECM and other like the traditional blockchain from for Bitcoin they all prioritize the decentralization and security and then thus and such that it both suffer from the scalability issues so to take a deep uh closer look at why ethereum or like other blockchains is not scalable it's because like the uh we can show like this like a diagram of this how exam works so users and transactions to an Instagram node and then the transaction will then be broadcasted to a P2P networks The Proposal stand will submit a block then everyone in the network will download this block and re-execute all of transactions inside this block to reach consensus so that means like all of the phone notes need to do the same thing like same contribution computation for every blocks and because the ECM is widely decentralized so hundreds of thousands of nodes will repeatedly uh during the same competition for every block and that's why the same is not like beautiful scalable because uh it sacrifice some like the uh it's actually fight it has a lot of redundancies in computation just for being uh resistant and being censorship resistant and then also being decentralized so how does the Instagram community plan to solve the scalability problems so about two and a half years ago italic posts this blog post on the Forum so about the raw about this row of centric roll map So the plan is to scale the extremes through the Roll-Ups chains that can process more transaction on the layer 2 but having and then having the efficient settlement and finalization on the layer one uh to skill uh to achieve the scalability and without sacrificing lots of the Securities for that so now let's take a look at how the rock Works in general so here now you have two chains the first uh the layer one being the instrument it serves as the settlement layers for any transaction happen on the layer twos and the layer 2 is becomes a less a less decentralized blockchains so that it can process more transaction blocks at a faster pace and theoretically the layer 2 will batch all of transactions and Ascend sufficient data to the layer 1 uh with some sort of the proof to finalize all of the transactions that in dispatch happen on layer 2's so the requirement for a roll up to being a row up is that the users can recover the latest States a state route on the layer 2 purely relying on the data stored in the layer ones and then there are two types of the Roll-Ups uh right now so one is the Optimus drop and the other is the zika wrap so I'll give like first some of the intro like about what is the Optimus role so the Optimus drop is that it will just submit the transaction data to the layer 1 waiting for a period of time for the challenges so if no one challenged like the there there is any invalid connection within that batch for a certain period of time then that batch of generation will be considered finalized under layer one and it cannot be reverted anymore however the drawback of this Optimus Rob approach is that the waiting period time is sufficient is quite long so that people need to wait for seven days uh to until that connection can be considered is finalized on the layer ones that's why like the people will like tend to work on another type of Rob it's called the zika Rob and in the zika Rock uh every time like you will not only submit the data to the layer one but it will also accompany with a zika proof that can be easily and cheaply verified on the layer web and once this proof is verified by a small contract under extremes and then that batch of transactions can be then sync up finalized that's how like you achieve fast finality for the ZK rock with the zika rod so but like actually the for the it like simplify the diagram a little bit so for the ZK rocks so basically you need to under Layer Two you need to build a proverb they're going to generate a ziki proof and then accompany with some datas and then both were submitted to the layer one for settlement and finalizations um but the problem with the ziki wrap is that it is non-trivial to build a secret system for many reasons so first is that to generate a proof for some computations you need to write down your program logic in the form of arithmetic circuit and it's quite complicated and hard to uh to being like the using only the additions modifications and some of the mass assertions in the circuit to express your computation your program logics and also it requires certain overhead to handle like the uh to uh to generate this leaky proof uh for the zkrops and also like even worse that uh different programs and different applications may have a different circuit such that like you need to encode every application you need to write a new circuit to be able to using the zkrops and even worse that there will be no composability between the different application specific ZK rocks how to solve this problem of this no compatibility with different applications specific zq graph is that we need to build a general purpose zkrop that can run any type of applications and then one of the type is like you can uh it's where we are building is called DK evm what we do is try to put the ethernet virtual machines into a ZK circuit so that any application uh any dabs are written using the solidity like built on top of the uh ECM can be run directly on the in the uh on the on the layer twos and then using the zkevm to General to generate the CK proof for that any applications that Deploy on the layer choose so that's the benefit of the having the zkevm in the layer 2 in the CK drop is that you can achieve the composability and it being also very developed developer friendly because all the developers need to know is still the solidity and using the same tool chains Foundry hard hat anything like you're using uh on the layer ones you can also use it on the layer twos but there are also some drawbacks for building the ZK even and so one reason is it's very hard to build so the extreme virtual machines uh is not built for the ZK so it's not very ZK friendly so you need to be very careful in a lot of like the and it's very hard to do like putting the entire exam virtual machines into the SDK proof and then due to like this incompatibility of the basic field with the finite field using it in the zero Notch proof and also there's a lot of special op codes like catch hack uh some bitwise operations uh and also the uh the signature verifications the ecdsa signature verification they are all quite special functions like and they need to spend a lot of effort to building the ZK ZK circuit and also to generate the proof for the Z key event it's quite large uh proving overhead for that so that's why like initially people are more tends to building this application specific uh zika wrap instead of being in the zke game so why is the ziki even possible now so there are many three reasons first we are now having better zero knowledge proof systems we have like a lot of New Primitives such as the polynomial commitments the custom Gates lookup arguments and the recursive proofs all those like recent advancements in Brazil Notch uh proof protocols that makes the uh building the ZK event more practically uh available like a viable in a second we have more Hardware acceleration available wherever right now like the mode and more like the state of art GPU approval items and then we also uh were expecting the fpga or A6 some accelerators they can accelerator Solutions in the future that can further bring down the cost of generating SDK proof and assert is that we have a lot of new open source tool toolings and Frameworks available and also like not to mention like the the screw is built in the ctvm in the open uh Source communities with exam uh Foundation like the PSE team Foundation foundation and other open source communities so there's lots of tools and resources available in the open source so that making the ZK and building like the uh of viable and a practical so now let's dive in deep into a little bit like our past Decay even so there's like a few different sticky event flavors uh which the people they all call the ziki even so first is language level compatibility uh with the ecms so that means like you can compile some evm friendly language like solidity or euro into a snot friendly VM which differs from the EVMS and the second is spico level which we directly interpret the event by code directly inside your ZK circuit so that you don't need to use a different compiler's uh you can reuse all of the same tool chains to directly use that and then you can run on the DK UVM and then the last one would be the consensus level which you target for the full equivalence as the EC uh with the evm using on the layer ones that means the these levels equivalent can directly prove any layer 1 blocks and here like the what we are building in the scroll is that we're trying to Target for a biker level compatible or equivalent ZTE evm such that like the developers can using all of the existing tools to building on top of the scroll okay now uh next we're going to talk more about the ZK ebm and first let's focus on what the ziki even trying to uh prove so let's simplify the uh the same like or the evm how it works so first of all at one time step like T you have like a state route trees that including all of the state account uh informations and also the any storage uh any story trees stored in the smart contracts and at that time uh you'll receive a new transaction in trying to do any like the uh transfers or executing some smart contracts so you'll input these two as the input to the ethernet virtual machines that are going to execute and output the result will be a new word state with a different route after you apply the transactions and then look inside what happens inside the user virtual machines you'll basically like a few different modules first you have a state machine that's going to interpret all of the bytecodes inside your inside any smart contracts and you have stack and memory for any transient uh data keeping the memory and also your access to two database one is the the bytecode database I go to load the smart contract from that and execute them in a second you have a storage database that can keep any uh State account information as well as like the any storage like the stored in the smart contract so let's like uh take one more further step into looking at what happens like when you're executing the smart contract so after you give like these two inputs that were state and then the transaction to the Eastern virtual machines and then what happens that you are going to execute Optical by op code uh written inside this smart contract and it will end up with a execution Trace with different steps like we're doing a push and then some push and some M store and load and then you do like the low summer core data up on the transactions and then execute like any special logic from the uh from the smart contract that will be finally end up like you're modifying some datas in the storage and in the state or country that would be generated a new state or state so now what we can even try to do like the ad like the additional steps inside this like the whole pipeline of the executions is that the ziki evm is taking the specification of the of the Eastern virtual machines and then it was taking uh take also the same input data from the uh how the design virtual machine does is take a word State snapshot and I take in any new transactions as the input data and what they're going to prove is that they're going to prove this execution Trace generated from the same virtual machines is correct and it will also prove that the state routes were translated from the old state route to the new state route so to summarize a little bit like what does ism is trying to prove it's like you first need to approve the execution Trace generated from by running the incident virtual machine is correct and unique and the second that you need to prove the Globes Global State stay good to translate from the old route to the new root okay so this is like some high level like the things about how what ckvm is going to improve and then let's dive a little deep into the how we build the zkum in the circuit so remind that uh I just explained that the ziki event is trying to prove that uh the trend execution Trace is correct uh with like after applying certain transactions and then executing some a smart contract so that would be the logic is quite similar to what happens inside the circuit where the core circuit in the ZK event that we are building is a called evm circuit but event circuit is basically a state of machines mimic the uh the same machine inside the Eastern virtual machines so you are also mapping all of the steps inside your executing Trace into your circuit which is looks like just uh in the in just like the blue table that we're just looking like a two-dimensional Matrix and then each step will mapped to uh a slots inside the circuit as well so like one-to-one mappings to the steps and then one step will be corresponding to any of course you are executing inside the execution Trace so the each step inside the circuit we're having slightly different height due to the complexity of different op codes for example the multiplayer the multiply op code from the event maybe like it's more complicated than an ad op code so it may be taking more roles and more resources in the circuit to prove the correctness of that old code and then if you uh take a closer look at each step slot inside the circuit you will be separated into different sections or different sections so you'll be having the step contact keeping some contacts uh of like the the stack pointers the program counters the informations in a second will be a case which are going to switch on different op code specific uh constraints for example there will be like the one case for each op code uh corresponding to like the two up codes you have inside these in Virtual machines but that's it's basically a switch statements like you you written inside any languages and then the server section will be any opcode specific weakness that's going to help you to prove the correctness of any op code yeah it's like just explain like for the step context you're keeping certain informations that for this current step is for example which code hash are you executing like it decides like which uh contract you are executing and then some guests like you left it in the transactions the program counter that pointer and the current state route exactly like there will be more informations and for the k switch it will be uh basically a bunch of selectors corresponding to each of codes in the in the Eastern virtual machines and also different error cases that's also important that you need to handle uh you need to prove and handle all all possible errors that will happen inside when executing the transactions and also we need to make sure that exactly only one uh case is is switched on each step and the last one will be some Optical specific weaknesses will be like some of the uh input data for example like the the word like the you're going uh you're going to add together and the results you can do and then there will be also some additional witness that going to help you to prove the correctness of each other so let's take an add up code as an example to see what happens inside the uh in the in the c key event constraints so first of all you need to constrain the step context is transitioned correctly from the previous steps so for example in the current step if I'm executing an adult code so the program counters the next step program counter will be increased by one from the current step and then the step pointer will shrink by one because to add up code Pops to uh two word from the stack and then push one back to the stack and then the gas left will be like reduced by three because the add up code will consume three gas in a UVM and second it will be a hard case switch that means like only one of the case like one of the uh the case will be selected we just add here so it means like this so first you need to prove uh each uh op code will be a case the selector will be zero or one and then finally when you can stream like all of them sum equal to one and then last will be some of course specific weakness here uh is that example we because of this uh field incompatibility between the circuit and then the evm the event world has 256 bits but inside the inside the circuit you can represent a value up to 253 bits so that's why you need to break down uh you need to break down the uh those words into two parts like with the high 122 uh 122 8 bit and then low 123 bit values and then so you need to do like additions from for only say like the for the low uh 122 8 Bits the a low plus below will be equal to zero plus some of the carry on like into the into the next high 180 bit and then do the same lessons for the high 1228 A2 or 122 8-bit uh additions here and then further what you need to do is you need to prove that uh the uh the word a b are correctly popped from the stack and in the uh the output C is correctly pushed back to the stack so what you're going to do is you introduce an additional lookup table that help you as an auxiliary data structure to help you to prove any stack or memory operations here so here what you're going to do for proving the stack pop is that you just do a lookup thinking like that okay so I'm pop up like the stack at a certain uh stack pointers which is a read and then that's only going to like the value you're going to pop up from the stack and then after you do the calculation of the word c here inside the circuit you are going to push back uh push the stack back and right back to the correct address inside the lookout tables and because these local tables is also constrained uh it's also constructed after the executions so that you need to have additional circuit to constrain that the lookup table is constrained correctly so this is like some of the uh just high level explanation of the uh building the ZK event circuit uh there'll be like a lot more details but if you're interested you can definitely look at the open source repo to uh to dive more deep into how the code is constrained there but just give you a high level of the architecture of the CK event so the ZK even although we call like a circuit but actually a construct with a lot of sub circuits together uh to function together constrained together such that it can be built to constrain all of the executions happen in the Eastern virtual machine so in the beginning for the zqm you have the the core part is the evm circuit a serve as a state machine to uh constrain each uh op code that can happen like inside the Eastern virtual machines but for some of the seeking unfriended unfriendly up course like the end or xor those uh bitwise operations the expansion uh of code and then the cash check uh computations will be uh relying on like offload those kind of competition into the lookup tables and that will be further constrained by other circuit to help you to constrain the whole uh these up codes and a second for any stack memory and storage operations we'll be relying on a ram lookup table as I just showed before so those like the Ram uh lookup table that can is served as a database that consists of all of the records of stack and memory and storage operations so inside the evm circuit you don't need to reason about like the crackheads of those operations but you just find a match inside the inside the lookup table the database of all the records now once you have a match inside those Ram lookup tables you will consider the stack and push and purpose correctly the memory read and write is correct inside the um circuit and then you have some additional lookup tables to help you to load correct by code from the from the smart contract and you can load certain informations from the from the transaction core data and it's unblock metadata From the Block lookup tables so all these local tables will be then further constrained by some other circuits to help you to prove that those lookup tables is correctly constructed inside the circuit and then to in order to serve this to constrain help you to write those all of the lookup table circuit you will also introduce some additional uh Lookout tables and additional circuits the final there will be some local Precision tree circuit will be constraining any reader write to the storage and state trees and then also there will be some transaction signature circuit you see DSA circuit help you to verify the transaction signature is correct and then there will be some RP encoding for the transaction here uh there will be some RP lookup table and RP circuit and then finally you will introduce a public input circuit that's going to connect the public input data that you uploaded with the Rob and then constrain like the certain data is crackly calculated uh in the in the whole clicky even circuit okay so lastly be like about school is that we are building the ZK event with the community like with a lot of community members not only like scroll is doing that and and we also like the having this design and all of the code has been peer revealed by the communities right like community members from like us and from the QC team of the ICN foundations and also like other many more uh people like who are interested in the zikivium and then contributing to the equilibrium repos and if you're also interested you can also take a look at the repo and it will welcome you to contribute to the to the same report together and then lastly about like our principles like the four while we are building the ZK event to scale the exams we still like to follow our principles when building things first we aim to build an evm equivalency can drop so that I can achieve the Best in Class user and developer experience and second we still like to keep a Security First mindset when building the layer choose so where like we first have the ZK even and ZK raw protocols that can explicitly prove the correctness of any executions and transactions on the layer 2 and we also activate uh having this external and internal auditings on our code base and also being building with the community building like in the open so that like all of the code can be also peer reviewed by others not only like us building like in-house code and third we also believe in the decentralization matters in the later context so which we think like this will be the key property of the blockchain to be censorship resistant and then to be also social resistance so that we are committed to decentralized across all different layers including we're having a proverb decentralized approver Network and a decentralized sequence or validator Network and then last like I'll just uh just just talk about like that we also have like a hackathon bounty program in this event uh and then we will have three different tracks first we'll ask you to deploy your smart contract on top of the scroll test net uh that's a public test net on the goodie and then the default deployment process will be just very similar to what you do on the top of the exams you only need to change RPC endpoint and the second is that we love to do Notch uh so show us your best application building new use cases that leverages the power of zero knowledge proofs and the third track is that we want to see the developers and the apps taking advantage of the cheap gas fees and a faster block time on the layer twos and you can benefit from the layer 2 scaling property and a faster finality with the qrops and I hope you enjoy like the hacking on topless gold test net and for more information you can also check out this website okay uh that's all about like my talk and thank you everyone for listening to the talk I can I can take any questions from the audience actually that was uh that was awesome it was such a good overview on how everything is set up my we don't have enough time for questions because we're gonna make sure we can get to the next talk there's a time question on the other end but I'd love to kind of maybe just ask you one little thing as we get the next speaker setup which is if you have a wish list of what you would like people to build on on scroll or just on SDK VM is there something that you've been really wanting to see that you haven't seen yet or you think there's something that other people should try what's uh what's on your wish list uh yeah that's a good question so I think that which is like we we're seeing like that I think like that even is building like for general purpose so any type of applications any like Innovative like the applications can be also like built on top of that of the scroll uh CK even layer 2's but like I've seen like some interesting thing would be uh you can think of like any zika applications that'd be interesting uh like privacy or like any private votings or anything like this um like social application like it's identities like those applications I think we'll be innovate like the more easily underscore so that's an interesting point so maybe maybe I also misunderstood how would private voting work here is it just the fact that you don't get to see the weights or like where's the Privacy coming from in this example uh yeah so like to just clarify like that actually does he keep wrap usually doesn't provide privacy by default so it's like it's more for the skating uh and the compression of the transaction happen but for like the any private applications you're probably like having the private issue the pool so that anyone can hide the identity of like the voters that you don't need to review your vote but you can still verify that someone uh in the in the pool in the dial like a uh voted like that and then only you can only vote once so existing checks on like making sure that nobody's abusing it and yes having that information be private yeah that's awesome yeah well thank you so much and uh with that we are ready for our next talk so go hack on scroll and uh we'll see what people build thank you thank you up next I want to introduce our last speaker for today which is John Cole from hyperlink and uh John's going to talk about now with all the Roll-Ups that we have whether it's ZK or optimistic or anything else around modularity how do we make sure they all work nicely with each other and that's where multi-chain world comes in we're understanding what's possible what's not possible how do you think about making what should be possible uh is going to be important so for this last talk for this Summit I'd like to welcome John here with us and uh have him get started hey John you are muted there we go terrible start terrible start for the day thanks for having me I'm gonna start by sharing my screen here and we'll get right into it wonderful and we'll get that loaded up as soon as we see on all right all right so let's go here okay so what are we going to talk about today right Karthik just told you that we have a multi-chain future ahead of us and we're gonna need to figure out how to deal with it it means really a lot of things right so this talk to dates titled connecting our multi-chain future so in this talk we're going to cover the current state of blockchains the need that stems from that current state as it pertains to interoperability then we're going to touch about how all of that relates to the scalability of blockchains which of course in particular means the modular blockchain thesis and then we're going to finish the call with this little thing that we're doing here that we call The Interchange Highway and so that's why you see that little subtitle of the interchain highway so this is uh if you're curious you want to know what it is well this is what stable diffusion thinks it is uh and I kind of like this little impressionist style that I gave it but let's get right into it so the current state of blockchains as I like to say with my dad joke style the State of the State of State so we have these amazing internet computers and they're creating loads of valuable state but they are isolated they can't connect everyone here knows this right everyone who is really sad throughout the day and and is going to participate in the scaling hack like this is really not news to you realize that the valuable state that exists and is created on one chain by and large is not easily accessed by another even if we're talking about a roll-up and certainly if we're talking about a roll-up on a roll-up as we will get into later today there's been this uh expansion now into a multi-chain environment which is that most often it's meant deploying your app on multiple chains and effectively this has resulted in creating multiple instances of your app on those chains right definitionally if State can't be easily accessed between chains as a developer building on a single chain you really can only access and serve users that exist on those chains and that pertains obviously to every bit of State that exists there this is really sad because what does it mean it means that if you now want to expand to another environment right you were um very pot let's say you launch as an app on arbitrum and you're like whoa I want to expand to optimism as well for whatever reason maybe those are distinct audiences well your next deployment does not benefit from your existing one so now we're expanding uh actually creates another form of fragmentation between these blockchain environments it's uh yeah as I said it's it's quite sad Now worse yet we're transitioning into a world where there's not only going to be more chains and deploying your own chain is going to be easier and bear with me today I I know this might not be acceptable nomenclature but I'm going to use the team the term chain as a blanket term to include what would be an alternative layer one what would be more familiar as a roll-up whether it takes the form of an optimistic roll-up and a ZK roll-up and certainly when we need to have those distinctions we're going to get into them specifically and thirdly I'm going to again treat something like a Cosmos app chain simply as a change so when I say chain don't get hung up on the notion that it's just a layer one it is a blanket term for any one of those three so again we're moving towards this world becoming ever more popular through the realization of the modular blockchain thesis that not only is deploying your own chain more common it is also made easier because there are many more of these toolkits but what then right you deploy your own chain your own environment and effectively you've created you've sprouted out a new planet in a solar system a new island in the ocean if it's a Roll-Up for say uh and it's an ethereum based roller you have one main line into the main economic Hub right into the into the main continent to call it like uh into the main planet in that star system but that's all you get what about the other planets in that star system the other Roll-Ups what about the other Islands on any island chain how do you connect to them are there any what are the trade routes that you can access right uh and so this that is uh where we start getting into some problems lastly as we analyze kind of the current state we have to talk about just how many infrastructure interactions we have as users in crypto in fact the new user almost always has their first interaction with an infrastructure before they ever reach an application you know this is something that whenever you take a step back you realize this is this is certainly not the way recently a good friend was talking about their experience onboarding a close friend who had never been into crypto but was interested in collecting a poapp that poapp was on gnosis they tell their friend to download the wallet of their choice the friend downloads rainbow finding it to be a very acceptable and easy to use um Mobile Wallet then they realize oh gnosis is not supported by so now my friend has to onboard their friend to metamask on a desktop they have to move the eth that was purchased in the first wallet they didn't want to expose the private keys so he tries to onboard them to that and now they're already 30 minutes into it this person being on board it still has not reached this final application collecting that Co-op that they wanted to they realize they have to enter the RPC for gnosis and very cumbersome they they can't find the RPC address so they go into the noses docs and they get their long story short they spend about 90 minutes for him to he has to explain to his friend and that is only after all of that work dealing with so many parts of infrastructure did the new onboarding into crypto get actually exposed to uh to the app no one here probably thinks that that's acceptable right there's no way that uh that we can work with that so if this isn't the end state right like what is right you know uh how do we get there well how do we get to this point where like we're serving people a lot better we know that whenever uh we do get this demand we have really big scaling woes and obviously this event uh that we're all embarking on and scaling ethereum is deeply related to that we're going to try and find ways to do this more um more acceptably and so these internet computers of ours if there's one thing we know about like we know how they work right we know that they work by making digital resources more scarce than they are otherwise and so we know that whenever demand increases unless the supply of these resources changes we're going to have a rough situation uh we're gonna run into this situation then I'm sure everyone on the uh on the line today has run into it you just realize just how high uh that gas cost is and how do we solve that so we're going to talk about this today and to solve this we're going to talk about the combination of interoperability um modular blockchains and a few other things that will come up so what does inacceptable like multi-chain future look like well it has to be more uh it has to be more acceptable than we need to find a solution to that demand problem we don't want the gas to be too damn high all the time right should we ever talk about a future where demand doesn't increase no we shouldn't talk about it because everyone here is very passionate about the industry and a future where demand doesn't increase is just not that interesting because it means we can all go home we did not fulfill our goals of crypto being a solution to Global problems so hard step we're not even going to talk about it the only way to cater this demand is by creating more more supply for it and that Supply can take many forms uh there might there will be a spectrum of chains you know on one end of the spectrum I don't think certainly I don't and I'm sure most people here don't feel this way but one end of that Spectrum can look like very heterogeneous environments in very monolithic chains they might take the form of move chains like sui and Aptos and certainly the VM will be a part of it and maybe the Solana the c-level VM will be a part of it and on the other edge of the spectrum we have a completely homogeneous environment it's all evm based and then we just have many many many Roll-Ups stemming from this uh the singular Hub that Hub can be the cosmos uh the cosmos Hub with the SDK and IVC it could be ethereum with many ethereum based Roll-Ups personally I'm inclined to think that we'll end up somewhere closer to the hub version but not completely homogeneous so this is really what we talk about when it comes to the modular blockchain thesis a very large amount of Roll-Ups and app chains and whatever you want to Define them stemming from from these hubs beyond that what does an acceptable future look like all of we're going to have all these chains where they're going to have to be connected applications are going to have to be connected how do we prevent an experience like the one in that not so great story I just shared about a person trying to redeem trying to onboard into crypto for the first time to redeem a damn Co-op uh apps are going to have to be connected but if apps are connected it's going to mean that chains are going to have to be connected how can we get there and before we get that let's talk a little bit about the errors in current history of interoperability so before we got to where we are today which is we have some form of acceptable interoperability majority of it is very user-centric it's still users bridging assets it's still users dealing with infrastructure we had the first instantiation that was what we call here defined rule set interoperability one thing to note you see a timeline here the timeline is a bit misleading notice there are no end dates for any of these this is because all of these errors are playing out simultaneously so maybe the better title for this is not errors of interoperability rather modes of interoperability because these are all distinct in their form of operation but again all of them playing out at the same time and it's not clear that these will remain independent and not coagulate in some form or merge in some form as we move into the future so early on around 2015 2016 we have this notion of defined rule set interoperability this is most commonly observed in uh in Cosmos in IBC in polka dot and xcmp really what it is it's interoperably within a set structure and it's the same notion of horizontal um horizontal scaling where instead of saying like hey I'm going to have one computer that can process everything I'm going to have many little computers and they can have some logic about how they can share things between them and they will handle all the press the processing so the dominant form of expression here are certainly uh what you know app chains is the right way to Some people prefer the zap chains I like referring to them as app chains that's the cosmos parlance and the polka dot World known as pair chains some distinct differences between polka dot and Cosmos and IBC there but this is the common way that these are expressed in each as we talk about each one of these modes will probably spend some time thinking about talking about how exactly it's working today and so today there are dozens of Cosmos chains IBC transaction volume is quite high now not every chain has a very active IBC channel to communicate amongst the other the other chains that it can communicate with right like if you look at the network graph of IBC connect the chains there's there's a lot of concentration there but there's still certainly a lot of activity similarly there are many um many more polka dot uh pair chains today more than you'd expected would have existed certainly eight years ago and this category of defined rule said on top really while limiting while you are limited to interoperability only within that set structure and no strong form of communication with chains that don't fit that structure it's certainly an acceptable mode of doing things and one that's going to continue to see more activity as time progressed there was more active participation in crypto more types of users and we went into what uh I like to call acid asset Centric interoperability this was interability that focused on giving users the ability to move assets between between different blockchains where the structure of the underlying chain was far less important in fact it really is not it's only important for the operator of that interoperability service for the user's perspective it is entirely unimportant bridges are the most common expression of this right if you in some of these Bridges take the form of the canonical or native bridges that we see for Roll-Ups but certainly Bridges like Wormhole like synapse these are the dominant form of expression for this mode of interoperability and truly there's been billions that have been transacted via Bridges again in the form of asset Centric interoperability there's also been some issues I want to say that as of today more at least five of the 10 largest security incidents in the history of of the industry all relate to the category of interoperability now is it because this category is inherently unsafe or because this mode of acid-centric interoperability is inherently unsafe that's debatable I'm certainly biased but I would argue that that's not the case and it's just that software with super high stakes in in adversarial environment as uh the permissionless internet computers that we work with it is it is very dangerous and so incidents are going to happen and finally there is this last mode of interoperability it's very very new there's not that much to say about it that isn't speculative and that is app Centric interoperability now if there's one thing that's very common between the two modes we observed in the beginning at least in their operation until this point in time is where does the burden of interoperability lie there is an operator that provides the service but who performs the action in both of these it's the user it's the user having to move around an asset and you know if you wanna think about this in non-crypto terms having to move your funds from ethereum to optimism having to move your funds from ethereum to osmosis when you want to transact there that has a little bit of the feel of you know I really want to purchase something on Amazon today so how about I load my balance and I transfer it from my bank account say with Bank of America and I load up some bucks into Amazon I get some Bezos bucks um as my balance and that is quite strange right you probably wouldn't want to do that there are not that many instances where uh common internet products that we use ask us to behave in that way but this is where we are in crypto so the key difference between these two modes in apps app Centric and droppability is this notion of separating or moving the place of the burden of interoperability primarily it's about moving it from the user's hands to the application so that now we we bake in a layer of abstraction such that apps that are built in this way are now handling that transfer on your behalf similarly to like we don't know the logic of the credit card or like the payment Network when we get charged on an e-commerce site like Amazon but it moves the funds on our behalf and that seems fine it certainly contributes to a simpler um to a simpler user experience the dominant form of expression here is interchain application but what really is an interchange application simply put it's an application that should be through some means connected by some interoperability tool something that can communicate easily between the different internet computers or computers that it exists on we believe that that'll be the dominant form of expression but it's still really early it's still not clear that this will be the case what does it even mean to be connected by some interoperability platform like what does that mean for us like from a blockchain perspective so for that now we're going to step in to talk a little bit about flavors of interoperability and by and large they come in two main ones you either get native verification or you get external verification what does native means native means you are leveraging the consensus mechanism of the two or more chains that are connecting and most importantly it means there are no Mark trust assumptions introduced into your action Beyond this idea of I'm already trusting you know ethereum which I'm used to dealing with and let's say in our example now you want to go to osmosis I'm trusting osmosis and I that's all I'm okay with and so really native verification is the ideal method because it only inherits the security risks of the two chains that are connected now why why refer to it as the ideal that kind of makes it sounds like it's not easily achievable well sure should it's not sorry for my language it is not uh easily attainable unfortunately it is by far the most expensive and most I mean really most resource costly method of verification in fact in systems that were not designed from the ground up to be able to replicate the consensus of external chains within them uh it yeah it is just incredibly expensive and for this reason it works the best and perhaps without external tools really the only place where it works well are within these defined rule set systems so insofar as IBC is concerned IBC gives you a form of native verification now should you be super discouraged not yet uh there are things that will help us reduce the costs of native verification that will allow native verification to be more feasible for environments that weren't built for Native verification interoperability most promising along this front is uh certainly zero knowledge proofs as a way to replicate the consensus of the chain that you are connecting with the chain that you are or sorry to replicate the consensus of the two chains amongst each other in such a way that now having a interchange State transition is much more easily done without having to introduce a new trust assumption but unfortunately uh it's gonna take some time right there are great advancements you've seen stuff with uh with the ZK bridge that recent paper and there are great advancements in the field of Hardware acceleration for provers and so I'm quite optimistic that within the next few years we'll start seeing the ink Links of zero knowledge proofs and increasing the prevalence of native verification interoperability something that is especially useful for the modular blockchain thesis and the future of ethereum scalability the other mode is external verification well you know easy words to say right if if the previous mode did not introduce any new trust assumptions and this is the mode up you know aside from it or opposite from it well you guessed it it does introduce a new trust assumption so external verification means that in between the two chains that you're connecting now you bring in a third party and you rely on that third party if you spend a lot of time uh looking at or trying to solve the Oracle problem or just dealing with the Oracle problem you are intimately familiar with this in fact I don't feel incorrect in saying that external verification interoperability really is just another manifestation of the Oracle problem and solutions to it often take the form of either fully fledged Oracle Solutions or narrowly scoped or narrowly defined Oracle systems external verification takes many forms as many different configurations the easiest and most common looks like a multi-sig if you were unlucky enough to be involved in the Ronin Bridge incident you might be more intimately familiar with this configuration but many times it just takes on a multi-sick meaning that whatever state we're replicating between the chains the ultimate Arbiter of that is decided by a key it used we used to have actually interoperably systems that did not even use a multi-second or a single key thankfully we've Advanced far past that and that is no longer the case but that is a very very popular mode simply because it simplifies uh the operation but it obviously introduces predictable and obvious attack vectors another configuration is proof of stake where you can kind of enhance that multisig with some type of economic risk meaning where these third parties that are being introduced as external verifiers now have economic risk now they have a real reason to not lie about what they're doing but importantly unlike the proof of mistake that you're familiar with from ethereum We're ultimately a validator cannot change your balance a validator can lie about a certain State transition but they they cannot take away your balance in Oracle systems you are totally beholden to what the external verifier says is the state of the world if the external verifier says that the sky is red the sky is red for all you know on that destination and this is why proof of stake systems when it comes to interoperability they are completely different they are in many ways ways they are similar but when it where it's most important when it comes to the key risks to the system they are quite different than what you're used to when it comes to proof of stake simply for blockchain consensus and another configuration uh one that I'd like to Hope is growing in popularity is the optimistic instruction again different from optimistic Roll-Ups but similar enough to where you can use it as a mental model you bake some amount of time a certain challenge window between when some State transition is initiated on chain a and that being replicated on chain B and within that time Watchers can observe the transition if they find anything malicious they can submit a fraud proof and prevent it and last there are configurations that will involve different forms of advanced cryptography these can involve threshold signatures multi-party compute and we unfortunately won't have enough time to get into those and there's who knows what other configurations can hold but I can tell you that there's going to be more of them so we've done a half decent job of covering the history of interoperability but now I told you we're going to talk a little bit about the modular blockchain thesis and how it relates to scaling uh crypto so look we all know with the magical products of these is we're going to have thousands of Roll-Ups and they're gonna fix scalability right and they have to obviously but what does it really mean what does it really mean for us to have all the state on ethereum and now we want to access it and we have all this demand and so we need to be able to access uh we need to be accessed block space in a more refined more targeted uh perhaps even less generalized mode such that we're not paying you know we're not paying 500 degree on 200 000 gas transactions on the regular as was not uncommon during periods of high demand as we saw in 2021 so what's it going to mean in practice right we're going to have all all these hubs all right we're gonna have talked a bit about this a little bit earlier we're going to have ethereum as a main roll-up Hub and we're already seeing this materialized earlier in the day you heard uh Kelvin from optimism talk about Roll-Ups and optimism has done amazing work with the op stack coinbase already took it upon themselves to extend the op stack and launch their first you know really launch the first widespread roll-up built with the op stack this is just the first example of this but really do think we're gonna see dozens of these if not hundreds Celestia with its work on data availability Celestia roll-ups will become far and wide there are several dozen Celestia Roll-Ups being built and those will seek data available either from Celestia you know maybe from eigenlayer Lord knows somewhere points remains we're gonna have lots of roll-ups whether it's all the app chains that already exists in the cosmos World these are not exactly Royal since they uh don't separate uh execution as you know as much as your standard roll-up does but for our purposes certainly okay to think about them the key point to take away from work so we're going to have these hubs in the lowest level hubs will look like ethereum Celestia um you know Cosmos a slightly higher level Hub can look something like optimism in the op stack it can look something like bass it can look like perhaps Eclipse which is creating a toolkit to make Celestia Roll-Ups more widespread all of these hubs from them are going to emanate so many roll-ups but how do those Roll-Ups talk to each other how do they call cross between hubs right we talked about the future that is acceptable to us a scalable future needs to be a many roll-up future but how is that square away with the experience how are we going to avoid having so many infrastructure interactions whenever we want to move between these Roll-Ups and communicate between them and that's where interoperably comes in once again the modular blockchain thesis needs permissionless interoperability if everyone who wants to is going to be able to spin up a roll-up on-demand if apps are going to be expressed as individual Roll-Ups if they're going to be generalized Roll-Ups becoming a hotbed for a more accessible and cheaper computation how do we communicate between them are we really going to wait the seven day challenge period going back in between them obviously not no one seems to think that but the thing that gets not enough attention is interrollup interoperability and across intermably across roll-up hubs and to that end interoperably must be permissionless but it never is so I promised you will tell you a little bit about hyperlane so hyperlane is the first permissionless interoperability layer unlike other Solutions in the blockchain space it's not another blockchain to solve blockchain problems it's a network of networks a network between blockchains in that interchange Highway that we talked about before it's the path between them so it's our effort to create the safest fastest and most accessible way to Traverse the empty space between blockchains and most importantly as that space gets filled with new smaller chains that look like Roll-Ups look like app chains look like app specific Roll-Ups even anyone has the ability to deploy hyperlane on those and communicate with any other network that already has hyperlane on it so we're running out of time but high level how does it work hyperlane is deployed on any environment any environments that want to be communicated between them so if you if you use the op stack to create your roll up you Deploy hyperlane on it as soon as you're done creating the Roll-Up it now you put a mailbox on it that's what it means to deploy hyperlane then you or anyone can run a relay or the relayer once again totally permissionless role and contracts send messages to the mailbox this contract that does exactly what it sounds like in relayers sit in between different chains in different mailboxes observing the mailboxes and then they submit uh the Merkle tree that can sorry the Merkel root that contains your message and delivers it to its destination this is what we believe the best way to offer permissionless interoperability and truly the only way that interoperability can scale to a world of modular blockchains which we know is the best way to scale ethereum so it took a bit too long ran out of time but uh that in general is uh is our high level talk about this today if you'd like to learn more you can find me on Twitter at pale Nimbus um or you can reach out to hyperlane.xyz you can find us on our Discord we'd be happy to talk to you all about it and we will be sponsoring the scaling ethereum hackathon as we do with pretty much every Global event we are large supporters and big fans of each level uh so we'll be here for you amazing thanks John uh this was super informative I feel like we got to do a park two here to actually dig into how hyperlink specifically can help here with all these things and uh this has been this has been amazing and a pretty awesome start to the summit so we get to uh really see more people can do with optimistic we'll love ckvms and cross chain applications thank you so much well we'll make it happen even if you don't want to you'll do a part two this is this is good stuff we need to have this information be out there and available for everybody to uh to ask well thank you so much and let's wrap up today's Summit so those were our amazing talks talking about how optimistic Roll-Ups work why you should be excited about 40 or 44. how coinbase's base op chain will change and bring in millions more people into the space and what is the best way to think about
