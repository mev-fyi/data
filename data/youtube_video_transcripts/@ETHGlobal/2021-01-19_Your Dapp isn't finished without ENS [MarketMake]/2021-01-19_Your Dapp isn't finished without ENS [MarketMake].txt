anything in the chat or try to find a way to sneakily interrupt you okay great awesome so andrew yep all good to go yep awesome great so thank you everyone one second let me let me open the uh the waiting room a few more people sorry okay great all good yep awesome thank you so much everyone for joining we have brantley milligan from enf ethereum name service who's going to tell us why your gap is not finished without enf it is not thanks take it away bradley great okay thank you yes so uh your name service is our project and um uh so my name is brantley milligan i actually work for an organization called true names limited which is a singaporean nonprofit and it is sort of the de facto manager of the open source project ethereum name service uh we of course have contributors from outside of that you know true name is limited uh we're just sort of like the de facto managers of it um that's our github link you can see it all our code's open source that's our website our lead developer and the creator of ens is nick johnson trying to go to my next slide okay so uh just three sections of my presentation here what is ens how ens works and then how to integrate ens and then hopefully we'll have a time for questions um after that okay so ens of course stands for the ethereum name service i'm gonna talk about what what what this means so first i'm gonna talk about how is it a name service um because a lot of people the funny thing about a lot of people misunderstand this the funny thing about naming services is that let's say with the domain name system of the internet it's kind of lower on the tech stack uh it just works you know you almost never have problems with it and so most people including like most tech people don't really know how dns works um even really conceptually and they don't necessarily really understand even like socially it's dynamics and things like this how it works um just because it's like like i said lowering the tech stack it just works your people are focused on on other stuff sort of like how most people really are now experts on tcpip right um so let me just say a few words about just kind of naming services or systems um so ens like any naming system is just a lookup system that's it a lot of people try to over complicate and make it they think it's doing a lot more than it's really doing literally you just you provide a name to it and it provides you information very simple so your computer then might do something with that information but that is separate from the name system so for example with like the world wide web with dns i type in google.com okay i am not actually like going to google.com what my computer is doing uh in the background is it connects to dns and it asks dns hey what's the ip address of of this uh in the records of google.com it tells you tells your computer and your computer goes to the ip address and that's the ip address of this of the google servers um the the naming system is just like a ui thing but that's all it does so like dns is not like what connects you to google it just tells you where to connect to google so why do we have naming services in the first place because identifiers that work well for computers don't work well for humans and vice versa so for software uh you know identifiers they can be automatically generated they can be numbers and letters you know even if you have you know a string of 100 letters and numbers a program can instantly see that that's different than one that's exactly the same but one one letter difference humans can't humans use language but language is like socially contingent it requires context meaning changes all these things like this and it's kind of trickier you know what words should be using to identify what that's like a human problem and so what a naming service does is it just bridges the gap between the two so ens has names it has owners of names it has records that can store any information so if you have a name if you have someone's name you can look up and retrieve records then do something with that information so now i talked about like with websites what this means for ens let's say if you're using ens to send a cryptocurrency payment is ens provides your wallet with a cryptocurrency address and then the wallet sends the transaction on that network so let's say i'm sending bitcoin to brantley.east this confuses a lot of people say well ethereum name service is on ethereum how could i send bitcoin to an ens name the reason i can is because ens is just simply storing the bitcoin address and the wallet just takes that bitcoin address and then sends it the transaction on the bitcoin network so why is it the ethereum name service it is not because it's a naming service only for the ethereum ecosystem it's because it's naming service built on ethereum so the logic and records are stored on ethereum but it can store information relevant to anything right so um i have brantly.if i could put obviously an ethereum address in my records i could put a bitcoin address a dogecoin address i could put an ipfs hash i could put my twitter handle i could put my my home address i could put my favorite comic book character i could put any random information i want all it's just being stored on ethereum but of course any application can retrieve that information and then do something with it so why uh why did we build e s on ethereum so if if e ens is serving things beyond the ethereum ecosystem it's just using a theorem for the back end why why did we use a theorem for the back end well we think it's the best blockchain platform for a naming service we really believe this so there's many advantages it has high security decentralization so for example if we wanted to have uh our own dedicated blockchain just for naming let's say like name name coin or handshake or something you know we disagree with that approach one of the reasons is that it has lower security decentralization it's not gonna be able to compete with ethereum on that so we get to piggyback on all these the high security decentralization of ethereum uh ecosystem infrastructure we're not gonna have to reinvent the wheel here there's an enormous uh you know ecosystem of things that makes it easy to interact with ethereum that again we get to just piggyback and use because we're on ethereum uh we can make use of standards so like for example all uh all dot eth names not ian all not all e s names but all dot east names are erc 721 uh nft tokens nfts that means that in an ens name can just plug right into like an ethereum nft marketplace really useful uh programmability so because ens is built on ethereum ens names can be are like ethereum smart contract objects that could be like owned by contracts can be programmed to do interesting things you know you have that whole and um that's really useful and then relate to that interacts with other contracts on ethereum or composability because the ens is on ethereum it can interact with other contracts on ethereum so for example you could have an ens name owned by a dao on ethereum or something like this and that and then the dow sells it on a in a marketplace an nft marketplace or something i mean you get all this constellation of things that come together when you're on ethereum so to be clear enos uses ethereum to serve the internet including and beyond the ethereum ecosystem and our goal is to make ens and therefore ethereum a basic piece of internet infrastructure used widely by people whether they are part of the blockchain community or not and we are doing this by complimenting the dns tech stack i'll say a little bit more about what i mean there the dns tech stack in parallel expanding the capabilities of the existing dns name space focusing on use cases not served by dns in some cases not possible on dns this is another key part of our strategy that you know there's already the internet already has like a widely used naming service it's called dns we're not trying to like tear that down or like replace that anytime soon we want to upgrade it we want to complement it um there's some things that dns does really really well with its current architecture and that probably is not going to go away but there's certain use cases that dns was not built for or that you can't even do and that's what we want to bring to the table we don't want to tear down we want to build up and complement so how ens works so um no servers ens proper has no servers it's run entirely as a set of smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain and therefore there's no permission needed to use this system you just need access to ethereum blockchain sometimes people say oh we want it we want to enter we want to integrate ens you know like do we you know how do we do that or what's do we need your permission or where's your api or something it's like it's just not ethereum it runs itself our organization could disappear and ens just keeps plugging away there are there are some things that we run just to be clear like our web interface we do run that as a normal website just to make it easy for people to interact with ens there are other interfaces and that can also be on ipfs but ens proper its core all runs on ethereum there are three like primary parts of ens there is the registry the registry is a smart contract that holds basically a list of all the names owners and resolvers resolver is a smart contract that holds records so the registry has the names who owns the name and then also basically what smart contract you should look to to find the records and also time to time to lift gtl we don't really use that that's something from dns that we have there in case we do want to use it uh okay so then we have resolvers so a resolver is a smart contract that stores and serves records why are these things separate we could just have one smart contract that's the registry that all that has names owners and then also stores the records the reason we don't we have them separate is that one we can easily upgrade um resolver contracts without touching the registry contract which is registry is like really like the core core part of ens it's like what names exist who owns them resolvers you know we upgrade on a regular basis also this allows people to have custom resolver contracts so like if you don't want to so so we maintain a kind of what we call the public resolver which is like the default record set that most people use but let's say you want to have your own record set you can create that and have your registry entry point to your record set rather than our default record set so it allows for more customization the third key part of ens is registrars so a register here is just a smart contract that creates and distributes names based on certain criteria for example payment so for example the top level domain or suffix dot eth exists in ens well how do you get a dot eve what's called second level domain so like brantly dotties how do i get that well the way the way this works is that we have a smart contract that owns dot eth and will give you a dot eth name if you meet certain criteria so for example if you pay it a certain amount of cryptocurrency there's also like length restrictions and things like this and then there's like how long that you own it before the smart contract takes back and things like this is all automated so that's what a registrar is you can have a register by the way for a second level domain so some people have done this let's say i have brantly.eth but i want to be able to sell subdomains off that i want to be able to do you know sell you know calvin.brantley.ethan heather.friendly.ethan andrew.brainlife.edu right what i could do is i could give ownership give up ownership of brantley.east to a smart contract a registrar that then allows people to register subdomains off of it based on certain criteria so that's what a registrar contract is of course to make any change uh to ens right now because it's all running on ethereum whether you want to register a name or set records or transfer ownership or anything like this this requires submitting um transactions on the ethereum blockchain which of course requires access to the ethereum blockchain you have to have some ether to pay network costs and you have to be able to submit the transactions we do plan on putting certain aspects making well i should say making certain aspects of ens available on certain layer on layer twos this year uh if you're aware if you if you use ens um ethereum network costs are very high right now gas costs are high just because if e s i'm sorry ethereum has so much use right now that the cos you know there's limited use uh transaction a throughput capability and there's so much competition to use it that the costs have gone up that has impacted everybody including ens so we're going to be working on making it possible for certain parts of ens to be put on a layer two so that you have lower lower costs so resolutions or lookups of records um you know where whether a name is available or anything like that do not cost anything because they are not a change to the ethereum blockchain so let's say if i have brantley.east and i want to look up the bitcoin address in the records that i'm literally just reading from the ethereum blockchain so that doesn't cost anything only when you're making a change is there a cost now of course this lookup can be done locally you can be running your own ethereum node on your computer and like let's say you have meta mask in your browser you can actually a metamask be pointing to your local node again you're just reading from your own computer or you can use a you know an ethereum gateway service like cloudflare or infiera or maybe a light client although those don't really exist they're not widely used okay so what do ens records look like so i mentioned that a resolver contract is just the contract that holds your records that you have your name and the registry point to we maintain sort of like the default record set that we call the public resolver that we upgrade over time and it has all the uh the standard uh record types that we standardized through an eip process um those are right now we have addresses so this can be any cryptocurrency address uh we then have a content record where it currently supports ipfs hashes swarm hashes and tor dot onion addresses although we're hopefully be adding cia hashes soon we have text records which just allows for any arbitrary information any arbitrary information it's not like optimized for storage but you can store any any text there that we all it also supports all dns record types you won't see that in our manager because we don't support in our ui but that is there and of course you can make your own custom resolver or your own custom record set you could also take the public resolver you could extend it if you wanted to so keep all the ones we have but like add an additional one that's for a certain use case or something um i would only recommend that if you have like a really good reason for the most part if you want to store some new type of information enos i would just use a text record because the public resolver already uses that so you don't have to do additional work so like if you want to see an example of records uh for yourself uh you can go to our manager app go to app.ens.domains and just search for brantley.xyz or brantley.east or something and you can see all my records and i i don't have i don't have i don't use every single possible record that we have because we support like over like the top 100 blockchains and things like that but i have like i think maybe 15 or 20 blockchain addresses there i have a content you know record with an ip fast hash i have a bunch of text records there so you can check that out okay so what is the name space on ens so a lot of people think that ens is dot eth names that is not true ens is naming infrastructure that runs on ethereum that has dottie's names but can have lots of other types of names in fact it could have any kind of name so enos really is just sort of like the pipes it could support any names so dot eth though is the was the first top-level domain available on ens and it is it is native to ens it does not exist in traditional dns it's something that only exists in our system is native to enos that has sort of all the benefits of being blockchain native um however we'd like to have more namespace available on ens there's really two ways we could go about doing this one way is we can just create a ton of new top-level domains we could do that from a technical standpoint it's negligible i mean we just literally just sent a train you know create them and now suddenly we have 100 new top-level domains we decide not to do that though because a namespace already exists on the internet in dns and that name space is growing all the time and we don't want to create what's called name collisions with dns so a name collision is when the same name exists on two different systems and it has two different owners so you we wouldn't want a situation where a name on ens is owned by one person the same exact name is owned by somebody else on dns and now it's like well depending on where i'm using that name or what browser or something like this it's going to go to different things that's called a name collision that would undercut the value of having a name system in the first place so what we've decided to do to expand the namespace available for use on ens is to simply integrate the existing dns space with the same owners on ens so the idea is that if you own a name on dns let's say brantley.com or brently.xyz there's a way that you can claim that same name on ens it's not brantley.eth it's like brantley.xyz so we've already done this with with some top-level domains in dns um.xyz i mentioned but also the ones listed there.logs.cred.co.art.gov these were sort of like test cases for us and they're kind of done in different ways we actually are planning on the next couple weeks rolling out near near total dns name space integration on to ens so like if you have brantley.com brantley.io brandly.org you will be able to use those names on ens here soon hopefully we will that system will be hopefully going on to testnet net this week hopefully maybe even today maybe later this week and then um uh on mainnet next month heather you unmuted was there something you wanted to say yeah there's a question here in the chat from gawain who asks is ens similar to unstoppable domains it's a good question um so uh you know why don't i take that question at the end because i think i'd like to go through ens here and then i can take that question cool thank you okay so how does enos compare to dns uh well simpler infrastructure service replacement smart contracts there's zero downtime you can't ddos attack it by definition it's it's you know architected to be decentralized censorship resistant as built-in cryptography and individual ownership or self-custody of names which i think leads to better security of course as i mentioned previously programmability and interactivity with other smart contracts or composability and uh i mentioned that we're trying to focus on use cases either are not good for with the dns or not possible in dns so the like i said you can store any information in ens but um the things we're sort of practically focusing on are so for example with cryptocurrency addresses like with payments uh because ens has far better you know security than dns then uh that it makes sense to be using ens for crypt storing your cryptocurrency addresses and for cryptocurrency payments same thing with ipfs websites if you have a distributed uh distributedly hosted website with ipfs and then using dns which is which is you know somewhat centralized that doesn't really make sense you want to use something that's all that's a naming service that's censorship resistant to ens and then like i mentioned with programmability or interactivity or composability i mean dns can't do any of these things and so things like owned names owned by smart contracts or groups like a dao or multisig and then used as you know nft or something like that those are all things you can do with ens so how to integrate ens like okay so you like ens where would you actually practically use this our goal is that every time a user might otherwise see a cryptocurrency address or a content hash they instead see an ens name that's what we're focused on so these are just examples of of the primary ways that people use ens so cryptocurrency address forward resolution so for resolution is where you have a name and you resolve it to a cryptocurrency address so for example let's say i want to send bitcoin to somebody i type in their ian's name and then or in this case let's say i'm sending ether to them or you know erc20 token or something um and the wallet then retrieves the appropriate address and then can send can send that cryptocurrency payment super simple we also have what's called ethereum address reverse resolution so reverse resolution is where you have an ethereum address already and you look up to see if there is a if there is an ens name that is associated with it this is useful because like a lot of dapps like you log in with your dap and they'll like sort of like almost like your username is your ethereum address right and you'll you'll see something like this this is bad ui what you can do is look up is there an ens name associated with and then display that either instead or alongside so for example if you have enos reverse resolution set up you log into unit swap or many other adapts it will show your ens name as sort of like your username so it's almost like a transferable username it's kind of cool so yeah like usernames um some dapps will even like give you free subdomains or something like this uh which is really useful um i mentioned ipfs swarmatory.oneresolution uh so there's a number of browsers that support ens and ipfs websites so opera brave status metamask mobile uh metamask extension and some other ones as well we have listed on our website where you can actually type in a dot e's name and if there's an ipfs hash in the records it will result it will show that like a normal website so that's really cool we also have a project called ifdns which is like a dns bridge to ens and ipfs so let's say if you don't have opera brave or metamask or something like this but you but you want to access in an ens ens and ipf's website the way you can do that is just simply add dot link to the end of the name and it will resolve like a normal website so for example if you wanted to go to almond dot eth i have that example there you can go to that if you have the things i mentioned that support ens but if you don't you just add dot link to the end and it will work like a normal website almond is actually a great place to start because it is a search engine and directory of ens and ipfs websites so you can go there and see people have tons of websites they've set up on this uh tour.onion resolution so if you have this works if you have the tor browser and only works in the tor browser and you have metamask enabled we've actually set up some dot east names to resolve to certain tordon onion hidden services so for example if you go to duckduckgotor.eth it's just something i set up i think you're going to need to have put a slash at the end of it so metamask recognizes it you do that then it will go to the duckduckgo tour hidden service so that's really cool uh like i said you know we do support dns records although it's not a major focus focus of ours but some people are experimenting with this um so for example dot cred is a dns top level domain that is integrated into ens and uh they have a couple interesting um ways of using enos so if you register a cred name on dns you automatically get the same.cred name on ens they just do it automatically for you ownership of the dns.cred name actually follows ownership of the ens version of it and then they actually store dns records on ipfs and ens and that's the canonical version of the dns records so what they do is they'll pull those records from ipfs and ens and they will put them into their dns system to work but if you change the ens ipfs version of it then um they change their dns version so they actually have priority to the decentralized version so i think that's really an interesting experiment then of course everything we haven't thought of so custom because we support custom records so here's some useful links uh you know you can learn more about enos okay so i like the chat here or something yeah okay so we have some questions so is ens similar to unstoppable domains i would say unstoppable domains is similar to ens because ens predates it by several years um it's much uh more widely used than unstoppable domains so enos is is an open source project it's run by nonprofits it has dot eth names we're integrating the dns name space we really view ourselves as infrastructure for the whole internet going forward for decades to come we have 172 integrations including 44 wallets we're in you know multiple browsers we're in tons of dapps things like this unstoppable domains you know i'll just say it's sort of just like a copy of vns that's run by a for-profit that has far fewer integrations i think they have they have like 30-some or something um they uh they also use the dot crypto name so they don't like dot crypt is also not in dns there's a problem with this though so with dot e dot eth is actually although it's not in dns has actually reserved dns as a three-letter country code for ethiopia um that's not that won't be used so as the dns name space expands over time because people can register new topical domains nobody can ever get dot eth so there's not be a name collision dot crypto is not reserved so in the next uh uh tld round um then uh dot crypto might get registered by somebody else and now you have different owners of dot crypto on the unstoppable system unstoppable domain system and then on dns um and then you have name collisions and because we're integrating the dns namespace into ens it it could have name collisions not only with dns but also with us so i think that's a serious problem um they're you know they're taking a completely different approach i think enos obviously is better that's why i'm on this project um but you can make your own decision there and basically you know we do we do everything ensemble domain does plus a lot more plus like way more integrations and just i mean that's all there is okay might reverse resolution not lead to unintentional data leakage about identity good question um i would say if you said reverse resolution you're wanting to associate the uh your ethereum address to your name in that way of course that information is already public anyway if somebody could do a for you know through forward resolution although it's trickier to find but reverse resolution you're doing you're you want to leak that information so i would say only set it up if that's what you're wanting to make that connection can you share a name for ipfs and ens search um yes almond it says a-l-m-o-n-i-t dot eth and dot link um lol exactly what i was thinking unsubscribe doesn't ens defeat the whole purpose of anonymity um so with ensm you don't have to use your real name you can use a pseudonym with ens many people do so i could be like you know jordan 1400.eth or something or or whatever so it's it certainly has it can be a pseudonym or in some cases maybe you want to associate your name with a certain um wallet or something like this i would say don't set your ens name as like your name and then associate it with wallets that you don't want to be connected to you because by setting up enos that way that is what you are doing so um enos can defeat privacy but maybe you don't want privacy but if you do want privacy then be careful how you use how you use enos thank you for that clarify a lot good have to head out love ens i have my own hosted website on the ass as well karl farderson dot east.link okay cool yeah people can check that out question from youtube will i be able to configure a ca policy in the future for example to register on or purchase an ssl certificate from the ens registrar basically buying certificate signing from enos yeah certificate authority um it's a good question um that is something certainly that could be done we don't like have something set up that way right now but you know certainly could do that let me tell you there's a lot that ens can do that we are working on and um there is you know ens is not finished and there is tons of work to be done and if you want to get involved in any way you know you can start contributing and um you know we were even sometimes looking to expand our team um but there is lots of work to be done so if you're like why doesn't enos have this feature well feel free to help us build it or maybe we will eventually how can we get a copy of the slides you are presenting today good question i don't know can i like give it to the youth global people they can make it available somehow yes definitely we'll share it on your discord channel sure oh yeah good point i'll just put it in my dis in our discord channel jack has the eyes he's looking at something okay is there a thought on how to stop phishing sites etc which are use very similar domains to famous domains and then are used for fishing yeah good question um this can be particularly tricky because um i can't remember the exact word enos supports like all oh it's like uh a wide range of characters so we even support like emoji we support like other language characters it's not just you know english or latin characters or something like this what can be tricky is that some of the characters can look very very similar and so actually i saw this the other day somebody said oh look crypto dot e sold for for ether well what it really was was crypto where the o was like like uh i can't remember the exact language but some like eastern european language oh that looks just like the english o but it's a different character so it was actually that was not the same as like crypto.ethe with all english characters uh what we recommend is that wallets or any place that you know are using these things maybe have some sort of warning like just so you know this is all you know latin characters but has one slavic character or something like this but this is a very tricky problem to solve brace yourselves ens is coming dude ens is already here people are using it but yes i think it has a lot of room to grow please we love we live your slides we love your slides okay question from youtube is there an ens javascript library library to use for dapps yes so if you go to our docs so docs.ens.domains we have a library section and we have like 12 libraries and we have multiple javascript libraries i mean we're in we have our own javascript library that we called ens js but we're also like in ethers dot js we're in web3.js where there's a bunch we're in a bunch of libraries question for me have you considered privacy integrations yeah so i mean it depends on what that means um it's like you could add privacy to different steps different parts of vns or different step parts of the registration process um we don't have any plans right now specifically to like do that i mean i'd say like if you want to have maximum privacy what i would do is i would create a new ethereum wallet like a new metamask wallet or something i would then send it ether from your main wallet but through tornado cache or something like that and then and then i would register a pseudonym you know you could say you know they're kind of things you could do it's tricky um but i'd say long term you know we'd like to make that easier for people to do but we don't have anything right now looking forward to getting in discord okay follow up on phishing defenses could user feedback or a blacklist be maintained by ens what kind of thought process is going on for anti-fishing approaches yeah okay so like a blacklist thing um we have no plans like ourselves maintain a blacklist but we would welcome the creation of an ecosystem of blacklists that then people could opt to use or not so we're not gonna obviously have some sort of blacklist like built into ens that defeat the whole purpose but like if a wallet wanted to use a blacklist or like a wording list like hey you know you're sending to this uns name warning this has been reported to be a phishing scam or something like this or warning that this has like a slavic letter in here when the rest are latin characters or something um we would welcome the creation of that so if anybody wants to do that like even as a hackathon project create some sort of blacklist or whitelist service or something i think that'd be really cool i mean we've talked about that for a while it's just waiting for somebody to do okay any other questions we have opt-in blacklist tool oh yeah so makoto yeah so we've done a little bit of work on this but i mean nobody's like using it or anything like that definitely work to be done on that topic makoto is one of our developers so makoto thank you very much does anybody else have any questions great okay i will put my slides how can we sign up ens with promotion uh great well we don't have any promotions but you can go to app.ens.domains and you can register a name and start uh playing around with it thank you so much brantley that was super informative great workshop great okay
