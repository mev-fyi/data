[Music] [Music] [Music] all right i guess we're starting is this my queue welcome everybody um my name is kartek one of the co-founders of youth global and i'm super excited to welcome all of you to the mev rail scaling ethereum edition so i have a quick a little bit of logistics to uh just cover before we go into our our roast and um i'm super excited that all of you are here we already have a few hundred people on our live stream and a lot of them on uh on the zoom chat for the discussions and uh for those of you who don't know this event is part of a scaling ethereum and scaling ethereum is a month-long event uh which is a hackathon handful of summits around everything that's going on with scaling on ethereum as part of this event we have over 600 developers over a thousand people attending the the various summits uh and we have people from 58 different countries and 18 different times participating working on a lot of cool things of what we can do with l2 systems and anything related to layer one on the scaling side so we did a handful of summits over the past few weeks on just what's happening in the world of l2s what's happening around with the merge and how we can use zero knowledge primitives to help with scalability and throughout all those discussions um it became clear there's a lot more we can cover and that led us to sort of trying to make this work at the end of your roast with the with the theme of scaling at this event and i'm super excited to kick that off uh today so um for those of you who've attended the amy rose in the past this is going to be slightly different than the zoom chats you've been able to be available to part of we're watching all this on etherglobal.tv and what's going to be different here is that anybody who has a question we ask you to sign into the chat and ask your questions there this is a live stream and we can see everything that you're typing and so can all the speakers so any questions that come up i will be able to relay them to our speakers and and get the discussion going or get any of the questions answered we also have the ability to uh get you directly onto the live call so if you have some questions and uh and want to ask them live um just comment on the chat directly and we'll be able to make that work so for all of you who are joining in uh be sure to say hi and any questions that come up over the next few hours just type them in and we'll get them to our speakers so we have a lot of interesting topics today that we're going to cover um we're going to have our first talk by phil who's going to talk about just the fundamental to uh permission systems in mev or mev being the fundamental uh aspect in permissionless systems then we'll have alex talk about what mvp looks like on each two and then we'll have a discussion uh with phil justin and and italic on scaling ethereum um and mev then uh georges will talk about the what is the mev game um theory looks like on l2 systems and then we have a talk by carl on just how muv auctions looks like to the sequencer and extractions then we have ellie going over mv minimization minimizations on on l2 and just what that design constraint looks like and lastly we'll have another panel with stani georgios david and barry white hat on just what this world looks like for bots users and sequencer dynamics so a lot of a lot of interesting themes and topics here and uh for anybody who's gonna who's interested in keeping up with the schedule or just seeing what else is on on deck you can just head over to scaling.educable.com and see the full agenda for today's talk and uh without further ado i'd like to welcome justin drake from the ethereum foundation who's going to be our roast master for today and uh justin will take over from here welcome justin thanks kartek uh thanks everyone uh thanks smashbox for for having me um i mean i i guess just to um to break the ice you know i i've been asked as a as a roast master to prepare some some roasty questions so you know i've taken my my job seriously i guess and i tried to um to come up with the you know the hardest questions i could come up with and just to make it fun i've i've kind of purposely used some abrasive language in the questions um so yeah i don't usually um ask questions like that unless maybe i'm in a really bad mood so i guess we can quickly go through the questions just to give you um an overview of where where my mind is at and also i guess food for thought for potential future discussion today so question one why does the flashbot's definition of mev not include all extractable value such as evm fees this definition is confusing and wrong please fix it question two can we please stop celebrating the gas savings from off chain priority gas auctions those savings are absolutely minimal less than one percent of total gas usage and that's from the public source mev explorer version zero question three can we please stop propagating the misconception that the mev power hierarchy ends with all powerful block builders basically block builders are more powerful than the bots which are more powerful than the users this is fud the power the real power hierarchy is users at the bottom bots as the neck level block builders as a level above that and then dapps and and dap designers and then the vm like the the enshrined consensus at the very top we primarily need to focus on better depth designs as well as vm level mev minimization and extraction such as eip1559 question four can flashbots leadership tone down the concave thinking such as mev is fundamental and fairness is impossible we only need good enough fairness we don't need perfection and we only need good enough mev minimization we don't need you know perfect mov minimization question five can the centralization risk that stem from the flashbots block proposer white listening whitelisting in the context of ef2 be properly acknowledged and taken more seriously question six flashbots rev so that's realized extractable value only provides a shockingly small 5.2 percent increase in minor revenue do you find these small rev numbers compelling enough to justify the huge flashbutts effort and then the final question can flashbots.net be friendlier to non-devs um and not redirect to um a github repo so i guess that's all my questions and um i'll now pass it on to tina oh so it looks like uh tina is not here hello can you hear me yes thank you our roastmaster for starting out for being the bravest roast master and start out with a challenge to flashbots and uh i commend your um bravery and i would uh anticipate phil um on behalf of flashbots at the end of your your talk mev is fundamental to permission the system to be able to rapid fire style um address these set of seven questions we can dive into them later on if we had more time but um without further ado phil um would you like to take over the screen share and start your talk yeah absolutely um alrighty hello everyone can you hear me should i start my video also um all righty so uh hope everyone is doing well today uh today we're going to talk about mev and what to do about it uh and provide a road map for how we tackle this major issue in the ecosystem so maybe let's start with a reminder of why we're here according to me from my perspective uh and a quote from the bitcoin white paper by satoshi uh saying the system is secure the bitcoin system as long as honest nodes collectively control more cpu power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes this simple sentence is super profound and speaks directly to what satoshi thought the security model of bitcoin was um honest and attacker nodes but really kind of this honesty model is not enough and doesn't underpin in my opinion the reason why we all find these systems interesting because in the real world this control of cpu power is actually expressed in money in dollars and in resources and economic resources especially as we have uh liquid staking and mining products things like derivatives things like cloud rental infrastructure that kind of increase the ease of entering and exiting these cpu positions the game really becomes a game of money um and and its incentives rather than purely cpu power so what we're trying to do here is build systems that are economically secure and kind of assuming honesty among a fixed set is not enough because if it was we would use more traditional consensus protocols like pbft so if we disagree on this slide we're probably not going to agree on the rest of my presentation but this is from my perspective why a lot of people uh in my in my journey and in my learnings in the cryptocurrency community are here uh so so taking this into account let's take an economic view of mev i'm not going to intro mev because i assume uh if you're watching this and you're interested in this event you kind of know what mev is so so mev just being basically minor fees that they can make or validator fees from manipulating the system and taking an economic view of this it becomes pretty obvious that the most profitable action for validators or for minors or whoever has access to this value uh is to extract the value to extract it as selfishly and as efficiently as possible um so let's think about what this means economically in a world where no one is extracting the value and the value is just kind of sitting there this means that any validators that engage in this pure extraction become the most profitable validators and they rapidly concentrate cpu power and therefore network control to themselves corrupting the security game that nakamoto posited in the slide before this includes things like fueling selfish mining uh and 51 attacks uh and things like that so to to be useful to exist in a world where economic incentives dominate and where we don't have permissioned fairness and permission trust assumptions we have to be robust to the above phenomenon we need to build systems that continue to work for users and continue to operate even though there's this economic concentration vector even though there's this ability for validators to concentrate power to themselves we don't want to build a system that centralizes itself basically to these validators so in this context um to avoid concentrating to to sort of validators who are willing to engage in pure extraction at the expense of the ones who are not we have to make sure we enter a world where if there is mev on the table and this is assuming that mev exists like in each today it's not talking about systems where maybe l1 is changed or l2 has changed we'll get to those later but assuming that mev exists we have to extract mev as efficiently as possible to avoid this concentration and everyone in the system must extract about the proportionate amount of mev to their cash power that would lower the margin of validator unfairness so if you own one percent of the hash power you should have about one percent of the mev profits if you own eighty percent you should get about eighty percent um otherwise if you have kind of a a super linear function rather than a linear function there you get a direct centralization vector that kind of erodes these guarantees and and harms the ability of this system to exist in this economically secured model not only that but but a very real economic point from the stakers and validators we've talked to most stakers and validators just aren't willing to leave mev on the table they want to be extracting this they want to have access to this value in most cases so this model of leaving me on the table if it exists is not realistic and what we should instead make sure is that mev is well distributed proportional to the validator or network hash power this is a joke from my blog post basically saying that to speak to my previous point we're trying to build systems here that are secure by economic incentives even in the case where we have adversaries trying to attack them and because people's rational self-interest is so large the systems continue working uh and and i think it's very foolish to think that these adversaries that we're building these systems against especially as they increase in value and become more political will draw the line at mev extraction and won't use this as a vector to attack the system so that's why i see sub-optimal mev extraction as self-defeating from an economic security point of view now i'm going to talk about why mev is fundamental and by fundamental i mean is not going to be reduced to zero anytime soon it's not going away note that this doesn't mean that we can't reduce mev a lot it just means that we will never take it to zero that's what the word fundamental means here so there's three kind of prongs three sources of the fundamental uh kind of value the fundamental vector of mev that i'm going to talk about in this presentation and their transcriptability interoperability and diverse trust models so why is mev fundamental well the first reason is transcriptability what we're trying to build is decentralized systems systems where trust is distributed and decentralized and in some ways democratized and to build these systems what we need is auditability without auditability we don't know what goes on in these systems we could have infinite inflation we could have double spends as a user we need some way to audit our finances we need some way to audit what other people are doing in the system and we need some way to audit the system stability ideally through cryptographic transcripts and through cryptographic audit logs that's essentially what we're building with these blockchain data structures unfortunately when you have these cryptographic transcripts that can be validated without additional trust assumptions you also introduce probability so that's something i cover in this blog post here from 2018 that talks about bribery infrastructure for vote buying and for other economic mechanisms but basically if you can generate these cryptographic transcripts you can condition payments on these cryptographic actions that uh that introduce basically this trustless bribe vector because of the existence of the cryptocurrency itself itself on which these actions are occurring so we want this decentralization we want this auditability so we have to build systems that deal with this bribery we have to build systems that exist in spite of it and in fact that was a big part of the ef's research agenda several years ago and i imagine continues to this day is how do we even define this model economically and what it means to be secure against bribery so that's very much ongoing work but we do know we want this we want to be secure against bribery now because you have multiple outcomes and you have this probability that is fundamentally a source of mev because these different outcomes have different values to different people in the network one outcome might be worth five dollars to me where my transaction gets mined first and another outcome might be worth zero dollars to me and same for everyone else in the network so this distribution of value across outcomes combined with this probability directly provides mev into the system another reason why mev is fundamental is interoperability so even if we eliminate mev within a single blockchain and within a single truss model or within a single l2 or whatever it may be there are other sources of mev that come from the ability to arbitrage sources of information flowing across different trust models so things like events on cosmos uh events on bitcoin changes in bitcoin transaction flow changes in prices on centralized exchanges these are all relevant sources of value that right now flow to the miners and the validators and are covered under this umbrella of what we refer to as med and these payments will ultimately still be controlled by whoever controls transaction ordering or whatever process ultimately controls transaction ordering providing an incentive to manipulate this process so anytime you have information flowing across trust models which is required for any meaningful interoperability between systems you have some composability boundary there which entails some risk for anyone trying to arbitrage across these systems and this risk directly drives profit it directly drives arbitrage incentives and it directly drives the kind of bribery we talked about in the previous slide and even in decentralized networks this risk is not evenly distributed right so some bots some network actors are better positioned to capture this risk than others which introduces mev which introduces this distinct set of bribery preferences and fuels these payoffs to validators and two system participants to control ordering last thing that fuels med is a diverse set of trust models so you might just say why not slap a fairness protocol on our level layer one i've heard there are all these different protocols we can use to make layer one fare or make layer two fair why not just use a fair ordering protocol well there's not such thing as one fair ordering protocol and there's not such thing as one layer two that everyone's gonna use and there's not such thing as one blockchain that everyone everyone's gonna use in the real world you have multiple different kind of execution zones and multiple different trust models all with economic activity so here's an example from fairness protocol so this is just one set of fairness protocols designed for permissionless systems with one set of trust assumptions and you can see depending on whether you want a leader or a leaderless protocol whether you want a synchronous network or asynchronous network assumption depending on what what guarantees you want and depending on which nodes you want to trust because these protocols are parameterized by which nodes are running them and which permission set of nodes you essentially choose to run these fairness protocols so depending on all these assumptions you get different execution and different protocol operation now assuming that many different people run these protocols and you have many protocols coexisting arbitrage opportunities across these protocols start to come into play in the incentives of all the nodes that run these protocols creating bribability and fueling mev so just the fact that nobody can agree or we can't all agree on a single set of truss assumptions fuels mev why because any protocol that requires assumptions can't be a universal protocol can't be a protocol for everyone in the universe and fairness protocols will always require assumptions why because fairness always requires assumptions fairness is a political concept fairness is an economic concept there's not a single notion in a single definition of fairness different users and different actors in the network have different definitions and different ideas of what's fair different markets require different protections against different styles of unfairness so i don't think we'll ever have a single fair fairness protocol the same way we don't have a single universal fair governance system in the real world or a single property ledger that everyone agrees on or et cetera et cetera it just doesn't exist there's no such thing as that single source of fairness so fairness protocols themselves by existing in these multiple zones themselves will also create mev and themselves will kind of require minor payments to run so just the fact that there's no single notion of fairness in some ways inherently creates mev and relying on a committee honesty assumption to get past this and kind of move past this this point doesn't really work it doesn't economically scale because it breaks down once economic attacks and incentives come back into play and collapses back into trust assumptions i call that self-defeat so we can't just assume that we can slap a fairness protocol on and move on we have to actually deal with this fundamental issue of med lastly i want to say amiv is fundamental to permissionless systems for another reason why because all mev is is profit available to actors that are in a privileged position in permissionless networks and these profits are fundamental to how these networks operate so uniswap for example provides a permissionless bribe aka mev all mev is is a permissionless bribe to any arbitrage bot who brings the price back to market that's why the network offers market prices even to illiquid pairs because of this mev maker dow offers an mev-based bribe to any bot that maintains or a stability of the system by liquidating vulnerable positions without mev maker dow wouldn't be stable or it would have to rely on a permission set such as you know keeper dao or some other protocol that has a more permissioned elected and advanced set of bots the fact that anyone can come in at any time and restore the system stability is what gives miners the ability to extract this profit is what creates this mev in this analysis so same with these other systems and permissionless bribes kind of inherently run these systems for users and create mav so many times we want to design with mev and not because we're all foolish and not because we're all bot operators that being said i want to address some misconceptions that might come up in this presentation so i'm not saying that we can't reduce mev i i'm not saying that a lot of the forms of predatory mev that exist in the network like uniswap sandwiching um can't be reduced or can't be made more in line with user and protocol incentives and i'm sure we can do this at the dap layer and i'm sure we can do this also at the layer two and layer one uh level and i'm sure we're gonna hear all about all these things in the rest of the roast i'm not saying that mev should not be minimized so if you're a user you shouldn't use protocols that have a lot of harmful mev you should only use protocols that expose med that's necessary to their operation i'm also not saying mev is a virtue it's not a moral issue or a moral virtue to extract meb and i'm not saying today's system is the best i call it the least unfair today's system is probably unfair more than it needs to be and we can reduce that in a lot of ways with smart dap design i am saying we need to think carefully about mev we need to blame dapps and we need to beware people who are trying to sell silver bullet solutions saying this one protocol whatever the protocol might be will eliminate mev for all use cases it may eliminate mev for many use cases and it's something we should think carefully about but we also need to still deal with this issue because it's still going to exist in the cryptocurrency world no matter what we do and this is something i'm happy to debate on and i'm sure we'll debate uh kind of people on the panel later if you want to read more you're welcome to read kind of the expanded form of these arguments on my blog it's linked here highly encourage that and lastly i think i'm out of time so i will leave you with this slide which is summarizing my blog post and says what i need to do sadly i don't have time to answer justin's great questions but i'm sure we can make some time for that and also hit them in the panel that uh justin and vitalik and i are on later cool thanks everyone hope you found that interesting happy to hand it back to the roastmaster take questions whatever the relevant order is i will open the chat now do we have any questions for phil um i mean i kind of have one question which is you know one of my questions there which is you know you say that mev is not fundamental in the sense that we can't get it to zero but you know who cares about zero right what about one percent if we remove 99 percent one percent is negligible and we can just forget about it um and i think my intuition is that every technique uh basically might remove um you know half of the remaining mev so for example eip1559 that might you know ex extract and burn half the mev and then you left for the other half and then you might have another technique like i don't know bdfs or whatever and then you have all the other techniques and then they they gradually chip away and because you have this um this distribution basically as soon as you have five techniques you've you've removed the bulk of the mev and so even though i agree it's true that maybe is fundamental um it's a bit defeatist in the sense that we should really be uh focusing on the on the solutions that we'll chip away at the mev yeah i totally agree with you like uh the reason i started researching meb is because i think it is a fairness potential fairness issue for everyone who uses uh cryptocurrencies whether or not you use systems with mev other people's mep also affects your system so that's an important point to make so i think it is important to reduce it as much as possible that being said you know i've written personally many libraries many papers on mev techniques and like thought about this quite a lot my personal opinion and i'm happy to debate this and maybe maybe we i think i do want to debate this on the panel uh that we're on is that all of these solutions have some ux trade-offs um and like one example is is batching right or uh delay-based solutions like vdf-based solutions all these solutions have ux trade-offs for users and the question is like what do people prefer are there still going to be people who want to use this real-time exchange and are there people who are going to prefer to use this kind of delayed exchange of eip1559 what's the ux trade-off if anything it's a ux benefit i don't think eip1559 affects mev it it introduces like a static base cost for transactions but ordering can still be done completely out of band uh if necessary um well that's because you have the definition of mev like the that goes back to my question one which is mev should still include all extractable value which currently includes the fees um and you know mev is bad for many reasons for example it leads to chain instability um and so eip1559 does definitely reduce mev by not giving it to the blog proposers so i think the the transaction fees people are paying for inclusion are actually a very small percentage of the eventual mev market even today in many blocks in a substantial percentage of blocks like several percentage of blocks they're negligible compared to uh other mev sources which makes them already negligible in the consensus game whether or not they're always negligible if they're often enough negligible which they are like they're you know they're what we should be designing for in my opinion uh and so those fees are are not spoken to by one five five nine so you're right it does change the dynamics a little bit in that some of the transaction fees are burned but it's plausible that miners um or transaction fees could increase to accommodate for that and if not it's plausible that there could be other out-of-band games um so i do think yes it specifically for for kind of congestion fees and chain stability it starts to chip away at that issue but there's still like uh you know the game is like still fundamentally unchanged and like the deeper protocol level mitigations are still things that were we haven't explored yet um and i would love to discuss those too and i think there's a lot of stuff we can discuss there um but but my kind of journey on this is that like i spent a long time with with a lot of projects i advise you know decks protocols uh other smart contract projects things like that trying to get people to address mev trying to get dapps to address mev and then the main pushback was the ux trade-offs like their users didn't want it except as an option and once you introduce it as an option and you have liquidity that's split across these different mev solutions that actually ends up creating more mev uh which is kind of what the analyses showed so that's kind of why i'm coming at it from that perspective i don't think there's nothing to be done there like i do think there's something to be done but i think that like i've personally run into this brick wall of ux trade-offs uh often enough that like i'm not trying to be defeatist i'm just like a little bit defeated and i encourage people to like you know keep coming up and keep kind of chiseling away at this because i think it is super important and it's very under researched and like having more people on it i think reduces the probability of defeat there phil what do you think about the engineering arms race of mev because mev doesn't have like zero cost to extract like someone has to build the analysis systems to uh to do uh mav extraction and i think like one of the patterns that i see is like the like perception of extractable value has to reach some sort of critical mass before the engineering starts to happen like uh uh there was like some amount of extractable value on it uh threshold that ethereum reached before and maybe extraction like became serious and you know i would observe for years like that like we would like oh there's mev here but no one is extracting it's because like writing that code was not true it was not true yeah i agree um uh and part of the reason we started flashbots is that we saw that equilibrium sort of shifting in the run-up to this current bull market and i think like anyway this current defy boom and this current uh youth bull market combined with the the rise of so many different d5 protocols on eth have made mev on eath just like too big to ignore and i think there are several different projects that are out there at least a dozen that i know of that are actively you know working towards building that infrastructure so i think that is true for a while uh but i think especially for eth today practically speaking the the size of the market just grew so large and the design is what it is like we can talk about changing it and i think that's a conversation we can have but like in practice it just did grow to like a multi multi-billion dollar defy market very quickly uh without having designs that were ready to compensate for the changes in mev so in that situation like the the infrastructure cost becomes really much lower especially when you have like desperate miners um who are who are looking at things like proof-of-stake um so yeah i do agree with you at the same time i think uh that cost was starting to be paid by many entities and so the most important thing to do at that point is to try to democratize things as much as possible in the short term and try to advocate for reduction and for dealing with this as a commons issue in the medium term i think this relates and like the connection i wanted to draw to um like this like portfolio of mitigations is like we deploy these portfolios of mitigations we work on these portfolio mitigations they have ux trade-offs um and then we don't ever know whether or not you've actually mitigated enough it's like any kind of security mitigation like you don't know if your mitigations are good enough because as soon as one leak becomes valuable enough then like engineering resources will get focused on like extracting as much value um uh uh from that and that's that's another aspect of it which i like sort of relates to like the fundamentalness of mev is like we can keep working on mitigations and we are like morally obligated to work on mitigations but like the mitigation like we will never know if you've mitigated it enough yeah i think we can only like observe kind of the second order impacts of mitigations and like keep introspecting and it has to be a continuous process because this is like essentially what we will we are rebuilding uh and we will rebuild is like uh the the general financial arbitrage game that was built in like the 90s on wall street uh which which i think we want to avoid a lot of the pathologies of but i think there are real parallels here uh where you know uh i see mitigations as like kind of exchange design and fairness proposals in that world that try to increase fairness by doing things like batching to try to reduce uh profit for hft um and and i think a lot of the analyses that people have there on fairness kind of apply to mev also you can port them into this world for example batch auctions like you can analyze them to be more fair than limit order books at the same time there's very little data on how fair they are when they coexist with limit order books and like what arbitrage across them looks like the same way like fairness protocols you can analyze them to be fair in isolation it's much harder to analyze what they'll do in the real world or what they'll do when there's they're running for a while or as incentives change as people get corrupted as they get attacked things like that so that's kind of i think the work that really needs to be done and it's like multiple decades of research that needs to go into that with that note um i would love to uh invite our next uh speaker to present meb on east 2. alex please go ahead and share screen and we will revisit a lot of the questions in the site chat and from the east global tv at the panel after alex talk hello can you can you guys see my um ice cream yes sweet sweet all right one sec put a little timer on all righty let's get started um thank you phil for the the great presentation um and um phil kind of talked about permission of systems in general and i'm gonna talk about mev in east 2 and i'm alex part of part of flashbacks um all right so a quick recap first of all um about the merge and e3 in general so in december 2020 the beacon chain was launched and this this it's essentially this this separate chain that runs on the proof of stake in census already where you have validators voting on uh beacon blocks and these validators submit their eve on uh an ethor and smart contract deposit and then become validators and so what essentially gonna happen at the merge is the shift for for ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and you could compare it to like a mid-air engine change flight engine change um it's not as dangerous as it sounds just because the beacon chain has already been launched and has been amassing more and more validators but this is essentially like a way to that i found useful to think about it so essentially changing the consensus engine of ethereum but so if you've kind of followed that analogy we have this kind of dual dual chain model right so we have this consensus chain that has already been existing the beacon chain and we have the existing ethereum chain so what's going to happen after the merge and when ethereum is now on a proof of stake and since the mechanism is the the ethereum blocks as we know them today and so i've called them eth1 blocks are going to be included in the beacon chain as an element of a beacon block alongside consensus objects such as validator attestations exits and deposits of validators and there's a slight difference in proof-of-stake where the validator is known a validator is chosen in advance to propose a particular beacon block and so that's a slight change that we're going to talk about that's important but so if we go through the standard theorem transaction execution before and after the merge um before the merge a user would send a transaction the transaction is propagated on the eth1 p2p layer transaction shows up in an ethon client mempool that client would be a node software that a miner would would run for example with with some a transaction ordering interface and mining interface an eth1 client would form a block then the block would be added to the ethernet chain should the miner win the the proof of work lottery and then what's not mentioned here is i guess as as uh other blocks are built on top of that one there's probably probabilistic finality that's that's reached um after the merge a user would still send a transaction the transaction would still be propagated on the same peer peer network layer the transaction would still show up in ethereum client mempos the eth1 client would still form the blocks the same software that currently assembles block and ethereum would still do that after the merge and so in e2 the only difference is that the block is now passed to these two client as as we showed in the previous slide right as an element of a beacon block and then the the finality is slightly different it's probabilistic at first and then deterministic after uh some some amount of time and when uh an amount of of beacon blocks have passed and have been finalized um and so let's let's focus on on this bit first so this is interesting because this doesn't change that much and so i think when people think about these two they think about a radical change in transactions and that type of stuff and uh that that's actually not really uh the case and so more than this we see that the same software is used to order ethereum transactions and that's key because um we can kind of first this is kind of first takeaway that ethereum transaction ordering as we know it today still exists in eth2 that's important for the extracted mav that we know of so the the the value with respect to transaction ordering from example arbitrages and liquidations uh the the game of ordering transactions would still happen very similarly um and by as we know it today i mean the same p2p layer and the same software that orders traction as i was mentioning and so now that we know this we can kind of reason about hey what if validators would run a transaction ordering software that looks like a flashbots mevgef right and so a slightly modified eth1 client that uh is able to accept tips from from users for transaction priority um and we can use some of the numbers on of flash bots to uh reason about this and to kind of map out validator rewards and that's something that we presented in the previous talk and we're going to build on a little bit now previous talk given last week um [Music] so we're using a pintails model pintel is a great great article on this that i put the link here and i'll share more um but so thank you pintail and um we're using his python code and building on it so um the assumptions as i kind of showed in the previous slide is about 0.18 east per block of mev and that's from flashbacks uh numbers and so that's actual value that we've seen flow and then 52 percent of blocks that have neb in them and so not all blocks have med um and then extra limitations around there's no tx fees added which goes back a little bit to justin's uh point around the definition of mev um and other other other things to mention the i guess one key thing is the 0.18 is definitely a lower bound and there's going to be an update to our infrastructure very soon that would change that number so take the numbers that i talk about as more a way to build intuition around this and maybe to start talking about the implications of mev rather than exact figures to build on top of so mapping out the mvv enhanced validator yields this is a graph that we showed last week with tomas the orange the orange curve uh is mev enhanced validator yields the blue curve our normal validarian the blue dotted line here are the the actual number of validators in the system currently which is about 120 000 for 4 million eve stake and so we see that mev boosts revenue by about point nine percent uh seventeen seventy point nine percent which is pretty significant especially when you compare that to minor revenue uh and the boost of mev to minor revenue which we we found to be somewhere uh between five and seven percent again as justin mentioned in his questions so this is kind of an order of magnitude higher and it's definitely important and um worth keeping in mind um and so more about it rewards means more validators because this is more you know it's more attractive and and that means more security you ultimately finish your network so that's great um yay however in reality mev is only earned by the block proposer because they're the ones who are paid this tip and they're the ones who have the ultimate power related to transaction ordering and um over a finite time scale there is actually a range of uh blocks you can hope to propose um and this this is just governed by like a simple binomial distribution and so in in pintail um article again uh he's here they show for a hundred thousand validators uh how many blocks can they hope to propose for the unluckiest one percent the median and the luckiest one percent you can see that there's a there's a wide range of 15 to 39 right and pintail maps that and you can see the the orange and blue curves there are the unluckiest one percent in lucky it's one percent you can see there's a slight difference between the two but now if you add any v on to that the the two curves that you see here are now collapsed here and the difference is pretty much uh you know you can't see it but this is the the average mev the unluckiest and luckiest and you can see how wide the gap is and that's something to to think about more more deeply in in my opinion because um a second takeaway that maybe we can see from this is that mvv increases the variance of returns between the luckiest and unluckiest validators um and that brings up a lot of questions that we haven't answered yet and this is something that we're thinking about more but does it exert pressure for pulling dynamics to to happen right because you want to smooth out that that variance of luck uh does it mean that mev is is prohibitive to being a solo validator um or does it exert additional pressure for all the gopalic dynamics to form right where uh people that have a large uh validator stake will uh have more blocks that they they propose they will get more mev rewards from that and then they will have more ethan and they can stake more and that kind of cycle um i'll i'll also add that right now we're assuming an even distribution of muv per block that's 0.18 uh in reality mv is highly uneven uh unevenly distributed and this was this would exacerbate this this effect um so that's the second takeaway uh about a movie on youth two um going back to this this kind of flow of transaction execution the the second the second bit that's interesting to focus on is actually the difference right and so the difference in how the the the block uh the block of ethereum transactions act actually gets passed on to or gets you know uh validated by the consensus or how do validators or the network comes to consensus on it and this is where the the difference is the the blog proposal is different in in in an eth one the block composer or today is a minor and he needs to um that would be a validator and in each one the the the minor knows probabilistically if they're going to propose the block or not depending on their hash rate was it needs to the validator is selected in advance and there is a single validator selected to propose a block at a particular slot and so that's that's also different but so thinking about what changes uh consensus voting power is now governed by the the amount of eth held and because you you stake security deposits of 32 if and the largest eath holders are exchanges and so if you look at the etho one deposit address addresses uh you can see that a large chunk about 17 percent is kraken there's there's binaries this will be here and there are other players coming online as well and this is interesting because these players are regulated under different regulatory regimes they have you know other activities than simply staking and they have other services as well where a staking might have synergies with and where mvv might have synergy with all of this and so um this is going to shape the enemy landscape to some extent and what people are willing to do given the jurisdictions they're in and giving the other services they offer and the reputation they have and it's definitely worth keeping in mind as a mental model i will say what what isn't shown here is that for a lot of these large exchanges and players they don't necessarily run validators in-house rather they redirect a lot of staking flow to other pools partly to avoid correlated slashing risk and um partly to to avoid just the huge overhead of running in-house validators uh and so this is not necessarily correct in the sense where it is possible and i would have to double check that kraken for example direct some of their flow to to stake fish or to state us um and so this is this is a little bit uh something to keep in mind the other thing that's interesting is you have new players coming online not only the the large earth holders but also these meta pools or cool aggregators in a way so lighter is an example of that where they offer staking derivatives in particular liquid liquid eth so you don't have to you're not stuck not being able to withdraw your your efas as being a validator um and the redirects they can flow to to validator pools right and so these are the ones kind of mentioned here um and so you can think of the dynamics of these metapools with these pool alligators similar to these dex aggregators in a way right where when dex aggregators came what they end up doing is bringing the price of similar assets on different decks is in line together and making things more efficient and so if you kind of port that logic to uh profit sharing of mev and also the media activity that validators validated pools engage in uh i think these these metapools or pool aggregators however you want to call them are going to exert influence there and are going to be able to potentially uh set some some social norms but also influencing in the split in med profit sharing so that's also important so the third takeaway is the identity of block proposal exchange uh changes uh and that's that's definitely important um and worth considering again in your mental model of mev so there's a lot of things we didn't talk about this is a short presentation uh but we've been doing a lot of things on different funds the first one is this is all assuming that layer twos are not like fully adopted but in reality a lot of the transaction ordering is gonna move to layer twos right and and what's gonna be living at the layer one are these kind of like roller batches and frog proofs and so that might change some some of the thinking that was mentioned in the previous slides uh there's also the the cross layer to ordering that that's interesting uh and how that relates to um for example shard aetherium and the role of centric ethereum um and so there's there's been talks of of staggered shard blocks for example and that might introduce a new sense of ordering um between different l2s um there's also new constraints on iv search uh the fact that what i mentioned before the the block leader selection is known in advance uh is is very interesting and relevant to mev and predictable block times as well fixed block times 12 seconds is also interesting from a from a simulation time and optimization perspective um and also many other things uh ones that i would notice future protocol level changes in how they affect them in the stateless clients changing in finality gadget from from casper to casper ffg to cbc and other things there that are fascinating to explore so as a quick summary of the presentation transaction ordering as we know it today still exists and still happens on eth2 and happens with the same software and transactions are propagated on the same pvp network layer our early numbers show that any viewer awards are a bigger deal than proof of stake ethereum than in proof of work ethereum and so the impact that mev would have will be accentuated it looks like any of your awards could help make ethereum more secure uh by incentivizing a higher amount of individuals to be validators at the same time it looks like mev awards co could accelerate dynamics that were explored by phil as well right in the sense where if mev is not extracted or is extracted asymmetrically by one party other than whatever you might create this this instability that is important to think about and there's a change in the actors that hold consensus voting power in particular who the block proposes are there's a lot more research to do and we look forward to collaborating with a lot of a lot of you and a lot of organizations on this this is the the beginning of us thinking about not only eth2 but also how that interacts with layer two and roll-up-centric ethereum so um consider this as like a an introduction to some of our thinking there and definitely an invitation for you to to participate share your opinion and contribute um and that is it um thank you i wonder if we have time for questions i let um maybe justin let me check the chat actually but thank you thank you for listening um yeah thank you alex i'm not sure if we have time for questions i don't see any questions in the chat all right if we do have questions i have one but it depends on if we have time or not please i would suggest let's go ahead with your question uh let's keep it short and uh while we uh promote uh uh ali uh uh sorry eli from uh uh starkware to present next before the panel okay great i guess i just want to um highlight question five from the very beginning which is um like in as i see it the the migration from the current design of flash bots from if one to e2 poses a potentially significant centralization risk and the reason is that there's this white listing aspect so it's okay to white list pools it's okay to white list whales but you can't white list 10 000 you know enthusiasts mini stakers um so could you highlight the centralization risk and um the efforts are being taken to address it so you're you're you're totally right and part of this this uh centralization that you mentioned is related to preventing preventing spam risk and ddos attacks on on miners right uh and what's interesting about eth2 is this this this fact that i mentioned before right that leader election is done in advance it means that you wouldn't necessarily need such relay anymore and we've been exploring these kind of alternative architectures there uh where you could for example encrypt your ethereum transaction with the the key of the validator that you know is going to propose the beacon block for the for the slot that you're targeting uh and then you wouldn't you wouldn't have the same issue the issue that you have with proof of work right now is you don't know who's going to mine and so you have to share uh these these bundles with all the miners at once and they're slightly different simulations you have to do with each of them and so all that complexity is something that is unreasonable to ask miners to do and so that's why we've kind of taken on that role but it's definitely something that you write is not um it's not uh something we i mean it's not necessarily sustainable nor something that we we aspire to keep in the in the in the system so we're actively exploring it we are also participating in uh east global's hackathon realism where we're like prototyping quickly on on what what movie would look like on eth2 so it's definitely top top of our mind um and as we've kind of outlined in our values et cetera we want to preserve ethereum's core values and one of them is obviously the centralization so it's something that is close to our hearts and it's very important to us to to do fantastic thank you yeah it's very interesting that this this this public knowledge it can be turned into an advantage like traditionally i think of it as a disadvantage yeah and i will i will even go as far as saying that with layer two then we'll hear more about them today uh leader selection is gonna be a key criteria to understand how the mev mechanics to some extent and i think the exercise for us to think about mechanics from uh e1 to eth2 can then we can reproduce that pretty easily to other layer twos and both their their finality uh um mechanics and also their their leader selection mechanics and that might uh uh that might guide us in what mdv would look like in these systems so it's definitely interesting is ellie here we're still waiting to uh to get him on board uh just uh having some painless debugging but if there's any other questions from the chat or the comments we can relay that for the next minute or two i'm reading the chat now i don't know justin if there's anything you want to maybe i'm looking at the wrong chat i'm looking at the zoom chat um i i need to open the east global one too yeah i'm looking at the zoom chat i'm not seeing any questions there oh vasily knowing sloths in advance opens up realistic possibilities for multi-block mev um i agree but i also so maybe justin you could talk about single uh secret single leader election and i i understand that's like a future improvement but then that would they would limit knowing the slots to i mean you wouldn't have the public list of uh who is going to be the validator for a particular slot i'm also curious about maybe proof of custody and how that interacts with this and key delegation in general wherever pools would have a lot of uh power over for example they would have several contiguous slots or this type of thing and how realistic is that yeah so i actually don't think the secret leader election changes too much on the mev front and the reason is that even though the general public doesn't know who will be the validators there's still two things one is that you can still potentially encrypt to kind of this unknown public key you know it's an interesting cryptography problem to think about and then the other thing is you as a validator or as a pool you still know where you are positioned right even though if the world doesn't you still know and so you'll still know if you have two contiguous slots um and yeah i think this is a kind of a worrying potentially worrying centralization risk right because the probability that you have two or three or whatever contiguous slots gonna be you know um a function of of how large you are and so that will incentivize larger pools um yeah interesting i'm curious to i've been i've been writing a little post and i've been trying to uh compute the number for the probability of having two contiguous slots uh i'm not done yet but i'd love for you to check it out right i mean the actually um we did quite a bit of research on these contiguous slots uh idea and the reason is that it affects randall right so in randall you're meant to reveal or not reveal a secret and if you have several contiguous slots at the end of an epoch then you get to manipulate the randomness so quite a bit of analysis was done and i think italic wrote some some if research posts uh that are possibly relevant to calculate probabilities there got it thank you i mean what's what's not clear to me is if you you you're a validator and uh by the way if eli is here please i'm just talking until until he's here what's what's not clear to me is is how like the actual mechanics work if i'm like a validator and i uh you know submit my stake to a validator pool how much power did they have over like do they have full control of my of my key uh is is there something there that uh there's like an anti-centralization measure that's baked into the protocol right now or that you guys are thinking about so i was told about proof of custody for example and i'm not sure how that interacts with all of this if at all well as it stands today most pools are fully custodial so for example coinbase you know they just hold your ether and they'll do everything on your behalf um and in terms of incentives for um [Music] you know for for not having this centralization risk the one of the main ones that we have is basically penalizing correlated failures so um if we have let's say thirty percent of the network or you know that fifty percent of the network that goes offline then you know that that's more heavily penalized than just one percent going going offline for an extended period of time another thing is if you have you know one validator who gets slashed that one validator will only lose a small amount of eve but if you have 30 percent of the network that that did something like a slashable offense uh then the the penalties will be very large so that's something that maybe the general public doesn't realize because it hasn't happened yet but my prediction is that at some point in the future one of the exchanges are going to mess up and it's going to be extremely costly and there's going to be a great lesson uh in terms of diversification because you don't want to put all the validators in the same place anecdotally i've been talking to people who might have been looking at this for the exchanges front and this seems they're very aware of this correlated slashing risk and also diversifying their infrastructure so they don't have this but what i'm what i'm what i've been thinking about is that infrastructure decentralization is not the same as as power decentralization right even though they decentralize the infrastructure if if they still have some say over the ordering of blocks for example or they have control over the e4 clients that are used to uh for for you know to include the e5 and that beacon block then even though the infrastructure is decentralized and they might not suffer from a very harsh correlated slashing risk they might still have power over uh uh that everything and so i don't know if the infrastructure decentralization is a strong implication of power decentralization and in terms of consensus voting power right um and what one thing that comes to mind in this whole pool situation is one of the attacks i'm actually one of the ones i'm most worried about um is um is basically a an inside job by the pools so you know we've made a lot of effort in the eve to design to separate the online sticking key from the offline kind of withdrawal key and my guess is that the the exchanges have extremely good cold storage infrastructure and the withdrawal key almost certainly won't get compromised even by some sort of internal employee like a rogue success system and so there's this kind of uh feeling of security where you know because this is assist admins can't access this withdrawal key that can't really steal funds but actually that's a false sense of security and the reason is that there's a ransom attack um that you can use if you have access to the signing keys and the reason is that you can um you can trustlessly um hold your validators at ransom by threatening to to to post um via slashing um exactly and so if you if you're coinbase and you have 30 percent of the validators let's say um then that's effectively maximal slashing you'll lose 100 of your stick and so you're the the power that you have uh to perform this attack uh will will depend on on how large your your pool is so if you want to mitigate yourself against these rogue sysadmins attacks go to a small pool interesting thank you i believe hi uh do you are you able to share your presentation from your phone would you like someone i prefer that if someone else can can do it for me that would be easier because i'm joining from uh from actually just you know from some family event from a car you don't want to hear the full story anyway so if someone can share my uh my my screen you know uh yeah let me just do like this and then i can uh um okay can you see me well okay uh and can you hear me well terrific and i'm supposed to go for like uh 15 minutes or so or 10 minutes and then leave time for questions let's aim for 10 minutes uh and leave for questions okay so 10 minutes okay so i'll start so hi i'm ellie ben sasson i am a co-founder and president at starkware and i want to tell you a little bit about a few of the methods for doing mev protection on layer two and of course i'll be speaking from the angle of uh starkwarse technology so i'll be focusing mostly on vidu which is a start based vdf in time lock uh so can we move to the next slide please okay so what is the problem the problem is that the l2 operators right now we're discussing uh mev protection on layer two so any operator that is operating on l2 receives uh transactions and just like on l1 just like with the miners uh this operator may extract value unfairly and in the same kind of from uh censoring transactions from inserting um the operator's own transactions and from modifying the true sequence of events um so those are the three problems right deletion insertion and uh reordering um can we move to the next slide please now how how can we solve this on layer two and i wanna say uh at the very first at the very beginning that that actually conventional uh methods in in certain cases may work very well okay but i i'm not to devote a lot of talk to that so what do i mean i mean in the conventional world like if you go to uh you know standard regulated exchanges uh they will have similar problems and the way they are uh their integrity is asserted and checked is by a combination of auditing reputation and legal incentives so if you assume that there is an ability to hold the operator accountable either by inclusive accountability meaning that the mempool is visible to everyone or by some delegated accountability where there's some you know legislator or regulator that can look at things then you can apply the conventional mechanisms right it's a repeated game people will leave if the reputation is damaged and of course there's the fear of legal actions and this applies to single operator uh in particular the the systems sorry the the customers that we are right now serving you know diversified dydx immutable x these are all single operators that they and starkware if we were to uh do shenanigans uh all of these things would apply to us so i know we're not and i trusted our counterparties or not um and it may apply to decentralized operators especially if the operator identity is public okay so if you have a small network of uh public entities you know reputable financial institutions or something then this may apply but let's talk so let's move to the next slide so let's talk about the more interesting case what kind of cryptographic uh primitives can we put to bear on this so we have uh commit reveal schemes uh that's the first kind you have vdfs and time locks that's going to be my focus you have trusted execution environments like intel's sgx and you have secure multi-party computation these are four different methods that i'm aware of that can be applied to solve the problem and especially in the case of decentralized operators so let's move to the next slide here's a brief comparison of how they you know a few parameters so um the first column you know is this a non-interactive uh setting because non-interactive is a little bit better um it's more complicated when you have interactive protocols you know parties can leave off and it makes things much more complicated and less secure so vdfs and trusted execution environments um are non-interactive whereas commit reveal schemes and secure npcs they are interactive and hence you know not as good uh you can ask which of these technologies is available you know today for use uh so all but secure npc um i would say are available secure npc you know theoretically we know how to do it there are some things out there that are like this but you don't have elements of this form in production today so if you're asking about vdfs and timelocks so starkware has a video service running right now everyone can use it and you know there are other such vdfs chia has a vdf there's a whole bunch of other things um transparency you know is there a trusted setup you need to trust anything so all of these uh protocols but for the trusting execution environment uh they are transparent or can be made transparent depending on what is the technology you're using for uh the secure npc or commit revealed uh time lock um and uh yeah i think the lack of transparency for the trusted execution environment makes it very uh problematic because you know i don't find it reasonable to assume that a lot of value will reside on trusted execution environments without keys being compromised and finally what kind of protection do you expect to get from these schemes so i think that the bottom to give you much better protection because you can have inputs fully encrypted and the operator will sort of operate on them without even knowing exactly what's going on whereas with the first two it's a bit uh you know the information is revealed at some point or can be revealed and and they are you know they give you some of the protection but not as good now if you look at these uh um so so i would argue that vdf time locks are kind of uh in the sweet spot as far as we know today because they are have all the v's and they're you know they don't have the three pluses they're not fully green but i think they're pretty good so they may be used let's go on to the next slide now when it comes to uh cryptographic time locks or vdfs there are two basic mechanisms that you can use them two modes you can use them in you can use the time lock where transactions are so you can ask users to submit their transactions uh using a cryptographic time block plus some you know expiration time to prevent uh opening of this so that's one up uh one mechanism right so now when the transactions are put in the mempool and are being sequenced um the operator doesn't really know what's going on and only after they've been sequenced are they opened the second option is to apply a vdf which means that the transactions are submitted in the open so the operator actually sees them the operator will sort them arbitrarily but now we'll fix the sequence in a block right we're talking about l2 so you can rely on l1 for your security so you basically commit to this order you apply a vdf to the block header and then you use the video randomness to resort and shuffle the transactions according to the permutation that was selected and then you process them okay so those are two basic options you can use with uh time locks and let's just do a brief comparison of them so let's move to the next slide so if you look at the time lock based approach it's slightly better in that it actually shields the information while it is being sequenced from the operator which means that the operator oh it precludes the operator from inserting or deleting certain things right because uh the operator doesn't know what's going on whereas in the vdf approach the operator can extract some value by deleting uh transactions inserting her own transactions and things like that so there's an advantage to the timelock based approach in this shielding but on the downside it requires k computations of delay functions because each one of these uh delay things needs to be opened and and i know that there are some really really cool vdfs which can be uh or time locks that can be opened with just one opening um but uh you know at least the ones that i'm aware of that are out there right now in production don't have this property um and then the challenge is that but the challenge with the time lock-based approach is that miners may demand to see the unlocked transactions by given to them by side channels and thereby sort of compromise the whole scheme so miner could say look if you want me to sequence your transaction even though it's time lock please show me the opening of it and usually it's it's going to be very easy to prove that a certain thing was opened in a certain way in all of these schemes okay the second approach is the vdf one oops uh sorry let's go one slide back the second approach is the vdf one and uh you need to compute only one delay per block but the operator can do some stuff and extract some value okay so let's move on to the very last slide of this presentation um so i want to say that you know vidu is going to appear on starknet so cairo will have support for vdfs and timelocks um by a dedicated built-in that will do this um and then it means that you can have you know when you're you know programmers of uh stark net smart contracts will be able to write all kinds of things like time lock based uh med protections you could have vdf based mvp protection so you could implement both of these two modalities that i spoke about previously using vidu as a built-in as part of your basically code base for cairo and of course there's going to be a lot more that you can do with it that is outside of mev you can do second price auctions which again can be some solution for uh uh or all kinds of sealed bid auctions you can have lotteries leader election you know proof of stake protocols and more and more all of these things will be programmable very efficiently on l2 um and and i hope that people will you know build applications um with this and i just want to say that as we're prioritizing the set of built-ins and things that will go into the cairo programming language would be really really cool to collaborate with teams that actually want to use this in production as soon as possible we have already deployed uh vidu as a service you know in production on on mainnet ethereum sadly no one's using it right now uh we'd love for people to come up and say they want to use the uh you know the version of it that will be part of cairo so please talk to us happy to answer any questions and thanks thank you ellie um any questions please post them in the chat okay no questions okay we have a comment from alex i am worried about the impact on markets like price lag between centralized exchanges and video enabled liquidity pools yeah so so i mean there's there's one variant that that i really like that could give you sort of the the best of both worlds it would look something like this so um you process in real time the orders um based on the current market conditions and you understand that um that that actually the sequencing may be such that some people win more or lose more based on the sequencing and maybe even the miners have been uh you know playing games here but the protocol then has a reconciliation period which means that you will take so after all these orders have been done the smart contract will take the sequence of orders randomly permute them according to a vdf and let's say two minutes or five minutes later we'll run this reconciliation protocol that will either transfer funds or leave some of the funds outside and you know renumerate randomly according to your order so what this would mean you know as a user i think you would get this would be like the sweet spot unless you're in the business of extracting value right because you could get immediately uh you know you wanna let's say uh access unit swap and and get something you'll get pretty much uh the final price but there'll be there's there'll be this random delta that you will you know learn of like five minutes later so if you bought a thousand dollars uh you know you got a thousand dollars worth of whatever token it is but maybe after five minutes it's gonna be you know either a thousand and ten dollars or it's going to be 990 dollars based on the random uh you know the randomness that comes out of video so i think this would be this would give you the immediacy of a centralized exchange and the uh fairness of uh of as if you applied to that's my preferred but it's more elaborate logic oh i see interesting it's kind of reminiscent of probabilistic payments where kind of yeah yeah an expectation you have the behavior that you want and it's fair but um in in real time on a discrete basis there could be quite a bit of variance yeah or here you get because uh the the downside of using a delay function is well the delay so what if you could have the immediacy of like acting immediately but you understand that the delay will be used for this fairness and reconciliation uh i think this would be so on layer one i think it will the gas cost would really kill it today but on layer two this can be easily done right um right right right um i mean maybe a potential other way to address delay with time locks is to have some sort of optimistic happy path where you you reveal the time lock ahead of time as in before it kind of expires and so in the happy case you have near zero delay but in the in in the worst case uh where things go wrong then things are ordered using cryptography so i thought there was a question so i see here that klaus from vega brought this up so klaus from vega if you want to work on this you know on layer two uh using cairo please you know dm us uh me uh let's get this thing uh rolling i think this is uh again on layer one it would be very gas costly but on layer two i think this would work uh marvelously well um this kind of thing and we can make it happen uh i saw there was another wouldn't veto incentivized spam tina is asking i'm not sure why why would the video incentivize spam oh like time locks or like if i i can time lock spam i guess um yeah so you could you know you could have a collateral that would be slashed or something if you do if you do that stuff i i confess that my preference is uh you know this immediacy plus a reconciliation later on it's also just one vdf and you get uh you know instant gratification and then near instant reconciliation i'd like to see okay i'm not sure are there any more questions because i think my time is up i don't think there's any more questions tina is there a break between part one and part two um so uh there's a panel uh that we skipped uh that we kind of went into uh discussion while waiting for um ellie so um we can bring that on or we can kind of skip to uh the uh part two and then have the panel towards the end so up to you guys i apologize i have to jump off to my family event but uh thanks so much for having me and i apologize for running a few minutes late uh no worries thanks for the presentation thank you for joining in bye guys thanks eddie bye i don't really have a preference i'm happy to start the second part i guess sure let's start the second part and then have a panel actually people in the chat are saying panel panel so let's do the panel all right so um we have three panelists vitalik phil and myself hello hello hi everyone um so i guess i was i was asked to prepare a couple questions for the panel um so maybe i'll just go through those quickly and then we can kick off the discussion so um you know the the topic is mev and scaling and i guess my first question is kind of qualitative and my second question is quantitative so the qualitative question is is optimal muv extraction in the context of scaling a centralization force right because we have these block proposers in order to do optimal mav extraction they need to be aware of all shards all blockchains all rollups so they basically need to be a super super node with lots and lots of computational power they potentially need a you know team of analysts a team of phds whatever and if you zoom out i i know how to kind of decentralize everything except this block proposing um and this is kind of one of the the last unknown so that's my first question second question is is quantitative and it's like what what will happen to the free market when we when we scale like for example one of the questions i'm interested in in the context of of ultrasound money is do base fees completely disappear right when we have lots and lots of scaling um or you know will there be some sort of dip but then it will go back up um or you know what are other considerations around scaling is it is it possible that maybe um because we have lots of scaling lots of shards there's going to be many many more fees and so this is even going to make the the centralization problem even worse um in the sense that not only do we have these these centralized actors but they're going to be incentivized to be super super large because of all the economic activity like if ethereum becomes like the you know the the financial hub for for the whole internet in the whole world um that's kind of scary um so anyone want to talk take question one or question two um i think uh question two is easy base fees are never going to zero because there is always demand for um use v all sorts of uses of the blockchain if prices go low enough like you know at some point someone in some minor is gonna spin up a service where the blockchains just get used as a store to back up people's cat pictures so like we don't know what that four is going to be but no it's there right um but do you expect we'll be in this in this deflationary mode um after for example sharding i would think on that if anything like the fees would be more they might be less individually but i think i think at least anecdotally we've seen every time capacity gets increased like there's a dip for a little while as right level of activity is now like too little but then like pretty quickly there's like a return to the mean uh at some point and like on net i think there's there's usually more profit for miners after each one of these cycles so i would at least personally expect the same thing to happen but it's hard to say i guess right right and this is definitely what we've experienced kind of historically um like the the total amount of fees just goes up up only um yeah as for the first question i think it is interesting and it's like super concerning i agree that mev is a centralization force i think there's a question of like how much of a centralization force it is and like how much of a advantage to centralizing is there going to be and like how much of that can we mitigate through either incentivizing like explicit decentralization or minimizing the centralization incentive uh like in the current form it's very strong of a centralization incentive i think um i think so for example like let's say without a network like flashbots which has like this searcher minor separation it's a huge centralization incentive because you have the miners that each have their own infrastructure and like unless you can reach the barrier to pay that engineering cost you won't be competitive and that's like what we were seeing with pools like ethermine kind of having their own mev infrastructure um i think adding in this more decentralized infrastructure where anyone can participate in either receiving profit or sending bundles is like a step towards making it more decentralized if that infrastructure is decentralized which today it's pretty much not uh but let's say it is right then it's that's a little bit more decentralized but there's still i think somewhat of an advantage from participating at more layers of the stack like as much as we try to flatten this reward function into being linear on the validation power where like with 20 you have 20 profit there still probably will be some economy of scale to size related around like your ability to build network infrastructure or have business partnerships with entities or whatever it might be like i still expect that curve to be a little bit above the linear curve like i expect size to continue being an advantage so i think the only thing we can do is like try to squash that down as much as possible uh but i still see it as being there and being a huge issue but yeah i'd be curious to hear what vitalik thinks of this also yeah and i guess i've i generally view these um mev efforts as being about like if centralization has to exist like concentrating it in a particular type of actor so that all the other types of actors can still be basically just like plug into that and continue to have economies of scale that are as so linear as uh as they were before i mean it's obviously an open question uh the extents to which that will succeed and then the other open question is if like even if centralization at some particular layer happens like to what extent does that turn into a risk for like actual underlying goals so like censorship resistance for example right like if there is say like one um you know like professional trading company of some kind that starts producing 80 of all uh uh block orderings then [Music] what like does that go like what practical ability would that company have to like say stop stop me from sending my transactions um on to the ethereum watching if they if if it decides that my turns out uh that like it doesn't want those transactions included for whatever reason like would i still be able to get my transactions included by paying an extra fee and then the the extra fees of everyone who gets this pool it will kind of add up to be enough to uh over uh to let some other um aggregator get more uh get more reward will there be some alternative mechanism where i'll be able to get included with a one swat delay will there be something else i don't know so so here's a related question is like how do we what are the goals of ethereum like with regards to decentralization i know this is a very broad question but i'm sure you've thought about it because like to take that that previous line of thinking to the logical extreme like there's like eos and algorand on the other end and like clearly we as a community want to be more decentralized than that but like how do we set a target and like benchmark progress towards that and like design for that goal or how how do we even start to think about quantifying that or or promoting it um yeah i think like one thing that we definitely needs to get better at is like actually kind of expressing our thinking about the ultimate goals behind decentralization right so like you know are we concerned about els because um you know they don't do the the right rituals and pray to the right gods or are we concerned about like eos for very practical reasons and my concern about the centralized platforms is definitely for very practical reasons right like if you take either els or even one of the uh recent els like platforms that have managed to get themselves into a position of higher respectability than els like the question is if the elites of that community get together and decide to force through with some protocol change that the community finds unacceptable so you know this could be some kind of censorship this could be like forking in some kind of issue and stuff to like say themselves and claiming that they deserve it because they're the core developers like something um you know would be like preferential treatment for like kyc participants or like something you know whatever right would they be able to do this even if the community was just like really strongly opposes this and in these centralized platforms i think the answer is yes right because there isn't a culture of running validating nodes and there isn't a culture of that many people running nodes at all and so you know if the elites get together they can schedule a hard fork and they can even schedule like six hours in advance and then even by the then six hours later um the users by defaults detect nothing and then maybe 12 hours later users start detecting things and by then like the hard forks already happened and the users don't really have a way of uh like quickly making a user-activated soft fork the users don't really have a a good way of coordinating a rebellion and so like they've just basically successfully pushed it through and like what are you gonna do are you gonna revert like billions of dollars of economic activity in the last six hours and uh try to coordinate all of the um black explorers and pools that did that disagree before there's even more activity like you can't right whereas on bitcoin or ethereum like that that sort of thing would very easily fail right because like first of all the number of elites you have to coordinate as larger you know you have more client developers more core developers second there's all these users running nodes and there's all these users that are actually verifying everything and those users would have to be convinced to download the software it would definitely take longer than six hours just because of sheer numbers and so like your ability to pull off that kind of like forced protocol rule change in ethereum or bitcoin is significantly lower right so the question i guess would or the one way of looking at the problem would be like would a single dominant mev extractor like change this calculus and like make it easier to pull off this kind of social attack now like clearly they would the mev extractor would not be able to force through transactions that are invalid but you know they would be able to censor right and so like the practical question is just like you know like exactly how much ability to censor what they actually have and like you know what is that something that like users would be able to find some way around quickly enough so i guess what i'm hearing is that the the fundamental role of decentralization uh in in your view at least in this perspective is to to maintain this power balance between the privileged actors in the system and everyone else such that everyone else can check the power of these actors and and stop them from pushing through unpopular changes unilaterally right i mean i think that's a definitely like one a way of describing a large part of what the the value of decentralization is there to do probably not a hundred percent um i think like there's other reasons don't like to say um and wants decentralization too but it's definitely a significant piece one of the the things that we've tried to do in the design of v2 is minimize the power of these privileged actors as much as we can um and i guess maybe one way to to tackle mev is to basically constrain the blog proposals as much as we can and i'm just thinking out loud here but maybe there's an opportunity to somehow constrain the the strategies that they have for block creation so they they have to commit ahead of time saying this is going to be my search algorithm um and i'm going to adhere to it and if i don't adhere to it i i i can't create block so i will get you know penalized um and then maybe there could be some sort of yearn style you know open sourcing of strategies so anyone can submit strategies um these strategies kind of get run maybe in a dis distributed fashion and then the most like the the winning strategies um a portion of the the income goes to those who wrote the strategies um so and then maybe there could be some sort of social pressure to push for at least the the centralized entities like the the pools to to adhere to basically at constraining themselves artificially in the context of block production so i think i think like that broad marketplace is kind of what flashbots is trying to build in a way but i think there is still like a lot of the variability in a lot of the power of these entities comes also from their infrastructure so like uh the network infrastructure like how do you police whether they heard a message or not or whose message they heard first i still think that is like kind of the fundamental source of like why they need to provide this input into the system uh and i guess there's a question there of like how much of this p2p networking attribution side is like do does eth kind of view as core infrastructure versus like uh you know kind of designed to be changed and customized um and and if so what are the desired properties of that layer right so i guess you know it's kind of the classic separation of data availability and execution i mean we can completely remove the uh the unfairness in execution but there would be you know potential unfairness in the data availability um and i guess one thing we could potentially do is look at these off-chain data availability committees and that that might be a way to go from purely centralized as in this one single actor to some sort of committee which might be more acceptable more palatable long term yeah so i think basically that's the chain link fare sequencing protocol is trying to bootstrap that from a committee i guess the question is just like what inherent trade-offs are there and like where does it fall in the l1 l2 dap responsibility funnel distinction like because because obviously as you go down that the design needs to be more general and work for a broader class of people like l1 needs to be the trade-off space that's most optimal for a huge number of people and then like l2 can be more specialized and the dap can be like super specialized so where where do we fit that in i guess is a good open question uh do you think l1 is the best place i'd say definitely not l1 and the reason is in order to do that data availability and sequencing you need to have a really good internet connection because you're you know you're basically connected to all these mempools and whatnot so it would have to be semi-centralized but i guess the good news is at the very least we can get this federated security um so there's kind of a lower bound on the on the security we could get because when we when we you know select a committee at random at layer one we're assuming that these are raspberry pi's running on the home connection um so they can't really do like the high panel with data availability yeah interesting so there there is going to be like a natural specialization vector there i guess and as as you said it comes from both the data availability issue and i think also the like network asynchrony aspect of like we want people all over the world to participate and you know we need this this network asynchrony is like a fundamental part of how we're going to coordinate them so yeah right okay so if we have a bit of time not sure we do tina interrupt me if we don't but like my my last question i guess is kind of a meta question is what are things we you're most worried about like what are maybe some of the known unknowns or maybe unknowns unknowns for which you have some intuitions what are these scaling things that you're worried about in the context of mmv i i would love vitalik to take this one first because i think um and i think i think this i got like cross-chain mev extraction issue that you mentioned is definitely one of them um yeah um aside from that like like we'll just like will demand for low block times leads to centralization issues like pretty much no matter how we satisfy that demand even if we satisfy it um with uh fancy layer 2 schemes um and then also there's just like issue centralization risks on the like staking liquidity side like basically what i'm speaking in ways that open up centralization vectors just like have fundamentally better capital efficiency properties by enough to encourage people to make stake in pools that are i guess custom well i i want to say like custodial but like the reality is there is going to be a spectrum and like the question is like where on the spectrum will um would they be like would they what would it be most capital efficient to stake in polls where basically the custody properties of that if become um such that they open up opportunities for attackers to like grab up and attack and uh control a large portion of the state power but that's like less of an mev issue and more of a d5 capital efficiency issue and what go ahead phil no good now i mean one one thing that just came to mind is the question whether mev is objective or subjective um in the sense that like we're kind of assuming that mev is an objective thing and we can minimize it and but actually maybe like there's some privileged actor not in the blockchain world but in the real world so let's imagine that you're a government you know your privilege acted there and so you can do things that others can't do and um maybe we're gonna have like perfect equality on the blockchain but because these other actors have privileges we're gonna have this um subjectivity of maybe like one transaction might be worth zero to most people but to you know a government it could be worth a ton of money yeah i think that's super interesting like thinking about the full space of manipulation people will do because you see it in the financial markets where like people will use some weird obscure power they have and like also do some trade like over there and like these two things line up really nicely for them and they make a bunch of money and like something happens and people don't know so yeah i expect there's going to be a lot of shenanigans um in terms of things i'm most worried about i think it's the same as it's always been with mev which is that like goldman sachs starts the mev division and like they're just fantastically good at it and like uh everyone buys the license to like have goldman sachs tell them what order to mine transactions in uh because that's the best way and there's like not a network there it's just like very top-down uh you know so basically eth turning into robin hood in an order flow sense uh that's that's kind of what i worry about uh and also how this interacts with like large exchanges in pos like you know binance and coinbase and and how that also plays with the the correlated slashing uh and the correlated failure incentives like are those incentives kind of enough to prevent centralization is the meme enough of their existence like will they kick in at the right time and kind of have the right effects i think those are all open questions i have on scaling okay fantastic um tina uh how are we doing on time we are just in time so uh perfect timing for carl to uh switch on and talk about neva or rap about viva i am very excited to see carl make through his presentation in time i will make a beeping sound if you cannot go through 169 pages in 15 minutes feel free to share a screen you don't think i can do it wow wow okay let's go you're right it's i i'm not gonna lie i will have a timer as well so that we can see anyway why hello everybody i am carl and today we are going to talk about miva mev auctions um also sequencer auctions also just like generally what is this you know what is mev like what you know what can we do with it and uh uh why is this extremely exciting in my opinion for just like literally the entire internet in the way that we work and communicate together because more things are complete communication problems than than you might imagine so anyway first why is this such an exciting topic i think that the reason why this is such an exciting topic is because i love open source and blockchains we'll talk about how this works but blockchains give a business model to open source this is my claim and i think that this is actually pretty accurate and pretty it's pretty pretty revolutionary and in fact blockchains give a business model to public goods in general right the ability for us to build things that don't necessarily aren't necessarily extractive but instead get used and when they are used maybe you are rewarded in some way that doesn't incentivize you to like you know hoard and whatnot you know like it's this beautiful future that we can potentially have and i really do believe that it is possible so you know i've been working in this crypto space for a while and guess what i'm you know working on all these various projects they're all open source and they're all public goods and so there is this fundamental thing where it's like okay it's amazing to be able to work on this technology give it out for free etc etc but how like how how is this actually being funded like i'm not gonna lie like you know i got paid for all of all of my work i'm not just like doing it out of the goodness of my heart alone right and i would say that a large portion of where this came from it's just the fact that eath itself got bigger and bigger and the network effect grew and grew and the price grew and grew and then people started reinvesting and it got bigger and bigger and just showered eath on everybody right and that's like like legitimately how all of these open source projects have been funded in you know to to some extent and so yeah you know blockchains gave a business model to to public goods these public goods that are that i was working on um and that many of us have been working on so it's it you know but it's like is that really the business model like we patronage uh essentially from you know or reinvestment into in into it's not it's not terrible i'm not going to say that it's like a bad thing but it kind of it doesn't feel as sustainable long-term and so here's why it doesn't feel super sustainable because users right they they have they have a bunch of you know ethan and you know crypto and they use dapps and then those daps essentially pay minors because you end up spending a transaction fee you end up getting you know arbitrage profit taken from you whatever it is and so and then developers make these steps and they're just kind of like oh okay well you know i'm just going to deploy my smart contract now it exists and now guess who's guess who's getting paid for it it's not the developer it's the miners right and so this is like a kind of like wacky scenario um and it doesn't seem doesn't seem particularly sustainable and i'm not saying that developers need to you know make all of this all of this cash but this is you know this is an issue anyway so the miners are making minor extractable value um and just imagine just imagine for one moment imagine all the um imagine that the miners had to actually pay the developers right that i mean that that would be pretty that would be pretty sweet and maybe what if miners literally paid everyone what if we could all like use the blockchain and guess what the blockchain pays us back that just seems like such a nice like a kind of weird like circular mindset and circular you know strategy that just seems like a great basis for an economy you know like every good economy is circular um anyway so you know this is an amazing future we'll and then we can all join in universal consciousness um as we're paying ourselves and being good okay okay i'll take i'll take a step back but anyway let's let's let's get into some mean potatoes um and you know talk about minor extractable values so what exactly is mev i just i mean i i think that when i think that this concept is probably a lot more you know normalized now thankfully um but uh i will still define it i think it's useful basically it's the revenue from being a miner so it includes block rewards it includes transaction fees includes front running includes slow market arbitrage there's probably a better word for that as well but we often think of it as just like just front running because that's the thing that gets like a lot of attention but really it's it's all of the above it's literally what can be extracted from running a minor right um and you know shout out to phil dime for uh you know introducing um and so there is another form of mev and that is just the minor extractable value that you can make from 51 attacking network being bad all that kind of stuff you don't want to don't don't be bad okay and so we make this assumption in blockchains that the mev for being honest the basically the the uh you know economic reward for being honest exceeds the economic reward for being malicious right so the miner is making money what is keeping the miner from doing anything bad well it's because it's making more money being good then it makes being bad and that's great but what happens what happens if the mev honest is actually way bigger than the mev malicious right like you know i mean and honest is a spectrum right like if you're front-running everybody is that really honest it's kind of like quasi-honest it's not necessarily you know great it's not pro social pro us pro community it's more just like pro you so like what what this big big mev honest is not necessarily a good status quo why like we should just taper that down a little bit and give back to us give back to the community and so when mev malicious is low especially especially especially you know proportionally to the mev honest and and and casper and you know consensus protocols that are a little bit more you know have better security properties can actually achieve this then we can extract that excess mev extract that minor extractable value so that seems pretty fun so now i'm going to talk about miva so miva notably there are there's kind of like it's a little bit of an ambiguous term at this point so i i'll try to make the distinction pretty clear um and we can uh we can yeah i'll go into it but anyway so these are the sources of mev and we're not going to talk about extracting the block rewards we'll just talk about extracting the transaction fees front running slow market arbitrage and by the way i i'm a big fan of the you know the previous talk where we can actually eliminate much of front running just by using some you know commit reveal slash timelock crypto which i'm very excited for but anyway um here we are these things we can extract and that's a solid that's a that's a solid chunk of change you know okay so first gas auctions you know we currently have you know priority gas auctions flash bodies work flashbots is working on much more sophisticated kinds of auctions here and they those are by the way called neva miva as well so i'm sorry it's a little bit of a confusing uh term because there's a lot of auctions all over the place and they're auctions for mvv all the time so anyway um you know users or arbitr arbitrage bots or whomever are submitting transactions to the miner the miner is about to create a new block sorry i got to give a little bit more context here the miner is creating new block figuring out which transactions go in it and so how are they going to do this well they're going to hold an auction and that auction you will have the participants be either the users arbitrage bots flashbots you know etc and they will send these transactions which express some you know desired you know uh inputs to be included in this block and it'll you know propose this modification and it can be conditional it can be arbitrarily complicated it's very you know it can be very interesting and at a sit at a very simple level the miner is going to choose the the transactions that provide the most value to the miner right pay the highest gas price pay the highest fee and so that is the transaction that is going to be mined and that is the ordering of the transactions that will be mined et cetera and the miner will make that gas times the gas price and so the mev plus equals transaction fee right we we just got we just got some some money from including transactions so that's an mev auction and that is that is uh one sense of the term and so i think i'm going to start disintegrating these terms a little bit and just call the next one a sequencer auction and that's what i'm going to be that's what i'm talking about when i say like you know extract the mev you know let's talk about a sequencer auction so the source is about mev right we just got transaction fees but now notably this is you know the week this also works for arbitrage right you know if there's a free arbitrage opportunity everyone's going to be wanting to take take advantage of it they'll all be bidding and they'll bid up to essentially how much money there is to be made and so this is just to to like given give a feeling for how the miner actually makes the arbitrage opportunities in some kind of like perfect uh perfectly competitive markets uh market situation now mev plus equals the arbitrage opportunity on the chain that's pretty crazy and you know there i i included this a little flashbots 2.0 diagram of of these gas gas price auctions because you know they bit each other up up until you know pretty close to the value that they're gonna make anyway so those cover all all of the other you know sort of forms of mev and now let's talk about sequencer auction so minor another word for minor where i'm i won't the part of what a minor does is it sequences the transactions in a block and so that sequencing is the thing that we're going to like focus on and so i'll instead talk right they you know they order these transactions and so i'm going to actually just call it a sequencer call the miners a sequencer you know sometimes i forget i have animations that describe what i'm saying so then i have to play them back anyway okay so this is that that auction that we just had right users paying transaction fees you know extracting mev for the uh or is i'm sending me feed essentially transferring mev to the the uh sequencer so what if we had an auction for being the sequencer itself so let's call hold an auction and let's say okay if you want to be a sequencer and you want to make this juicy juicy profit why don't you bid for that right that privilege well we can expect that the bids will be the expected mev you know gained minus the operational costs of being a sequencer and guess where that money can go you know first he was going to the sequencer where's his money going to it's going to facebook we're going to send all the money to facebook and google and amazon now i'm just kidding imagine a future imagine a future where we send it to ethereum send it to us send it to the community send it to not just you know the ethereum community everybody why right like you know if everyone's gonna be using this blockchain it better be good for all of us build public goods so you know one thing that i'll just like point out although i don't have that much time so i'll just you know mention it one thing that we need to do for this to work is we need to have really good open source software that commoditizes being a sequencer right we want to make it so easy to extract the you know mev in the way that we want it to be extracted so essentially right we may not want any front running to be possible we may want to you know require that all transactions are uh you know encrypted and with uh uh commit reveal schemes and whatnot like that is something that we definitely want to do but we need to commoditize being a sequencer for this mev extraction to actually work and to be you know uh uh something that doesn't get itself captured and then you know okay i don't remember what that that evie greater than okay what's with this optimism so that's what i'm i'm working on right we're building optimistic roll up the ovm optimistic ethereum we are scaling ethereum i forgot to give that context in the beginning is very important it's a very important project so um anyway miva's whoops sorry about that that can be implemented on top of optimistic roll-up and we got a charter to enshrine public access to public goods so that's that's pretty great and mivos can fund public goods in fact they should fund public goods and maybe they must fund public goods because like we're not gonna like who is going to accept a future where blockchains aren't giving back to ourselves so anyway currently we're sad let's make ourselves happy you know this might be sequencer auction we can call it sequencer auction anyway and then we'll fund tons of awesome public goods give a business model to public goods we're going to fund public goods blockchains will fund them in fact we will fund public goods in fact we will give back to ourselves all right this is what this is fundamentally about you know value is subjective all this stuff is subjective we're all just kind of like slurping around in a soup we need a good you know non-uh extractive system we want a little circle we want that circular circular logic that's what i'm all about just kidding um great look at these look at these rich people although i guess it's right here pretty centralized you know we gotta gotta spread the money around a little bit more in my next image anyway that's public goods funding i don't know how to distribute the gift for the funds you know we've got bitcoin grants and whatnot but you know i believe we can do it love no no love no snowboarders and you know thank y'all that's optimism check out optimism check out optimistic ethereum check out uh you know even shout out to all these folks that's me am i i think i hit it i think i hit the 15 minutes i'm 11 seconds over let's go yay congratulations good job do we have any questions for carl no questions from eve tv chat but awesome presentation um i guess i have one maybe questions if there's no question um so i guess one option for redistribution is is burn right and that's like the simple equal redistribution to everyone like what is your intuition in terms of um how inefficient the burn is like if we were to you know focus the money on specific projects could what is how much more can we get how much more bang for the buck could we get um great question so i think intuitively that there is value in having some sort of redistribution mechanism that is a little bit more complicated my the reason why i think this is the case is because we do currently redistribute you know a lot a lot of value based on you know i work on some project i'm like you know convince some venture capitalists to like pay me some money and then i go out and i build my thing and then it makes everyone a bunch of money that's like a very sophisticated like money redistribution system and i think that it gets you know it gets even more complicated you introduce taxes you introduce government subsidies you you know all of these things i think that it is uh just kind of the nature of the problem of like collective value and collective you know value distribution it's essentially like a preference function on like what what we as a you know human civilization like want and so i just think that that preference function is gonna be quite complicated and i'm not sure if there's like one distribution system to like rule them all or if we can just do like okay this is a really simple one let's just like focus on that only and it's one of many so here's my kind of uh counter argument um for the burn basically just a simple burn um and like the first one is you kind of mentioned that there's like if you don't burn then you have all sorts of questions around credible neutrality right so burn can gives you credible neutrality i guess the other thing is that the burn you know is part of the ultrasound money feces you know i keep shutting the ultrasound on your thesis but you know there is a possibility that uh ifa will become you know in the same way that ethereum could become the the internet of money if could become the money of the internet um you know with tons of of monetary premium and if we if we focus on this one thing the burn um then i think we have a higher chance of eve becoming kind of this this ultrasound money um and and the fact that eve becomes ultrasound money gives us all sorts of of you know rippling effects you know it means you're more security for for ethereum it means more economic bandwidth it means all of these other good things so i think the trade-offs need to be carefully weighted as to whether we want to be you know very ad hoc or just be credibly neutral and reinforce the um the the burn yeah don't get me wrong i'm feeling the burn too i'm feeling the burn but it's really just an argument that you know there are probably multiple ways to uh skin a horse i'm not sure if that's a that's not uh but uh there are multiple ways to go about it and i think that you know we should have we should do we should we definitely need to burn and we probably are going to want to be doing other things and in fact my thought is the most the most uh exciting mechanisms are the mechanisms that have sub-mechanisms and sub-mechanisms like composable things that incentivize really good behavior so if you said like okay the if you say like this mechanism let's say it's the burn let's say something else has this consequence of you know funding innovation giving back to uh you know people who need it just like generally like rising all bringing everyone up then that is like that and and those sub mechanisms are all dependent on like you do this burn and then you like kind of like have this ripple effect of all these other things happening that's what i'm interested in so like if you know for me to feel the most burn that's what i would that's that's where i really just would love to see it's like okay yeah you know that's how you do the burn and then the whole world's burning i don't know in a good way in a good way excellent thank you carl um we don't have any more questions um so i guess we could move on to the next talk um tina do you want to introduce the next speaker yes um next will be georgios is going on can you hear me yeah we can hear you okay wait and now you can probably also see my screen um cool is the screen on too yes okay fantastic so thank you all for coming thank you carl for the very energetic presentation as usual my presentation is going to be a lot more vanilla and we'll make a lot of assumptions about what the audience already knows because we've already heard a lot so skipping through i'm georgios i work at paradigm venture capital firm and i'm a research partner here so let's talk about mv and before we talk about mev in layer 2 maybe it's worth kind of understanding what the questions we should ask when talking about mvr and the firstly let's preface this by saying that i don't think that we can remove remove it fully but we can minimize it and there's various layers of the system which we can touch on towards minimizing the mov one of that is on the protocol layer on the very base layer there's a lot of parameters there is how block producers are chosen because maybe the block producers as we saw earlier in the discussion are random but maybe they're predictable and if they're predictable what are the implications of that um for mbv maybe if many blockbuster users are predictable maybe it's more likely that they collude and that they end up maybe doing multi-block mv extractions like time-banded attacks it's also another good question to ask is are transactions in the clear so are transactions submitted to the sequencer encrypted or are they submitted um clear text if there is if they're encrypted um what is the mechanism to decrypt them and so on with respect to ordering who owns the ordering is it always a sequencer or the block reducer or the miner that owns the ordering operation or is there some consensus and forced operation which randomizes transaction ordering this is also very important um what about finality does the protocol have finality how long is that finality finality is a big factor when you're thinking about time-banded attacks again in the multi-block mv extraction scenario separately from that on the network layer there is a question to ask around byzantine fault tolerant proof of stake versus the proof of stake that we have in ethereum for example in tendermint um the mav cannot there's no notion of time-banded attacks because once a block is mined once a block is validated there's no way to roll it back but perhaps the mvv extraction happens at the network layer during when the gossip protocol plays itself out and validators try to decide which transactions they should mine on the network layer also because i didn't add it because we've talked about it a lot and after all we're in flashbots mev rose there's flashbots also which allows you to basically instead of having the main communication channel you try to introduce another one such as the flashbots kind of like second mempool and that allows you to introduce new rules on the network layer there finally on the application layer there's things which you should consider around mev such as you know thing thinking about it from first principles mvv is exposed when anybody can when there is like race on the application layer it gets exposed when there's races towards touching the same piece of state for example when there's um let's say an order on uni-swap and they both touch the same the all orders that's the same reserve variables so something that could improve things or for example in liquidation so something that could improve things would be that maybe you try to introduce some ordering on the actors that try to go after an mev opportunity and an example of that would be keeper dao's k compound protocol where instead of allowing anybody to liquidate you know they just allow certain parties to execute liquidations based on the dow elected liquidators similar similarly done by um by b protocol again on liquidations so like the giant notions that you try to remove this sort of um anybody can liquidate anybody can herb and try to introduce different structures in the way that actors interact with the system so now that we have kind of a basic questions on how we should be approaching the problem it's worth maybe looking at it from the angle of layer twos so just to say the very basic things the layer twos like since the dawn of layer twos with the scientist papers what they were saying is that they let us experiment without fear of the layer one like weird things happening to layer one so we can start introducing crazy features on the layer two while being relatively conservative on the layer one but the kind of layer twos that we have right now which are mostly rollups whether it's the optimistic or the city variants more or less the mental model should be that it's just another layer one again with respect to mev and the previous questions and that it just has some additional mechanism which allows it to inherit ethereum security beyond that there is nothing too specific to the layer 2. and something to note is that when whenever the layer 2 is more programmatic for example fuel is a mod is a slightly more restricted computationally roll-up compared to let's say star or z casing or optimism and arbitron kind of uh if you think about it in a spectrum and so more programmability always will mean more mvv so that's how you it should be thought about on the m layer two layer and then something which was also mentioned earlier earlier is that when mev gets extracted on layer two that means it does not get extracted on layer one so in a sense we're not really removing mev by introducing layer two systems rather we're just moving it from one place to another and we introduce certain rules there and those rules may either be you know mempool things the block producer election the things that carl just talked to us about or transactional randomization or who knows what else and kind of zooming in on that i'm on the mvv auction i have like slightly more opinions and carl carl and i may disagree on this that in a way the mvv auction forces everything to be on the sequencer and the rational sequencer probably would want to extract as much mvv as they want or as they can and it remains to be seen if kind of operating this benevolent sequencer model is good enough there's another approach that we've seen by arbitrom which says that instead of kind of having like one sequencer that decides on the ordering you introduce a bft protocol on top and you have all the parties in that bft protocol agree on the transaction ordering again that maybe works maybe doesn't for reason's field for reasons that phil has talked about in his blog post and in his talk and that is because how do you elect these people what happens does this still then does that move again the mvv from the actual consensus layer to the networking layer before when the parties are trying to figure out who should what transaction ordering should be followed so you know the takeaway basically is that there's no free lunch in any kind of mitigation that you introduce and other approaches of course are classic cryptography based techniques for kind of separating execution from ordering which only alluded to some of them with and we've had these discussions in the past in the previous rounds something to note about uh mev and the optimistic roll up is specifically there's a statement which goes like because miners can certainly fraud proof for zero cost and by censoring a fraud proof um they can get paid counterfactually after fraud has has been executed um you can say that all the funds in the optimistic roller could be considered mev because well the sequencer could go loot with the miners or the miners could be a sequencer and they would make an invalid state transition and you know everything would be censored for the entire dispute period so if you're thinking about this completely in a vacuum you know you're just changing sequencer miners that's it sure i'll take it but in crypto there's lots of complex interactions and we will see why this attack kind of collapses and the reason is quite simple we should think about it from two cases one where miners just do a 51 coordination and they orphan any blocks uh which include the fraud proof so this would be a chain split scenario where some miners decide to to create them to accept the fraud proof some others don't and effectively you have two ethereums this ain't going to happen miners are long if any kind of attack on ethereum in that way directly destroys destroys their investment so that aside there's also another approach which would be that you know maybe all the miners somehow get convinced to put their hashtag and say this transaction is bad we should ignore it um or this transaction would rather we got bribed by this party to censor this transaction so i don't have a formal proof for that or you know some kind of intuitive game theoretic argument but i don't i don't see po and i don't see this possible as possible at all it destroys ethereum's base settlement assurances and it seemed like a complete non-starter to me so there's a co there's a very like small nuance here that you know we just talked about transactions which would be good but get censored by miners but what about transactions which are let's say bad for example somebody doing let's say money laundering on optimism and they want to withdraw these funds so should miners accept a transaction that um that allows the money laundered and money laundered to exit their funds um and on that i have no opinion ideally if the base layer is properly um distributed this should never occur like the protocol behavior that is not able to distinguish here but who knows what will happen right like our understanding of blockchains evolves a lot over time and just to kind of hint at things because i know that we have a talk in the next movie roast about cross chain mev but just to kind of drive the point home it's not just that the simplest systems and the most complex systems have values degrees of mev um and of course with systems with values uh with variant kind of degrees of composability or interoperability but anytime any of these systems tries to talk with each other it exposes mvv and anytime a message is related from one place to another there is a party that does this relaying the e-layer you know you call it whatever you want and this re-layer will have the ability to insert their own transactions delay inclusion of your message maybe reorder the transactions and so on so the question i post to the audience is like as the as blockchain start to become more complex and the interactions between them go up will we be able to keep up with this complexity of mva extraction and what how will our tools evolve on all this and that was it thank you very much and i'm happy to answer any questions if any thank you georgios great talk any questions again great presentation no questions from eve tv chat um oh alex has a question um yeah but justin if you want to ask yours first if you have any i always have one question in my back pocket just in case no one has questions i um i'm happy to go after you um alex go ahead all right um so i'm still wrapping my head around layer two so thank you georges that was a great presentation so i have a question related to layer two submitting the roll-up batches that were with transactions within that layer two already sequenced within that roller batch to the data availability layer so ethereum or to a shard in ethereum and if someone is doing cross layer 2 arbitrage would they would they be concerned about which role of batch is is processed first by the data availability layer or does that not matter at all in the in the sense where you're you care about the sequencing of which batch is submitted first between two different layer twos does that make sense at all to you or um am i am i missing missing something here so you're saying that there's two layer twos two sequencers two data availability layers each one of the sequencers submit um the data availability batch to their own system and i am a party doing cross-chain arbitrage and the question so it's nearly that it's uh two sequences two layer twos but the same data availability layer right so it doesn't matter i mean maybe it does matter depending on the the protocol implementation but it shouldn't matter like from a client-side perspective all you need to know is that like the the data has been published somewhere so for you like as the dex trader or whatever medium small size um it doesn't matter like what matters that you have like the guarantee that the data is there um yeah so from the perspective of um of the individual protocol i don't think that you need to care much about how what happens on the remote uh layer okay cool thank you there's a question from the from the chat about do you think infuria alchemy etc are going to start extracting mev soon so firstly infure and alchemy are not miners or validators to the best of my knowledge they are just node providers so they don't have any specific roles in the system or the ability to reorder transactions in whatever way whether they would do there's maybe like a dark scenario in which you know if you're just start censoring transactions or start copy copy copying traders that use it um that's one possibility but in reality all the kind of legit traders they use their own nodes and they have you know like proper peering with peers that are well peered and so on so no definitely not okay so it looks like we have two more questions question from youtube do zero noise proofs affect mev extractability at all if you bought the argument that i made earlier that the optimistic rollup is not affected by the attack that i mentioned from miners then in practice i don't think that player two and zero knowledge has kind of like any added benefit over optimistic class um plus mv so i don't think so i don't think that zero knowledge groups affect anybody unless you know unless of course you mean that you introduce your knowledge proof to maybe do the secret leader election or to do some things in the vdf and so on okay fantastic and i think we have just one minute um and also i asked my question which is it seems that paradigm is going big on move like hiring a team internally that specializes in that but also investing heavily in the broad muv ecosystem can you talk about you know the investment thesis around hiring all the mev giga brains i don't know about like us hiring any of the mv giga brains we're very excited to be working with flashbots of course um i think that mev is like an important trend um that we've we identified early on both like charlie and i were like looking at this from a while back so i think that mev is like one of the most important topics for ethereum's future and of course we care a lot about ethereum so um so it's it seems very reasonable to me that we'd care about mev and try to be close to it i see so it's kind of like a defensive investment kind of a hedge um you know you have all this if you want to defend it because you know the muv is kind of a systemic risk i don't think it's necessarily a stemic risk or well maybe the nice way to put it is that we want to try or like i would want it to be a force that makes us improve our systems and make them more stable so it's uh you can call it defensive but maybe there's like a positive angle to it that's all i'm saying okay fantastic i think we're up on time and we have um our panel next with uh i think georgia is still on panel barry and stanny and david i believe everyone is here and georgios actually prepared extensively a set of questions so props to that as well as uh david from uh tech from synthetics also prepared some notes um that we shared in the agenda uh as well with some highlights uh on their consideration with l2 implementation so all of this can be uh can be uh found uh in the agenda so georgios go ahead yep so again okay i'll see you again um it would be nice to get a quick intro from our panelists uh starting with barry maybe is buying around yeah hey joining us i'm here uh yeah so i'm barry i did a lot of work on l2 stuff and i have done some work on the miva stuff the minor acceptable value auctions so i'm excited to chat with the kind of more deaf i focus people and get their opinions on that nice stanley hi everyone i'm stannie kuleshov i'm the founder of of our protocol which is a interest rate market on on ethereum l1 and now in matic as well uh i've been building financial decentralized financial applications for few years now and starting with uh it len uh back a few years ago uh mainly i'm pretty much in involved in the in the products uh side and also building incentive models and uh also kind of like helping on the risk assessment cycle and creating the of a risk framework and yeah that's about it nice thank you and david hey everyone i'm david uh so i joined synthetics as a core contributor earlier this year um i first got involved with uh their project going back to 2018 uh when they were called haven so they since rebranded i used to i was the founder of a smart contract auditing company called blocktrax and then after that i ended up working on a a database company so it wasn't necessarily in crypto um and then uh very excited to be back in d5 so i'm looking forward to going over kind of uh we're building a lot on optimism on l2 so very excited to share with some of the learnings challenges and and stuff we're really excited about as we move forward i thank you very much so kind of to kick start the discussion it would be nice to hear from stanley and david like some things about what kinds of mev do major d5 platforms exposed today i imagine that both avi and synthetics have something to say on it maybe starting with stanley yeah sure well two kind of occasions i would say uh usually uh in location of liquidations for example so uh obviously protocol has uh uh we have a collateralization system so when you deposit into the protocol uh then you can borrow value out of the protocol against your plateau and and to keep that collateral position uh you might need to refill depending how the market moves so if it's moved substantially the the market decreases you might have to refill the collateral or it might get liquidated and how the liquidation network works uh in other protocol and and pretty much across the whole dfi ecosystem is that uh there's certain type of incentives available for the uh liquidators so whoever actually takes that position and replaces the collateral with the borrowed funds uh will also get a margin uh for that particular uh transaction now what's interesting here is that uh the the liquidators that are uh in in all they are also liquidating other positions in in other protocols as well and and depending on the incentives and because it's an open network everyone is kind of like a finding on getting that particular incentive model and and because these uh some of the assets are uh very volatile in the sense as crypto native as by itself uh what happens is that the incentives are quite uh wide in their uh spread for example and we have a fixed incentive system to kind of ensure that uh when the market decreases substantially uh we have enough liquidators coming and actually fighting to get that uh jersey uh incentive and and this is kind of like an interesting part because many of the uh liquidations actually happens with flash loans which practically means that you might not need upfront capital uh to to do certain type of uh liquidation but you can actually flash borrow from the protocol make the liquidation don't use any capital and just collect the spread and this is where the mev has a has its own risk i would say and in general what it when it comes to flash loans so other protocol is a flash on protocol so you can not just borrow against a cloud but you can borrow for one particular uh transaction with sub-transactions uh doing for example arbitrage uh let's say that you borrow from ave you buy an asset you market one market that's a uniform and you sell it in another market fiber for example and and this is also kind of like a community opportunity where the value can be extra extracted by by the miners so at least those two cases are uh something that's very familiar to uh to to us and david yeah so um so if you're familiar with synthetics at all i mean one of the the biggest challenges any d5 protocol faces is getting liquidity in the system and so the way we've designed our our liquidity system is um snx stakers come on to the platform they stake their snx and then they mint uh susd which is kind of the entry point into the synths uh world on synthetics and so on synthetics we support a number of different synthetic assets anything from um you know synthetic and synthetic bitcoin to um fiat synthetic currencies you know we have a synthetic oil and there's you know commodities and now we've added equities such as you know synthetic tesla and coinbase et cetera and so how the liquidity for those assets gets created is through the stakers and we have this thing called the debt pool so when people stake debt gets created in the system and when traders come on and they trade let's say you wanted to go from se to s bitcoin um or i guess lately you'd probably want to go from sbtc to s eth which is pretty exciting you would essentially be trading against the deadpool right there is no like counterparty you're trading peer to contract right and in that sense the the risk the risk for front running the risk for people taking advantage of you know price discrepancies and price oracles and stuff like that the risk is borne by the stakers so it's a little bit of a unique problem that's specific to synthetics normally if you were you know trading on something like uniswap um the trader would be at risk for for front running and other um you know mev uh risk areas so it's a bit different for us and so because of that we've had to deal with several challenges around the user experience so this is a big kind of ongoing trade-off between how do you really nail the user experience especially for us as as people come on to do trading different with different trading strategies um with uh security and making sure that you know the stakers and the people providing liquidity to the system aren't getting uh taken advantage of and so uh on l1 we had to introduce this thing called fee reclamation which um it has you know obviously the benefit of not being front runnable because we basically when you make a trade you basically have to wait six minutes for the trade to settle and when you wait six minutes um we basically are looking for price changes um during that period and we'll take those into account um you know whether you you know depending on the price that you get so that the point there is um that hurts from the ux like no trader really wants to wait six minutes for the trade to settle um and then also for composability right like if we wanted to integrate with ave it becomes you know challenging because of that that waiting period and so um as we look to move to l2 we're trying to do everything we can to get rid of fee reclamation and feel confident that our system is not and the stakers aren't exposed to unnecessary risk so a couple of the differences between l1 and l2 is on l2 so we're we're building on top of optimism and there's no mempool um you know on on optimism and so because of that um that relieves one you know attack vector where people could look at the transactions coming in the queue you know and they can basically say i'm going to pay a higher gas price and i'm going to basically have my transaction execute before this and so um the transactions are just going directly into the sequencer on l2 which is um you know obviously there's there's there's benefits to that the cons of that is that currently optimism is running the sequencer and so there's some centralization aspect to to it in today's state and so there's been a lot of discussion like carl just gave a presentation on neva and then there's you know conversation from chain link around fair sequencing and stuff like that and those those mechanisms are designed to help bring more decentralization to the sequencer not being able to order transactions right because optimism has every reason not to shoot themselves in the foot in terms of messing with the order of transactions but once you know the plan is to move optimism away from running the sequencer to bring more de centralization where anyone could run the sequencer but when that happens we have to make sure that they can't you know just order the transactions the way that they want um therefore affecting the system so that's one kind of attack factor slash thing we're working with the other area is around price oracle latency and this specifically again is a huge problem for synthetics because the way the debt pool like i explained with the liquidity is structured and so with that some of the things we're doing is we are working with chain link to try to get the deviation threshold down so the way that that works is let's say the deviation threshold on for a chain link price oracle is point three percent right that means that when there's a move in price that's sorry uh not yeah 30 bips right um so i guess that would be like you know your 0.3 percent and so um if there's a move above that it causes the price oracle to update the price right and so you want that to be as low as possible because that means you'll get more frequent price updates in the sense that there's you know price movement so we're kind of we're working to get those down another thing we're doing is we're trying to um we have a heartbeat the heartbeat's less relevant as far as the stuff goes but you know the the heartbeat is like if the price hasn't gone above that threshold right there needs to be something that triggers a new price and so the lower the heartbeat is the better the problem is that it gets expensive right if it's if it's pretty low so we're aiming for like a one-hour heartbeat um and stuff like that um and then i would say the last thing to kind of keep in mind there that's been been something we're trying to do is so we're launching with higher fees than we'd like to have um because higher fees you know obviously is not ideal again this is this trade-off between user experience for the traders and everything but it does bring more security because um so for example we're launching with like 75 bips which is a 0.75 you know um structure or at least that's what we're thinking um and obviously that helps make it so front running is not even worth it right for people and so but we want to bring our goal is to bring that down to like 30 bips you know over time um so those are some other things and then i guess um yeah i mean you know just a fair amount of talking so yeah thank you very much that was very extensive i think that you know people will kind of look back at this kind of segment as a as how mv and synthetics interact with each other on the on the thing that you just said about optimism just to ask the questions by um what do you think about the mv auction so yes you were very early into like designing the mechanism i earlier said some things about like not liking them so much so i wonder what your thoughts are on mev options and how they will define kind of the player to block producer election game oh fun okay so yeah so okay let me just give a little quick introduction to it so i think that like mev is a serious problem and we should do all we can to remove as much mvp as possible but we should also try and mitigate the problem of mbb so i see medeva auctions maybe extractable value options as a way of mitigation so that's kind of what i think what like georgios what are your concerns about it um basically that the it just doesn't solve much in a way you just use it to elect your sequencer and then yes the sequencer of course received all the mev and then then what well okay so theoretically like because you have this option to elect to the sequencer the value that they're the profit that they're making like the majority of that profit should just be destroyed or else donated to some public goods uh the idea is that like you're although mav is still exists in the system what you're doing is you're capturing like some subset of it and and when you're doing that you're kind of reducing the severity of it um yeah does that make sense to some extent although it still seems to me that you know having some form of more low-level randomization scheme or separation between execution and ordering would be a more robust solution but it seems like that maybe maybe these two are complementary yeah i think we should have both i mean we can dig into this more but i i've also had some thoughts about the random ordering but i'm not sure if that's the direction you want to take it in the title i mean i think i think i think everybody would be interested in hearing how like random ordering and kind of like these mechanisms interact or will affect rather the rest of the defy ecosystem on layer two so maybe maybe kind of worth scoping down like your thoughts into this uh okay okay cool cool yeah so i'm a little bit con like okay so you do random ordering where like the block producer orders the transactions before they know what they what the transactions are but like there are certain situations where this will be really bad right for example if someone on synthetics or ave is getting liquidated and let's say the reward for that is like a hundred each then people are incentivized to create like a hundred e's worth of transactions and just randomly put those out there on the off chance that they will get be the first one it turns it into this kind of lottery situation where you get this like burst of transactions appearing because people know that oh i probably won't get there but if i do it's like winning the lottery so that's for me is one concern of the random ordering i think someone raised that earlier during ellie's talk uh but i'm not sure if it really got described correctly so i think that like the solution that i prefer is actually the time lock approach where so basically what you do is you say okay here's my order uh i'm going to place this order and it's going to be processed after some time delay and the reason you have to use a time lock is because you don't want people to be able to place orders and then real say that okay i'm not actually going to reveal that order yeah so i i think it's important to do both um but i'm skeptical about the random random ordering approach um but i know other people have other opinions on that i'd be interested to hear it's interesting you mentioned like the um kind of the the liquidations use case because um so in terms of our roadmap i don't know if you can pull up the second slide um that i had but this definitely becomes relevant if you think about like our what we'll be rolling out um so currently uh we just have staking right on l2 on mainnet um we'll be rolling out um exchanging like uh next and then after that shorts shorting um since um and then futures right in future is the way we're designing the system is sort of like perpetuals where you can specify leverage and so once you start to specify you know five times leverage on a position the liquidations become like somewhat tricky and and can be um so i think there is like a potential attack vector kind of like barry was saying there so i think that's that's a pretty interesting thing i'd i'd like to give more thought to one thing one thing i'm taking as well kind of like what one solution would be i mean it's kind of like it's not an optimal solution because uh in one way and theoretically is that you can you can create governance based permissions for liquidators so practically certain type of liquidators can uh can liquidate uh and and that could be that could be one option that you have have this like permissionless uh ability that will be one way but then again like we're going against the permissions permissionless nature of the the blockchains and and uh the leafy itself but uh to some extent that could be uh one way to do it especially if you do if you use governance for this kind of solution that might be um pretty pretty interesting another thing chain links talked about in their um like fare sequencing stuff that they've been thinking about is um basically encrypting the transactions um so that the content the transaction contents only revealed after the ordering has been agreed on so that that's another kind of interesting thing um it's you know i don't know that much necessarily about it but i know that that's something they've been they've been trying to figure out so yeah so my concern with this approach is that like what you have to do is you have to make sure that people are forced to reveal their order because otherwise what i can do is i can make like potential orders and then refuse to reveal them if it's going to lose me lose me money so yeah that's my thinking there there has to be some mechanism to force the reveal of the order i agree with that critic yeah exactly it's a free option um maybe moving forward like because we're kind of running on time um when uh like evaluating a layer two protocol because um standing you have deployed deployed yourselves on matic and i don't know what the rest of your plans are um and david like you've chosen optimism i wonder did do you take mvv mitigation or you know the strategy of the project um around the movie um into account does it matter what's the what's the deal does that mean matter for you or is it like um like yeah just an extra nice to have maybe starting last time personally and kind of like in in uh i would say that it matters uh quite a lot because i mean it's a it's definitely like uh look like an issue but when it comes to deployments of a protocol in different let's say site change layer uh their twos and and other maybe blockchains what's kind of like that well what we usually follow is is pretty much like uh what the community wants to do like what what kind of uh i mean it's not like the the the biggest uh decisive uh thing but also like uh when when we deploy uh contracts into other uh networks like it's part of the kind of like a technicality is that like how how the function it will be and it's not just the mev but there's other kind of things like how how easy it is to deploy contracts for example i mean whether there's a ibm compatibility and so forth so it plays some factor but but then again uh i somehow see the space now a bit saturated with with different kinds of chains and many of the l2 solutions are not super ripe yet i mean it's still kind of like very early but definitely that would be something that affects quite a lot especially if you see more and more issues related to mav and and uh incur but i guess like for us they the the most kind of like a key part where it might happen is the uh liquidations and as as long as most of the liquidations work it's not a problem but the kind of risk is that if if kind of the liquidators incentives are are lost and in that sense the there's less and less liquidators coming into the uh uh spot when you actually need them the most so that's kind of like the uh problematic part i would say but yeah i mean it's a consideration and but but still it's it's just part of the the tech we're we're we're looking and assessing when we deployed the protocols yeah i would just say you know i think it's definitely a consideration i think if i kind of think about like why did we choose optimism in the first place so you know the way we kind of looked at it was like how do we mitigate risk as a whole right so obviously you know maybe i mean mev falls in into one category in that but i think the biggest thing for us was like not having to maintain two code bases right using our existing solidity code um and then the way that optimism's been approaching like their ovm is they're trying to leverage as much as possible um from like the evm and like what exists and what's super secure today and so um you know there for example i think they're like compilers like a 200 line diff or something like that right so um these are those were all considerations we were taking into account and then you know i think we just really like their team and we're we're really excited about working with them um you know at the same time we're we're trying to stay we want to be at the the bleeding edge and so i think um one question we've been getting a lot is like what's our overall l2 strategy um right so we love we love the optimism team we love what they're doing um i think as things you know continue to change we're certainly excited about like you know just being on l2 in general and making sure that like we're at the forefront of the way like the community is moving um and then again it's just a lot of it's social too right like there's where is the liquidity going to be is something we've been we've been thinking about and trying to figure out and so um you know to me all those things kind of went into our initial like like our main decision and then yeah obviously risk mitigation and this type of stuff is an important factor as well but i think the other stuff maybe even um not to say was like this isn't important or anything it seems like those other things were kind of the things that were dictating you know our decision nice thank you very much david and stanley and barry i think that at this point we're quite over time so i think we can wrap it up here thank you very much everyone tina kartik and the rest and we'll see you around yeah thank you george thank you uh everyone on this panel um and uh any uh i guess uh uh i guess summary and next step for open questions from justin or uh uh and phil kartik uh anyone who's on this call uh as we are uh uh uh planning our next meb wrist a mega event that will focus a lot more on these kind of micro structure questions and also things that we touched on but didn't dive into such as fairness debate extraction versus mitigation um we will do a more systematic deep dive into those but uh want to see if there's any uh remaining open questions that anyone wants to suggest as well or takeaways justin are roastmaster um i don't have any specific questions um i mean i'm i'm glad i've been learning about you know flashbacks for the last week or two um and i'm sure i'll have more questions as i do more deep dive but in general i'd say that i'm very impressed with some of the principles that flashbot has taken you know around decentralization around ethics uh around open sourcing around you know all these all this this this good stuff you know eliminating the the forest et cetera et cetera um you know i still think there's a there's a lot of work on the actual product but um i think the the cultural foundations are extremely strong which is which is fantastic thank you awesome well i want to thank as we wrap this up i want to thank justin for
