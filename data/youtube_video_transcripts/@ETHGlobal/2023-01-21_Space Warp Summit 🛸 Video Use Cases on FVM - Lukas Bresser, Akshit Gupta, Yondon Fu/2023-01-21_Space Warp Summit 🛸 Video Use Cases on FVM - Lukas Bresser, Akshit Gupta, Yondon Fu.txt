foreign [Applause] [Music] and we are up into our last but of course certainly not least top uh so we're gonna welcome back uh Sarah to the stage and Sarah's going to be the moderator for uh a chat about video use cases on the fvm so video of course being an incredibly data intensive application uh we're joined by two awesome Builders uh in the space so we're joined by action from cuddle01 and yonden from Alive live peers so I'll also invite them up to the stage and to unmute and share their screen or share their video as well and I will let Sarah take it from here thank you Jacob all right cool hey nice to meet everyone again um we're back we're back with more um teams that are building uh around with and in the fall Point ecosystem um today we're joined by live here in huddle one um really exciting teams that you know we've been talking a lot with um we've also done like some amazing amazing events with um the teams like you know on Bungalow or with really huge for in the blockchain week that was super exciting had all one did a meeting for Bungalow um so yeah I'm really happy to have both of you come on today um today we have yondon and akshit from knife pure and had one so I'll let you do a quick introduction uh for those of you who have not met me in the previous talk I'm Sarah from the femt underdeveloper advocate so yeah I will let down London actually do a quick introduction sure I guess I can kick things off so thanks for the introduction and thanks for having me my name is Yonder and I'm one of the co-founders of Life peer and these days I lead a lot of our engineering and research efforts and yeah happy to be here and to talk about video and fvm and like so hi guys so I'm akshit I'm a full stack developer at hurdle zero one and I lead the front-end team there and I'm also one of the founding Developers is it so the teamwork revolves around the SDK so which powers that fall yeah yeah thanks thanks for that great introduction um we would love to hear much more about what I think for those who are new um to what not even had a one um offer and what they're building and we would love to hear more about what you're building these days where you're really excited about both of you are um come from teams and projects that are very video Centric it is you know video is huge um in general you know web 2 web 3 regardless um it's really really huge right now it's like being a torment and look popular um but decentralized videos are going to be a really huge thing right uh what we want to find out the day from you is what are you building where you're excited about and yeah why why a decentralized version of video um so yeah I'll London maybe you want to start off with um Wildlife peers up to the GT and what life care is about for those that are new sure so taking a step back I think at a high level the way that I've described the work that we're doing at life here is Building open and decentralized video infrastructure and we decided to focus specifically on video because uh the reality is that video being super data intensive and compute heavy is one of the hardest mediums of content to scale on the internet today and it's pretty cost prohibited and a crucial piece of this infrastructure is video processing uh one flavor of which we've focused on is video transcoding the process of taking a single video and basically being able to translate it into all these different versions so that you can effectively play it on any device anywhere around the world and back compute is pretty heavy and we've created this Global decentralized Network that offers this service and an Open Marketplace where you can bring your hardware and bring your bandwidth in order to push down this cost of service and provide this service to the network uh in an open and decentralized manner uh and the way that we work with developers historically is we have this selector Studio product that's built on top of the network that offers a Gateway API an SDK as well as various video player tools to make it easy to integrate live streaming or video on-demand experiences into your app so I'll pause there and happy to expand further later on for sure um akshit how about you and hello one yeah absolutely so Hydro zero one is a communication toolkit for web3 and our mission is to cater to 100 million members who are hard to zero one by 2026 and uh we have three pillars which are uh motion is about and uh first is the Hydro zero one web platform which is a sufficiently decentralized real-time communication platform for nfts and DOW communities and web 3 native users so uh if you have a Dao or in an SD Community you can create your calls user nfts as PSPs so you feel like feel right at home in the web c world then we have our sdks so we have Plug and Play toolkits for Builders to you know power the tabs with Audio Video Communications in their product with a few lines of code so even our web platform is powered by our SDK infrastructure so that's a proof of how powerful our web sdgs are and using our sdks a lot of hackers even built um beautiful products uh in some of our hackathons we recently had one December holiday hackathon in which we saw beautiful products and even one with light beer called incur uh which was uh pretty awesome then uh the third winner at Hydro zero one is 3D RTC protocol which is called Divergent and it is a peer-to-peer protocol uh which in which you can leverage uh decentralized communication uh using any RTC client so uh even if it is a drtc app like if it is an app which is uh backed by webrtc you can directly directly you can talk to our trtc protocol and leverage the infrastructure so that is a summary about Hado zero one and what it is bringing to the web 3 world Paula thanks so much for sharing that I think we so our team as well has played around a little bit with both lecture and puddle 01. um we I think one of our developer Advocates met like he had been publishing his video if you live here and he really wanted to explore more of that um how we can get and knocking looking at it as well like how can we get all the great tutorials that we're doing and kind of tested our life here and being an integration through fvm um in the future and bottled Rwanda we also want to convert like I'll check in then I'll call if we're good at that experimenting to try using the platform as well um and it well I think we thought like a live um update that was another Phil Bangalore about how they're like at that control now for conferences Right Live conferences which is pretty cool because then you can you like learn green will be just you can't actually see who's behind them um so I think it makes for a very interesting um new feature through all these live conferences and live meetings that we're doing um I think one of the next question that I have for both of you is um what are some ways in which you're exploring working together with the Falcon ecosystem and and in particular fbm if there are any plan sure so I think the most relevant on the live peer side at the moment is we're pretty excited about supporting and advancing video streaming on the internet uh with decentralized protocols and decentralized networks and lately we've uh been really focused on trying to make video streaming work really well with ipf at Nissan drive storage protocols like ipfs and filecoin and I think uh what some people might be aware of but not many that are outside of this particular domain is that there's just so many different parts of the video pipeline that are stitched together in order to make video streaming work at scale it's not just storage it's not just compute it's not just fast retrieval and content delivery it's really all of those things under the sky integrated in a tightly uh slightly conjoined manner so that things can work really well so we've spent a lot of time over the past couple years really making sure that we can push the cost of processing down and we've also built end-to-end services that leverage that network but we're also really interested in basically taking the capabilities that we've built and supporting video streaming within the ipfs and Falcon ecosystem an example of this is uh in the fall we launched this ipfs playback feature where you can take any uh video CID that is located or stored in ipfs on the public network or on filecoin and to take that CID transcode it into all these different outputs and Renditions and stream it back for anyone using that same CID so basically giving developers that are used to working with cids a similar interface but enhanced capabilities and now you can stream uh at a on a more scalable Banner so we're excited to continue working with the ipfs filecoin teams the folks working on treble in order to make this say a first class feature of of the networks that we're a part of as a dates to the fvm I think maybe we'll have time to talk specifically about a more specific applications and use cases but generally I'm excited about the prospect of these programmable storage contracts that enable these collectives to come together in order to provision storage and compute resources because I think that really changes the Paradigm of computing and cloud computing that we're used to where you'll have a single individual rent resources from someone that has the resources required in order to scale your app but now we can do things like a collective or a community comes together and they can jointly using smart contracts rent resources provision resources together in order to create interesting products that create value for that community so that's like my super generic answer and maybe we can talk about use cases or apps separately yeah yeah for sure um I think it's a lot of exploration right now fpm I mean at the old Lenola and all of you both were know like the product is being built as we go along so there's a lot of explosions to do that um cracking retrieval data retrieval that is huge um and really really important task that we're looking at and the fact that life period managed to crack it for a huge like video being such a huge like um the NFL as well I think that super interesting um well yeah I would like to check out more on the ipf side of things and how how that like the new feature that you mentioned um is actually working right now yeah um how about you actually like how how are the green paddles number one yeah so um title zero one from the start you know leverages ipfs and file one for storage so make all the meeting recordings and you know the live stream recordings which are powered by Nike are stored on the five coin Network so uh once we have you know this programmability that uh you want one just talked about uh we'll be able to compute over this data and you know create much more powerful maps and we can you know create marketplaces for videos uh which which could then in the users could even uh curate their content over there and do multiple things and you uh another use case that we are even researching into was storing our metadata using uh fvm actors so uh we even uh I'm actually in the file coin foreign program where I'm also reading about those getting it up to date so that uh we can implement the FM things in Hardware zero one as well yeah yeah for those of you who missed the earlier panel um The Foundry program is the fcm early uh sem Foundry early Builders program so we have like teams that come on um they maybe have an idea maybe they have to exploring and they built together about for the period of the milk Moon um so that will be going to mean that launch they actually have both projects to go out and that's what huddle um01 had been participating in um yeah and if like Pierre wants to join very happy to think you want to um yeah I called I mean thanks for sharing those today um you know it's something that um yeah well we definitely a lot of opportunity to build that on um given that programmability just will bend up by really anything that you can imagine um in it then uh I guess the next question that we we do want to know and I I know a few people from the community um and this is the general thing we went to and what do you right especially for video being so robust uh in web 2 and a lot of people consuming off what two platforms right now uh what do you think from your perspective what is the reason that moving to a decentralized video platform um what what makes it more interesting or better or more efficient or more performant um than what two options that exist right now yeah so I guess um always worth uh kind of talking about the distinction between uh say like the application platform and the underlying infrastructure uh I working on the infrastructure side can speak a little bit more to the infrastructure but there's uh certainly reasons to uh favor uh web3 application platforms as well but on the infrastructure side from my point of view I think there are two main things in my mind that um web3 infrastructure and decentralized infrastructure represents the first is a really big opportunity to commoditize uh existing bandwidth and compute and storage resources in order to drastically push down the cost of this infrastructure with Community powered networks and Community powered marketplaces and video infrastructure is just such an expensive offering in a traditional cloud computing context where for that reason it's actually really hard to bootstrap new new creative applications because in order to even get to a reasonable scale you you're dealing with all these fixed and variable costs that are massive uh right off the get-go and as a result it really leaves you with very few business models that you can explore uh and in our point of view at live here we think that there's all a lot of constrained uh constraints placed on application Level Innovation when uh the only avenues that you have to explore are dictated by what your super high cost basis is in provisioning infrastructure so I think from a cost point of view with the decentralized network with these token incentivized networks we have an opportunity to really push down costs and that just enables you to explore new application ideas that you currently can't uh the other bit that I think is fairly important is this notion of having a credibly neutral playing field for you to build on so with a lot of the infrastructure services and SAS companies the build on top of today while oftentimes it might make sense for you to start off there uh really there's a lot of variability in terms of things like pricing uh cases where your infrastructure provider ultimately ends up competing against you by releasing a competitive offering uh because and they can obviously offer that at a much lower cost basis than you can because they own those resources so it ends up with this Dynamic of you really want to be building on an infrastructure layer where it's not a credibly neutral playing field but with decentralized networks and decentralized infrastructure we do have an opportunity to lay out that infrastructure in a way where it is a Level Playing Field and you as a builder can start building today with the confidence that this will continue to exist and work in the way that you think it'll work in the future which we think is also quite important for experimentation and permissionless building yeah I think I also I mean as a kind of The Benchmark for those that are listening in um I think I read somewhere that live here brings it down to about 50 times the cost ability that with with traditional or like web 2 existing option for video um yeah for video streaming right thank you yeah yeah yeah and I think that and a lot of that is to the first point of uh really leveraging the Dynamics we can create with these networks and tokenize incentives and Community powered networks where uh these resources exist today let's try to aggregate them and then put them to good use for the people that uh want to actually build cool things with it yeah um and and you know actually for yourself like how did huddle zero one spot this um this Gap in in being able to provide decentralized to Doom conferences in a way yeah so uh like this actually started in the hackathon itself so our Founders are you shenzo Schmidt we were in the hackathon and they saw everyone building their own webc but this all the meetings being done on Zoom so that's where the idea for octop of you know having a decentralized solution for video conferencing and what really uh differs from the web to equivalent of those are like in Google meet and zoom like uh we are doing a meeting right now so you it doesn't really cater to the website community so like if you have an NXT or a Dao Community you would want to see like uh your a part of a group right so you you can't token get your calls using those tokens so that's what I will solves then it also gives you like crypto Primitives such as pf3s uh nft phps which also bring brings in like a better alternative uh for the Webster crowd and uh other than that like we're also leveraging file coins so filecoin is way cheaper than using other centralized Solutions such as Amazon S3 and like once the retrieval is solved then it will be much more uh much more easier for people to retrieve their data and uh use it on there so these are some of the things that uh differs us from the web 2 equivalence and other than that like a web RTC also comes with peer-to-peer calling so our drtc protocol is also uh peer-to-peer so it comes with two things first it's your data is not being shared to any Central servers it doesn't go to any Central server and then the other thing is that the latency is also very less so you don't have to go around central servers and uh to the peer thing so the latency is very less so that's how the web 3 it differs from the web to experience yeah um and your related question on this and our curiosity um what what are your thoughts around like being able to maintain the network of different providers because I think for the dental life Network especially when it's like with storage and you need um you need a lot of people um they are participating in network to be able to deliver the fast streaming time that you need is that a challenge that you get and how hard I mean briefly just out of curiosity how do your team deal with that yeah uh it's it's actually a little difficult to do with that because um right now like we we have Central Service uh on our main platform although uh like we are on a road to Progressive decentralization where these like the providers the media server providers will be incentivized using tokens or other markets or other video markets and uh that's how they'll be able to power that communication it's a long road ahead um and I didn't do close off one of the I mean thank you so much for sharing like more insight into the the back ends and the thoughts and the considerations behind building the decentralized video platforms um if not anything task at all right and the fact that you are able to watch videos like the way that we are used to it um and it being fully decentralized it's just surely a meeting so thank you so much for um building the project that you're building um I guess to close off one of the things that we again want to know is um from for both of you what are some depths or video adapts that you would be really looking forward to seeing from hacker uh yeah I I guess I can uh wrap two off first um so when I thought about this uh with this question I have uh maybe like simpler example and uh complex like that would be awesome example uh but the simpler example would just be uh I think with the fbm storage contracts I think it'd be really cool to start seeing uh things like uh really actual permanent Perpetual storage of certain videos that you want to preserve forever for archival reasons and it's just sort of like a set it and forget it experience and you know that this video will always be accessible and it might be a really important artifact from a knowledge standpoint uh ranging from that to uh you having like a massive Archive of videos that you want to preserve and being able to uh program like a large volume discount on that uh because you know that it's going to be like many petabytes of archival video data that is really important to preserve from kind of like a human history standpoint or something along the line so I think those are uh interesting like it's just taking videos and medium but it's just generally exploring what you can do with video preservation with the fdm contracts and the thing that is probably more complex but I think it would be really exciting is with these programmable storage contracts uh and the research that folks are doing on data Dows creating these templates so that communities and collectives can spin up a data down and that data now has all the baked in functionality so that it can bundle together the payments it needs for storage bundle the payments it needs for compute for retrieval and then all of those are handled by the Dow itself on a regular basis so that it Provisions resources for anyone that is a dow member and if you're a member of that Dow you get to use those resources because you're a member of that Collective and then that gives you the opportunity to explore these modernization models where maybe the collective comes together Provisions these Resources by bootstrapping some funding and then creates a product of value and then a portion of that value goes back into the Dow's treasury in order to continue provisioning resources for the Dow going forward and in this way you can actually start exploring these self-sustaining applications that can pay for resources on their own and then it abstracts a way that need to say like I need this for storage I need this for compute I need this for retrieval and you have these templates that can kind of package things up so that people can just deploy these and experiment uh and I think that would be really awesome okay no it's understanding right now if the hacker that was the thoroughly a project that you just described so take note and you can build it as well so thank you for giving the answer um okay actually what about you what would you like to see being built yeah so I'll give a reference of a book that I was reading the other day so it's called the great good place by the uh Oldenburg and he talks about uh unlocking the third place and you know the third place is a place where people come together and uh you know they come voluntarily and they come technology and anticipate uh together there so uh this what this does is that it spawns video bombers so if like you see these days uh there are platforms like Tick Tock Instagram we see videos all over the Internet so we do is a really powerful thing and um like I'm really excited about uh like platforms like video marketplaces building where creators can you know curate their own videos exchange them in a decentralized way and uh they can charge it charge for it and there there will be a competition between each of them so that will also hike down the prices so uh those are some great use cases that uh of programmability that uh fcn provides and I'm really excited to see things around this uh where social adapts and PDO Commerce kinds of things are being built on fcm yeah I can totally see like a Marketplace for videos being traded around um that would be kind of interesting to see how that would look like um and then just throwing in my idea because I was thinking about it as you both were talking but I would love to see like uh like a step or like a data dial the desktop titling for videos um whether it's like detention at Computing because I know that that's not an easy one to solve um because usually if you're doing publicly for live video streaming you will have like a live translator or you have a really strong AI model um we'll love to see how that can be decentralized that they can make a huge difference the compliment um all the great attention live video platforms out there today um yeah the quick little brainstorm um feel free to take our ideas and build it out would like to see all your projects you know being formed out all the discussions that we had um and that definitely continue to be on the difficult um and on the fall coins back Channel um yeah thank you so much to your chip for coming on the call today from your different time zone um that was a really great discussion on what video has to offer in the web 3 space um and yeah guys please check out live here and huddle01. cool thank you so much bro good thank you thank you
