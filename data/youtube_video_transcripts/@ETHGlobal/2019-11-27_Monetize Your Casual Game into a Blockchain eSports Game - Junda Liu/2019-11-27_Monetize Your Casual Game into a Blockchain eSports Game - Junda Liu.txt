they're starting yeah first of all thanks for coming this is for monetize your Karel html5 games on sellers existing no production blockchain based mobile esports platform i know then that the name is a little long but you know bear with me the whole thing will be very simple and the I have a few slides but after that it would be actually would be kind of a live demo to show you as a seller ax developer what would the experience be and I'm Jin de co-founder and CTO of the seller network so first of all what do we do when you go check seller Network you might get a little bit confusing because we have this underlying layer 2 state channel you know we work with let out for a counterfactual together for the standardization and you also see this seller X which she actually looks more less like a blockchain but more like a gaming app right um so it's actually pretty simple we started as layer to scaling project the the goal is simple we want to scale our block chance and after several iterations of the protocol of the implementation quickly we kind of reach the production level say oh we have the thing down the system is there what's the next question we need to answer is what do you do with it obviously we get all the benefit of instant finality zero transaction fee zero latency everything coming from block chain but the next question people ask what's the real-world use case right you might heard a lot people talking about defy or whatever but for us we kind of say oh there is a vertical that can significantly benefit from the technology we have built is the mobile games to be more precise is the cervix now we are branding it as cell X is you can see on the screen it gives the user the seamless experience just like playing a normal game but on the line it's our accelerated blockchain technology so that's the power and we cannot see a eSports itself is already a proven although right there is no we don't have to convince people say hey eSports is a valid business model it's already proven people say for now people say League of Legend and we say hey we want to bring to mobile to make it even the Carroll game developer like independent game developer instead of the the deep pocket Game Studios even individual developers can benefit from this system and it turns out it's actually being pretty good you know this actually is the old number I didn't get the latest number yet the next time we'll definitely refresh this page with much much higher numbers like I think in the past week alone we already have more than hundred thousand new games gets played right so this is all the power that benefits from the lair to scaling solution seller has already run in production on a zero and that this map is one of my favorite actually to really see the potential of blockchain right so if you think about I think there's some number of Facebook without say hey they're still like almost three billion people are still unpacked basically they cannot access the financial system the people in developed countries have been used to write tickets for granted and if you see this map clear issues the the because blockchain is truly a global thing as long as you have internet access you can benefit from system actually a fun fact is several of our most active users are actually coming from Madagascar so if you think about that something kind of really hit me oh this actually makes sense at the same time we always precision ourselves as the platform provider well we never want to oh we want to become a game studio or something right we have a few games kind of a showcase to tell people how you can make it work but fundamentally we want to pitch to the you know for example the typical game developer community to say hey this is a completely new way to monetize your game I think you know if you have some knowledge about how games today make money especially on mobile it in that purchase or is ads right both of them hurts the user experience I saw some developer is actually really hard choice for them they still need to make a living but at the same time they want to have a high quality polish the game that players enjoy and for us we be say you don't have to sacrifice right as long as your game is a good game people love playing that and people can build up the skills using your game that's the revenue share model the seller provides to the developer and really make it down to the bottom simple we that's the API you know for a simple solution you need to do right let's assume you have existing game we always said two lines of code that's it and then I will show you later the whole Antoine flow you can you can download our a production app it's again a special QR codes chewing on your developer portal and you have it your game you can test it and then the next thing is the app the games will be on the review and they will publish on our production app and I might skip a little bit too fast I of course if I have this number here so now our monthly active players is around at like 15k this is kind of not a big number in the traditional traditional sense but if you think about in the blockchain community right this actually is pretty surprising numbers yeah so that's basically our page for more like the gaming vertical but remember underlying outperform is still there so that's why we also have open more like you could say less about the use case less about the gaming use case but more for like your flexibility tool to say defy prediction market whatever you want to do or even protect the user privacy when they do like a decentralized exchanges right so that's our web SDK you can also go and take a look it definitely will require little more experience like not only javascript you have to be aware of the some of the solidity and don't worry about we do have a very well written documentation and also a sample solidity plus you know off chain code you can take a look or our github yeah this part is talking about you know the the smart contract called the full product protocol specification and all the example samples project you can take a look at our open source this is really I would say not for typical developers with this actor is really more under you know hike level 9000 level the the thing here that underneath seller we build it with the extensible architecture in mind so basically first it's a layered architecture and then you can plug in play different you know completely different primitives think about how internet works right you have this IP layer then on top of you have TCP UDP and some other streaming you know transport protocol then on top of that you compute application very similar here but again right honestly speaking with we don't expect you know within 36 hours someone can really get something like really hardcore like this done but again right I would be super happy if someone figure this out but this is more like say I'm not even satisfied with the know simple state channel I want to build my own things that you can still do that on top of the seller system yeah I think this lies about the week where the official sponsor for the East global in almost every event will go with our team members and you know to help developers answer their questions and also we get the the world right so this is for this hackathon the awards we set up yeah I think that's all for the for the slides I will just show you something really quick I think I still have almost 20 minute so first yeah I already have this local in in my I just try come it helped seller seller X was it a sample where is the sample then selects example go seller here um you know just clone the project there are two branches why is the master that is a vanilla html5 okay and then this one is answer and I want to show you is that literally the difference between yeah there are some other random zone but the only thing that matters is here yes seller this slot this Coast emerges make it bigger seller X dot on start it will reset the game and you know you call sell axed I'll get match to get all the you know matching information that's needed to be provided to your to your game and then you call seller exit already that's it so the visit and that starts the game already and then after game is done you have another thing called semi score right here just take a quick look and I will show you after this let's say you take a game or whatever you you already have a game or you developers a new like interesting html5 games and with this lines of code it's already ready it's already can be published on seller X prefer and now we switch to the developer portal and you say I want to create a new game right let's give it a name let's say hack is Waterloo a demo demo subtitle cellar rocks this question I think these are often device orientation this is the landscape hiccup primary car this is more for the UI to show and you know make it more out pretty and here you have the choice you know yes I did just show you the simpler like solo game so it simply say the game does not require a fair to player interaction you just play within the game after that you have a score which is compare the score if you select solo game don't have a choice is it high score wins or low score wins yeah mm-hmm and then you are done next step is I think somehow already here already went through the process right so you can skip all these I just make sure you upload the the game assets assets yeah if you want get a sense of it I just try to drag the open mmm okay let's like sit down go Tess a dancer legs you see the QR code right and then you download say the teller except on either Android or iOS I cannot present this right so but go into that to the selects app on the right top corner there is a very subtle scanner now you can see you are being switched to the developer mode okay I think you can see my screen so we that's the whole flow and then sometimes it takes a few minutes for the background to get completely in sync with the SS and resources but that's it that's basically after that's done yeah you can say I kept loading I think now it's pretty quick you can see you can already test your game with midnight tokens this is this is Diane the seller and you can play with your friend you know you can try to do a public matching which will be you have to have other people's kinds well or you can do a a private match because we create another QR code for your friend to scan yeah yeah so I think that that's basically it for people who want to be a little bit more into the advanced space this is a solo game right we also support the generic state channel turn-based game so basically you still need to write you're almost a smart contracts in solidity but then again then remember this website the developer does alexdodd up all the detailed walkthrough tutorials for solo game and also for turn-based games out here and they also include the link to the you know to the github projects you can download as a starting point obviously we have this the whole skeleton everything is already set up you just need to fill in your own logic I think that's the whole point what we are trying to make the developer especially coming to hackathons I know everyone is kind of short on time so make sure it's more efficient for you and also hoping everyone can spend minimal effort fighting ways infrastructure right basically focus more on your own innovative ideas less about how do I configure this ERP C endpoint you know I've been there rather like I kind of get the enough of a say why can't we do better for developers so it's basically that's the our answer for the the hackathon hackers and you know our boost is near the entrance we have people there answer question and also if you do not want to walk over because to code you just send a message on this chord yeah okay any question no good yeah just have you hack it Thanks
