times it's easy to you know if you're just waking up you want to hide behind your camera but it's nice to see faces instead of names so if you're able to we'd love to uh see your face it helps me to get to know the hackers you know if i'm going to be talking with you for the next few weeks it's always good to see a face [Music] all right looks like the live stream is good to go again if you want to turn on your video you're more than welcome to um [Music] and we can start so my name is trent i work with ethglobal helping them run hackathons and doing some community management this is our first hackathon of 2021 and we're super excited to be here with everybody and especially the ave team we worked with them last year on a couple different hackathons and we're really excited to be starting off 2021 again with them couldn't be a better partner for these kinds of events so uh hopefully you're here for the brainstorm session and you didn't click on um an improper calendar event but this event here today is what we're going to be doing is you know going over just the general ideas that people have um how you can integrate ave and we're going to start off with intros from the ave team and then we'll move into a bit of a more open-ended q a session where if you have a specific question or an integration you think might be interesting you can ask the ave team that but let's start off with some quick intros from the ave team maybe just give your name the type of work you do with ave and yeah let's just start with that david why don't you start yeah sure uh hey everyone so i'm david um you've probably seen me around i generally do a lot of i guess developer ecosystem type things and community stuff i'm also a general developer and builder as well in rv so that's me uh us to unreach the other team members hey you can go next working uh quite a lot on the product side and also on the uh a bunch of other uh more boring stuff on the back office and uh being building and in in kind of the defy space quite early 2017 and uh yeah that's the most of the uh stuff and i love to brainstorm uh previous academics as well trying to participate in in your ideas so uh i think important is that if you have something in mind uh feel free to share it's it's open um open place to to kind of like get uh thoughts out and and just get them further yeah uh from my side i'm i'm ernesto i'm one of the of the core developers of the product coming out but also like participating a lot in product itself so yeah if you need anything some people already is contacted me in discord and through the common chats we have about but yeah feel free to to ask about anything you want hey everyone uh i'm jordan i'm the uh ceo of ave uh same i've been building d5 for four years now uh and very available if you need like uh brainstorming like everything especially everything related to governance uh would be i would be interesting to brainstorm with you and help or even like other things like nft and then their general products related to ave like anything like open to brainstorm uh to brainstorm with you and actually quite excited to see what you're going to build awesome is that everybody just a millionaire yeah there is me as well yeah i'm another core developer like ernesto said more or less we were involved in the development of the protocol we are also involved in the development of other tools and functionalities that are related to the protocol or built on top so if you guys have any idea or requests or you need help or support build whatever you have in mind just ask us and we will try to provide the best support that we can you also have a david k uh here as well i don't know david you want to say hello quick hello if he's got his microphones if not that's fine as well yeah maybe we'll we'll loop back and see if we can get him um okay awesome this is great to have so many um core team members uh here to help brainstorm and like i said we're going to start off with those intros which you just did for anybody joining um that was the first part and now we're going to move into a few higher level questions uh we'll talk with the avid team and then afterwards if you have a specific question or an idea that you're thinking about then we'll have time for that in the as the second part of this so let me just pull up those questions we had talked about um let's start with a pretty big um a really high level question so we had defy summer um well summer for for people in the northern hemisphere but d5 summer six months ago with this really insane explosion and then that kind of you know it had its own crash and then it switched to nfts and then nfts plus d5 um and now we're moving into uh what's the latest in algorithmic stablecoin so there's these trends that come up um cyclically what the as is from your position in the space is one of the bigger projects what are what is the ave team seeing in terms of trends um that you think are interesting let's start there and we'll go in the same order david if you want to start yeah sure um yes so from my perspective because i'm more like i guess consumer facing with the community so what i've been seeing lately is a lot of like the core i guess um bass foundation uh is is pretty good these days with with protocols like rv um so we're seeing a lot of developers build on top of these protocols um so you know there's a lot of composability uh in the in the in defying space at the moment so using rv with you know various other protocols we're seeing a lot of that uh in an an example is an avigachi or d5 save or for a combo you know those sort of guys are combining multiple protocols into their product so i'm seeing a lot of that great stanley and and if you don't have an answer for any of these feel free to just you know pass but um we can we can just go through the list what you want to give your thoughts here so uh what will be the next thing you mean sure that's the question everybody wants to ask what's the next big thing yeah i i think uh it's it's something that we we we as a team always uh try to try to think a bit uh actually quite quite a lot then um i i i to some extent it's it's also like a question is is that when you when you choose to build something that uh you know removes uh inefficiency and and brings a lot of value to the ecosystem um it's also always kind of a big question of timing like how how quickly you can get it into the market but also uh secure fashion that you don't you don't compromise the very important elements and and risk people funds when it when it comes to d5 uh products and we do think kind of this and sometimes you are i mean you might have a very nice idea and a product but you might be a bit early too early in the ecosystem with that particular uh offering uh and it's not a bad thing because i mean uh you always have the chance to iterate and make things better the the products better and i think what if you look at uh ava as an example it's it's not something that we created uh overnight uh it's it's practically a few years of uh development and iteration what was the first version for example uh the very first learning protocol it landed and making it a bit more efficient and as the ecosystem grows and the narrative changes what's what's exciting at the moment uh that's that it really follows the path and once you add some feature it's very hard to tell like what is the how it will be used uh for example i mean adding flashlights uh we couldn't probably see always like that the what kind of use cases they could be and over the time as the feature was live uh different developers including previous hackathons we saw like a lot of interesting uh use cases and and they become came actually products so there's probably two billion worth of flashlights used from abbey last year and and all of mo well let's say most of them are used for example to rebalance uh different positions in india fi and arbitrage to practically bringing a lot of efficiency uh for the users i personally i'm betting quite a lot on the credit delegation functionality so what's what's very cool about the version two of ave is that uh there's sort of functionality that you can do behalf of other uh addresses other users practically other accounts so so what you can actually do is that you can deposit to deposit into other and then delegate your credit to someone else that actually draws the credit so so you have the collateral inside and then you form a bus relationship with that third party now what's interesting here is that uh this is something that you can delegate to a contract to some specific polling contract that does some functionality in dfi it could have actually even wider uh application uh driving liquidity from d5 to some other purposes uh having some sort of credit scoring there uh and and having actually utility for the traditional finance and pull liquidity so that's kind of like layer there uh i think there's a lot of uh opportunities when it comes to uh scoring and how this credit could be drawn i think that's uh something that might uh uh we might see some interesting uh hacks and also developments during during this year well let's not say this year but at least like the next month sure yeah hedgehog hedged that soon anybody else from the ave team want to take a hit at this yeah i would like to add also that stanley was centering quite a lot in the part of the of the landing protocol itself but i think that is something really interesting is is is the governance part uh like during the last year there was a um late 2019 there was a big trend on dials and governance systems then it went a bit like say fade out or something by by by all this deal farming and so on uh this last year but but i think it's gonna come back because like essentially it's one of the most interesting fields in in blockchain and one of the original ones in ethereum that like dowse like a coordination of like social coordination so in the case of hubble for example that we introduce now the like the stable version of our of of the governance and i think like there are like really good opportunities to even innovate at a base layer of governance systems with new models and build on top of other or not so yeah i i i think that is going to come back once like the like the the grid ends a bit in terms of to add on on what ernesto was saying like just to give example of what innovation on top of governance can look like it can be analytics watching like the uh which which address votes uh what are uh one address that votes like something that could be interesting is actually when one address votes like seeing the exposure it adds to other protocol like to other if it participate in other governance like just being able to make like this uh governance graph like we always talk about social graph but governance graph like seeing the the relationship between votes in different protocol um then there is like everything related to analytics but also uh ui for in india governance you can delegate both your voting power which makes you like kind of politician of the protocol and your proposition power which is uh like sunny say like the lawmakers the devs that that can make actually technical proposal uh so like those two power are separated and basically interaction like social interaction with like social media ways to have like a social interaction with the delegation of the the proposition power is something that is also very interesting i guess like there is like a lot and just to have like a general answer to the original question uh i think 2020 was just like uh the start like now we have base layer protocol uh like ave uh uni swaps schwab all the uh balancer all the mm's with different flavors and i think now those those basically 2020 edition of d5 are consolidated and we can start building on top like more robust products that use those building blocks like this is how you you should see like those defy we always talk about legos they are like building block we see now protocol like the yield protocol building like fixed rate landing like you cannot build something like that if you don't have this like uh basically money market underneath so like there is so many stuff to build like you just look at the financial industry the banking industry and you say okay i need for example like if you think about flashlight like flash learning itself uh is a cool innovation but you need like a lot of liquidity to make flashlight interesting like you need a protocol you need a um an mm or money market with a lot of liquidity then you can borrow like one billion in one transaction so like there is a lot of those like upper layer innovation uh that i expect to see now that basically the base layer of the building blocks are like consolidated awesome anybody else from ave well i i think that more or less everything was say it was said already one one cool thing that we could add for example to we could think about the governance is the proposals that essentially can execute themselves by gather proposition power so that people could for example delegate proposition power to smart contracts so that what happens is that the smart contract will be able to automatically execute sorry create the proposal once it gathers enough position power so that anybody essentially can create a smart contract that will be able to propose to the other governance which is something that is for sure very very cool so yeah there is a lot like to on the plate i think and i'm personally very excited to see what the builders will come up with definitely i see we have mark who just joined mark do you want to say hi and introduce yourself hello i'm mark i'm uh in the integration team and one of the thing i want to add is that the average protocol v2 is a playground and feel free to play around with the new features and especially to combine them so you have the flashlight you have the credit delegation so uh like some user feedback we had like very very uh recently on the the social media uh was oh do i transfer my wall position from one address to another address for i don't know privacy purpose or wallet management purpose to switch my position to a cold wallet and it's quite it's not something that complex to build with a with a flashlight but right now it doesn't exist there's no feature that allows you that to to do that easily with one click on a ux to do it and that's specifically the kind of small but smart thing that anybody with a bit of technical skill can build inside the hackathon and we will do a blog post that we probably will publish tomorrow that will give you a small ideas that you can build fast that way that will just make everybody using a life a little bit easier and uh don't be afraid if you cannot build like huge pyramids of codes and very very fancy things there's a lot of small things you can build at any skill level awesome yeah that makes sense okay um we're going to move on to the next question but before that uh just something to make sure everybody's staying engaged if you have your video on i'm gonna pick one of the hackers by random and just give us a quick one sentence intro to yourself so i'll give one second for you to turn on or off your video depending if you wanna if you wanna talk right now and then i will pick one person um why don't we have um marcelo bardus give us yeah just a one sentence talk about yourself yeah oh yeah i'm marcelo and honestly i'm looking for inspiration what to do i have an idea but it might be quite complicated to to implement so basically i want to build a smart wallet smart controlled wallet which should replicate all the transactions done by different address and yeah it should be something like a politician but instead of choosing an address which you will give him power you will do basically the same so okay cool yeah we'll we'll get to anybody who wants to join this idea i'm open just dm me that would be cool yeah we'll get to the specific um proposals a little bit later but let's move on to the next question um for the ave team so we have actually a really huge range of hackers who have staked to to build something over the next few weeks um and that's that's a great thing we really enjoy seeing you know people who are just learning solidity to really experience teams um but for us on the support and for the ave team that means that there are going to be people with a pretty wide range of experience levels coming into this and trying to get exposure to your docs and learning how to build something if you were let's say if you were a complete beginner let's do three levels um looking for the response for if you were a complete beginner so you're just learning solidity you're intermediate you've done some you know you've done all the tutorials you've started to build things uh and then the third the third type of developer would be like um you know you've deployed something to mainnet it's integrated with some financial protocols how would you approach this hackathon let's get one for each of those levels uh from somebody on the ave team and whoever wants to start just just unmute themselves and go ahead yeah sure i think i can start um so i think if i was a beginner i think the easiest is obviously you know depositing and borrowing using those features um but also um you could extend it by using credit delegation um because it's essentially it's pretty similar right and they're pretty easy to learn from a developer perspective um as an intermediate uh developer i think something like batch flash loans or the governance features like delegation and things like that that have already been talked about uh and then the on the advanced side you could also do some interesting with all of those as well um but specifically and then i um stanley loves this uh would love for someone to look into l2 or zero knowledge um type stuff and that's probably for the really advanced um devs so that's that's what i think um stunning uh yeah i would say like uh i i think for i i think all the others have more more distant from developers developers perspective but um i think it really depends on the conference level um i definitely like in a hackathon there's good amount of time so i will not panic uh too much and maybe uh might be a good good place to to challenge a bit uh yourself and and and try something new new and cool and i mean end of day if it doesn't uh play out well uh i mean you can have a contingency plan but uh what i'm trying to say is that uh it's it's kind of there's no stress in in in the time period it's it's long enough that you can achieve pretty interesting things so uh it's a good place to to um challenge kind of your skills and try something uh very cool and maybe something that normally you won't you won't do but i think uh yeah that will be and if you're really really like uh kind of like being doing this and being very deep in ethereum uh uh maybe those uh something like zk might be uh fascinating place to dig dig deeper but uh referring what ernesto said about for example governance uh indeed it's one of the basic ideas and some of these basic ideas there's big big issues to be solved in a very uh large scale so um pick your battle yeah yeah i'll add to that um uh stanley's basically saying just to recap like don't be afraid to push your limits if you're afraid of you know pick something that's maybe a little bit bigger than than your skill set and that will hopefully force you to you know expand beyond what you're comfortable doing um and then like to balance that out do realize that if you are you know planning something really really ambitious sometimes you can bite off more than you can choose so be aware that like you should probably settle on an idea within the first week of the hackathon so we'll be having an idea feedback session um this week around this time on thursday uh and by that point i think it's probably fair to say you should have your idea relatively solid and have a good idea of where the direction you're taking it but um yeah don't be afraid to be ambitious but um recognize that three weeks depending on how much time you're dedicating to this you know if you're only working on it on the weekends or a few nights per week it can be a challenge to do something really huge but yeah definitely ambition is is a good thing anybody else from the ave team want to want to take a stab at this the question was uh the the different levels of development how would how would you attack it if you were a hacker i would like to add also like in in the line of uh of of mark that you mentioned something like that there is a lot of times there are a lot of profiles of developers in the file that is people that is using device so it's used to to interact with platforms to use tokens and so on and they are and they want to start like developing something so i i would suggest that uh a lot of times it happens that you are using certain products and you notice that you will appreciate to to build a small tool maybe to make things more optimal for the interaction usually those implementations are not so complicated but are terribly terribly useful so what looks really small sometimes is like way more use that like a complex protocol with a crazy big architecture and way more successful so sometimes it's not about complexity it's about like simplicity yeah you can make something really beautiful with just a very simple idea it's very effective sometimes yeah yeah i wanted to add that for the more experienced developers and teams like one possibility could even be uh to add core functionalities to the core protocol for example if they think something can be improved or new functionalities can be added for example i don't know minting of synthetics asset for example starting from the other protocol or gas optimizations or other functionalities that someone could come up with by looking at the code that is something that is for sure very very useful and appreciated ave protocol is open source so anybody can contribute and like if something is added to the core protocol that is very useful it can become a proposal for the governance to be added to the actual protocol in minutes so for the most experienced developers keep in mind that expanding the core protocol is also an option if you have ideas on how to expand it or how to improve it for sure anybody else from the of 18 not on my side i think everything i can add uh in the simple stuff uh that uh ernesto said like i have a good example like uh one community member expert did up on a per day to calculate the factor of position and uh to have liquidation price and at the end of the day it's just a little touch of front-end very basic stuff and a bit of matte and if you have like zero solidity skill you can produce that and it's super easy useful and it will find some use case in the community for sure yeah that makes sense um okay so it um for anybody who has hacked with each global before you might notice that um in previous previous hackathons these brainstorming sessions were you know uh not sponsors but this this event is specifically uh centered on ave so ave is our is our close partner for this and we are focusing on getting them you know we're encouraging people to build on ave and really explore the protocol uh and to that end they uh we have put together some incentives to get people building on them so anybody who integrates ave will um receive 100 a usd c is it aucdc or aoc let me double check that because i use dc yeah so so yeah we're not going to nobody's obligated to build on ave but like i said this is an ave centric hackathon and we want to see uh you know everybody putting their creative um ideas out there and as to what they can build or integrate with the protocol and that's one of the incentives so again 100 ausdc for any team who builds or integrates with ave and let's not forget that there's also obvious ox that you know so this is the this these are mine so you'll get your own but uh that's that's somebody somebody would probably buy your socks donnie i wouldn't i wouldn't be surprised it's a little weird but you know whatever whatever goes watch them sunny um okay let's see let me just see if we had any other other questions does somebody want to give a quick overview of what v2 actually does what ave v2 how it's different maybe somebody had some experience previously with with ave and they're just coming back you want to give a quick overview of what v2 does but maybe uh each of us can go over like maybe one feature sure that excites us about v2 um just quickly um the the probably the one i'm most excited about i'd say like maybe credit delegation um so that separates the uh the native credit delegation um so previously in v1 we had credit delegation votes uh but now basically all the deposit and borrow functions you can do it on b uh well sorry the borrow functions you can do on behalf of someone else um so that means that the person that deposits into the protocol doesn't necessarily have to borrow money but they can delegate that credit to someone else and that someone else can make use of that borrowed money uh and you know whether it's an off-chain agreement or on-train agreement uh they can enforce you know repayment of that loan in whatever way they want um so people have already talked to me about some really interesting use cases uh and i think that opens up the design space a lot so that's a pretty cool area yeah i think it's important to just to to complete what david was saying is that the credit delegation can be done to a smart contract so it doesn't it doesn't need to be like a credit delegation to an address or like a an entity it can be credit delegation to uh a protocol so that's uh something to keep in mind and i will just like continue with uh with the feature of v2 something that is like very interesting for me is uh the collateral swaps so the idea to swap your collateral uh let's say that you have you are using you are using like it or ave as collateral for your borrow position and then you you can swap it to to link let's say and and then be long link instead of being long eat uh you can basically trade your collateral and there is a lot of things to build around the trading of conato as well it's an interesting area anyone else from ave so let's see the the features were credit delegation what were the other ones yeah yeah no another another thing that is for sure very excited exciting and is worth uh in investigating and maybe building on top is that is the flashlight version two uh because compared to the compared to the initial version of flashlights of the one there are multiple capabilities that can be used to create interesting projects or protocols on top uh one of one of these for example is the intrinsic leverage capabilities that the flashlight version two have because essentially you can um take the money in advance and not retain the flash one like you were doing flash run version one for this is for anyone who has confidence with how the flash will work but you can actually deposit some collateral in the same transaction and eventually not retain the flash run but open number opposition which essentially brings automatic leverage capabilities so you can flash borrow in advance um use that amount borrow it to to buy some kind of other asset deposit within the same transaction in the protocol and open alone at the end which means that you can automatically create a leveraged position so this is something that is for sure very very cool and interesting definitely just just another thing on on that um because there's um some questions on twitter about that so the what emilio's highlighting is that um the normal flash loans is that uh you get the money um first and then you pay it back by the end of the transaction with the uh let's say debt incurring flash loans uh you it's it's like a uh you get that a lot you get the flash loan first and then you can choose to deposit the collateral into the protocol after after the fact so you can incur that later on um so it's sort of like the reverse of a normal loan where you would have to deposit collateral first and then you get a loan so yeah it enables margin trading type facilities but then also a lot of other things uh does ernesto stanley do you want to talk about mark about governance features um or any other v2 features that excite you yeah i mean in the governance i think it was already mentioned before that uh one of the biggest difference uh there are like two big differences with other systems of governance out there and one is that uh like it was designed in mind that there are like two different entities participating in governance uh like in terms of delegation so there are like the the people that is voting that is receiving delegation power and then there is like the people that is actually creating the proposals and proposing to the government so we have this this difference between proposition power and and voting power and is um i think there could be it can be good ideas to build something from there and and and the other big difference with the governance is that like uh how how it gets executed the proposal itself we have like it this is a bit more technical but we have two different ways one is just if you have more knowledge of solidity like writing a smart contract and the other is composing the proposal of chain but there are also some interesting possibilities that it's needed to check a bit more documentation or or check with us but yeah yeah uh one thing i want to mention is that the the depth organization is also kind of interesting uh in the sense that when you borrow from from the protocol you you basically get depth talk next position uh those tokens are not uh transferable but there might be some interesting things that you could do related to to the depth tokens and and how how to use it maybe even more than than just kind of like accounting uh and integrations instrument so might make sense to take a look at those and and and kind of like uh look what what what could be done yeah on that some people have thought about uh so on the protocol level the debt tokens at the moment aren't transferable but there's a possibility that someone might be able to create some derivatives of debt tokens so that could be rather interesting as well mark is there anything that you want to add all right cool uh maybe the last the last feature i'll add is um we'll also have staking rv so as you hopefully know uh ave the token has staking capabilities so you can also uh create things like that where you know um uh yeah i mean you could have a look at the docs but you know you can take a of a you know safety module then you earn interest on that and then also uh as and as i mentioned with the voting governance um it's not just on the protocol level of like using governance and helping people vote but also we have voting delegation features as well uh or even just analytics around voting because the v2 voting is quite new um so we only have our governance interface but i would love to see more uh projects or interfaces around voting governance you know how to like if i want to delegate oh if i want people to delegate voting power to me you know at the moment they can do that on twitter or they can um you know go and do it through our platform but it'll be awesome to have that you know more widely out there in the ecosystem as well definitely does that does that cover everything you want it's covered david um yeah i i i think that's that's pretty cool yeah yeah hopefully yeah perfect all right that was all the questions i had um was there anything before we move into sort of more open session was there anything else you guys wanted to cover related to the ave protocol or integrations that i haven't asked about if not just give me a thumbs up and we can move on all right cool i see two thumbs that's all i need so this this next part is going to be a little bit more participatory so if you are a hacker and you are you have an idea please use the raise hand function in zoom i'm not sure i have the same interface as a host but it's somewhere on the bottom i believe but just raise your hand in the zoom interface and then i'll just call on people what i'll ask is that you just give a very very quick intro your name and then try to keep it short enough that you can describe what you're interested in building but not too short that we have no idea what you're trying to build so the first person i see is jack so jack why don't you unmute and you know tell us a little bit about what you're thinking of building and then the ave team will hopefully have some feedback for you awesome hey guys uh let me know if you can't hear me i just want to say it's awesome to be able to bounce this idea off of the entire of team that's here so thanks for uh thanks for being on this call for and for listening to me um so basically what we want to do is build a new type of smart contract insurance platform we think one of the biggest hurdles in d5 is all the hacks that have been happening and basically we need to be able to keep the average users um value safe so the way we're thinking about it is there's three parties there's the projects that we're gonna sell the insurance to we're gonna sell it to them basically wholesale they're going to pay a small fee it's going to cover all of their total value locked or whatever they want to have covered we'll just cover it then there's going to be stakers on the other side they put up the capital for the insurance and they're basically going to get one of the highest yields in all d5 and we can talk about how we want to sort of integrate that with ob and maybe deposit that capital onto off and then internally we're going to have an audit team which basically one of the biggest issues with insurance right now in d5 is the pricing is a lot of lack everything's too expensive and so our team is basically going to have be incentivized to go through every project smart contracts and price the risk accurately for our stakers and in the white hat hacker panel that happened yesterday basically they were talking about how the auditors and projects are not vertically integrated like you pay an auditor they go through it and you know they they don't really look at the project again sometimes um and we think this is a way where we can have that team that audit team sort of work with projects over a longer term basis and try to keep them safe um so happy to talk about this in more detail there's a ton of stuff in it smart contract insurance platform but we want to integrate it with av and yeah love to hear you guys feedback yeah whoever has some thoughts on that just just go right ahead on mu yeah whoever wants to i think maybe like stanley and jordan or um mark probably best position probably know the ecosystem the best i think it's you you're very right like you're going like uh one of the issue in the whole security and insurance space like in d5 i think it's uh like based on your pitch it sounds like a very interesting project uh if i can give like some idea as well like uh one of the thing that could be interesting is find a way to integrate uh what you are building with even like the governance flow because uh sometimes like there is a team that will make a proposal governance proposal and the proposal contains like payload and that team that build like the proposition uh for the protocol might want to take insurance with your project to say okay actually like basically the payload will never have like much change that would be like a security bring security issue in the protocol but that could be like something that is part uh i think there is like no product at all like there is not many insurance products but there is absolutely no product that uh look at uh the governance activity even so like uh yeah this is just something on top of my head based on what you just said it could be interesting to check so you're talking about insuring like new proposal changes or ensuring a new proposal sort of yeah yeah so for example like uh a team that make a proposal to governance like that proposal contain code and just like having a way that when that hit com when that team comes with the proposal could say okay we we have uh also the backing of senford insurance and i don't know what we will name but yeah yeah yeah okay i like that i thought a lot yeah but good idea thank you yeah one thing i can mention something is that uh the the safety modules taking a database is is some sort of uh kind of like a risk transfer and uh one of the interesting things is that if uh if there's some sort of like a reinsurance uh or like further risk risk transfers or chopping up the different risk in in in pockets tranches those are kind of like interesting uh topics uh tying tying the insurance with with governance is it's quite fascinating i really think that's uh that could be a game changer actually yeah we've spent a lot of time looking at the uh the safety module and i read some of your comments about the wrist charging and having like mezzanine and junior and that sort of thing that seems like a really cool idea and the reinsurance part as well like who's going to ensure the safety module stake on ave you know like you guys can't insure everything of yourselves so maybe you need something at some point or reinsurance in case you know there's excess loss so we think there's something to do here wait any other team members want to um get some feedback for that if not thanks jack cool idea i'm looking forward to see it uh thanks so much guys appreciate it um next up we have vb i don't think it's metallic um but i'm happy to hear their idea regardless you're muted [Music] hey yeah hey hey everyone so it's phoebe sweets and i mostly work on the fondant side of things in the crypto space so one of the hardest right now i'm facing is uh saffron and dev when i'm writing integration tests for your front ends i'm having to deal with the multiple wallets so we have metamask wallet connect etc so my idea will be the tooling category where i'm hoping to build a cross web 3 wallets testing framework so yeah it will be like a set of utilities that allow one to write tests once and then they'll be able to run against various wallets yeah and as a demo i'm hoping to write uh integration tests against the ave front and up so yeah i'm not sure if that qualifies us and yeah i have a integration yeah but uh i'm also curious to know if the current of a fronted up i don't know if you like do you like everything tests uh yeah really get the front end up yeah and uh yeah because i don't think it's open source so i couldn't check that i think i think that i think is i definitely is really really useful like usually as you probably know like in this in this kind of hackathon people tend to to work more in economic parts and so on but precisely what you are mentioning is like a really really weak point right now on development even for us like for us it's really difficult right now we have like as you probably saw there are like 10 wallets or something like that some are using wallet connect the others are native on the browser the other is ledger the other and you know it's a lot a lot of troubles in for users for example like specifically ledger and so on so i think it will be like like really really good and for sure we are gonna we are gonna support you gladly it's yeah at the end you if you don't have the tooling it's impossible to to be like the mature material but your products and and sadly like in this ecosystem is still not the highest priority so yeah go for it about the no right now we don't have one github our client but but we can we can work on that to make you like give you access or however we do but for sure we will support it cool yes an excellent idea so to reach out to us um directly and we can see what we can do with the uh the front uh front end client code yeah we get a lot of um support issues with various wallets so yeah definitely would want to see see you build something like that [Music] anybody else of 18 want to give feedback on that or yeah definitely i mean like um like it was said sometimes people tend to focus on like a flashier financial integration but tooling is really crucial and actually some of the we've had finalists from previous hackathons who just build um like a vs code integration or some sort of tooling that's really useful but hasn't been hasn't been built yet so definitely a good idea um i believe we have samuel up next [Music] hi everyone go ahead okay um kanye mcclelly please hello okay okay um i was actually thinking why can't we um kind of use i was thinking of using um d5 for insurance in terms of real world for real world exam real reward examples like example trying to use um trying to put different in terms of health like pandemic like i don't know like this pandemic that is going on right now around the world people actually need to like kind of ensure their health like using i can building i was think of building something related to that but i'm not i'm still trying to see how i'm going to figure that out like using medic for medical insurance kind of i don't know if you think it's something possible but it's an idea that's been ringing through my head i'm thinking of how to implement it sure yeah i think the one the one tough thing with with health records and health data is there's a lot of regulations surrounding um how you handle that data so if you're doing any sort of um mainnet ethereum integration with health records it would be a pretty big challenge to actually um do that properly and without breaking the law um i i'd be curious what other people have to say if you if i know people come from a lot of different backgrounds and if you have some healthcare experience but that's my my basic knowledge so it might be a challenge to do something related to insurance on chain without um using something like this zero knowledge groups to obfuscate the data or disconnect it from accounts you do have to use anonymous identifiers and any private health information in most like first world jurisdictions can't go on chain yeah i think like if i can add there is like two things that i can think of like basically one of the issues in insurance is getting the liquidity uh to ensure like getting the capital so this is for example the way i see the case for the credit delegation uh you could have like uh some smart contract that gets credit delegated uh liquidity for the insurance uh but then you definitely need a part that is like off chain uh basically to to bridge the real world and not like necessarily bringing bringing like else data on chain uh but managing like uh basically as if you were building a health insurance company but that's your capital comes from dubai in the background i think that's the easiest uh way oh okay thank you and to add to that i i definitely that's uh interesting point because if you get uh this streamlines like you can stream your liquidity with credit delegation it practically gives a competitive advantage to new uh kind of innovation in the uh financial technology space practically uh the different uh front-end business models uh you know insurances and and whatnot because you can start up a some sort of a product insurance product and get liquidity from d5 if you get the uh credit delegations and define your c excited and uh regarding the data it doesn't i mean it's it's all about kind of like risk right so uh i guess like when you go to the personal level health data data and so forth it's a bit challenging but i mean uh there's quite accurate uh uh you know applications software where you can track how for example [Music] some viruses spread let's say how coffee to spread into particular area and then increase and decrease uh the pricing of the insurance so let's say uh if you will be uh in finland uh and and because you know it's the coffee doesn't spread that much here uh you know the the pricing might be cheaper but when when the person goes to uk the pricing changes uh because if you are in an area where there's a lot of cases and and so forth so it can be quite uh interesting but also like as insurance uh insurance is pretty much derivatives and and as a financial instrument so uh you could uh create uh derivatives to pretty much anything i could imagine uh one one industry particularly let's say you have um you have rockets right you you ship rockets to space launch rockets to space and and and in each rocket let's say falcon axis going up there is quite a lot of uh different other companies there they have their nano satellites you know various components and they cost uh millions at least hundreds of thousands you know just a product but all the research and development involved and getting that thing up and those are kind of a very high risk industries that uh you know i don't know where they get their insurances but it could be interesting where where uh you will have a market to something like that i mean if they get go to orbit and same for let's say in help this this using um kind of like held in a in a more less personal way but uh i could for example imagine the help thing that if you are an area where there is a lot of you know kind of like accidents then the insurance cost is it's different and then you can price it with with oracle's and then get the liquidity uh from from credit delegation and and kind of find combine these different uh not just like money legos but layers like one thing i i i think what's cool is that you can combine layers that you have the d5 layer you have something in between the bridging and then then the traditional finance layer let's say an insurance and going to the mainstream so this layering up is pretty interesting yeah i guess it depends on and how ambitious you're feeling because it this it sounds like this would be a pretty big project especially for you know a few week hackathon um and if maybe you do or do not have experience with like oracle's but you it seems pretty big um the idea itself like i guarantee that there will be you know on chain health insurance in some capacity in the next five years or something maybe sooner but for a hackathon this seems like a big problem and maybe there's a way to you know break it down into some smaller component where you're sketching out the idea for it but you're not necessarily building the entire thing ideally we we have you building something as a submission but um yeah maybe maybe write up your ideas and um try to get some more feedback on on that how big you want to make the scope for this three-week hackathon i'll also i'd just like to you muted david oh i think his his headphones have pulled out not sure what happened yeah you were just you were just talking and uh i couldn't hear you yeah you bike you're about to start over not right damn it can you still hear me yeah okay perfect uh yeah i think about bluetooth drop down um but anyway yeah so so it about it was about i'm fair evader so uh what this uh high compound project did pretty well actually was that they would um everyone would pay a subscription fee each week let's say the fare cost was like i don't know ten dollars a week but the subscription fee might be two dollars a week and they tried to get hundreds or thousands of people paying two dollars a week and then anytime someone would get caught by these uh fair authorities on the tram uh then you'd get the fine ticket then that would be your proof that you got fined and then you they would just pay that fine for you from that pool of money um so that was like a form of insurance and sort of outside the system um so so i'd put out there that you know health insurance doesn't i mean excluding america because health insurance is like really expensive there um but if you capped like the health insurance amount so like you know maybe a few thousand dollars um a model like that where someone like is streaming a certain amount of money or like as danny and jordan mentioned credit delegating like incurring a small debt each week uh then it goes to a pool of funds and then you know if you can somehow work out uh probably add some game theory around you know having someone verify that yeah you had a health bill that was you know 10 000 uh and you've been paying the subscription fee for x amount of time maybe you get access to that that's just an idea what hackathon was that uh a startup weekend uh in melbourne nice yeah i like that it was a good idea and actually we had uh but then they got a cease and desist from uh the metropolitan uh transportation authority i can't imagine why exactly but you could do that in d5 now um back then it would be pretty oh this is before before d5 like exactly oh yeah even better you could you could do it on chain all right thank you samuel um i think we're gonna we're gonna move on to the next person uh but i look forward to seeing how you how you attack this problem and it's it's scope um let's see the next i have on the list is guiles or geez yes jill hi everybody so yeah my name is jill uh uh i'm i come from i'm living in israel but i come from france uh so the idea of the our idea we are not a team of four people and the idea is to make a a swap platform but for multiple tokens at the time and let me tell you the use case uh typical use case so typically for a user that doesn't know too much the defy market it doesn't have a too high budget so we will enable to make a swap of up to five tokens based on pre-selected list inspired from uh the fighters for example like top five dexes top five derivative top five uh lending platforms and you will be able to buy for let's say one thousand dollar five hundred dollar all of these at the time and in the same transaction so here is the technology part like uh it will buy uh all the the five tokens at the time we want to simplify the usage for uh i would say uh newbie uh people so i was wondering i mean all in all it doesn't i i'm trying to find uh i mean this is the concept and i'm trying to find a way to connect ave functionality somehow if you have ideas guys i would be happy to to hear i heard maybe i didn't understand well but uh a leverage effect this could be something also that we could do like in the swap we could multiply by 10x the amount take a loan and uh and maybe have a preferable rate i don't know if it's possible if it's uh if it's fine to do that just uh maybe something i understood or understand understood wrong in any case this is the the concept make it very simple predefined list of tokens of successful tokens both in one single transaction and with the reverse operation of course making it possible to buy back all the five tokens to the the basic uh currency which is which can be usdc or die so i'd be happy to to to hear if you have a comments on this idea or suggestion on how maybe we can integrate uh ave somehow in this uh application so would this be like an index that somebody can buy and sell into yeah some kind of index yeah i okay it could be an index or even um taking that actual underlying um so so i think it's a pretty good idea i'm thinking someone like my brothers who aren't that technical but they want to hold some d5 or get in the space you know an easy way for them to click one button and purchase a bunch of tokens that would be cool uh one way to easily implement rv is just also to include in that one button click would be depositing in rv so you buy this you know five tokens blue chip tokens and automatically deposit them in rv uh then of course like emilia i mentioned before you could have the auto leverage uh if they wanted to take on more risk um using flash loans and then you know so you can extend their their position so yeah there's a few ways i think you could integrate quite easily okay there could be also another usage i mean the uh being able to to swap two to five tokens at the time uh in the same transaction i mean the cost of transaction is so high these times and uh i don't know if it's going to last but at least for a few weeks or a few months we would see a times with uh 500 grays maybe 400 so it's very expensive so the fact that you can swap multiple tokens at a time can have also an advantage not only uh for beginners i mean this is a quite simple application but then also we can also enhance that with uh multiple currencies at a time so maybe somehow i have a uh i mean i'm yes i don't know i i think one of the suggestions is that like you said for for right now the biggest problem is is the gas cost the thing is that even if you batch together like the buying of five tokens and you connect let's say the wine to uni swap uh you will not have so big advantage in the sense if if the flow is that the user enters to your application he clicks a button and a transaction is triggered that it buys like under the scenes from i don't know for initial switches or balance or whatever it buys five tokens instead if you for example have a tokenization on top on your site on your contract and you do like batches of acquiring tokens i think it could be cheaper like if you for your users it's not a high requirement that they buy the token right now at this price but it's more like i want to invest value of one thousand dollars in in a set of five tokens you can buy in one transaction like a certain amount of tokens and then the users just go to to your contract and take part of those tokens but they already don't need to to to swapping unit or anything excuse me how was the feature that you're talking about there is no no name of the feature is that is the that is the objective i suppose i'm saying that the the cost comes when you need to to swap tokens immediately like when you need to to you go with with 10 usdc and you want to buy imagine have a talk from unison no there is the cost but if you buy in batch like one thousand a in value of other tokens and then people just comes over time with 10 10 10 and takes from your contract you already don't need of course you need to have some price and maybe it's a bit more complicated but uh yeah i mean in the scope of this academy i think it's this is doable and pretty simple and uh of course there will be there can be a lot of improv improvements maybe scheduling also uh scheduling the action of buying is uh at a low gas price can be also something but okay anyway so this is uh this was my my question on my uh participation thank you for listening listening to me guys thank you appreciate it next up is benson do you want to share benson oh sure hi guys can you hear me great um i was thinking of uh an idea i guess it's uh insurance i guess you've had two insurance uh ideas earlier um it's almost more like life insurance um being able to maybe uh sell maybe it could be short term could be one year two year type life insurance to anyone and um basically uh people who use ave depositors could borrow against their assets in ivy and basically uh the insurance uh part of it they would become like almost like the reinsurers they would buy uh small chunks of that insurance so let's say if you had three clients uh um let's see and if they bought nine thousand dollars worth of insurance you could tokenize it to like one dollar tokens and then uh depositors of of avery could then borrow against their deposits and buy any number of those tokens and of course you know let's say you could have like 9 000 investors so in a way it almost like becomes like they become the reinsurers and of course if no one dies you know they get whatever money is collected from the pool let's say it's done annually possibly or it could be done monthly they get to share uh in uh you know um you know what's it the pro rata type way uh what's it then it's averaged out to um the investors and um and uh that way they get additional interest on their borrowed funds so they're able to use their current assets to um i guess get interest on you know in ave and then also borrow against that and invest in something else and get additional interest in it that was sort of what i was thinking yeah very cool i'm not i'm not too well versed in insurance um i don't know maybe stanley or jordan or mark you guys i think maybe know a bit more about this area yeah i think i think the project is uh is very nice as well like uh there is definitely something with the the ranchers that that is interesting like uh maybe everything can be done like within the same uh like maybe there is even ways to to simplify like we just said i just need to think a bit more about it but yeah it's a it's a cool idea as well maybe someone from the more technical side has ideas yeah i only thought about it last night so um you know i kind of sketched it out a little bit you know in terms of what the cash flows could be like yeah the idea seems cool i think we can catch up later like without following maybe brainstorming when the the idea will be more refined initially okay that would be better but the the baseline idea i think is pretty interesting thanks it's really good that a lot of people working on insurance products as well i think that's a a really good area um there's a lot of the design space there is is quite large so it's pretty cool yeah plus it brings in like additional capital into the system i guess but trent yeah muted again anybody else have some feedback if not yeah i mean like one thinking like uh i mean definitely insurance is is is interesting and especially kind of like what what kind of ideas there could be and uh many of the insurance is like this this kind of like a pool model what's exciting there is that um people can take different kinds of risk you know you could you could let others to insure you you know completely and they get less yield uh those who are receiving the insurance and play with this this functionality that you have uh a group of uh people and and pooled systems so i i think there is a lot of solutions out there and even if you look at traditional uh insurance space or let's say like there isn't much that much innovation in even like in in fintech uh space so i think probably like we'll see interesting stuff so it was quite an interesting idea thanks all right thanks benson all right thank you very much uh we're gonna move on to the next person i think we skipped over a few people up in the chat who couldn't raise their hands so i'll just do that manually i think uh gawain tell me if i'm pronouncing that right but um if you want to share your what you got yep so i'm gawain um i am currently um right now i have a team of four right now um for sure possibly five but um the idea um is actually around the music space and um it has to do with brands and um independent creators connecting directly through tokenization um the platform would basically consist of different obvi use cases like creator advances obviously probably maybe taking advantage of the flash loans and then also staking incentives for brands because obviously we want to attract brands so what's one of the best ways besides just creative talent obviously is money so uh they can partake in staking incentives uh as well on the platform and that the idea is to be able to distribute um these staking incentives or staking to different creators as well kind of opening up the space for um additional projects they may want to do or or whatnot or you know whatever their case their case may be in that awesome so it would be like uh the basic the basic is like a platform to bring artists and and brand together right we're not necessarily just artists um the platform has both video and audio so let's say you're a director or something and you have an idea to pitch a tv show well you would want to to connect with a brand that could maybe stream your tv show and you know pull you on and whatnot so awesome uh yeah i think that there is a lot of things like uh that can be done even like in terms of payments like you you can people can be paid in in a token so they have like interest uh accurating tokens in the payment like uh definitely something interesting uh for me as well i would love to to brainstorm a bit more like also get a bit more details and to see like how we can be with ave and everything but yeah absolutely nice one thank you i agree with jordan by the way uh jordan and myself we used to dj that's a musical background so so we love that sort of idea yeah i actually i was a producer for about i've been in the music industry for about almost about 19 years or so so well i i am a drummer so i think we can make market make party with the band and everything that sounds funny but great great idea i think um yeah yeah just um let us know how we can how we can help or how we can work together i think yeah the obvious one is you know the staking and depositing assets yeah um but probably need some more details to try and brainstorm on you know some other interesting use cases around that another problem yeah pretty cool and it's especially kind of like uh taking advantage of like financial protocol and and bringing it into into a very interesting uh space is is super super exciting and like the the traditional you know creative world and music is in so many ways broken so there's there's a bunch of things you could do and uh yeah i mean this is this sounds awesome thanks [Music] great we've got about 10 minutes left so we're going to try and get through at least a few more hackers um before i forget i'll just go through some of the logistics so tomorrow is the kickoff um donnie will be there hopefully a bunch of the avid team will be there as well and obviously we want to see the hackers there this is going to be a general introduction to you know what you can expect or what what the expectations are for you as a hacker the guidelines for the event the rules we'll hear from sponsors about what their specific prizes are and if you can make it we'd love to have you so that's tomorrow at 12 eastern so noon uh it'll be about in two hours i think we have scheduled for it and the big big event is um stani is going to be having a conversation with anthony pompliano or the pomp if you know him from crypto twitter um definitely a big voice in the bitcoin community so we're interested to hear what their conversation is going to be so again tomorrow at 12 noon eastern uh you should have received a calendar invite but if not we'll uh it'll be streaming on the youth global youtube channel and then obviously live.ethglobal.com so make sure to show up for that tomorrow and it's going to be it's going to be a really interesting conversation i'm sure uh last few bits of housekeeping would be if you do have team members who haven't staked or are in some sort of uh they're in limbo please reach out as soon as possible we want to get everybody on board and ready to go for hacking to start after kickoff tomorrow so reach out to an equivalent team member as soon as possible um so that would be today in the next few hours so we can get everybody processed and ready to go for uh hacking to start this weekend i think that's it uh avi do you guys have any like logistical things you want to cover before we hit a few more people if not just give me a thumbs up cool all right uh so we're going to try and hit a few more hackers and luis i think you were next in the chat so why don't you go ahead and give a short summary of your project and anybody we don't get to um write down your idea share it in the discord and somebody from the ave team or the global team will be sure to respond so uh just because you don't get to share it here doesn't mean we won't give you feedback so go ahead lewis take it away thank you trent basically the idea is based around sports a payment network for athletes ranging from college athletes to professional athletes universities can host nodes or oracle soaking stadiums use cases can be for scholarships for college athletes and for professional athletes they could could range from x percentage of revenue of ticket sales or jersey sales governing tokens as well further in the example of nfl there's 32 teams who do 32 representatives from each team that dictate what percentage they're going to receive from either ticket sales or jersey sales or any other factor that is integrated into the payment but that's pretty much it it's not not built or anything it's just an idea as of now thanks guys okay so this is some sort of you're you're automating the back end for these large franchise agreements something like that right and then adding adding a little bit of governance in and i think the the value lies in in college athletes giving them a voice and financial independence and giving them access to the money and through this they could be able to whatever money they make on the platform either stake it or invest it back in to whatever they want so you would be paying college athletes as well with the idea would be that universities would also work on this and they would pay the athletes through scholarships but they could also earn money through the ticket sales of their games or jersey sales or any other stuff yeah one of the really unfortunate things about college sports is that i know at least in the us um college athletes they can't make any income or they're just they they bring a lot of revenue from playing but they actually don't get paid other than scholarships um even i don't even think they can do like sponsored uh like clothing or any sort of sponsorship deals so it's it's a pretty shitty deal for them because you know they're they're doing tons of work and and bringing revenue into the school but they can't uh benefit from the upside so this is like a big problem i know it's been talked about for many years um if anything it's a really interesting new approach to something that i don't think has seen really much innovation in quite a while thank you for for the feedback if anybody else wants to i'd be happy to hear that sounds like a cool idea i don't know much about college or u.s college uh sports um but just from what trent trent said maybe one way would be um you know if the colleges are paying into some fun which get deposited on rv and they earn interest uh then maybe instead of the college athletes getting paid out straight away maybe it goes to some time-locked contract so they're technically not getting paid um but yeah maybe in four years time five years time when they finish college uh they get access to some funds or maybe even they just instead of getting paid they get some some of the governance power right so they don't get paid in the uh underlying like fiat currency but they get minted some gov tokens of some sort uh you know that and they can use that as to you know show do some voting or show what they however they want to govern inside inside their organization cool yeah great idea i'm looking forward to seeing more you write about it a little bit more and see the project progress we're going to move on really quickly to the next people um and hopefully we can get through them uh keita do you want to share really quickly what you're working on um it kind of seems like my ideas kind of been taken a little bit but uh it was something related to music um i mean just a preface i'm a beginner so uh i figured it was kind of lofty but like the idea was to create some sort of token that you could invest capital into a musician's projects in but i had the concern that people with capital would get to have a lot of sway over the musicians uh creative decisions so i wanted to implement some sort of mechanism to um i guess potentially balance that with i don't know say how much you listen to the artist or uh how long you've held the token to just kind of uh balance out like having a massive amount of money versus having a lot of well being invested into a musician in a different way i guess yeah no so big general comment is even if somebody's doing the same idea as you um well the first thing is you can see if they if they want a partner if they have space on their team or you want them to join yours there's no no problem with combining forces if you think there's some synergy or you guys can team up and the second thing is even if you don't team up or you have a similar idea uh you guys are all going to come up with different solutions to the same problem so don't be worried about you know pursuing similar ideas just because it's similar uh but yeah i i think what you're what you're going for is interesting um you you said you're a beginner so maybe one of the suggestions i'd have you look at is audience they're kind of one of the bigger companies and they're doing some interesting stuff with um you know building a community of musicians and they're really picking up recently so look into them if you haven't already what was it audience a-u-d-i-u-s speaking of audience actually jordan dropped a tune there uh thank you i recommend to to uh to listen it it's hormone on uh audios i think maybe with all these djs in here we should get a music channel going and and have some some dj sessions in the discord that'd be great exactly okay so thanks for sharing um we've got two minutes left so we're going to go really quick through the last two i see here how about cook do you want to share hi everyone i'm cook from mexico from zenbit we are in a startup and we are developing an experimental game to teach new users how to use uh inter basic interaction on ethereum like sync transactions [Music] tokens or transfer tokens so we we in the game we have some nfts that led users to accomplish some actions inside the game but we are thinking to implement some um defy nfps like to teach some basic interactions to users for uh i am interested in credit delegation or lending uh function from [Music] a protocol and but uh thinking on on the user experience as many have said the gas fees are something that i think it's a problem especially for new users and so i'm thinking in uh giving uh the the players especially for mexican players that a castle is nft that let probably the users use the nft to pay the the gas fees inside the game or or for further interactions or for other contracts protocols i mean but basically we are making a game to to teach new users how to to use ethereum interactions and focus on on mexican users especially i think that's awesome onboarding is a is a huge challenge you know especially in in high gas fees so if any and all unique solutions are i'm really curious to see how people approach us differently so cool i'm looking forward to what you come up with one thing i just want to add to this um in our docs um for rav2 all our a tokens have a permit function uh so that allows gasless token transfers which essentially means you sign you sign something and submit someone else will conduct that transaction for you um so that might be relevant and a way to make it cheaper for your users and and some other things i've seen with these sort of learning platforms is one way is you know have someone have them pay up front to to try their learning platform sort of staking it and then when they complete the course then they get that money back but if you deposit in an rv then that means they get more money than they started with um so maybe that will cover some of the transaction costs uh depending on how you're how long the the game uh is good on the on that part in the lending part um i've been thinking on probably open a vault on ave that could be linked to some uh nfts that led users to to probably use the nft as collateral for for for lending and us as a as as a provider of service uh absorb that cost for the for the new user in like for example a small loans that that could be a cheap for new users uh probably use the the the nft as a collateral for for for for those of them yeah we don't have like uh nfts collateral at the moment on rv um if you wanted to build something that's probably another product that you could also look into building is like a uh somehow valuing nfts uh then allowing them to you know borrow money uh that's more of a like whole lending uh nft lending platform good but in general i i appreciate the session because there are a lot of good ideas to implement and especially for the the other protocol thanks good stuff great and we are going to really quickly move on to the last one kenneth if you are able to share real quick what you're working on yes i am working on utilizing ave within the oil and gas industry as well as logistics with uh the transportation of uh 18 wheelers for ave can you be more specific about um what is what it is you're integrating with obvious yes it'll be for uh oil and gas transportation of crude oil within the uh oil industry uh is what i'm really looking at and there's several ways to go about it and it's such a broad field in utilizing blockchain and bringing it into oil and gas and utilizing avi uh within the sector of oil and gas so that's what i've been working on in uh open to any suggestions would be great is is there like a um is there a practice that you're looking now for for an idea that uh and then you know that you want to improve that industry with with uh somehow with with uh decentralized finance or or ethereum and practically you need some kind of idea to to get things started yes i i have a couple ideas i've been pondering on as well uh such as uh for payments within the oil and gas industry with when it comes to the oil itself in the crude oil itself and how they pay for uh the third party gets paid by the company itself and situations to it's such a broad perspective and what's in oil and gas itself and there's so many things that you can do in regards to payments and i'm just open for any ideas that you may have to offer to me would be great yeah i think we've heard a couple other people talk about um you know these really big legacy industries like the music industry or uh sports and there's just huge potential for all of them and i think that um something like oil and gas there's like all of these legacy industries that are running on um traditional payment infrastructure there's always an opportunity to insert some a little bit of defy into all of them where it makes sense whether it's you know just improving the payments infrastructure i know you're there are some projects who are looking at like tokenizing invoices um i'm sure the oil and gas industry works on a similar system of invoices that are paid after a certain date and then contractors are not able to have any liquidity for work that they've already done or exiting with their their funds so maybe that's something to look at there um if anybody else has other suggestions uh even even something like having contracts in um adai or ausdc brings a little bit more brings a little bit of defy into this this uh older industry yeah but besides what trent's already said i mean i mean you know you i guess you would be the the expert in the oil and gas industry kind of so uh feel free to jump on discord uh and and discuss it with us there you can also post like you you should know the problems in the industry and then maybe we can help you brainstorm on how to solve those problems because you know personally i don't know anything about trucking or industry um so yeah if you sort of come with some problems and we can discuss on discord i think that will be the best way yeah that would be great i really appreciate everything that y'all have shared with me today throughout the call and i've had the opportunity to learn so much from all the questions and the responses y'all have given so i'm very grateful for everything uh that i've learned today thank you so much thanks kenneth okay we're gonna wrap here sorry if we bumped into any of anybody else's meetings but um thank you for
