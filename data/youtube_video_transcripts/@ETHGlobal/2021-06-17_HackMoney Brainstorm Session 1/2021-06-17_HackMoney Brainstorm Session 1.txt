that's okay hey cash are you are you looking to uh is funding early-stage startups that are seeking ways to uh improve climate change is that is that the purpose of what you're wanting to do or are you wanted to figure out how to be able to bring the crypto sphere into funding early stage startups in general so where i'm at with my research so far is that the capital requirements of climate startups is higher than that of software startups so i was thinking about how the beachhead market for general seed stage and angel stage funding would be climate startups but then you could expand from that into a general protocol for um startups in general for vc funding in general like it's it there's a lot of work involved to setting up a dow that can receive funding give funding be be an investor and maybe there is something there where you could make it super easy to spin up a dow for these purposes well for early stage funding i mean speaking just for the u.s right i mean um you having to be a registered broker dealer you know with finra you know for doing a raise you know to keep it really simple i think you could focus on reg cf or reg d uh you know investments or raises which don't require a broker dealer uh you know that way you can broaden the spectrum of potential investors and those that would be complying within the dow to be able to you know start that off and just focus on ways with which you know you can go about it um requiring a broker dealer yeah that makes a lot of sense and and another idea uh this one was inspired by stripe is to sell carbon credits that haven't been made yet so like if you're if you're a uh carbon capture startup and you don't have the funding required to build your pilot project you can pre-sell the carbon credit credits from the pilot project at a high rate to raise the funding for you to build a carbon to build the pilot project so that might be an approachable um thing we could do that it may be okay maybe to like distill this idea into something more concrete you could do something where here's a website where you can crowdfund the sale of carbon credits for uh your climate carbon capture pilot project as a nice little thing so does the dow uh would the dow be receiving equity in that startup for doing this or would it be just uh you know crowdfunding the idea so to speak you know as a platform to get some early stage investment but no equity involved to keep it simple for the purposes of this hackathon maybe we just skip away from equity because looking at the whole like erc 1400 or 22 something for figuring those out there's there's a lot of question marks around the legal engineering and maybe that's just too much to bite off for this or love to connect after sweden me too and i i abdicate the rest of my time so whoever's next awesome uh thanks thanks for sharing that that um and again these conversations can continue so track down people we're gonna um add a um a discord link in the sign up sheet so you can put your discord handle so people can follow up so our next uh team is or hacker is layer exchange hello simon here hello hello uh yeah so this idea is basically taking lp tokens that you would be storing in pools or at least receiving from your assets that you put into different exchanges at different decks however you would have a vault in the middle which would create a synthetic usd version of that pair so that you can actually mimic what that lp would that lpe receipt would be store that lp token in the vault and then trade with yield markets at the same time so in other words it becomes a decentralized vault but you can also earn yield on it at the same time and if there needs to be more clarity i can go into more detail yeah definitely go into me more detail this so if you have you have a number of exchanges and if you're parking an asset you can receive you get an lp token in return once you have that you are you do of course might have the opportunity of earning off of that because as people are trading on these exchanges then you get commission so if you could actually consider this as a yield opportunity as opposed to just it being stuck in the exchange then you could have a vault in between so that you could allocate a synthetic version to other yield markets and therefore be able to well keep your storage in those different exchanges whilst also earning yield at the same time on other markets that's interesting anybody have any thoughts or where you might look or anybody interested in joining the hack that's also possible yeah uh this is topper here i think that's pretty cool idea i've actually been thinking a lot about like these lp tokens basically capital inefficient right the money just sits there not working and yeah um uh one thing we always we looked at a lot of options because it's a great um uh great underlying asset for selling on options because the you can sit there and yield well and mostly have it sit there unless you have to pay out right exactly the the ultimately if you're able to gather enough users uh you might end up with a peer-to-peer lending market in the end but you really need to have a ton of users to make that possible and of course it's been very difficult to get that type of product off the ground um so yeah uh i would love to chat with anybody to some depths as well but i would really love to uh flesh out our smart contracts what we have already and uh yeah hopefully build something that would make well good of this hackathon didn't ave start adding lp tokens as as collateral or am i wrong about that yeah maybe you know you should reach out to the aviators maybe maybe i'm actually only familiar yeah yeah yeah definitely and just as a general i know if you haven't done it yeah global hackathon before like definitely reach out directly to the sponsors in their channels like they have their technical teams here and they definitely want to just hear from you and play play ideas especially at the beginning when everybody's thinking about what you're building so we definitely reach out to ave great thank you cool cool thank you simon and uh our next project is hippodrome that's me i was just talking to copper i don't leave my camera off sorry i'm just in a spot where it's hard to turn it on for the moment um but so hear me out on this this is a little crazy but um so we're building a game crypto coliseum it brings in a lot of um like kind of crypto curious or like new folks to crypto um and one of the big things that they have it one of the big problems that they have is when they're trying to like onboard onto blockchain so we don't have any like kind of like fresh people have like never heard of crypto but like a lot of them have like maybe have some stuff on finance or like coinbase or something like that and that's it like and so when they come to play a real blockchain game they're like oh this is cool i want to like move on to polygon and also i like i hear i hear this like cool yield on there like how do i do all that stuff um right now the answer is like really hard for folks they have to the the polygon bridge is like you know it looks nice but the actual like material process of going through that is okay take your take your eth from essential exchange move it into your metamask on the eth network make sure you're there now go to this bridge follow the instructions there which includes like switching the network of your meta mask after doing that um and then once you're on polygon okay go to you know one inch or ave or whatever you need to do now that you have this ethan you can do stuff there and it's just like it's an extremely complicated system um with gaskets the way they are now it's actually it's not that expensive it's like eight bucks or something like that but um when i go back to 100 it's like a hundred dollars to do that also um and so what exists though is ren protocol has a way to bridge um dogecoin onto um polygon directly um and doge as crazy as it is has some interesting characteristics one being it's got really cheap transactions it's like two bucks and so for new users the process could be hey go to this page um there will be a you know click a couple buttons and there'll be an address to send your doge to send your dog's there and then choose what output currency you want you know whether that's ethermatic or if you want to go direct you know here's a few safe yield devices whether that's ave or stake or dial or something like that and you just go directly from value on your centralized exchange send it one transaction to this page and now you've ended up with a you know a yield bearing asset or you know or just medic that you want to do something else with so a way to super easy bring value from centralized exchanges um and from people kind of new to the crypto space and bring them into the deep ecosystem that's really cool i think we're always really excited to see any project that is focused on onboarding new to world hackers um and people just into the space i think we all we all benefit from that kind of work yeah you know it's funny i've been in the space for a while so i think of this stuff as easy but then we've just been working with so many more new users than i ever have before and it's like this stuff is so hard still cool anyone else have any other thoughts or do you have a team currently or are you looking for specific help on your project uh we do have a team but um you know this is the kind of project where i would love the like the inputs come in they have doge and maybe bitcoin for the you know the more serious people or whatever um but uh um but the outputs i think are kind of interesting right like it's this is a i think it's a cool lego where the you can have the choice of different things come out there it's pretty cool so we'd love to talk to anybody that's interested in that because i honestly believe that this will be the easiest way um for people to cover the polygon oh and the other thing i should say the other part of this is for the doge people folks who are also you know cryptocurious mostly right they mostly bought doge and they love the means and stuff but there's nothing you can do with your doge right now um and so what this would actually offer um is an incentivized liquidity pool um on a polygon where you could take your doge make more doge which is actually you know i've been asking in their discord and stuff like for is there anything i can do to make money on this and the answer is generally no um and so um it's like i think it and i think polygon and doge marry pretty well actually um in terms of like you know for the for the new folks the low transaction costs and all that stuff was it's pretty good um and then also um there's right now the brand it takes like about an hour to bridge a doge over which is kind of bad but if doge folks wanted to make point one percent per hour on their doge they could offer like quick bridging so basically it's a it's a loan that you get to like basically get your doge to matic in three seconds and if you're if you're long doge if you really believe in it you can make a decent amount of money with almost no risk um just building up your doge um anyway that was a long-winded way of saying um anyone who's interested in like the polygon has projects on there and has kind of new folks that they want to bring in would love to talk to them cool awesome thanks for um thanks for bringing it up and again continue the conversation please everyone um people are putting in their discord names so something triggers you later reach out for sure thanks our next um project or hacker is favor chiqueta favor are you here so yeah hi hi guys um so a member of the team um tapa just spoke about the project uh okay yeah so you're good you're good um so you are already on his team or are you interested is that what you're saying hey i'm already on his team oh okay yeah sorry miss communication and putting stuff in there don't worry this is an informal discussion uh how about hippodrome are you guys here that was us sorry again i don't know why this oh i'm multitasking um autonet support net here hi hey um andrei here i'm a product manager from bucharest romania i'm working on this infrastructure on this distributed infrastructure for training and running tensorflow apps so ai apps um it sort of touches on the on what cache was saying the first project having this distributed investment framework however to keep it like trustless you need to have a closed loop like the production needs to be somehow on the on chain so basically this is something that i've been researching for a while um it's a way where um tensorflow developers can train their models for free and by having other investors pay for the training and the training is basically the we can call it mining the virtual machines that the miners run have all the libraries of tensorflow the client is based on um flutter which has um you know tensorflow lite and there are some map reduce nodes this is really technical but there are some nodes that distribute the loads the data set and the instructions between the the nodes that actually do the training and then once the models are mature enough to be actually you know commercially relevant the revenue that they generate will be distributed between the developers and the people who invested in the training um if that makes sense um the reason that why i think this is worth working on is just to allow anyone to be a shareholder of ai services you know um while human labor is becoming more irrelevant more tasks are being automated we need a way that anyone can share the revenue that ai models can uh generate and having it um you know crowdsourced it we can have the price per goal per invocation though it can be cheaper than the services that you get with amazon with google even though their data centers are much more optimized for training ai just the sheer scale of this uh network that blockchain mining has created allows us to price it more competitively there are a bunch of challenges but i'm past the proof of concept point like successfully distributed uh data sets and managed to account for the cycles that each node dedicates towards the training so i'm not really sure what's the what would be a relevant demo for this particular hackathon what would be a relevant milestone i'd be very interested to talk about that and other things that people might think about this project yeah there's a couple of um questions in coming in the chat here i'm just going to read them out loud if that's okay one from hp prom of um so how do you determine the split in rewards so the way it's set up right now the founding team or the dev team you can call it either way can um can get the maximum of nine percent this is just based on the effort like the compute effort it takes to actually get the model to commercially be commercially relevant like well if you look at gpt3 it would cost some somewhere around four million dollars to train it on aws so the founding team can get up to nine percent which can be just it can go to one uh address so the port it can be split between multiple addresses and the rest is uh just for the investor so people as they fund the project because they think based on the description and based on the developers portfolio they think that might make money um they they get a percentage just like you know you would get in a company you would get stuck in a company and there's uh did i i think i addressed the question yeah you did and i don't know tariq has another question i don't know if this is if you have this sorted yet but how does your pricing compare to how does the pricing compare co to cloud yeah uh yeah so i i ran a couple of uh you know models to figure out how we would uh fare in terms of pricing um it all indications are that we would get it lower at least at half the price that you get for you know something like the natural language uh service through api calls that you get from google cloud or from aws there still needs to be more modeling on that done but um yeah it seems like just from the sheer scale and the fact that um it's crowdsourced you would be able to get it lower and there the downside is that you know it's a it's a it's a token uh erc 777 token so once it starts trading that's all volatile um so there needs to be a way to account for that sorry about the siren no worries are you looking for any teammates currently that could help you with this for any specific roles that yeah that would be really cool yeah it would be really cool to have more people work on this with me or at least uh you know do some more of this brainstorming and figure out if it's something for them so if you're interested i am eight right in discord what what sorry let me rephrase what kind of help could you need like developers ux ux help design help uh not necessarily for ux and design um i think we're good on that but anything related to data science like even answering this question like how the price would be compared to um you know google cloud or aws there's a lot of uh logical architecture to still develop and optimize like the and we need to um account for like the mining nodes have their own implementation they're they're like separate from the main net right now this can actually work on on the main net it needs to work on something on either 2.0 or uh layer 2 because the there are too many transactions you know the gas prices uh would it wouldn't work but there are lots of stuff to still uh model from a data analysis standpoint so any help on that front would be really welcome and devops um i guess someone who has like good knowledge of um how distributed tensorflow runs normally if they worked on any um yeah infrastructures in the centralized world that would be helpful cool um in the interest of time we'll keep moving but everybody the sign up sheet andre put his um his discord um handle there so let's keep this conversation going yeah and also remind people that we have some uh if people are still searching for teams this is an opportunity to sort of play with that idea but also there's team formation sessions coming up um if people are still looking in the coming days um cool thanks andre um our next uh next team or project or hacker is irrevocable irrevocable are you here hi hi everybody my name is david troy um i'm i i found it irrevocable um and uh irrevocable depending on how you say it out loud um and i used to work in the art world um the art finance world specifically uh actually my thesis was on art markets and the emergence of art markets and how i developed in past times namely from the android markets um fun fact restaurants was not in our market um and uh uh so essentially i used to work in new york um 2014 uh where we used to collateralize warhols for art like asset-backed loans and a few other like frank stellas and robert indiana's and other like financial mechanisms behind like the essentially the put options that are set for most of these auction processes within southeastern christie's um after that we're done invest making for the law but that's not important um and uh yeah we i kind of want to bring back a few of these like our mechanisms that don't exist in the nft world because uh um they just it ends up being like 50 of all art sales are actually uh price floored um before they even go to auction so when you get when you see anything that go to auction sotheby's 50 is already uh collateralized in some in some form or fashion so we're just introducing a familiar idea that already uh dominates the art world industry into crypto because nobody has approached it that way um specifically in the fact that you can actually use other artworks to protect the price of other artworks you can actually use artworks to buy other artworks you don't actually use cash nobody actually uses cash it's a it's very debt-driven pre-auction and post-auction um there's actually probably a second line after uh the buyer's commission for some of these so essentially you want to use uh other nfts to guarantee the price of other nfts before they even go on auction and then you can create like an entire game around it where you make money be uh based on these a betting market for where a price would go up or down um currently as a whale is a whale to whale market as they call it or peer-to-peer and that's what we want to do for v1 and eventually want to appear to pool we're trying to avoid the auction before the auction scenario which is a common issue um but ideally for now we want to create this a tool where essentially you can use nfts to uh protect the price of other nfts or even buy other nfts with nfts or r for art i'm just replacing art for art um and this is again 50 of all large sales that happens christie's and sotheby's wow that's cool um and just i'm just curious like so you say you're coming from the art world um i i used to be in our world but then the art world isn't that glamorous it's uh there's a joke that is driven by three things divorce and debt yeah those three things so and then i left the art world for a little while never thought i'd be back to it but you know it's a little more hopeful to be in that empty world than the traditional art world which is you know i mean you're selling impressionist paintings and those ones usually old people um so that's the way it is um and yeah so there's a lot of mechanisms that's been involved since you know sotheby's existence since the 18th century um and they've been using these background systems which has been essentially collusion but i want to provide collusion as a service so anybody can use these mechanisms um so it's a it's it's part of the same like the english bid system is such an inefficient way to like provide bargaining power for the participants um the consignor should have more power and this is what we're trying to offer um because right now it's all the bidders and market forces which are extremely inefficient for english bids which is dependent on the second highest bid um so the second highest bid determines the price because you went a bit higher than the second size but or you would yeah yeah and we we would love to work with uh an nft lending platforms like uh we're trying to work with nft lending platforms we're not a marketplace we're not a lending protocol and we're not fractionalizing we're not we're none of those but we will collaborate with all of them cool you share your discord uh yeah it's uh i just posted in the group um and uh yeah and uh we we we i have a back-end engineer he's an anonymous guy he doesn't want to share um and but uh yeah we're looking for a front-end engineer to essentially build up this tool we're not trying to build a company yet because this tool is only peer-to-peer it doesn't really require token but essentially when it comes to peer-to-peer that will require uh some level of crypto economics to get to that point because it is a coordination issue at that point right now is purely a tool set that we want to see work and i want to demonstrate that you can make you can essentially make money with your mona lisa to bet on the sovereignty mundi and kind of that kind of scenario was a pretty interesting question in the chat um they were wondering how you could avoid the same owner using multiple anonymous addresses over bidding to increase appraisal values oh we encourage it that's totally normal i mean you're just betting yourself you're encouraging it that's it's no different from you bidding on your own self um if there's an alternative person bidding on it i mean what we're what we're promising is that you have a price floor if you're under the price floor you're going to buy anyways um this is the chandelier bid system an is a natural process and something you can't really avoid um we if if you really want to increase the price you can always increase it but you might end up with your own bags um this is a this is an anonymous like issue but um if they have the cash and collateral do so then they're just raising the price up for it um but in the end they're the ones that are guarant guaranteeing it they're the guarantors and yeah wash training is an issue but it's a symptomatic of any auction systems um you can try getting it with a with a with uh essentially a reputation system um but we're not going to build that um and yeah you can reach out to me and discord i shared it on the hacker list and uh like i said we're just looking for a front-end dev maybe ux ui but we want to make it really really simple like a like a cool tool like dispersed app or uh you know swap that kind of level um no explanation page just guarantee it cool all right thanks david appreciate it sounds cool um moving on to our next uh project is low kit okay are you here yes time here all right let's here okay hi everyone my name is leo i'm in south africa i first found out about the theorem hackathon they had like a session in cape town and it was like my first experience in the blockchain space um and then i went over to doing a bit more hackathons but not in the blockchain sphere um i tried to incorporate it in my kids startup so it's called a life cycle for the kid intake that's the name locate um so what we're looking to do is to decentralize the way kids learn especially kids in the rural areas because there's quite a struggle especially in african countries so what i'm trying to do is we're registering schools and getting sponsors and this is where the blockchain estimate would somewhat come in um if i can just go through the platform itself so we're looking at a pwa and the miner would enter the details being given by the teacher so they'd have like a coach then they'd select maybe they like soccer um animals and then they'd select their learning styles whether it's youtube song peer-to-peer don storytelling quizzes and then we move over to smart contracts so because you're dealing with babies again um they would have to do something like a pinky promise um so this would ensure that they receive the reward at the end um so what they do is they'll get maybe 50 for maths pick up letter in the community participate in the sport do dishes at home then they pick a promise then they pick a reward then the department of education would come in here give the content then the teacher would create the content by creating the quizzes then the child unlocks a lesson using augmented reality let's say for example they see a pyramid um well it is a pyramid but then they'll think it's a triangle then they'll look at it from a historical standpoint like the great pyramids of egypt and then it also helps with kids with accessibility needs as well then we move over to quizzes again to reinforce learning then we receive the reward it's another what gets released because the sponsor will be paying for it so this is where i would need a lot of help um but what the sponsor does is the sponsor actually pledges a certain amount to the school and if that particular class received or achieved the desired outcome then only does the funds get released to the vendor so then the vendor needs to be verified by the school and then after the vendor has been verified by the school then the kids received the reward um let's say for example with the monsters dashboards just a second story so what the sponsor would be looking at synthetic data of reminders to see if the class is actually achieving their goal then they would see what the kids are looking for maybe a trip to the zoo and then how much they're pledging then they're getting a notification if that particular school has completed um their goals and then they can transfer the amount um that they desire and then once everything is settled with the vendor and the school verifies then only do the kids get their reward that's me that sounds really really interesting how um do you have a team here is it just you right now it's just me i am definitely looking for a team um we i i mainly work on the infrastructure side of things uh so i'm busy with obviously gcp so it's very gcp intensive so that's looking at it from an infrastructure perspective but when it comes to the blockchain aspect clueless but i know i want to use it and i feel like it would be the best fit for it um because it gives the sponsors the freedom to know that um they've got um an ordered trail it's transparent they've got a shortage as to where their money is going and where it's being invested in if their kids or the school that they're investing in is actually achieving their goals and it motivates the kids to actually achieve them as well what kind of help specifically would be useful for you right now in building a team front end back end type work or are you looking for someone with specific knowledge of the education space um definitely backend with blockchain experience i think i am able to be fine with the friend inside of things um so i think that'll be okay it's just mainly the back end and just integrating the blockchain systems with the platform itself that's awesome i'm always excited to see hacks focusing on education and use cases i think that's a really good market to touch and it's a very a very needed assistance right now and i think if the person is good with like offline because in some of these places it's so remote so just something along those lines to be mindful of because the kids it's really remote areas and yeah it's really bad but i think with these technologies there's some good that can come it also sounds um just as a total aside if the project gets legs um pretty sure the un foundation has blockchain team that might do some grants and stuff for things in this area so you might want to check them out that's something to be sort of cognizant of for all of you um there's a you know obviously you know going for the prizes and trying trying to be finalists during this competition is is of importance but we've actually seen projects come out of these events that become full-fledged companies you know that are still around today so if your idea has legs you know we can we can connect you with grants and you know the appropriate people to to take that forward because we really we would love to see that grow awesome i think uh just for me maybe a little bit selfish but i'm definitely springboarding my previous hackathon idea with the blockchain aspect and look okay here's a blockchain that hackathon do the bloodshed things carry on so then i have to find another augmented reality you want to sprinkle from that as well but yeah i'm excited to see what comes cool well yeah um your contact stuff is in the um your discord handle is there for everyone in the uh sign in sheet so if anyone is interested in talking further on this you guys again encouraged to keep these conversations going um cool uh before i go into the next one um just a little announcement at the moment we're gonna we're live streaming this event but if anyone's watching on youtube or on twitter we're going to end the live stream right now even though the event is going to continue and we have this event recorded um but just everybody stay in the call here but if you happen to be on youtube you'll have to wait till the recording gets posted um so on that our next uh uh project or team or hacker is cam harris cam if you're here hey what's up guys my name is cameron harris um just a quick uh background on myself i did the i participated in a previous uh global one three hackathon and i built something called uh live tooth which is just a video tube site that stored video
