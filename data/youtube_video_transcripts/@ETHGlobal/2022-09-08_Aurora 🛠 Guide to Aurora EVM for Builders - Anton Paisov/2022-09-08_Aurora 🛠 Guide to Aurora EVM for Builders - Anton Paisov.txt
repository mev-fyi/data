[Applause] [Music] hello good morning good afternoon good evening spending where you're calling from uh we have anton here from aurora doing a workshop on guide to aurora ef evm for builders if you have any questions they can go into the zoom chat and and i will be more than happy to answer them throughout the presentation and with that being said i will hand off the mic to our speaker hello everyone nice to be here anna thank you for the intro um yes i am my name is anton i work at aurora i am overseeing all the integrations that are happening in the chain and ensuring that kind of it all goes towards builders having uh as bespoke and ethnic experience as possible while building on error now um it won't be kind of like uh two technical deep under the hood presentation instead because like you know with all the scaling solutions on the market first of all what we're here for is to help scale and scale theorem ecosystem and therefore we also firm believers that the future is multi-chain and this presentation is in the first place for me to kind of raise awareness of how error is different why it's why you should be interested in it and so on so first of all uh i think it's it would be nice to start with just some overview of the con of what our community achieved so far so we were at 2.5 bill tbl before the market crash we were uh we're at 2.5 million transactions per week or more than 150 application functions in aurora within the nine months from the uh we have if there is scan we have infuriating beta yet but still like you can get your pc from infuria uh which will be updated soon uh we have metamask institutional we have graph covalent curve necessary and basically uh a lot of a lot of the ecosystem projects and infrastructure projects that you would expect to have an abm compatible chain are already here uh bachelor guy may be in the two uh uh lambda protocol natively in the first person aurora uh and that was zero bad depth with the microphone which is not not that often uh we also had uh moonflower performance thing happening that back in the day and with sunflower farmers took down some of the networks they did not break aurora when they were when it was on our uh we also work in more and more on the native near uh aurora interpretations uh and as a result we already have refinance that already have flaps on our earth turtle iris we have our robots by the making collection that we launched together with our aurora plus product that i will mention in the beats as well uh as one of the most desired and popular collection on aurora and new and we have more than 10 projects on aurora at the system that already closed their funding rates now let's get to what aurora is and how rural works which is the most interesting part for you i would mention so first of all aurora used and again a vm compatibility layer on top of neo aurora is built as a smart contract so it's a regular new smart contract that has nvm inside aurora rpc our web service compatible rpc that like works as you would expect from ethereum and it's basically a rap mirror pc so as a result uh what you get is um just like you can utilize all the power and features of near uh with ethereum interface which we we find is critical and uh like it was back in the day it was an idea to try it out and no one thought that uh you can actually put an evm inside of a smart contract and that would not only work but also perform very well but that's what happened and uh together with that uh we get from here we get the one second block time around one second it's even a bit more but around one second block time uh two blocks finality time and um yeah uh also like one of the things that we have been working on in the past uh nine months was optimizing the gap usage uh because as a result of uh having a block time as one second we get that the it's the computation time basically so it also defines the maximum amount of computation that can happen and therefore uh it's not like only film is 14 seconds and on near international is one second so we also had to work a lot on optimizing on how like how much computation can happen and we actually got two very very very good results with that and at this stage we still do uh see sometimes the maximum uh guess error but it's quite rare and in almost all the cases it can be optimized for so yeah as a result we have the one second block time basically without any compromises we also have all the uh ethereum ecosystem tools available on error which would be like metamask ruffle hardhead remix etc and uh basically anything that is dvm compatible can be easily and quickly integrated with the world uh important like a very interesting thing and important in our opinion i think that the base token on the row is actually a theorem and i will talk a bit more in detail about how it works later in the presentation but the like the belief here is that scaling theorem equal system you don't want to introduce any extra theme that would not work as you would expect them because like it's all originated of course it's like now it's a lot of projects just start like building and of honorary native etc but like the overall um idea was i believe was anyone who is working on similar kind of solutions is to scale finger making system and therefore in our opinion the the closer you get to the experience the better and basically as a result you can just add an extra rpc endpoint where to deploy your contract you can deploy away and it would just work as you would expect it um yeah we also are working on uh we have a very strong product within aurora and we are working on uh with a very very strong focus on the x and we are working on launch and we already launched a few of the products apart from what's already in the infrastructure itself but we're also yeah working on the next ones but the the the two ones that are already live for error plus which is a second platform that is meant to become a wallet in the future and i will also talk about it a little bit after that and we also have the rainbow beach which is a very cool bridge and it's all like all the time complimented at the bridge with the best user experience now a bit of a bit more about the bridge it's a translational generic bridge with a theory um f3x was not hacked we have a fork and backbone program alive that we already did the second largest back boundary payout in in history and uh yeah we also have the uh system that automatically resists attacks and already yeah it's already worked twice on attacks and prevented theft so and aurora plus you can see the thing uh yeah you can stake aurora and you can get rewards and the rewards you get on are not only aurora tokens but it's also the tokens you uh from the ecosystem projects the idea like one of the key ideas behind error plus is to bring um the web 2 familiarity uh and like remove the web web 3 hurdles from uh from users who just start interacting with with blockchain and uh we do that by uh having the freemium model with subscriptions so every user that signs up for a plus has 53 transactions per month they will be able in the future to have subscription plans to have more transactions per month and just to like basically pay with a credit card don't think don't ever think about the guest fees however small they are they they are still mean that you need like if you have guesses you still need to have ethereum on your wallet et cetera et cetera and this is just simply not uh not a familiar content for the web teachers and uh yeah it will also allow third parties to pay for the user transactions now okay so back to east as a base token uh how it works so user science transaction for instance with metamask and some ethereum transaction then the rpc wraps the transaction into a new transaction then grabs transaction unwraps it commits the transaction on new and yeah that's that's what happens and uh as a result you have yeah i'm not sure what i wanted to tell more about this is very self-explanatory yes so we also have a community grants program that all together we have a lot of things to kind of enable and enable projects on aurora for example system new projects that are built in particular existing and that want to expand to aurora um so we have various space of support we help and we work with various marketing efforts we have a grants program which is of course very uh we also like to move to for that program to become not just grants program but the community grants program that's what the slide is about you can uh inspect it thoroughly if you want but the idea is to first of all enable uh the project that want to build an error to build and for the community to also to see it as transparent as possible and yeah so we also do four projects uh our currency management projects you can do interest to vcs that would be a good match for the project and so on now um this is mostly what i wanted to cover i hope to get more questions and in the meantime i will um all right yeah like anton said if you have any questions um definitely feel free to ask them now and you can come off mute if that's easier for you in europe yes so with infuriation basically uh let me tell you a little bit about what we were working recently and i feel like i know what that question is about so uh we were um for the past also kind of six to eight months we've been working on the new infrastructure that we will talk more about at the near con and also i invite everyone to join new con that starts on sunday and i will type the url in the chat and we'll get back to the interior question so uh yes we will have more announcement and we will talk more about various stuff at nyukon in europe won't yet be a part of that announcement because we're still in bed with in europe uh and the reason for that that we are we have uh our own infrastructure developed recently that is not yet public at the same time we are finishing up with the public rpc um kind of note package that as as we had previously we will have an updated one now and here we'll use that once they switched that one uh yeah the better will kind of be in the latest stages more and you will be able to request goods or better notes from there but in the meantime [Music] yes but i would still recommend using our public infrastructure for now in the first place because it's not overloaded it's not like uh it's a very very optimized one we will we are releasing a few important upgrades to it tomorrow but yeah you can use them here but not yet like at your own risk all right just gonna wait a couple more seconds for any other questions to roll in it will be available in the video and i will also prepare a few more links that i want to share about to the grants program to more in-depth documentation and two more things about um like we have good videos explaining how error works and some other specifics uh about multi-col i need to check with the tech team more in detail i think it's coming but i can't still get straight awesome um well i guess we can just end things there then uh yeah anton thank you so much for taking the time to do this workshop for um the east online hackers and thank you to all of you who join in to listen to anton speak and learn more about aurora uh yeah like anton said this recording will be available on youtube for reference after so feel free to go back at any time and also the aurora team is available for support throughout the hackathon in the sponsor aurora discord channel um in the youth online discord uh yeah and with that being said once again thank you all and have i hope you all have a great rest of your day thank you everyone uh very excited to see what you will build on aurora and yes have a lovely pack bye everyone
