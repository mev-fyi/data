himself and kick the session off thanks emily hi everyone yes i'm mcfly guillaume i'm the co-founder of aktmph so i will be with you today for 30 minutes to present what we are doing with our new release 88 mph v3 we launched that a few days ago on mainnet so yeah so first i will probably present our bounty the price what we are looking for and after we will dive into the product the platform itself uh the contracts the integration guidelines uh and after yeah i will try to save some some minutes to answer all your questions if you have some um and uh yeah i think uh that's it um anything else i'm missing emily or what's uh that's all about that's perfect you can kick it off awesome cool so yeah regarding the price for the if online hackathon we will offer 5 000 usdc worth of price for three different projects three different team or person um the first place will be with a free falls on usdc the second place with 1500 usdc and the last one the third place with 500 usdc for the first place we will also offer access to our grant program we have a we have a grant program with 80 10ph directly uh funded by the community and our governance treasury so definitely if there is good ideas good products that pop up during the academy we will definitely support your work after of course if you want but yeah usually we are doing that with a couple of projects um so yeah that would be different definitely something we are open to um so we we wanted to have like a general bounty a general price so it's uh it's definitely open uh for any ids any uh products something that you already started working on as a side project is also fitting into our scope um of course you need to fit also in the framework of if online uh the rule of if online um but yeah it's definitely open for everyone and every ide and mainly with our new release 88 mph v3 we really wanted to streamline the user experience for developers making everything as simple as it is to build on top of compound or rv so that was the main goal with this new release so we hope that it will ease your workflow in terms of building the right interface uh building the like managing the ad content c if you want to use 808 mph products for your own project um but maybe before going diving into the details just an overview of what we are doing with v3 so 88 mph is a non-custodial protocol uh currently you're operating on f1 minutes where you deposit some assets and you get in exchange a fixed year right so fixed you're right basically it's a percentage a yield percentage that you get it's fixed so you deposit let's say for one year 100 die uh if we promise you four percent fixed deal right you will get at the end at the maturity date 104 die so that's fixed fixed terms um so that's the main product it's what we are good at um and with 88 mph v3 also we introduced another product that we named yield token and this field token allow everyone to speculate on future yield um on the underlying protocol we are using because 88 mph we are not generating the yield ourselves we are using under the hood compound have a harvest we will release soon new adapters for cream for uh idle finance uh and many others uh but for i know what you have on on the mainnet is uh compound avr best so we are acting you can see 88mph as an intermediary between the end user who want to get his deposit earning some fixed yield rate and the underlying protocol that are using variable right for generating the yield so we are like this filter uh taking the variable yield right fund from compound for example and promising uh to our end users the fixed interest rates um so the yield token on in all of that is uh allowing someone to buy it and earn the variable rate but the deposits from our users are earning on compound so that's a secondary product but it's really important for us because it's helped us also de-risk the protocol the main risk we have on 88 mph when you are offering a fixed interest rate to someone is the insolvency risk so that means what happened if we are not able on compound or on average to generate enough yield uh for paying back for being able uh to allow our users to withdraw their principle their initial deposit plus their uh the interest we promised that to them so that's really important and for this reason we designed all the system of 8k10 ph to manage this risk because it's really what make everything useful and an added value for everyone so we want to offer a fixed idea right but of course uh managing the insolvency risk and eliminating as much as possible so the yield token is the year for that allowing someone to bury it and speculate on the future yield but uh we can get on a compound away or if you are already borrowing on compound or away for example you are borrowing die so you have a borrowing cost you can age your cost of borrowing by buying this yield token that will allow you if the interest rate on compound ravi are increasing you can kind of add your cost of borrowing some some dye let's say on compound so that's really an interesting product there is some of the projects that are doing this kind of yield token but it's fairly a different process for us we are naming it heel token but it's uh different from what you can get on other protocols doing fixed deloittes um so yeah that's the two main products after there is other stuff like you can stake your um some your mph so the mph is the native token of 88 nph you get it by depositing your your earphones on 88 mph and other incentives we reward you with some vested mph that are linearly vested to you over the duration of your deposits and after that if you want to stake them you will be able to earn the 100 of a protocol revenue so we share all the revenue of a platform with our mph takers uh i will go back to the revenue right after but i see that uh i'm already talking too much so i will dive directly into the product and after i will present you the integration guidelines the smart contract and everything you need to start building on top of 88 ph so i will minimize that so we are currently on 88 mph that so you can access that directly by typing you know your browser this address we are on rinkaby so you have a possibility to start playing with on a firm minute of course but also on rinkaby so i will just do the demo on rank a bill rhino so that's the home page where you can learn different things or we are doing things like what make us different from others oh it works uh the money flow and that's the future like the yield uh the yield token part so that's the the second product we have um [Music] yeah so that yeah everything of course is uh audited by trade of beats fake shield and cod uh cut four uh we have also if you're interested by that uh humidify bounty of 100k if you find some issue don't hesitate to to directly post them submit them on uminify so if you want to deposit into 88 mph i'm an end user i want to deposit i have some die to deposit you go on earn and you deposit some die here for example currently we are offering up to 1.85 fixed deal right plus 25 mph rewards so what does it mean if it's according to the duration of your deposit we will of we will be more generous or a bit more conservative according to your maturity so if you have a maturity let's say of 30 days we'll be a bit more generous in terms of the fixed deal right we are offering if you select for example one year we will decrease a bit the amount of fixed the fixed ideal right we are offering because we can't really predict uh end of the future of course so we want to be more conservative and the way we are computing evaluating what we can offer in terms of fixed ideal right to our user is by using uh interest oracle so it's an in-house interest oracle that pulls the price pulls the variable right from a compound for example and we evaluate a 30-day exponential movering average from that uh that stream of data from compound and from that 30-day exponential moving average we take a certain percentage in that case if you want for example to deposit for uh let's say approximately a month uh you will get 75 percent of a fixed interest rate that we extract from the 30 day exponential moving average so if let's say the variable right on compound currently for that is at 10 and our exponential moving average of 30 days is also around 10 we will be able to offer you for a deposit of 30 day seven of 7.5 percent fixed deal right so uh that's fairly simple like in terms of of mechanics like the design is really basic in that sense there is no other complex computation that we do to evaluate the amount of fixation right we can offer to our end users but it's working so it's a really one of the main piece we have in our system is bat interest oracle and the yield token that help us manage this insolvency risk also so we are not giving out 100 of a 30 day exponential moving average so let's say i want to deposit for 30 days i will get this fixed yield i will earn that amount at maturity so i'm depositing right now let's say we will deposit 100 die and i will get also mph rewards so that's the native token of 88 mph of course if i'm depositing for one year i will do something more generous i will get something more generous in terms of of yield at the end so that's the total available at maturity and you see here that you can customize nft metadata what does it mean is since the beginning since we created 88 mph and we launched that on mainnet in november 2020 we are using nft erc 721 to represent the deposit of our users uh as i said before we are in active intermediary so when you deposit 488 mph 100 die what we do is basically we uh we send with uh intel like volunteer imagery is we send this deposit directly to uh other component according to the pool you selected and we represent what you deposited through 88 mph by this nft and this nft is acting like a database where we register the multi-deposited the amount of fixed interest rates you need to receive the mph rewards these kind of things so that means that we can allow someone to customize this nft with metadata because basically it's an nft it's a d4 inft if if i can say so you can customize it by saying okay that's the test if online test and you can select you can upload an image you can upload also description if you want and you can add as many attributes you want so you can basically customize what whatever you want here let's say we will just select an image a random one i'm finding here yeah that's fine so that's it that's my deposit why like this is a an experiment uh we launched that with the v3 um it's uh to see how we can match creativity with decentralized finance and also connect with different community of creators to start exploring this venue also mixing defy and nft creative content with nft and d5 and we will see what happened with that but we have three artists in residence uh working on collection of arts and we will release this collection probably we'll start next week and we'll run some auction and we'll do charity things with the proceeds and we already did that in last december and we will start again and so we are it's open for everyone it's permissionless so everyone who is depositing on 88mbh can customize its nfc metadata so i will deposit right now maybe i'm not connected to the right one let's see that one okay so i'm depositing and just to gain time i will show you already deposit i did with usdc and die on rinkaby so you see all my deposits that are currently uh being deposited that are that have some maturity dates already reached or not reached so for this reason you see unlocked that means that this one i can withdraw it when i withdraw i will get my initial deposit of course plus the interest earned with a fused right so you see i have some that are still locked when it's locked you can still withdraw early of course your deposits so for example you need your money for whatever reason you don't want anymore to use 88 mph you can withdraw early minus a 0.5 percent fee on the initial amount so let's say i was depositing 88 die if i will do withdraw 100 of it uh i will uh lose of 44 cents um you can top up your initial deposits so what does it mean topping up a deposit is you don't change the maturity date you just top up the amount so it's still the same maturity date if it's ending in 292 days even if you top up it will be 292 days in a maturity date um of course with a new for the new deposits with a new fixed yield rate according to the day you deposit and you can claim your rewards so for example here i have this deposit of 144 die i'm currently earning 25 apr on this deposit in an f in mph so i can claim my mph and after i can do whatever i want with i can stake it for x and ph i can provide liquidity to boost my yield and other stuff and for mature deposits you can roll over your deposit so that means that you will compound the interest that you earned uh with that uh initial deposit and you redeposit uh the wall amount so the principal plus the interest uh url into a new deposit with a new maturity date but you can that you can select and of course you can withdraw um one thing i didn't mention before is um you don't see it here uh yet but you have the possibility to have a maturity custom maturity so you can select between one day and maximum one year and also we introduce uh probably next week um preset maturity uh and under the wood it will be zero coupon bonds so zero coupon bonds is basically a bond uh but offer a fixed yield and you can redeem it at when you reach maturity date you're reading the full face value and you buy the bond at a discount so for example if a bond it's a 100 value you can buy it at 80 at 80 uh dollar that means at maturity you will be able to withdraw 80 plus 20 so it will yield 20 uh percentage at the office deal right on on this zero coupon bonds but we wanted to simplify all of that uh with v3 so we don't mention any financial lingo or jargon directly into the interface it's just happening under the hood so you have custom maturities normal deposit and you will you will have preset maturity it's a zero common bonds um just taking a look at the time okay i will accelerate on that so i think that's it for the earned page things of course you can even if you deposited already you can still customize the metadata you can add stuff and we are introducing also the the video support uh everything is using ipfs uh with nft storage so it's uh permanently addressed permanently uh storage so that's a robust solution for uh nft like handling nft correctly there is no no issue with that um so mistake just quickly you take your mph and you can gain the you can receive a protocol revenue so we share 100 of a protocol renew and the protocol revenue come from the fee we are extracting from the interest paid out to our end users but also from the protocol under the we are using like compound or ave where we can harvest the governance token of boost protocol and we distribute all of that on a bi-weekly basis with mph back back so that means we are going back with the proceed of our revenue uh some mph on the market and we distribute directly by mph to our end users and it's basically working the same way as x sushi if you know a sushi swap is basically the same model and the last thing i wanted to show you is the vcl token so i hope it's kind of clear for you how it works uh basically when someone deposits what we do is if it's loading uh when someone deposit we will list here directly uh yield token opportunities that represents the that is directly tied to uh each deposit so for example here you see a yield token for the dye compound tool with the maturity on september 20 and there is ten thousand seed yield token available worth two dollars and this two dollar basically represents the amount of fixed digital right the amount of fixed right interest that we owe we promise it to our users so that's the price of the yield token and if you pay that this yield token will allow you to earn the variable rate on the total amount of deposited funds so in that case it's ten thousand dollars so with two dollars you can earn the variable rate on 10 000 plus the cost also the initial cost of the yield token so that's really interesting it's highly leveraged uh products that allow you to have huge upside so for this reason it's a speculative tool um and it's really interesting in terms of return but of course also it's very some risk you can go down if the current variable rate on a compound for example fall your roi will also fall so you need to to really making sure that you are optimistic in terms of the future yields you can receive from compound so if you feel bullish of course you will have a better return and also on top of that you'll receive some mph rewards um i will stop here i will just show you in two minutes of the integration guideline we have directly on all documentation so it's accessible with via docs.88mph.app the developer docs integration guideline you have the smart contract architectures you have all the links that are necessary to explore the smart contracts the smart contract references all of that is documented it's pretty well done and of course if you have questions you will be able to chat directly with us on our discord or directly on the discord of if online of course i will have a specific channel for that and you can access directly all the contracts on on github so you have a deployment there and you see also you will have access to a deployment guideline where we explain how to deploy your own smart contract for it mph and all of that of course is available for renkerby and for [Music] for mainnet so all of it is referenced there um and i will stop here i just wanted to know if there is questions uh i will check right now yeah i think there's a bunch of questions in the chat yeah so can i have uh much yeah can i have three minutes to enter all of that yeah you can get through all the questions i'm sure there'll be some time okay so yeah guys doing anything with terra usd or any integration field we can get so we are not doing anything yet with terra but we are going multichain uh layer 2 stuff starting end of next week we will start with polygon we will go on phantom avalanche and others basically we add up the same strategy as sushi swap deploying on as many multi-chain as possible so i don't know like i don't know much about terra but why not but it's definitely something we can support at least the ust i think it's already listed on several protocols we are using under the hood so we can definitely have a pool for usd i'm moving to the next one so all 88 mbh make money when someone receive um vested mph when he deposits he'll receive a vested mph linearly vested over the duration of this deposit when he claimed his mph rewards we re 10 newly minted mph so let's say if the end user receive 10 mph we will receive one nph directly going to the developer fund so basically it's 10 percent of what we give to our users so in that in that way we are able to finance our operation paying for security audits and all of that uh yes the interest oracle its own product of 8810ph and yeah fully audited at least six times and things like that so it's it's something that will work also with uh chain link uh keepers uh we will announce uh later but we have an integration with uh with that like it will automate the the workflow to update each day uh the interest that we offer uh so because we are using a 30-day exponential moving we need that so it's a manual process currently so we want to automate all of that uh so you could potentially create a debt market like the bond market and price vanished according to the nhl right yes exactly but defy nft staff it's an experiment but there is definitely awesome use cases with that so you can uh like give an intrinsic value to a creative content directly by depositing let's say uh 0.1 uh bitcoin into that bond linked tied to this nft with a nice loop done by your preferred artist if you want and this thing will have an interesting value of one point uh 0.1 btc for example so there is definitely cool stuff with that um what's actually happening when interest rate and all the people will be in australia and variety so that's where the yield token is really important for us so speculator by the yield token and it allows us to the risk the the solvency uh for for everyone so that's the main uh that's the main layer of the risking of course there is also the fact that we don't give a hundred percent of the 30-day exponential moving average for the interest uh so all of that we have here if you see you can learn more about prismatic mitigation we are talking about that here and after the lock pair designed and i don't freeze does it still earn apr so it will continue earning uh interest but not for the depositor for the community in the pool so it will create surplus of interest in the pool uh auto compounding for everyone else but for you like you get what we promised at the beginning so it's four percent on that day on on a android die you will get four died um if you were physiologing do you think you would start to think he said right borrowing right in the future probably not we won't go in that business others are doing it better than us we we prefer to act as a middleware where we use over protocol aggregators landing protocol and we try to mix a lot of that to create an offer really focused on the fixed uh fixed right landing business uh so next week it will be on polygon yeah the first one will be on polygon uh probably end of next week we will have something to show um yeah and that's it guys thanks for your time thanks for listening and uh don't hesitate to ask as many questions as possible either on if online whatever you want on twitter on telegram we are everywhere so don't hesitate thanks so much um that was a really great session and you managed to squeeze quite a lot into the 30 minutes and even on to everyone's questions um yeah feel free to reach out to the 88 mph team in discord and yeah have a great evening everyone yeah thanks emily
