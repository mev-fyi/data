[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] welcome to the CK 2.0 this is a join event with it Global that celebrates the launch of polygon ckuvm mainnet beta this is a special greetings from Barcelona where most of the ckvm team is located and I am Grace I am from polygon Labs I'm also the ckvm product lead and today I have the pleasure to also be your MC we're extremely happy to have these special days and to show it with uh to share it with our youth Global Community this is a community with whom we share values and purpose we have a very engaging program and we want to go through it very quickly we you will have some insightful conversations in a fireside chat style we will have the official launch of mainnet data and that comes with a surprise I won't say more than that two awesome panels we have also an important closing remarks and without further Ado let me introduce you to Sandeep and mihilo co-founders of polygon and the ones that will be opening the event take it away zmgm everyone uh today we are our you know Community has come up with this new thing which is ZM instead of GM so uh which where the Z uh you know describes a ZK part of it because polygon is going to be all about ZK uh from here onwards uh many of you have uh you know seen the Journey of polygon and today is probably the most important day uh in the in the Journey of polygon because at polygon we were always focused on mass adoption or web3 and we are very proud that and because you know now it looks very obvious but that time it was not that we chose uh you know layer 2 scaling on top of ethereum as the path which can actually bring the scalability to the world with which we can take web 3 to the masses and uh you know we have been very focused uh we've always been uh you know dedicated towards scaling ethereum on Layer Two uh to have like you know these Global trustless Systems uh community-owned businesses uh to be built and uh you know provided to the users and empowering users uh especially the users who are uh the underprivileged and underrepresented uh which is which is obviously the core ethos of F3 and uh you know before in 2020 we started with our polygon POS chain which is which was kind of good which worked at that point in time whatever was available but our focus and Mission was always to uh bring the world like true Layer Two Solutions and uh you know on layer twos there is like amongst the researchers there is kind of global consensus that zero knowledge technology is the end game right and uh because it it kind of like you know with the crypto cryptography and the mathematics behind it it ensures that you can technically have infinite scalability right which is very important for uh Mass scale applications to be built on top of uh ethereum to build on top of uh layer twos and hence like you know today is the day where we launch our first uh true layer 2 solution which is uh ZK VM as you guys many of you guys already know and uh you know mihilo my brother and co-founder has been the architect of this uh you know polygons entire polygon ecosystems uh you know strategy or uh you know kind of uh approach towards uh scaling on Layer Two with ZK so without further Ado I'll hand over to mihilo to share his thoughts on how you know he has uh he you know what what's his uh master plan in his mind and what he sees forward from here hello over to you uh thanks so much Sandeep hi everyone uh it's a true pleasure to welcome you everyone to this great celebration uh they're telling us in the background that there's more ten thousand more than 10 000 people uh tuned in at the moment which is really exciting and humbling and yeah first one to start by saying that Sandeep just being too too generous and he's exhilarating it's I'm just a single contributor to this uh great success and Sandeep contributed as at least as much as I have as well as the great team that we are very fortunate to have and yes maybe I can just say a few words about this this process so so uh like a year and a half ago roughly after a lot of research and experience with different scaling Solutions and thinking about how to approach uh this this Grand goal of mass adoption of web free that we have we decided that ZK technology uh we formed a firm belief that CK technology is the optimal uh or the most promising technology uh when it comes to building web free and bringing it to the messes and we announced that publicly and we announced that one billion fund uh that we uh committed to this great technology and in the meantime uh uh we have onboarded and joined hands with multiple uh extraordinary talented teams uh great individuals and we really formed what we we achieved what we wanted to do we established a ZK Powerhouse uh within polygon and the the first major result of of and deliverable of this great team and this great process that time really um honored to to have been participating in is this EK VM announcement zkvm is is a Sandeep mentioned and is generally known it's considered the Holy Grail of of blockchain web infrastructure and that is because it simultaneously offers three very important features one is scalability as we know we we have we want to onboard the world to web free basically and we're far from the uh sufficient levels of scaling so the EK VM addresses that the second one is security we know that in general in web free we operate with economic uh Concepts and funds Etc and we want to leverage ideally strong and proven security of ethereum which is the strongest the most decentralized programmable blockchain in the world and the third very important feature is evm equivalence or compatibility which allows us to leverage all these great important tools programming languages end user interfaces like metamask everything that has been built in the ethereum community so far with zkv and we can just simply leverage that we're leaving developer and user experience in Tech which is very very important so all these things together all these three things make ZK VM the Holy Grail or the optimal or ideal solution for for uh scaling blockchains we delivered we have been able to deliver this at least two to three years because before it was generally expected to happen and it's on top of that the ZK VM that we're delivering today is absolutely practical so there were concerns with complexity uh when it comes to the that was that has been always the main concern with zkvm whether it's possible to build and if it's even possible whether it can be practical will we need a data center to generate these proofs and today we are incredibly excited uh uh and it's even beyond our expectations the the fact that we are able to run ckv improver on commodity taws instances and pay them 1.9 per per hour which is how much our whole test net has been costing us so all in all this has been a great experience very exciting journey and uh I just want to say just one thing that I really have to say very very briefly um it has been uh why we delivered this this fast apart from great strength of our team and several engineering breakthroughs that that the team have made including uh very very transformative Concepts like Goldilocks Fields like Starkey like plonky 2 and other things in addition to that the the the sense of mission and collaboration that happened within the team was really truly inspiring and I believe it's it's really great that we deliver this EK VM we are incredibly proud and excited about this but along the way I think we just also got much much more uh interconnected stronger as the team more convinced about our mission and the fact that we actually can uh contribute a lot to this industry and hopefully to to the world and yeah this I would just actually hand it over to the actual hero and the person who made his mission to deliver this EK VM which is my good friend and co-founder Jordan and thank you thanks everyone again thank you for thanking me Halo for for those words uh yeah I'm not the hero it's like I'm just an engineer just trying to just trying to skill through you that's what am I so um to start the talk um I would like to start a little bit from the origins uh what we finish from polygon helmets when we finish the first version of the roll-up payments only roll up with pulling on Hermes and I was in zouken and and at that point uh a very good friend Barry White Hat come to my home and he challenged me about the zkvm uh We Believe actually when the first time he told me about that I told him this is impossible this is impossible to do but he just insists in thinking in the different pieces uh we were well we were just uh trying to see okay let's do the exercise uh how we can do that and and we were like going to the different um two different challenges to the different critical points and we were solving most of them in a very complex way a lot of times but we had the intuition at that point that things were possible and and we'll start to dig on that and and there was a moment where most of the big challenges that we had it's okay they are solved at the point so this is really this could be possible okay and it was at this point that I started first convincing uh my partners at that point David and Anthony and uh well first here also very help this is a feature I think we can do that on that and then I did the presentation in Paris just explaining the community uh how I believe this could be possible and here started the the real you know the the project they started uh not a lot but you know with a small team uh with from the Hermes from the Harvest team and there was a Kira crucial uh crucial moment that was the merch with polygon this actually was fundamental because this actually allows to put all the resources that we needed to build uh to build on this office uh with this we just built a team I just got the best professionals the best people that I knew that could deliver on that I convinced them to join this team because therefore together with the people that already was the internet we built uh what I believe is the best team in the world uh the team that can can really build that we started to work hard for a year and in Paris one year later we presented the could be a prototype if you want one to be the first version that was a full proverb it was a program that really works terminate was Terminator that was okay this this was what this was last July and since there of course we continue just uh improving this program a lot of optimizations new things and in October last year we launched the the public test net that was another huge milestone and since there are many who has been working really hard mainly focused on security security auditing checking double checking doing internal audience dealing with external Audits and to build the rebuilding parts of the code and cleaning the code and and until we feel comfortable uh with the code that we have right now and here is where we are uh and we are today at delay now the day that we have been training uh very much the day that was uh that seems like impossible three years ago and it's uh you know is this magic says where an engineer uh just uh put the things in production it's literally when the things starts getting useful for other people so this is the important point of uh or the important point of the of the launch another thing that I want to announce now and I think that's also a very important is that uh today we are not only launch we're not only launching we're also uh open sourcing all the code and what I mean open sourcing is not making available has been available for the last six months but we are also putting a GPR license and a GPL is license to all the reports of the approval I think this is an important gift uh for the committee and I'm very proud uh and before uh finishing I wanted to share uh three cigarettes three seconds why we were able to build uh these things uh so fast the first uh is experience that we got in the first roll-up uh in the Hermes one this was uh really uh I mean all the all the learnings that we got from there they are applied some some way uh to these uh to this throw up to the to the ckbm the second part is architecture I think that here we need very good decisions in the in how we designed the architecture we divide the architecture in layers we have a low layer which is the the cryptography layer okay that talks about polynomial commitments Stark flunks and all this recursion about France and this is an important this has been an important layer another layer is the arithmetization uh just with this is sometimes it's equivalent we have this symbol of uh the hardware layer sometimes it has nothing to do with Hardware but we call it the hardware lay because it's the slow layer it's a repetition we build a language for uh working in this layer without this language appeal and we built a processor on top of this layer right kind of VM specific processor to decode things uh as a normal processor and in top of that is the software layer or we got the ROM layer which is actually the program that's running on on top of this processor to build this program we had to build an assembly for this processor and then the program that's actually the program that actually uh emulates the the ABM and actually runs the AVM together and all these are stuck in layers allows us to have different teams working in parallel each one in one of these layers and only that for example for auditing having also different audits running in parallel with different specialized teams working uh together in there this is what allows us to to to to build the things uh so fast you know this amazing team already mentioned before but this amazing team uh team that's absolutely has been absolutely committed working day night and weekends for the last two years because they believe in this project and learning together because it's like you you create a language and then you need to learn about that language and then you need to go back and forth and has been a huge effort but at the same time has been uh also a pleasure we enjoy it and and also I mean uh we had so fun also build that and these both things together this has worked this professionally is one of the team and this uh uh and and this uh I enjoy enjoying the work that having done is what uh allows us to to to to build this uh uh this product uh this uh polygon zqvm uh so fast so in order to uh launching in order to redo the real launch uh we decided to well uh that the way to do we say that the good way to do would be that uh to invite uh vitalik to do the symbolic first transaction of these uh office AVM so I would like to invite italic just to do uh these uh to do this transaction hello italic and thank you very much for accepting this uh this transaction next let's see if everything works you know this is a little bit risky but um it's uh good to be here good to see all of you guys um okay I shall uh I guess uh collect present and uh and then I click on here and then okay great so let's see okay you see my metamask 0.01e if I'm connected to the polygon ZK VM right yeah so then you did the bridge before so that's I did I did indeed I did the bridge before okay so then I have to send uh what address should I send to um okay let's uh go on polygon ckvm we'll check this uh most recent transaction and how about we'll take whoever sent it um so we'll send to them um and then sent to them 0.005 eth um 69042 have somewhere mean value and then click next yes maybe you want to put a message there or something okay okay how do I put a message again I I would show you I was just uh look I was looking this up and like gbt told me to like click on Advanced options but I don't see Advanced options okay but just adjust the normal transaction that's that should be fine okay you can share with us the message sure sure okay is there okay so did do you know how to like add call data by the way [Music] um like oh you yeah I mean it's Advanced options and show the data somewhere right right but I just like like I don't see the advanced options field that's the thing right I cannot see very good the screen but that's amazing uh here um oh there we go okay um foreign advanced in advanced in the second Advanced oh oh I see okay Advanced uh yes yes show data at this one just yeah there we go yeah okay okay let's see how this works um okay we're gonna click Send to this address send to oh there we go 0.005 um okay I said let's do a meme number and then over here okay great I have to create some hex data okay let me just make make the hex data first uh let's see you need something something corny I'll I'll do it recording [Music] okay is that corny enough for you that's perfect okay amazing okay going back here um send uh sent to the zero like seven whoever this is 0.005 that's a gas limit has to go to a meme number um and then next data zero X or whatever this is um no I have a team number okay next I just and then confirm okay send pending amazing we just it should now go forward okay and it says success um okay so we have so maybe yeah you can see the data there well we're already sure just showing in in the show just the selection lyrics There we go foreign well now we have officially launched security VM mainnight beta and we love turning we love it so uh now there's a big Welcome to our community to our developers to our Builder and um we just want to say that we're going to share everything that you need to know about mainai beta at 6 30 the Central European Time or at 4 30 GMT time so with that and with this excitement we will continue with the fireside chat and we will invite now vitalik and Jordi to stay in and no better person to take this fire chat on than mihilo thanks a lot Grace so much for the time the right person to do this now given house super exciting and super fun uh and yeah actually it turned out very well uh yeah hi everyone again uh I'm very very uh excited and and honored to have a very quick chat with two people that I tremendously expect and I think without further Ado Let's uh go into that right uh so I I think maybe we can just start emotionally if that's fine then we can reach back to rational conversation so just tell me how do you guys feel about what just happened uh just do you have any any current emotion that you can maybe share and what do you think about this event is it really uh an important Milestone as we believe and is it really a gift of to the to the community just any anything that you can just share about how you feel about um yeah no I mean I feel like very happy and you know excited for what's to come it's uh no the the whole ckvm thing is just something that I think we've all dreamed about and talked about for such a long time and like actually seeing it happen um you know on mainnet and seeing all of the Pieces come together and just work as like just you know so amazing for me is um okay it's a it's a strange feeling because uh and I've been like dreaming for this moment for two years okay but uh at this point uh once you get there and you know even the days before I'm more excited for the for tomorrow and for the day of after tomorrow and what will happen tomorrow and the day after tomorrow that's that we will plan what we are going to do next and uh how we are built and we have a lot of things in the in the backlog because in the last three months I mean we have been working very much in security and not doing like anything new just checking and and checking the code many times and all that and we have a lot of things to improve and and to do it better and so on so most for me the most exciting exciting of this event is that okay we will finish this phase and we will continue building and improving this is just a milestone I think it's an important Milestone because it's having something that was impossible okay no he's here it's a KVM it's possible we can build that but it's a long path uh for scale we are just starting uh to scale this is just the beginning and now we need to really scale I mean really mean making uh many transactions going faster and this is and and this is I think is an important step for because this will really scale uh well this is a it will start this this edge of scaling uh uh uh uh a helium and we finally will see applications that were not possible because you're scaling no make them possible with the security of ethereum so that's that's I I think this is a really important moment for the space thanks so much guys for sharing this so okay let's switch back to a rational conversation and maybe a little bit more technical but we can start uh for the sake we have more than 10 000 people I believe signed up and hopefully hopefully yeah that's the input that you got from from e-global uh friends and uh hopefully a lot of them are newcomers right and you want to onboard as many newcomers as possible so for for their sake and everyone's sake maybe if you can just uh just recap again what is the importance of this layer two solutions and ZK VM itself just briefly in your own words just for everyone maybe it's it's always useful to recap yeah so I think for the almost uh since uh ethereum launched I've been talking about scaling as uh you know one of the most important problems for ethereum to solve and I think uh for being at the beginning like for the first few years of ethereum's growth that was definitely pretty theoretical right like we we use that ethereum had to scale somehow to be able to serve um you know future millions of people user base but like at the time transactions were cheap for the users that ethereum has ethereum worked fine uh but then uh especially uh in the last few years and then like the last bull run like it just became queer how expensive the ethereum mainnet is right like I remember the like a visiting Argentina and just like seeing how everyone is using a binance account right and like from their perspective it makes perfect sense because Finance to finance transfers don't have fees but uh at the same time you know I think uh as a crypto ecosystem like you know we will we do wants to ultimately yeah move Beyond to the centralized approaches and I mean I'm I'm sure even um you know a lot of people in binance feel that I feel that way as well right but uh you know making something that's uh decentralized and uh hard for and easy for and practical for people to use at the same time it's just like so much harder than uh you know making something centralized and easy to use right and uh then you know last year we saw the FTX situation and we just like keep seeing all of these incidents that just remind us um you know in a very real and practical way why yeah decentralized access to the chain being possible and being a reality is just so important because if you don't have that then you know you have this kind of like centralized centralized on top of decentralized Frankenstein that seems to just like sometimes be even less secure than just doing the whole thing centralized top to bottom right um and so I think uh you know scalability yeah and decentralization at the same time is like this really a hugely important thing and uh like for the last couple of years I think the ethereum ecosystem has been focused on Roll-Ups as a primary strategy for scaling uh basically just because uh ethereum chords developer time is limited uh the ethereum Network's ability to handle complexity is limited and so we did it once to kind of give every responsibility to layer to the layer one and we wanted to leave open some room for Independence Innovation to happen and so uh you know we've recently had this cellular or two ecosystem uh start to emerge and uh well I think these days dollar or two ecosystem has existed for some time right but uh for me like 2023 in particular is uh the year what it wants to see the way or two ecosystem really mature and uh for me like a big the biggest part of maturity is like Layer Two is becoming actual layer tiers right in the sense of like you know you don't just have like some um you know claim that like oh you know we're going to have a proof system in the future and like actually we just have a multi-sig like no you have proofs right and um you know you have a system where the your coins in the layer two are like actually protected by Math instead of being um you know protected by some you know group of like uh you know five out of nine people or whatever the number is where if they want to um you know go and grab up your uh 29 million uh dollars and uh in enjoy a retirement in some tropical beach country that's not Montenegro then you know you don't really have much defense against that so it's uh you know seeing I think you know polygon maker so much progress uh from uh just in terms of improving its security model over the last couple of years has been uh truly amazing and it's uh something that I can you know look forward to seeing the the rest of the layer 2 ecosystem too as well right and uh I mean yeah I'm just like excited to see um you know scaling not just be this kind of theoretical thing but actually be something that ethereum already has solved in practice we are just taking the theory and just bringing to the role so real problems and uh whenever when I enter the space you know it's just for me was amazing but because okay this this you can do so many things but actually when you want to do the things you get you just start discovering the limitations of space so okay but I want to use this because I think it's amazing so uh this is what that what I've been working on is okay what we need what we need to put this amazing technology in in in people's hands and and and extend that to that any anybody in the in the world can can use it and and well you see there are many things but security uh I mean uh usability but but scheming was fundamental if you can do uh just uh I don't know 30 transactions per second this is not enough it's not enough for the world but certainly not even for us uh a relatively small community so how how do we have to do I have been thinking a lot about that you know State channels we think about the plasma you know a lot of Air Force happens and and when pull-ups you know I remember this blog post from Vitaly some people uh just working on they say they uh happens okay it's like we start seeing the light and it's like okay this is a it's a path there okay splitting the data availability and the execution on the part and and and okay it's all off path but we just but we just took this path you know Foundation I think is doing a great advance in the that availability and so on and uh the the the the the ecosystem is also working out on these roll ups and these layer tools and and everything is looking that it's a long journey but everything is looking that uh we in in in in in in in no in few years we can have this uh uh this technology available to to the to the peoples and that's I think that's that's what's about thank you so much guys this this was really great uh maybe let's go just a little bit deeper a little bit more Technical and and uh as we see uh recently there there have been multiple projects that started working on zkvm and we at polygon and I'm sure vitalik as well we're very happy that that's the case but uh that um introduced the need for a little bit of clarity ideally what ZK vmes are there some different types of EK VM and italic recently introduced and helped a lot on that run by uh publishing blog posts about four different types of dkvms and basically that we're introducing at least some initial nomenclature for for this great technology and I wanted to ask you guys a little bit more um about that if you can chime in both you vitalik and Jordi first of all uh polygons EK VM varieties which type of ZKA limit is uh what is going to be in the future and maybe about the nomenclature itself vitalik if you now from this perspective would you consider changing anything in the nomenclature and uh just generally how you feel about about the whole nomenclature basically does it mean for example that the type one is by default the best solution or it's not that black and white just generally to chat about that a little bit in the context of polygons EK VM and in general about nomenclature of the TVs mm-hmm maybe Jordy answer the polygon question first yeah I I mean uh we are I think that was this this this blog post about classifying I think this clarify a lot of things because at the moment there were a lot of different Roll-Ups doing different things and you know the marketing people just putting things and bringing and this clarify a lot because at the end from the technical perspective is is what it is and and and the things in the case of the polygon we Define ourselves as a Type 3 I think we feel very good in type 3 and we are going in the direction to be a type 2 that's a little bit uh the the path that we are so uh the idea is to get closer and closer to ethereum we want to implement uh some record parts of our contracts that are not uh ready yet and there are some I mean some small details uh uh you know this new type of transactions and there are some small details that we want to get closer to that to that to that front we are going in that direction and I think this is a good this is a good uh activity the fact that for example in your system the people don't have to reuse the don't have to reuse the the tooling so they'll have to use a different tooling so they can reuse all the ethereum tooling so you just use uh Solitude you just use remix or you just use a hard hat and you just build and you just connect with the room and you go there this compatibility uh is really good for the end for the end user so I think this is a good uh compromise uh for uh having a lot of users using mm-hmm yeah so I guess so from my perspective like the way that you would that I would summarize the type system in like one sentence is basically that the the lower the number of the type is the closer it is to a like basically being an exact copy of uh ethereum CVM and uh the higher the number of the type is the further away from that it is but the reason why you might want to do a higher type evm is because either it's easier to develop or because uh if you make Duo some things that are a bit different from the evm then you can get some efficiency benefits that the yeah that you can't do otherwise right so like the difference between type 1 and type 2 for example is type 1 requires like perfect compatibility to the point where you can verify ethereum's existing execution layer and that involves some like very fairly synark unfriendly things like uh potentially verifying a huge amount of cash act right um and if you want you could go and like replace catch up with some more Stark snark Stark friendly hash function right and that's something that's possible but and like is probably is the correct thing to do for layer or two is today and like five years from now probably will be even the correct activities for the layer one uh but it's uh it does mean that today you're not going to be the same as a lawyer one anymore right um so I think like my view of what the ideal is is I think the ideal for a ckvm implementation is for it to be configurable and support all the types right like I think ni DLC KVM would have settings so that if you want you can turn it on to run with a you know catchy acrylic Patricia tree and that it can verify ethereum blocks or you can set it to run with some more ZK optimize stuff and uh you know it'll be more efficient for you it'll have like that might even have different pre-compiles and you know depending on what you want and you'd be able to kind of choose you know how to what extent you want compatibility and to what extent you want efficiency and like that could be a that should be more of a project by project choice and uh I think it should be possible to make ckvl implementations that kind of like make it possible to um to hit all sides of that and I feel like it probably shouldn't be too hard to do that if you're like starting from the higher types and moving toward the lower types right because you like you you had your previous code anyway right so you just kind of make it open either way I did myself the exercise to say okay you get all this technology because what you're doing is if you have you learn a lot and it's just a challenge every week and and it's like okay with this technology it's if you want to do okay forget about uh being feeling compatible and let's try to do a a deficient and listen let's see how we would do it um the interesting thing is that I would not change many things uh you know the the way that we were able to optimize there are things that probably yes I know there are things like memory alignment and things that are a little bit tricky in ethereum and and probably I would remove some of these pieces but not that many uh you know the way that we are Computing for example arithmetics in different bright Fields the way that we are Computing catchers whenever you're Computing hash functions the way that we are uh working with the storage the way that we are executing the programs and uh yeah I mean yeah it could be some differences but it should not be it's much less that I could I was I I you may think uh uh uh what what you saw uh and that's because the the grade of optimization that uh that we get just and being compatible so for us it's the requirement is okay we want to be ethereum compatible uh so uh that that's the specification so let's see what we can do with that and and we learn that much in this process that so we come up to some really good tricks and really good algorithms that okay this is even better that if we were not if we were doing something different to that so that's something to be the the conclusions that that that we're getting there of course I mean this is they'll think so it's a spectrum of things and we should go like piece by piece but in many pieces is you should not be very different thanks a lot guys I I would have so many uh questions in addition to this but maybe let's just touch on one and then we can slowly wrap it up because we have to adhere to the schedule I guess uh so um we're very happy that we deliver this right and we uh have we believe we are generally made it ready right we have uh multiple external audits multiple internal audits we have test net that has been running for months and and all of that uh but still it's very important to say that this is very complex technology this is new technology that hasn't been delivered before and uh it's important to be responsible right uh with that in mind uh Vitali published another blog post very recently where he speaks about uh proposed basically milestones for for zke AVM Roll-Ups or Roll-Ups in general when it comes to introducing or slowly removing some sort of training wheels and security measures so I know we have a basic security focused panel in a while uh but if you can just find one sentence maybe share your thoughts also about maybe this italic proposed roadmap or or model and just anything in general about the KVM when it comes to this responsible uh yeah sure um so I think uh like that that blog or well magician's post was also motivated by just like seeing this kind of confusion and like you know definitely this kind of like weird marketing situation where there are you know a lot of different projects in the space that uh call themselves away or twos and uh you know they're like people don't really understand like what actually makes earlier too old or two what makes it not only or two what makes a way or two decentralized and like and all of these things right and uh the goal of uh the post was basically to kind of you know help people sort of like zero in on like the thing that matters which is security right and uh the thing that matters insecurity which is basically this kind of complicated trade-off of uh you know when do you trust put more trust in the people and uh once you put more trust in the code right and it's a it's like a complicated trade-off to navigate especially because we're dealing with this uh you know fairly young technology that inevitably has bugs and uh probably is going to continue and a half bucks for some time uh but basically yeah you know the challenge is like on the one hand um you know we want to actually start moving away from um you know just uh systems that claim to be a lawyer to us but actually just like require completely trusting some small committee right like we don't actually want to say somewhere a uh four of seven multisig and uh you know run off with uh 29 million dollars and have a vacation in a tropical island country um but uh at the same time like you know we want to try to do it responsibly and uh if you kind of you know on day one uh just uh just to get ahead of everyone else um you know push out a release and say okay guys code is what um and then you know people uh throw in 29 billion dollars and then it turns out that there's a bug then like that's pretty bad too right so I think that what I tried to do is kind of structure things and uh identify a couple of uh middle grounds right so the three stages that I did that I identified well I call them stage zero stage one and stage two and uh stage zero is basically like full trust the people right so basically something that has kind of like the scaffolding of a roll-up and uh you know you get some big transactions you have backup channels you have all these things but at the same time you know there is some kind of override mechanism and like ultimately the override mechanism can decide where the money goes with a 51 threshold right so it's like a full training wheels thing stage two basically says you're fully running on the code now there is like kind of one Nuance that I did uh kind of allowing the stage two definition which is that you can what you can do is have a mechanism where if someone can prove that the code disagrees with itself then you can flip an emergency switch and uh what a uh you know humans come in right but and like code disagreeing with itself could happen in two different ways right like you could have two different ZK VMS you could have one zkvm and this which would be like if someone can successfully prove two different state routes for the same data like you know there's lots of different ways to do this or on the other side if no one submits a valid thing for an entire week right that might that would also suggest that something is broken uh but other otherwise like if the code is uh like the idea would be that if the code is running correctly the humans have no ability to over uh to override the code right and like that's a long-term goal but that like requires being like pretty confident in the code and the code's ability to not have like certain kinds of really serious bugs stage one is this kind of middle ground right where basically it's kind of like halfway in between right where for stage zero you need 51 of the humans uh to uh you know override and move money to wherever they want for stage two you need a hundred and one percent of the humans right 101 greater than 100 so you can't do it and then for stage one you need 75 of the humans uh so the uh the thing that I suggested was uh at least six of eight where there's uh enough people in that multisigs that are outside of the organization so that the organization by itself can't just uh go and move the funds wherever it wants to and and uh with this kind of threshold like you still have the ability to intervene if things really go wrong right and like I've uh like I've been in multi-cigs a lot right and like if really serious stuff happens then like you know generally yeah you you pretty quickly can get almost anyone right it's like almost everyone especially if their professional but um you know at the same time it's like uh like getting to something like it's much harder for 75 percent of people to collude and decide to go to a tropical island that it is for 50 right so you know it's this kind of middle and my goal for 2023 has been that like I want the layer two ecosystem to basically move to at least the equivalent of stage one and I think it's okay to stay in stage one for a pretty long time right because I think you know we do wants to be confident that the technology Works before we put even more trust in it but like if you don't have like like if you're in stage zero then you're basically not like really yeah giving any decision-making power to the code at all right and like it doesn't really matter if you're SDK roll-up or an optimistic roll-up or what kind of roll-up ultimately you're just a multi-state controlled by the security Council so in stage one you're basically saying okay well you know we have an actual proof system and the proof system has actual power but we don't necessarily yeah quite give it all the power and you know if uh there there is room for some Security Council if there's like strong agreement inside it to override what the uh what the proof system says in case of a bug and so I think like stage one is this nice Middle Ground where you know we're not just talking about these very centralized things that we've had so far we're talking about like actual proof systems whether they're optimistic or ZK that have teeth and that actually have like a a strong influence in uh what happens on chin but at the same time you know we leave some room for error and uh we don't kind of trust things fully and like this is something that I think should be achievable for um you know but uh at least many uh both um you know ZK VM and uh optimistic evm projects this year right like I've I've also talked to a couple of a couple other ones and like I know arbitrum for example they want to like open up their proof system uh real really soon and um I think they have some uh um Security Council parameters that are like even more stringent than uh what the yes what the stage one requirements are um so you know I would love to see polygon that you know really join the stage one Camp soon as well and uh you know really yeah kind of set this set the standard for like hey you know you have to have an actual proof system the proof system has to actually run in the proof system has to actually have some teeth but you know like still in a way where we still have uh you know we're not kind of like turning the trust over from zero to 100 from day one and we and you know we can be a bit careful and uh still uh you know kind of scoot for a couple of years while we yeah make sure that everything really is completely safe and then we keep going forward from there yeah just to mention here that in polygon ckvm is uh it's well it's a stage one actually we changed the BTC this morning in a six out of eight it was four out of seven and with this morning we changed it to six out of five just to be on the stage uh and but we are the cool thing is that we are quite prepared at least from the cold perspective uh stage two actually we could be uh stage two if you want of course we don't want to be because until until we feel safe we want at least uh but what are the pieces the pieces that we are missing to be a stage two is well first of all we need to enable the we need to enable the the force transactions we will probably will uh in in a few weeks because this is an important mechanism and this is something that uh we disabled in the last minute for some issues but we will enable it uh in two in two three weeks probably the reason other thing is removing this skill switch this is probably the the hardest part because I mean we need to feel comfortable that the the security is there so this will probably stay we are setting that we want to be running the the the system at least six months without finding any critical uh issue at least so that's so that's we will take a little bit it while on that and the other is the the the the time log for the upgradability right now is 10 days and we need to increase that to 30 days in order but this is So the plan is there and it's more about getting uh comfortability of the code and we will continue running you know back bounties and Audits and probably some upgrades in there so we'll stay here for a while yeah no I mean I definitely really appreciate the commitment to security and I'm like you know I'm so happy that uh you know we finally you know have a layer or two with teeth are running on mainnet now so you know big congratulations there thank you thank you so much both again uh if I can just share my humble opinion I totally agree uh as we saw like as Jordy said pulling on ckvm is formally I guess type one um sorry a state a stage one when it comes to these three wheels and I totally agree that uh um uh this targeting uh basically stage one for 2023 as as you said vitalik is the the Rises the the optimal and responsible approach because we really want to uh uh transition to to full safety gradually right and full permissionless uh Solutions um great this has been a fantastic discussion thanks you guys thank you guys so much and just if you have any closing messages or anything that you would like to share with the community any sort of message or or advice or anything and then we can slowly wrap it up my site is just to give a try I mean just uh it's a network a new network there it's a ckb and there so if you are a developer if you are a user and and just make a try and see how simple it is just to to build on top of uh or on top of the polygons again yeah I mean I I mean I have tried like sending two transactions and it's been pretty easy so far and so you know I do recommend thank you thanks a lot Grace please thank you to work thank you well thank you very much and it was an insightful chat and after all Michael you did make a balance between the rational and the irrational the yeah myself it's important myself it came out absolutely perfectly balanced and as as far as Jordy I know that we can check this check a a fire chat with vitalik out of your bucket list that's definitely something that we can check it out so now well the uh now that we had this fireside chat it's a good set week on where are we going next so we have two amazing panels that are coming up this particular one is about the building trustless scaling Solutions so I think there's going to be a very engaging conversation around security around auditing around pooling around you know what decentralization means and so on so we will invite um Brendan okay yes please Jordy and vitalik stays with us Brendan is our moderator hi Brendan welcome and I was going to introduce everyone in the in the panel but I think you should do this one so I'll let you in and uh and get started I think we're missing a person we're missing from uh hexins hmm and Alex is there okay I wonder I wonder what happened anyway um I'll let you continue then cool cool take it away so the focus of this panel is going to be on uh building trustless scaling Solutions particularly around security and auditing um I think I I guess for for those of us who are new to the event um Alex Daniel Barry uh would you like to briefly introduce yourselves I guess Alex starting to relax um yeah sure um I hope you can hear me now yeah yeah I spent um a significant number of years on on evm Research um mostly at the ethereum foundation um and you know regarding um polygon ckvm at Spirit we assembled a number of different teams um to to conduct review and I've been participating on the evm side mostly on on um you know even compatibility questions um how the the ckvm would compare to to mainnet and if there's any differences what kind of risks those could pose to you know on multiple facets including language languages um yeah I think that's like a short intro cool uh uh Daniel do you want to go next yeah sure Daniel from polygon zero so we work on a separate evm which is focused on type 1 compatibility and also working on related technology like Punky 2 and now Punky three cool uh yes I I also work with with Daniel and then last but definitely not least uh Barrett do you want to briefly introduce yourself briefly introduce yourself hello um can you hear me yeah yeah hey I'm I'm Barry I I worked on a whole bunch of like Z gay things and including I had a lot of fun working with Shorty in the on the early stage dkvm stuff so I'm happy to be here today cool cool well I I think we can just jump into it I I think it's safe to say you know Geordie from conversations that we've had that security is uh yeah Chris yes I'm sorry but we do have Baja now okay everyone is there now uh five do you want to introduce yourself all right uh yeah so so I I think it's safe to say Jordy from you know conversations that we've had uh internally at polygon that security has sort of been the guiding principle of the development of this in KVM and so I I wonder if you could just talk at a super high level about the philosophy and the perspective around security and auditing and sort of building a system that that fundamentally protects uh user funds so we would love to do yeah but there has been probably uh probably it has been the biggest challenge uh the biggest challenge of the full system you know because um these systems are really complex and uh it builds a lot of new pieces that are built uh on top uh that are built for this so one single piece that goes wrong and and the system is just insecure and and and and this is really I mean this is really problematic and it has been difficult here uh when we Face a security uh we just uh we just it has been uh I mean just trying to isolate um the the things that can go wrong and and and and and just trying to to and and just trying to find the right mitigations uh for the things that you know that can go wrong so in the case of uh uh polygon we just distinguish like four four things that can go wrong one is uh smart contracts we know very much about what can go wrong in smart contract and this is what type of things the other is the correctness uh this is really bad if the correctness of the proof I mean you are proving something that's correct but this this correctness goes to uh that you know some balance is wrong this is really bad and you cannot do much about that the good the good things on this point is that because it's ethereum compatible we just leverage on top so we just run all the ethereum uh all the video uh uh tests all the other so and we are passing all the relevant ethereum tests there there's more than thousands of tests there these give us a good uh the confidentiality that uh there are no uh no correctness uh errors or at least it's difficult to get the correctness errors because I mean all the tests are passing so everything is working as it's supposed to be this is not exactly so there are some exceptions and there are things that can go wrong and we find something at some point about that and we were being very decision that's really difficult uh the one that's really easy uh is the the soundness or soundnesser in the program is just for getting some constraint this is really easy and this is what uh I mean and uh we can go wrong and and here the the mitigation is it was actually was proposed by vitalik at some point at least but there are two mitigations the first is that if you are running uh if you have a priority proverb so if you are running the proofs you are not going to prove something that's wrong so I mean this is difficult but the proverb may stop or or if you want to have a decentralized system you need anybody to run approver and here is where maybe two if two Proverbs go from the same estate with different with the same transactions to different states then you can detect that automatic in the smart contract and how about the system these these two mitigations are good for the softness which is really easy to have a release date and the other the fourth one is more technical but it's like uh that you just stopped the program just gets stop it and because you cannot generate the proof but this is just the mitigation is very easily because the system just to stop sending seven days in the time mode you just upgrade the system and you continue so here yeah so this is all the things and that's why you feel comfortable for launching but again you know security is you never have the 100 uh uh security that the system is is is correct right so so we we sort of have this framework where uh errors can be either correctness um soundness are as an approver and then smart contract uh bugs is that is that sort of safety in the bridge yeah and then they already is not the proverb that you you are not able to generate the proof which is okay so yeah okay okay so so given that framework um I guess it would be really interesting to hear from Alex and then uh Vai uh we didn't get a chance to hear your intro so so we could provide that but but just um like what the experience has been auditing different parts of uh the system uh sort of within that framework of different areas like like how do you approach auditing for correctness how do you approach auditing for proofers on this um so it'd be cool to sort of your perspective yeah uh thank you Brendan and sorry guys I had some issues with the video so I skipped the intro uh so I'm I'm the CTO and co-founder of accents we did the audit for the zkvm uh so about the question I would say that um with the soundness I wouldn't say that there is uh a lot of things different than testing for completeness and soundness I would say that it's about the approach that you take in auditing the different layers of the of the ZK evm because basically it has like if you we can call it like Hardware layer firmware layer and application layer and uh one thing that we're trying to do is that uh when further we go down into the layers for example we were when when we were auditing like Hardware uh layer we're trying to use also some toolings there because like static analysis uh and like Dynamic analysis trying to write like a small small tools uh some toolings that will help us out because basically that's where almost everything is connected with some edge cases and like the the bigger the cover the coverage them the better and you have a lot of for example auditing peel State machines you have a lot of constraints and a lot of assumptions it's hard to just remember all of them sometimes so uh yeah it's better to use some toolings in that kind of situation and also like the manual review uh it's it's always the manual review for every layer that you do I mean you you sometimes you cannot find uh edge cases that will be found programmatically you just need to watch them just that's pretty much it yeah yeah I would say a single like uh word answer to the question and what was the what did it felt like it felt like scary like extremely scary getting into it um because you know the ckvm team has built a number of languages a lot of tooling um a lot of different parts um and you know they were also constantly improving the system and conducting an internal review um but they were super helpful in in setting up trainings um training workshops and being available to to answer any kind of questions um when looking at any of the different layers um I think what's what has been challenging of course is um the the different layers and you know what kind of understanding and knowledge and background and those different layers required and then the connection between the layers um I think generally it has been you know initially it was like extremely scary scary but as you get into it um you build up confidence um and especially um you know the the fact that um polygons equation is able to execute most of the ethereum state tests um that was a reassuring fact and there was in fact a good starting point to to dig deeper and see why any of those test cases would have been disabled there could have been a number of reasons um mostly because the test cases required um gas higher than what the approval would support um so even just investigating from that level down um it is possible to to find a number of different uh issues um but I think generally we had a number of different teams looking at the different parts the state machines have been looked in isolation um um the the evm instructions have been looked in isolation and then then there is like a stage where you try to connect these dots together um I think tooling is is um where they try to to invent some tooling especially for the peel uh for the peel layer um but I think even um you know the harmony centers technology is there's just not enough tooling what I seem to be uh somewhat useful is is pattern matching um and you know once you identified a given issue which may look which may look like something you want to to investigate further um I think some of those patterns were emerging in multiple Parts um so yeah I think pattern matching is is um you know when you look at such nascent technology that's that's uh more useful than trying to invent um complex tooling cool cool that makes a lot of sense uh I want to add that I definitely shared the sense of scare that that's the thing yeah I was just trying to be more pragmatic on the unanswer but yeah sure uh yeah about the tooling part so uh it was a lot of uh pattern matches like variant analysis thing uh of course yeah I mean creating a complex tooling here I mean hard in an Overkill rather than using like variant analysis techniques cool makes sense um so so Barry we we already heard that uh your conversations with Jordy sort of served as the Genesis for this entire project and you guys are long time friends um I I I'm really curious to hear from both you and vitalik uh sort of how the EF sees its role as like shepherding and stewarding these protocols and projects um into maturity and into production and uh particularly in the context of security and audits sure thank you Brandon um so yeah the way I think about this is that like there's a lot of different layer tools that are sort of like working to scale ethereum and one thing that I would really like to see on the security Dimension is more collaboration between the different layer tubes I feel like a very nice security parameter we could have is if we had a ZK roll up that also had a fraud proof and the fraud proof was just like the fraud proof was one of the members of the security Council for example and if the fraud-proof disagreement is he with the zkp then then we would have to fall back to the security Council to like decide and and break the tide I think that this is a very nice kind of underrated feature where we have all these teams working independently but I I would like to see eventually everyone sort of joining forces and working together because at the end of the day like you get a lot more security we're having a roll up with like a foolproof and a validity proof cool and then yeah uh Vitality would just be really cool to get yourself yeah I mean I think uh in general like in development of all these new technologies like the ethereum foundation tries its best to uh play a supporting role um at the same time you know try to avoid picking winners in the uh kind of you know projects and application space and I'm going to try to support projects so that kind of uplift the entire ecosystem and uh you know kind of play those more and like supportive tasks that are you know valuable things across the entire ecosystem that are more kind of coordination related that I would make much less sense for each individual team to do on its own and so forth um so uh you know sometimes so sometimes that has meant a great like writing and contributing to specific pieces of code though I think even there like we're we've been striving to not have the foundation dominate that and like you know bring in contributions from other way or two teams and uh someone and some other teams uh sometimes that involves being supportive on the security and auditing sites sometimes that supports other things but like generally yeah you know trying to kind of foregrounds to people um you know in the ecosystem that are that are doing all the yeah amazing work as much as possible cool cool very cool uh and so Daniel it would be uh really interesting to hear from your perspective being internal to polygon um how sort of the culture of uh collaboration around security and auditing actually functions I I know that you were uh one of the participants uh on the internal audit of flock um so yeah it would be great to get your perspective yeah yeah it's been a nice really nice collaboration between polygon zero the Hermes and the mighty team so together we're sort of the the ZK side of polygon um yeah so my involvement in Hermes ckvm was fairly small but yeah one thing I was able to do was help to to do an internal audit of the flank code which was very very interesting to learn about and see how they were doing things um yeah they'd say we we just have a lot of really good discussions with with these internal teams about what the right approach is especially when it comes to sort of training wheels or or backup layers of security which um what sort of backup layers can we come up with to make sure that worst case if there is a sadness bug then uh we we have some kind of fallback option and it's not just game over yeah cool cool and so back to Jordy it it would be really interesting to hear about your uh sort of perspective on the road map for you know what training wheels we have now like what the process of taking them off will look like um and and sort of like the end state that you'd like to to get to yeah well first of all let me let me let me point one thing that just to to answer the lead bar in here and is that uh all the audits uh our our public I don't know if the last ones maybe are in the draft mode but if they are not public now they will be public like uh tomorrow uh you can check that in the repos so what the repos they have a directory without it and I mean it's called transparency here I I would recommend all the uh prolapse especially the CK relapse the space to read those audits because as the people say here that it's there is a lot of patterns a lot of things that were discovered and you can learn a lot just reviewing uh those Audits and I think it's it's called uh for the security in there and of course we are absolutely open I mean just I think collaboration is is key in here I mean sharing and being transparenting with solids I think is the one step in in that direction for the future uh we will we just started I think was last Friday about the program I think that continuous auditing is is fundamental for here we will continue to you know we plan some upgrades as I mentioned just including this contract so we this will be complemented with some Audits and we probably will do uh some realities of some of the parts we already have identified some of the teachers that maybe should be more check out more closely or you know that just talking with different eliters to hear we have a good feedback of what are the more dark you know dark zones and clear zones and what are the concerns and we're sharing a lot this this feeling with the different teams and yeah security is uh just uh invest as much as you can and and and put as much effort as you can it's not never is going to be enough so here is uh reporting on behalf of a full team full security team just working in that direction we have a full budget uh uh in security and and and it's a huge commitment in there and the worst thing is that you never have the you never have this this confidence but uh that doesn't mean that you look after invest as much as you can makes sense um um yeah I I I I guess would be interesting to hear about um like where this space can sort of go because I I know that we've invested a lot of time and developing tooling for pill and ZK assembly and I I wonder like in the future uh do you feel like the burden of auditing will be reduced as we build more tooling like how do we get to to sort of a state where we can do uh more kind of Rapid development without as much of a burden on auditing do you think that's possible you should be interested to get your perspective yeah I think uh that toolings are something that need needs to be done I mean it will never interchange the the audit the review from people at least in the foreseen future I think uh but the tooling is a must-have in any case so because it will help uh it will shorten the time uh of the of the reviews it will uh help help a lot of ways like for example if you can fuzz something it it helps a lot with uh an exception that just going through by hand and doing everything manually but it it it will never interchange the the audit itself I think maybe not never but like as I said in the near future yeah it seems safe to say that formal verification for ZK VM is still uh pretty far away right now maybe not uh Alex anything to add on on tooling and sort of automating certain parts of the audit um yeah I think certainly I mean the tools we have created were more about um transforming peel to be more readable um in certain aspects and then maybe being able to create some proofs for certain properties um we did initially um in the first engagement we did try to do that and you can see um some of the the results of that in the first report and later we learned that actually polygon also has a similar inspection tool um with a web interface um but regarding you know more rapid development um I think what we found generally is um um you know the separation of Peel and zksm may have proved to to be a tiny bit of a bottleneck at least for us because you have two this you know disjoint systems which then are connected through various paths and we kind of felt that maybe if there would be you know a language in between the two so you wouldn't have like two separate systems maybe that would have helped but it's really hard to tell you at this point um and then I think the other tools which would be useful is more like um you know IDE plugins to help you navigate the the system much better so one example in in zksm the syntax itself uh it took um you know a bit of time to get used to um and as you have um generally a lot of utilities um just jumping to utilities and seeing what kind of constraints or registers they clobber that is like a big question right um it is it is really basically like what assembly is with calling conventions where you have to be aware what kind of pieces could be overwritten what pieces are saved um and I think some kind of an ID extension to help navigate these um could definitely improve the review process and then also had to actually generate some of this code the arithmetic State machine seemed to have been generated um you know by a different piece of code and if you have such pieces where you can generate the pill code or the zksm code and you can be uh you know certain that the generator is correct maybe it is possible to formally verify the generator that is something which could also reduce the the time um you know to review um but you know as it stands today um I think the the really big Saving Grace is the testing Suite um but unfortunately as you can as you see over time in in mainnet no matter how many tests you have they're always going to be edge cases found um if especially if you look at the pre-compiles those those are like cards but for issues um and you know more complex call Related um instructions I mean one big one in the past has been returned data um and I think these pieces maybe even even more you know complicated in ckvm just the way um you know memory and any of these constraints are handled so yeah I would definitely welcome a lot of tooling and I think over time we may get closer to to have more velocity um in reviewing this but I don't think manual review will ever really stop um in any of these systems um because you you need to have a holistic View and um you know some intuition into something which may not be a pattern cool well that makes sense um I I I'm curious George about the uh uh sort of the upgrade path for zkbm so suppose that um uh the evm101 introduces new eips or uh for some reason we want to change like the hash function um in the state tree how do you see that functioning I actually Daniel if we also get your perspective on this as well that would be great but but starting with Jordy um what sort of like do like do you see the optimal path being uh sort of upgraded in place with a multi-sig is it migrating to a new roll-up like how what what what's sort of the optimal [Music] um we are we are selling same compatible so the idea is so at least what's in the Davis to be uh uh just upgrade it in place so I mean just doing some upgrades of course there are some you know some pieces that could be a little bit of complex for example mentioned that if you want to upgrade the the hash function okay then maybe that would be just a full free state of the system you can do a proof of a statementation actually with aggregation we can we can actually build that but I think this may be maybe long so here we need to see Case by case and see what kind of upgrade we do but most of the upgrades that we have planned at least in the short run are going to be just adding functionality and maybe just uh adjusting some compatibility issues in the in the ABN so at least for a while it's going to be that way so the the idea is to be as close as possible to uh ethereum so it's translating from type 3 to type through type 2 ideally in a year we should be attached to uh roll up if everything goes uh okay makes sense Daniel anything to add on upgrading robes yeah I think I think most upgrades are fairly straightforward because uh well the the ones that would be difficult would be once the touch date and like changing the hash function for example would be more complicated migration but others would be fairly easy and I think it shouldn't be that much work to keep up with changes to ethereum because um you know for good reason it they happen very slowly [Music] um yeah on our side we've implemented some things already like BLS which is not not actually uh you know it's still a VIP it hasn't hasn't fully landed yet but we just have it ready in for if or when that happens um yeah but but overall I don't think upgrades will be a big deal unless we need to do something like change the hash function cool cool um and then I I I'd like to go off script a little bit and ask I I'm actually very curious on italics uh perspective on this um to to what extent do you think that it's uh important for um for ethereum to eventually be sort of succinctly verified and I think obviously we're talking about incorporating eiqs like to what extent do you think that the future design of the ethereum L1 should have sort of take into account like ZK friendliness and uh so that we get to to the point where we might eventually I think that's crucially important I mean I think uh like I've been talking a lot about the you know the importance of preserving and improving upon the decentralization of the ethereum network and I think in the long term a really important part of the decentralization of the network is going to be just everyone being able to really easily it verify the rules of the chain right like I've talked about how like I think it should be possible to stake not even just on a laptop but on a phone and for something like that to be a reality like like phones are very good at bandwidth right but they're very bad at computation um and so um you know you were basically are going to have to you know use something like a snork or a stark to uh replace the computation or verifying Unitarian block with uh something much simpler and the nice thing is that like especially with things like PBS and the various stuff that's coming here on the Mev pipeline the computational load of running a node actually should be pretty low like it literally should be possible to make it literally just be verifying once like downloading a bunch of data has to get in verifying a snark and like that is a yeah like to me definitely a dream long-term future for ethereum like um actually if you uh look at the yeah the roadmap like um you know picture that I published on Twitter I think at the end of last year like uh in The Verge um I yeah after the Virgo tree is you know the Verge is no longer just about vocal trees The Verge is the about verification and you know adding I added in um you know a section where kind of the ultimate goal basically is you know removing reducing the cost of verifying the chain down to verifying one proof so uh I would absolutely love it if the layer one could uh eventually make its way over to uh satisfying that goal over the next five or ten years I uh my my cell phone is often dead so I I'm sort of uh terrified of the inactivity penalty if I were to stick from my phone but I'm sure for uh more responsible people that that would be a very workable model um well cool I I think this has been I mean I have two old phones with me that I'm no longer using so you know like I just like put one of those up for staking and like leave it out yeah yeah that's noodles okay cool uh the the spell has been uh really interesting really fun um I guess uh I think we're right at time but um I I guess Jordy do you want to leave us with a closing thought um about uh you know security auditing zkbm and painting in production I would say that especially for the users just be responsible uh I mean it's a new thing I mean it's a new there is many things that can go wrong so we need to find you know we do we need to be responsible of course we want this to use and we want this to happen the security is also about uh people using and this is how the things get stronger just having this maturity uh of the things but at the same time uh we need to understand and hear um so it's important to put the effort to explain to the people that this is a very new technology that's a very nice technology it's a very good technology it's all the technology of the future but it's just it just get boring so do not go crazy uh and and understand that we are in the early days of this technology and taking a contact you know you don't put all the savings and start asking for more touch and putting the money there so just things like that cool well great well yes well thank you very much I I thank you all the panelists for this uh gray panel and also just wanted to say that we we encourage collaboration and I'm happy that Barry actually mentioned that between the the ckvm Roll-Ups and now we leave Brendan and vitalik in this panel we bring in Hudson who's gonna moderate the next panel there you are I I just wanted to give a a little um parenthesis here that I wanted to thank the the Auditors that were in the previous panel and to also um remind people that we have already published all the the audit results and we can we have them available in our repository so encouraging people to come and take a look at those uh audit results and this panel I think it's uh probably one of my favorite ones we're talking about evolving the CK stack but more on the ethos side the web 3 and and here I wish I could be part of this panel open source development decentralization all the stuff that we love and we keep here so that's then I leave you with your paddle thank you so much grace yes uh so hi everyone I'm Hudson um I work at polygon labs and generally I'm an ethereum rascal on Twitter uh today we have a great set of panelists um so many of them have already been introduced but I'll go through the people who haven't been introduced so the hollow we know that guy vitalik has stopped working on his masternode to sneak into this call uh we'll accept them uh we got David uh what's uh what's your story just like a sentence or two well I'm one of the co-founders of polygons eqm and I am basically leading the project and product side for a long time so super excited about this launch absolutely awesome yeah hi uh I'm a leader of the polygon Milan project which is uh you know another ZK Focus project with polygon wonderful and Anthony okay last but not least my name is Anthony I'm also one of the co-founders of polygons and in my case I'm more focused on the operations and and the you decide gotcha gotcha all right this is gonna be a really good panel because I looked over the questions and I made tweaks to make this more interesting a little bit so uh let's get started with the first one so Mahalo earlier this year the polygon teams got together to align on a common product Vision uh that was just you know I saw the post on Twitter where it showed everybody sitting at a table uh would you like to share the vision of us with the the polygon ZK vision and uh where we are in the journey and where we're striving to go especially for the fact that you know when I talk to people about polygon sometimes they're like yeah polygons that thing with all the chains so uh let us know what's going on yeah thanks a lot Hudson it's a great one and a very important one of course uh so when we announced our strong commitment and strategic bet if you will on ZK or roughly a year and a half ago uh we we were very much aware of of uh the fact that this is a very number one this is very early stage of this industry and number two we're trying to build something which is highly complex which has never built before and we didn't want to be opinionated uh from the beginning hence why we we joined hints with all these great people and we have until this very day free formally independent teams falling on zero polygon Hermes and polygon mind and Minden working under this wider polygon umbrella if you will we have never regretted this Choice actually the opposite like the the plurality and differences in ideas in approaches in Technologies and Primitives that these teams have been using and and have expertise in he has significantly significant differently contributed to the the the this Milestone that we are shipping today and it made polygon ZK VM much more performant and enabled us to ship it years basically before people expect it so this approach uh he has one negative side probably is that some people are confused in The Wider Community right like why does polygon has these three approaches what's going on here but realistically and practically this is one very strong very coherent team with just different expertise and different different uh approaches but the team has been working very very strong uh together and it has been a pleasure really uh participating in the process that being said that the the vision of of um polygon when it comes to Decay is to establish this infinitely scalable secure computation layer built on top of ethereal so there will be a multitude of chains there will be even application specific chains like supernets that are part of our uh product suit if you will uh um so uh the thing is this all chains are should be observed one day and should be uh tightly coupled um seamlessly interconnected to form one single infinitely scalable secure computation layer on top of polygon and that is our region with ZK and we're I think progressing pretty well on that part now we already delivered basically polygon zkvm we are working on other interesting Technologies to expand ethereum Beyond just uh scalability and we actually have the first formal uh uh uh proposal or implementation to interconnect all these chains that's something that we call the lxly bridge that should actually enable exactly what I mentioned turning These Chains into one single execution layer uh uh on top of ethereum so yeah hopefully this is helpful absolutely great answer um so David uh this one is about open source so open source has always been a priority at polygon I've seen that the last few years since I've been an advisor and now an employee uh so um when you all share the ZK evm repos last July at HCC how is that an important step and where are we today with open source and just add a little bit of spiciness what's been the hardest part of that because I swear every time I get into a discussion about open source licenses there's like 30 to choose from so basically where have we been where are we now and uh why did we choose this kind what is it hard yeah yeah thanks well yes it's a very hot topic to be honest because that's you know this kind of tension between uh making this as a contribution and becoming uh you know some some project that's uh creating value for the whole community in fact ourselves as a project we have been benefiting a lot from other teams uh Innovation and continue Solutions so we feel it's fair for us also to to provide this to the community in fact the discussion about licensing is the second topic which is uh do we do this permissive license or with your GPL because in the end we want to make sure that all this effort we did is useful for everyone we can just provide this source code as you know something where a community can just innovate iterate develop and we will be very happy if the Innovations of other teams will be also available for for the future and for other contributions on other projects so for us it's a decision on license was to just provide GPL as uh the the proper GPL uh let's say the main components of the ckvm you will find them in the repositories today with Affair GPL version three but there are other tooling like the all the judge explained these tools to create this aromatization uh the pill all these languages are an in a premises license MIT Apache too so anyone can just you know use these tools to build anything with a different no commitment or license and to the application they prefer more convenient even if it's for private uses so we want to uh you know do this contribution this is a we feel very very proud and very happy to to find finalize the project but the second one is to you know do this uh openness of the contribution we did so far and we'll continue working like that because as Jordan was saying this is only the beginning of the project so we'll continue in in the open and in this uh open source license contribution yeah wow yeah I do this every time I do a presentation okay anyways uh thank you for that and uh hello vitalik the next question is to you um so like you mentioned earlier about stage one of kind of a roll-up strategy in your brain and uh to progressively kind of give up centralization control other mechanisms that might you know stop the progression of a roll-up from being as powerful as it could be in the hands of the users so is there anything that like a lot of the ecosystem is minimizing or overlooking when it comes to this process the transparency involved any hot takes that like everyone's gonna disagree with you on on how to do it [Music] um I mean I feel like everyone agrees in theory the bigger bottleneck is like in practice right like it feels to me like uh everyone is on board with the idea that like well you know of course Roll-Ups should uh ultimately I'm you know have proof systems that have teeth and be secured by them and move away from uh relying on multi-cigs and all of this stuff but like in practice there are just are a lot of uh projects that claim to be very close to that but are actually much further away from that and some like there's different like degrees of I guess egregiousness of uh this sort of thing and there's that and there's different degrees of like well-intentioned this versus um you know like actually never having the intention of decentralizing at all um and I think the yeah the bigger thing is to kind of uh just uh like standardize and sort of like lay down The rules a bit so that's some private projects that don't don't really have as much of an opportunity to kind of Wiggle out and try to claim that they're like you know basically decentralized when they're actually not and uh also make sure that um you know the projects that have done a good job of that are are properly getting credit on that gotcha that makes a lot of sense uh so what you mean is like basically practice what you preach and if you're not doing that there should be pressure applied basically yeah yeah I think that's a good way to summarize like I yeah like I haven't really seen big divergences in uh what people preach I'm uh I'm only seeing diverges this and why people practice gotcha interesting uh thank you for that uh all right so Brendan and bobbin uh y'all are both gonna take this uh we'll go with Brendan first and then bobbin uh can also add their thoughts or other takes um so as we celebrate the launch of the ZK evm on on polygon uh the polygon ZK team is uh asserting leadership in the space and with their open source ideals and uh you know safe execution how are your respective projects within polygon positioning for this and how are they embracing open source uh like and the ideal vision of decentralization overall in the ecosystem where where are we going uh yeah sure I I can start um so so I work on the Zero team uh our we sort of have a dual mandate which is to um work on proof system r d so we built plucky2 and Starkey um and Incorporated a lot of those uh optimizations and advancements in the ckvm um and then we're also working on CK AVM stuff that we can maybe talk about in more detail in a couple weeks but um I think for us uh open source and decentralization is really important I I think that like one of the most rewarding things that we can uh contribute to the ethereum community to the crypto Community is uh or you know the concept of public goods that are um freely and you know like permissionlessly usable uh by everyone and so for us like it was really important to release our proving system optimizations under a really permissive MIT Apache License um and so I think that those decisions like vary depending on whether we're talking about um you know like a a full productionized system like a zkbm versus sort of like an underlying uh proving system library but um I mean for us like decentralization open source I think or like both core values and um super important so oh yeah Bob it yeah I mean I would basically Echo the same thing I'm like a very a big delivery in open source in fact like a political mining project right now is uh you know Andre MIT license like where it was under my devices from day one and as Brandon said there's like different considerations for something that is more kind of productionized versus something that is being a bit more experimental uh and uh but but I do think there is a great benefit like if you open it up to the community you get a lot of feedback you get people like looking through the code base and all that stuff so it's uh good like it's good on both ends in my opinion you uh let people use it but you also get benefit of people using it and finding bugs and fixing and you know contributing back to you so like uh I think like you know for me personally like working on their Mighty lessons like that's what I've been doing for the last I guess three years and I don't think I published anything under any other license um and in terms of like mining specifically so as I mentioned it's another GK project I think uh the way we're thinking about it is that uh one one of the nice things about uh l2s is that this is where you can innovate and we're trying to explore other design approaches to the space I think the King game is a super important and like The crucial piece to have but we also want to explore other you know State models that maybe better support privacy better support local crew generation and things like that so that is what uh where exploring was minded at this point awesome awesome uh great answer um I would also say like with this push for open source and I might get to this a little later with people if we have extra time the thought of collaboration comes to mind which is kind of the name antithetical thought to how l2s are working nowadays but before we get into that I want to make sure that um I get Anthony here because he there's a question on polygon ID a lot of people don't know about polygon ID I feel like just because it's been being worked on and a lot of the other you know there's like a ton of different ideas on ID so um what do you think about how polygon ID upholds the web through ethos and the self-sovereignty ethos that a lot of the web 3 and ethereum projects share and um can you add more details on how this being is how this is being achieved uh in light of you know the work that you've done with polygon ID and I guess like a two sentence intro to polygon I do would be nice too okay thanks Hudson yes I mean Jordi David and myself we have started our project with what was with with item three and then at the moment we saw that in order to vote we needed to escape and is when when Jordan started to start on on hardness and how to scale on top of the material you know then yes for us and we have seen in in countries where where there is uh well some problems with democracy how how important is to have a self-solutely identity and the ownership of your data no and the fact that that nobody can censor you and and you can be always on passive site and managing your keys then in our case what now today is the day of ckvm but we have a lot of hopes on polygon ID that's that's always next big project and we are we are very focused and we have a lot of hopes on on that and the idea is that it should be the the entry door to where three through your event if you know that through that you can manage all your keys and and you are able to access any kind of tap or any kind of any any service that that you require but always ensuring this this privacy level that the zero knowledge groups are able to to provide awesome thank you I I was going to add or another question on that so is there plans or current designs for like a mobile interface or something that just really kills it on the user experience because that's like the number one thing I hear about when it comes to a lot of these like ID Solutions all in one wallets like things like that so there's already a fragmented ecosystem what is polygon ID going to do to make it very accessible to users and non-fragmented yeah here I mean you are totally right and and the polygon edit team is working very hard on the Shadows let's say in a rogue mode then uh now in July we will see a lot of a lot of new features and then also brand of the year we should almost have the full stack or or the major part of the of the of the new of the new improvements and yes this mobile aspect is something that we are working on and yes there is that in in the next month it should be announced awesome that's great to hear I'm definitely looking forward to it um so I've run out of my prepared questions so what I'm going to do is this we're all going to take some time uh to do some closing thoughts you can spend a couple minutes it could be whatever you want I'm not here to restrict you this is a free space uh so we'll go ahead and start with uh you know let's start with David well uh I have uh open thoughts but um I would like to see that this solution of ckbm becomes you know the this the first solution for developers because they understand what's behind this uh trust model that the metallic was referring to now is in the end we were you know in targeting projects to extend the decentralization the security of ethereum uh it was not about centralizing again in Layer Two it needs to be clear path to our decentralization needs to be a clear strategy but we need to be transparent and verifiable is what we are trying to do with our model not not only open sourcing but also being transparent in in this all these aspects so users developers understand and and know what's uh what's the plan in our site uh what's the kind of network they are just betting on uh it's not only about equivalents or features or these kind of things about uh for me respecting the ethos of web3 in terms of uh decentralization and Trust model so next thing we will do is enable this Force transaction this Force batch because initially we have a single sequencer but shortly after that we will have this uh Force batches then we will Target decentralization of proof generation and they will Target this intervention of sequencing while we address this Improvement in security this bug bounties this maturity we want to we want to achieve but from the Inception we have these protocols and this ATS in mind so we are making technical decisions that enable us to a license to meet them awesome great great thoughts I'll go ahead and get my like 30 seconds of things I think that the tech stuff at polygon is amazing uh one thing that I personally want to kind of get out uh as a message this year and why one of the reasons why I joined polygon Labs is that you know a lot of the stuff we're building in l2's scalability privacy Stuff Etc is not a cr-sum game as the founders of polygon said from the first week it launched there is no Silver Bullet to scaling and I think the future holds that there will be a lot of different solutions so a lot of the you know things we've seen both from polygon and other teams that kind of go back and forth with friendly debates and then getting more heated debates I think a lot of that is going to change this year so that polygon besides getting known for the most deepest most interesting and most well-built tech also has kind of a oh they're the nice ones they come in and help when you know another chain is having problems or you know going and being on stage with other chains and being more collaborative and other ways on panels maybe sharing research designs uh either way how it ends up doesn't really matter just that there isn't a new Vibe this year 2023 is like a new polygon Vibe and I really believe in that um next up we're going to have Antony well in my case I don't want also to repeat what what David was saying know that I remember that we enjoyed it came to us and one of why I left my previous work and I decided to join kidneys because the idea also to to help him band no in that case and how we could create a better world through decentralization in Center Central resist resistant all this kind of of quality so then I feel that this is another step in that direction okay we are not yet there obviously I'm not gonna be so nice and there is a long journey and still that but today we we are closing a cycle of three years almost when when everything has started well when Jordan came up with the first brilliant idea and and I'm really proud of of of what we have done knowing that it's we are not yet at the end of of the of the road no then for me today is exactly is a day to enjoy and and yes it's it's one day where I think we are one step closer to this to this idea that we have of a better world of a better Society I think we what I think we are in the right direction excellent words uh bobbin yeah I would say um I actually like your idea have some about like uh uh this uh uh kind of we're in this what three space like we're all on This Together We need to collaborate with each other this is like an I think we we want to lead uh by example in this as much as possible and where we are uh you know collaborating like our Tech can be used in other places and things like that I think uh all of the web three space benefits from it and in my mind like this is a very important thing to achieve and stride forward so like this is like we want to build this uh and scale and provide privacy and all that stuff but we also want to preserve the web for ethos of like collaboration and uh kind of fluidity and all that stuff so like this is for me this is like a very important thing and I hope we can achieve it awesome uh vitalik what about you um I mean I'm just like happy to see ZK VMS becoming real you know like I'm happy to see yeah like ethereum the way or two scaling becoming like fully real and not just something that's kind of theoretical and there's these back doors that you're not supposed to talk about um so you know it's a it's a bit it's a big Improvement and uh I think uh over the next six to 12 months um you know we're probably going to see Asia even more big improvements on the horizon as uh both other leader tours uh start uh step up and get to a stage one and uh you know polygon Zone implementation continues to improve over time and at the same time we get uh eip4844 greatly increasing the amount of data space on chain and uh Roll-Ups hopefully yeah moving quickly to take advantage of that um so I'm you know excited to see all of those all of those things happen and excited to like really get to the points where we can start to call a scaling assault problem for ethereum wonderful uh Brendan uh yeah I I don't see much that I I would just say that the thing that I'm really struck by right now is just how far we've come and like vitalik was saying like this was all theoretical like three years ago no one thought that this would be possible and uh you know two years ago it was the narrative was like oh like we'll never have General computations EK Roll-Ups and then it was oh like maybe we could get the evm compatibility but like never evm equivalence um and it's funny because when we joined polygon and and we we talked with Jordy about building an evm equivalent to KVM we were sort of like well like you know good luck with that like I mean we're we're we're we're we're not so sure um and so I I would just say like full credit to to Jordy and the team this is like an amazing astonishing accomplishment um and yeah I think it just like opens up this huge space of possibility for what we can do in crypto and I think the next year is going to be like incredibly exciting completely agree and last but not least the hollow I think we got like exactly a minute and a half left go go for it thank you Hudson so much I will abuse the opportunity to say two things instead of one uh number one AI completely want to Echo what you just said in that idea for polygon 2023 which is more open more helpful towards even other projects including competitors because as we all said we're in this all in this together um we have been heads down building and really passionate about what we do and we tend sometimes to you know be a little bit self-focused or a little bit closer than we should be right but that's only because your heads down building and sometimes maybe we get even a little bit defensive maybe even on Twitter or whatever because when you're passionate and you're really trying to do something the right way and then there are some doubts about that then you tend to get sometimes a little bit defensive but we should completely hopefully change that in this year and really full fully promote this ethos of collaboration and openness and being supportive to to other projects uh um as much as possible as well that's one thing and the second thing I would just like to zoom uh out just for a second then maybe revisit why are we doing all of this this is just a bunch of nerds you know just trying to ship some cool Tech and why are we doing all this and just to to Anthony's point that he mentioned um for and for me personally this incredible idea of establishing This Global Network of value is is absolutely mind-blowing so with with the internet we have been able in these past decades to establish this Global Network of information and democratize access to information right and knowledge so uh 20 years ago it was impossible to imagine that today uh anyone with the mobile phone and internet access can attend an MIT course learn to code you know improve themselves and all of that but many of these people don't have the opportunity to to monetize now that knowledge and or those skills or their talents and that's why we need this Global Network of value basically we need this global permissionless economy that we're trying to build and this human coordination and it I'm sure it can I strongly believe as all the people here that it can transform really trust our society in very profound uh uh and positive ways so I'm very very happy that today we have just one step closer to that that grand idea so yeah that's excellent words so thank you so much we are right on time uh so I'm gonna see if Grace wanted to come back in for anything closing or if we just say so long oh you're muted Grace doing the same thing yes so excited I forget to mute so uh thank you so much this panel was exactly what I expected I am so happy that we have emphasized the importance of the ethos that we live by in web3 and more importantly how we do how do we embrace them in polygon so thank you so much for sharing that now we are at the final stage of our event so I invite you to leave but now we have to maintain here we have to keep um David and Tony and um this uh I'm happy that you are here this I just wanted to share that that the whole team the ckvm team shares the passion and the excitement and that we are incredibly grateful for the support that we receive from the polygon family so as we close this event I just wanted to say that Tony and Anthony I mean that Anthony and David have been the pillars and the enablers of what we're celebrating today so I'm sure you're gonna have some really great messages thank you okay thanks Grace okay then to close the the confidence now after two hours I will we will try to keep it short but when this morning uh or two hours ago survey Jody was Raising that there were three secrets to create a the platform I think he was missing the more important one that that also Grace just mentioned okay and that's the team I mean this has been a high performer theme where I have seen Engineers with 20 years of experience working in a very humble way supporting whatever it was required where there was a support and backup team creating a battle and avoiding any kind of noise for for the team and yes from from the the more senior guy to the more Junior guy everybody was supporting uh was was really trying to collaborate and I think this is something that we should never underestimate because one work or one task like this one it cannot be done by a single person okay then at the same time when these days we were in the final stage and there was two o'clock in the morning where still there was a lot of pressure we shouldn't under underestimate that because we're delivering but people was nervous were fixing things what I always saw is that people was laughing and I think this is very important also this kind of passion this enjoying the work although obviously when you play at the highest level uh pressure is there and and but at the same time how they were totally engaged with the project this is something that I will keep always on my heart and I will never forget and and yes and then thanks thanks to the team I think that's that's something very important also to the organization the co-founders the other teams the corporate and the ability teams thanks thanks for everything this could have been impossible without all polymer without one polygon and and then the second part that also I want I went a little bit to to raise due to my experience is that a what I think that zkbm will allow us is to become mainstream okay there are a lot of use cases and we haven't spoke we've spoken a lot about that no in gaming in defy in payments in supply chain chain in ticketing in nfts that were where this kind of scalability was required this is what I think that that the cabin can bring to the next level because it will be seamless for developers and for for any kind of company or Enterprise wants to join us but always with a with the security and the soundness of ethereum and I think this could be very important and I encourage all all the possible Partners or developers to to join us when when possible and and yes I hand over to my my colleague David thanks Anthony well uh how would they go most of what you said um I I will start with uh giving thanks giving thanks to to his Global for setting up this event giving thanks to to italic he's very busy all these panelists all these participants this was an amazing event so we really appreciate that also I would like to to start giving thanks to to the team as Anthony was saying the the team not only this this Harvest team the second team but also the whole polygon team because this is a joint success for everyone I don't want to to basically one but we have the CK teams me zero might then marketing comms engineering security team applications operations for Partnerships legal the whole team it was amazing the thank you for your patience just supporting this launch because it was very aggressive and intense but uh it was it was a pleasure to work with you all and it's a whole success for the whole team also I would like to to give thanks to the Auditors team because as we have discussing the holiday uh Securities uh main topic and the main concern for us they were super helpful and they were super patient also because this is a very Noble technology very complex uh things to throughout it documentation needs some improvement still at this stage so it was challenging for everyone but we feel very comfortable about security this stage to to get to minute and uh well from my side I will also would say that I think I mentioned later before this is only the beginning um we have a a lot of things to do we put a high effort to implement this as we discussed uh in the the process and the form that we consider the right way uh with respected the times of development we open the source code we uh did some some test Nets where we learned a lot of experiences we we did battle testing we managed to to ship thousands of Silence proofs then we did the security reviews Jordan was saying for the last five months we basically are refactoring things to improve but basically security fixes and and this kind of reviews which was uh the big concern for us because the approval was already implemented since the since October last year but still we managed to to make the most of this time also we have a super long backlog of uh of issues and things to to improve because uh you know the technology is Supernova we are in the states where we feel it's material enough and practical to to launch minute but uh we have uh several lines of work I would say the main concern when we started the project was even for us thinking on how we could build approver that's practical uh he was the contribution of zero Maiden basically technology of zero enhances the the performance by 40 times which was basically difference between being practical or not but I remember compensation with George at the beginning of the project we were thinking on data centers how we could prove all these polynomials and it was super challenging for us so we started this process of improvement until we got to a point that we are able to to run proofs in a single server provider cost like two dollars per hour and we are able to to do a proof of 10 million gas under three minutes of time so for us we get to a stage where proofs are not a concern anymore and we are not also creating a big deal of a cost for users so this is I would say the big achievement we got at this stage but um the network is uh turquoise improvements because this is the the beta magnet but still we need to improve a lot in terms of uh I would say I did to discuss activity but we have to improve also in the course for users because now the biggest cost in the in the same gas fees for users will be basically data availability layer one and this is something uh we made decisions that improve uh the future decentralization but still we can apply some optimizations in this past and this is pending and also what we need to do beyond that is to accelerate sequencing and to improve the transactions from second rate because in the end this was a stability project and this is what all was about so this is the what we have to do from now today we will stay it will take some time to celebrate of course this is a big achievement but tomorrow we continue on this path of improvement and let's say completeness of the project also we would like to become very soon a type 2 C kbm uh and there are some things we already know how to do and we need to apply but this is a path that will take uh you know during the next months or potentially the whole year so well after this event we got metallic doing the first symbolic transaction I would really appreciate that it was amazing the quote he was put in the transaction but shortly after this event is over we will publish the access of the mainnet beta in this polygon website in Social in blog so anyone can get access to the network it's a public is permissionless and people Anthony already said we will invite developers and users to to test what's the the flavor and the the feeling of this ebm equivalent in a secure lab which was the the original objective and the big deal of all of it and of course we are super happy to achieve this and we are open to feedback because some things might happen but we want to learn from this experience from users and we hope everyone enjoys the network and we can scale together a lot and we can get a you know feedback and receive contributions also because we are super open to any one contribution but uh this uh celebration for us and an important Milestone and we hope everyone enjoys it and yeah thank you so much for 47 thanks everyone for the support and see you soon I hope thanks for everything foreign
