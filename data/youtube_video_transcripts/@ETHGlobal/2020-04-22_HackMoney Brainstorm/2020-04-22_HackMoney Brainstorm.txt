and one more minutes okay Julian will be joining good good all right Julian Julian hello yeah so sorry I had because I don't use zoom so had some some difficulties to you to join sorry about that awesome alright so I just need one more second to figure out the livestream [Music] thank you everybody for tuning in again I know we have people from all over the world morning afternoon night whatever it is all right Andrew if you just want to check it looks like we're live on YouTube so if you could just double check that and then I will double check them Twitter periscope thanks for bearing with me everybody and it's been five minutes so we'll get started shortly Wow fifty nine people have showed up that's a really great turnout I think we had 120 people registered that's awesome it's awesome yeah all right unless there are any final hiccups I think we'll get started awesome I didn't hear any protest so we're gonna get going so everybody thank you so much for joining this hack money brainstorm if you didn't know this is an event specifically linked to hacked money which is equals very first online deep I octopod now if you don't know who equal was we're an organization that does events around the world and in the past they've always been in person physical events me-oow get a bunch of sponsors get hackers to come for a weekend and build awesome things but again like I said this is our first virtual event we're super excited so what we're gonna do today is just we have three awesome guests got Scott Lewis from Dex egg to five poles we have Julian Putin tell me how to pronounce it Julian you fall out we have Julian from state capital and Tina Chen from a bunch of projects you can say which one you'd whichever one you'd like to be associated with you guys muted can't tell they're within one moment Tina want to make sure our speakers been actually done I think we're here maybe I Tina Grady's there we go Tina cool yep okay cool sorry about that let's say yeah like I said hack money starts this Friday and this event is is part of part of that keeping people in the hacking mode defy money mode and we're super excited to have all these people who've joined us on so if I left anything out I just want to give a quick minute for the speakers to introduce themselves and talk about what they're working on Scott if you want to start us off yeah I'm Scott we're working on d5 poles and Dex AG x AG which is a dex a grater and F gas station awesome do you know my one of my previous had its global hackathon winning project it was called hash edge from e Singapore and yeah and I'm working on it through a flash organization like a pro bond hackathon with project milestone driven goals yeah Julian yeah so I'm Julian I'm walking with behind a state capital and stake down so we do staking as a series Nikki to provide a market maker and an arbitrage awesome so I figured before we dive in now that we have everybody's background and which products are working on I'm just a couple like in questions to get people thinking about it what would you say is your favorite under the radar defy project we know all of you guys are really in tune with the ecosystem what would you say if you had to pick one what's like a newer project that not many not many people would know about I really like Realty which is tokenizing real estate the market they're in they can't really be fully decentralized tokenizing us real estate but kind of bridging the chasm between real world assets and my criteria montane assets is I think pretty important to the future they're doing it yeah I really like um max dekstop I know it's a Newport swap on it just roll out its new purse swap on East iPad yeah it's actually utilizes a mmm and in combination of an order book to set the price its purity on chain I speak so I thought it was a very clever design is that the one that spelled MC Dex oh yeah yeah okay but it's pronounced big dance like McDonald's yeah kind of yeah okay well I like I like balancer if we still under defy more like to define economic space I like balance because it's um it's it's a mix between uni swamp and and set set protocol so it's it's a you got auto market maker attached to you and to the system and you also have auto balancing across different assets so I think it's very interesting all the project like a curve curve finance as well but it's probably not very under at the moment yeah and also it all the different project are trying to integrate BTC so for example like gbtc I think this will be a massive massive opportunity for the for the ECM space to bring the quiddity from from Bitcoin become market so I like all the different projects that are building that recognizing Bitcoin into Ethernet workbook yeah and it seems like there's a new one almost every day some tokenized version so it'll be very interesting to see the trade-offs that each of them makes or the different design decisions yes there's certainly like certainly a really wide design space exactly not attacking the Edison's awesome ok and then one more maybe one more icebreaker what is if you're comfortable sharing I'll go first what is the largest amount or a silliest way you've messed up sending money on etherium I remember I've said I've tried to send eath between main net and test nuts before and I'm pretty sure I that that Ethan's gone forever I sent it to improper contract maybe I'm sure everybody's lost money in some way but I'm just curious sharing I think you just reminded me of one I did that too yeah sending between test nets yeah like really silly but but I it might be unique enough that I might Docs one of my address is um basically just having to do something at a later time and then forgetting to do that thing yeah losing all the monies but it wasn't that much money which was lucky but it made up for the low amount of money was but the sheer stupidity it took to lose money that way but yeah well for me for me was very simple I use a paper wallet but then I lost the paper so mistake those are allowed all right thanks thanks for playing along guys all right let's let's dive into it so this hackathon is thirty days which means people are gonna have an opportunity to build a lot longer whereas like I mentioned previous events were two days two nights and you're just kind of like going going going this is 30 days where you're gonna have time to iterate and have time to maybe hit some dead ends restart it's a lot more time to explore and and build something that's gonna last beyond just the event itself so we have I'll just list off the sponsor we have so far and maybe that'll help too because they will be offering some sponsor prizes and that'll help to frame the discussion we're gonna have so we have Ave compound we just added Eunice WAP uma ENS chain link and P tokens so those are the projects we have a sponsors and they're gonna be offering prizes so we can we can talk about things that will integrate them we also have this spreadsheet that we've been adding to called uterine level ideas for hack money I'll drop it in the chat if and if anybody doesn't know this is actually Liam born from eath global he actually made this the other day and it's referencing something from a few years ago I believe called mosque level ideas must level engineering ideas so we're trying to make our own version of that uterine level ideas for hack money and it's got a bunch of different things on there but yeah now that now that we have like yeah - who the sponsors are and a link to that spreadsheet I'll just open it up to Scott or Julie and or Tina if you want to just talk about things you've been thinking about oh yeah I could like go through I put a few ideas down there I could go through a meal peg no you weren't yeah okay so the first idea that I put down there that I thought would be cool is um there's sort of a growing I think when Athena first started everyone just made open source code and it had permissive licenses on it and they deployed on blockchain on the chain and that was pretty good for other builders because you could look at the code if there are parts of that code that you want to use you could put them in your DAP but now we're seeing more projects having proprietary code on chain and I think if you are a minor with broad interest in the space and then later a staking pool with broad interests in space when people do open source their code it's better for the whole ecosystem so I have a long term interest in the ecosystem succeeding I might want incentives so that people do that um and so if you had an NF t they let people put their open-source license on chain you could apply a differential gas price to contracts with open source licenses or proprietary contracts so if you want to keep your code proprietary you can but some block creators might have a little higher standard to get your transactions in the block and I think it might it might be cool because you could sell the NF T's to projects they want to add them and then if you could get block creators to buy into the idea there might be an incentive and a little bit of a sustainable business around that I think that people I think a lot people in space might be interesting that another idea is is a debugger for package transactions sometimes it's a little hard to tell what part of a transaction failed and if there's a way to solve that problem I think a lot of people would want to see that and they might pay pay for it I'm looking and then yeah I like can you Julian if they have any ideas they want good yeah good oh I said yeah you want to go first I have too many okay so I gotta go I think for me like I'm being a system we can swap or you can list all the different physical assets so for example a BLT and you could basically have different project based on physical asset that you can see all the different yield that would be pretty cool so for example like tokenized carbon offset or real estate or anything like that at the platform where you can list all different physical asset then comparing all the comparing comparing all the different then it would be pretty cool well let me just click on open the doc should I go you know yeah so so I've been thinking about a lot about various type of douse I think right now there's enough money in defy a stake and there's enough permit Asst already available but what is more or less missing it's kind of like the playbook of how to organize participation both in terms of capital and so one of the idea is so basically using essentially create a a Dao for transaction reorganizing retinas ation alliance so that because we know more money s take and so and it's kind of inevitable so can we front run the run the miners and actually protecting ourselves in an alliance way in a through economic incentives design but that's one which is defy related because only defy has enough money at stake to justify such and the other idea that I had was kind of so now that we saw projects like compound rolling out cup token and there are very nice properties associated with it what if we can so like one of my view is that we saw a lot of the primitives start to have some kind of a nationalistic or regional boundaries but why don't we leave the politics like to the douse who participate in such governance to express your affiliation like your your views rather than to have it on the protocol level let a protocol to be neutral and let the Dow's to play out the politics like like different kind of viewpoint in either governance like for some for example certain views I meant either like from certain decisions to be more decentralized or less centralized like things like that but to organize Express Me's through various styles and to how to dowse participate in governance that's another thing that I've been kind of thinking about and and lastly I guess it has a little bit less to do with with defy but more to do with using certain like dignified incentive designs to better organize product development such as an elongated kind of always ongoing hackathon style product batiment I'm trying to design and apply this to my own project that was essentially an extension from my East global project so like what I called essentially and continuous organization that is basically set like set by project milestone but then essentially we automate like a put of a bond sorry I put about equity type of design for each project milestone so like the one you know we have these group of hackers joining force together to get to this goal and v2 we reorg into and people have more option allottee to reshuffle the formation but and and and so on so there's a multi round game however in each round is basically you can write like uh like instead of a call option type where which is the typical like you know corporation stock option type of you choose to essentially exercise later but then like is instead you you up front in opting into this like 36 hour or a hackathon mode or like one-month hackathon face by opting in saying that yes I accept to take this person this token that is assigned to me if I and this project complete me the milestone but I can also opt to exit it through exit to catch like a cop-out option so within the limited period of time so that leaves flexibility for new more interested people to join at every single product face and this is self like it turned itself a selective process so those are the things that I've been mostly thinking about yeah awesome those are those are some pretty pretty big ideas so for the dow idea are you specifically pulling that from compounds governance or is this a generalizable it can be applied to any d5 protocol I think there like so so first of all I have to attribute part of this idea Robert ROM compound because he was one of the I think both of compound design and he mentioned it down the road would be kind of cool and that kind of went along with my line of thinking in terms of douse participation in what dows means for defy I do believe that douse will actually be we see we will see very meaningful innovation and on Joe's like last year we see a lot of concept but there's nothing to be governed or not enough to be governed and there's not enough of infrastructure available and so that this year we're going to see more playbook so I do think that what that idea at mention specifically has a requirement when it comes to the the token design and compound who can support that but I do think that it's definitely generalizable yeah awesome Julian did you have anything oh you still need it I think once you meet you can't okay okay okay yeah if people could actually build like a simple UI using flash lon to swap interest yield across different platforms so we could add for example are they or compound or could also be using t BTC but basically will be a system that can track the best yield something like I earn but more like in a simple mechanism or you just add flash phone in a book and you just click and then swap your different interests yield so for example like defy saver the website allow you to close your your loan from maker or maybe like you could basically build something a little bit more advanced or you can swap interest rate across all these different projects and this will be not very difficult using using a flash loan and you can charge I've seen other interest rate swaps recently like like officially built like people have been using them or just like as an idea cuz I've seen them and I use them but I mean I use my own implementation but I haven't seen any UI for people that have no technical expertise and they can do it themselves ok so you're just thinking of like a very simple easy to easy to access UI yeah it was for example for example like the moment you can collateralized east or maker to print die and then you can use this toast I to to earn interest on on javi for example but then if you want to close you if you lose the style if you invest the style another mechanism you need to be reimbursed with alone and it's not there's no existing where you can also cross for example if you like compound and then order defy yield system you cannot really move them move those different asset across those different platforms all right now but maybe maybe I'm wrong but haven't you haven't seen them yet scribe Tina any any thoughts on that or have you seen anything like the simple menu because then you could you could actually and then people could actually provide if it's defined if it's a if it's a flash loan then obviously we'll be using like resentful Ave or other flash long-billed but then you could also have a tool what people provide liquidity for people that want to swap their the interest and then you could charge a fee on that liquidity so it would be like a kind of like a pool of liquidity for people to earn a yield for people that want to swap or close their loan we build yeah yeah this one is probably for compound but I'm thinking you like make it more generic where you can just have it built for all the different yield platforms Robin are you able to talk now do you want to talk a little bit about that oh yeah we've build a website called difference and we used Harvey fresh long - you don't need to repay your loan first you can just swap your collateral from maybe tie to either and you don't need to prepare upfront capital yeah oh cool cool only but I mean it's just for for compound right yeah well I've never seen quite a few interest rate swap projects that because I think ever since East Berlin last year interest is swap like has been like a hot topic and everyone and Raijin pot is kind of no one has really explored it so I think that's that would be an interesting i yeah to actually put but definitely recent IRS projects like there's some swap net that's coming up not sure how they're they're like papers out and you guys can check it out it actually right now implemented light version because it has in a mmm prices and similarly I think that 88 miles per hour is and I haven't really played around with it much but it's had some interesting structure when it comes to the interest the fixed rate interest what can I just gonna give me a wave anybody who's on the call who is to hack money and they're planning on building something just just wave at me I'm just curious all right so that's like maybe maybe half maybe more than half just really awesome to see so as the title of this event would suggest this is a hack money brainstorm so I'm gonna open it up to anybody who would like to ask for feedback on their idea again ask for feedback we I don't want you to just kind of go for ten minutes talking about your concept and then maybe Scott Julian or Tina can give a little bit of feedback or talk about what they think about that idea so I'm going to if you want to speak or talk about your idea just raise your hand and then I can unmute you start with Adrienne go ahead hey hello everyone so just very quickly my idea was called non fungible wallet and the base idea is to join the NFC world and smart contract wallets word by allowing you to generate a wallet that will act as an an F T that way you can transfer it so you can use it to put many things into it like ERC 20s there are say 721 create a bundle of asset and then use it use the energy property to move this bundle and maybe use it for hula terror through mechanism like croquette yeah Hadrian um I think I think that's pretty cool i I think I I guess then you'd be able to tokenize the wallet on top of that yes so what it would be a token yeah I might say two things first I think that's really cool for kind of getting up put like a poor transferable portfolio stuff um like that might be a fun thing to put my crypto Punk's in the other things I might suggest is if it could use both NF cheese and like regular ERC 20s kind of like just have both of them in there that might be pretty cool because I think like tokenizing like in arbitrary basket of ERC 20s might also be a nice a nice thing to have that maybe isn't quite as usable what is that yeah so what it would be an address so it could own basically anything your wallet would even take part of a protocol yeah no I think it's an interesting idea awesome piracy actually you could actually integrate this with newsies wallet anybody else have any ideas they want to present Nick take it away yes hi guys I'm thinking about right now you have like project like crypto voxels and decentralized which cell decentralized real estate but if you want to invest in those you need to buy an entire property and I'm thinking about tokenizing the ownership of a property and when you do so you can set an expiration at when it was settled through auction so basically we tokenizer share in p in an NFC which will get auctions at a set date so that way you split it up in pieces and then after a while it gets liquidated so you can we'll get like X amount of eats depending on the result of the auction kind of like they're like with like rapper crypto kitties there's not really a good way to like break up yeah but crypto kitties you can put in any kitty and it will mean the same token but the erbil like tokenizer share in the future proceeds of the auction yeah then as an angle I would like to do it like like a maybe a balance of pool without that a bunch of them in there so you can expect later on the central and piece of kept the books also kitty in there and maybe like maybe if all the like so if it's like going to go to auction at a certain date but then the people that like own the security like own they're not securities own the pieces of the pie or whatever right oh the pieces of the the basket if they can hit snooze maybe if they don't want to spell right now I also it becomes like a bowel type team the majority of the owners decides to not liquidate for a while or something like that yeah like with the default case the default case is you end up in auction but then it's like hey we still think this is like a good speculative value to hold it then we all want to just like keep it going rather than have to like with the I am blanking on their name what was the tokenizing goal the og tokenizing gold oh they just liquidated chicks what problem where it's like it defaults it lasting forever and then you like have this huge coordination problem to make it not last forever you know sort of the opposite where it's like the coordination problems we all still want to be in it that would that's pretty nice oh cool all right oh now I got to find you testing can you hear me yeah hey so we're working on a simple way to spin up multi-sig or Dow but for normies so kind of in the same idea space is like fantastic 12 or signal Dow but less chatbot forward of an interface and kind of like Dow house but we wouldn't be using the word Dow it's more like the venmo or like chase banking type audience but oh look I have a casual group bank account yeah for PTAs and stuff yeah you say PTA a parent-teacher Association yeah there's like a large transparency problem and then there's also a large bookkeeping problem that like none of the parents really want to deal with and yeah I don't know I've always loved doubts for that then I totally I'm that's finally gets build like as long as people I'm scared of it I think it would I mean I don't know like how much money did you collect like who's in charge of the bank account like all these things right now just like yuck for like these like small like a Cancer Walk like a community like Cancer Walk like you know it's nasty it's like a big coordination cost this wasn't yeah I'm actually curious um I really like this idea I wonder what what is the current challenge that you're like the biggest roadblock here are solving right now in making this happen I suppose the proof is in the pudding that normies are using dows so I guess just like a different onboarding flow that sets them up with their own wallet and app rather than like trying to get them on meta masks better Fiat on-ramp support things like that more abstraction in short cool yeah I really like I really like Dharma's of flow for onboarding for yeah cool thanks alright looks like we've got harsh I'm gonna unmute you and you can tell us about your idea thanks won't hey everyone so my anger is more defensible - so I was thinking of building the push notification service of salt for the entirety so it will basically be divided into a bonus but can send messages to all the users or all the bullets which subscribe to their groups and basically you know once they send the messages then the 30 providers can pick it up and display to them or you know they can use the app or the website to come and you know check out their message that's sort of a basic idea which I'm working on right now would like to know all all of you guys what would you guys think about that I I love this idea of a bunch of talked about how I would build it I'd not ever had time to build it um it's something people need like I don't know if you heard the beginning but like not having ever built this idea I would actually since then needed it so not to have lost my own money um so like yeah I don't know if you do like kids serious about it like definitely be me um I think if something people need yeah was awesome you had come right in the middle of that I couldn't please open the end like the perfect so yeah fingers crossed all right anybody else interested in sharing car doesn't have to be like fully worked out you can just talk about some initial ideas all right zero yeah okay we would like to build the market for oil that simulates the features of the the financial futures of mainstream market and we want to use Uma priceless synthetic token and and I wanted to ask if it is possible for the because uma is like a dye for the dollar it's the same but it has an expiration so something is put in the world and no ether is put in the world and tokens are created for a face value that is like 100% in relation to one hundred twenty percent that is the collateral that has been put in the world and we I wanted to ask you that if there is any project that could help the sponsor of this token like for example I have only thirty ether and I want to issue dye for sixty four sixty times the price of hitter so the double of what I have if there is a product that will lend me the money like for example sixty eight or so that I have 19 to that one hundred fifty percent of the face value and to put this in collateral and if it falls under well 10% or 15% it will liquidate the loan give back like instead of 6061 ether to the lender 13% to the liquidator and the remaining but I did the operation they don't really understand that the project are you trying to build something on the insurance market with open no I am trying to simulate the futures and specifically the oil futures well it's not a great feature right now it is a great feature to feature not a bug I thought about doing this like on Ouma I think they're launching or something today yeah you may check that out when comes live yeah I think that would be a really funny thing because I just saw FTX roll out oil its oil future and the settlement price is going to be $100 above the spot price so to keep it positive so funny thing that very high hope if you want to build a I mean I'm also interested I was buying physical barrel of oil so it's probably something we can do yeah sorry would you put them yeah you take physical delivery yeah it's it's in a countryside of France Wow like it's not it's not barrel like it's it's not massive queue you know so much you know 3,000 liters and it doesn't come in like small milk jugs on your property or like it becomes a counterfeit track yeah the capacity of 10,000 liters right now and it's probably something that with uma we could actually tokenize it and yeah that's great I love it that would be amazing to tokenize Julian's delivered oil truck yeah I mean if you think about me is you know cereal if you if you're building this um I'm actually interested I think it's a great I think there is something to do yeah can I send you a direct message in this course and we'll speak about it yeah just took me a message me on Twitter or something but I think it's a cool it's a massive potential right now also awesome also in general if anybody wants like dear media about the idea whatever just find me in the f Global discordant ping me yeah Sam call me alright one of the things we've started doing is quick attention checks so what I'm gonna ask everybody's to do if you have your if you have your video on pick up something smallish on your desk and just hold it up to the camera it's that's not your phone and as per usual my cat is making an appearance we have a mask hat I don't know what Mick is holding a marker wait should I should start doing crypto kaiju look at that we should start keeping track of the strangest objects that people have head-scratcher these are great right cuz I'm stuck in San Francisco like this is I'm unfortunately stuck in a place where I can't move or travel to any place in the world because of the travel called it 19 travel beds yeah eternally well someone someone is sitting on the boat I can see like ceiling absolutely official Brendan you sure that it's not just their their background oh yeah that's just a background cool all right we've got about ten minutes left so let's try and get in a few more proposals looks like Daniel was a list okay cool good yeah so I saw in the lead in the like butor and level ideas to do a medium clone on ipfs I thought that was a cool idea but I want to give it a cool spin using Ave so I'm thinking when instead of like with medium where you have to pay money every month to subscribe I was thinking maybe we could take some dye and stake it maybe like 50 something amount of dye and the interest from each reader would then get paid to go to the creators of the content so just kind of like a lossless way of subscribing to good content so it's kind of my idea yeah this is a great idea it could be it's kind of kind of simple to build yeah I don't know a lot about smart I mean I know about smart contracts not really how to write I'm learning solidity but uh I think it shouldn't be too difficult to make the only kind of question is how to incentivize like good content but kind of like working thinking of thinking through that right now probably at the beginning would just invite like writers that are good writers to come on and and well hopefully they'll make good content but they're I'm sure there could be made more complex later with like better incentives like steamy I don't know to steam it they don't like people steam it and scent you can like pay money to your favorite author but I'm thinking it'd be kind of like a ubi for the authors like everyone would receive money based on like how many articles they've written so basically like a ubi to be paid out to everyone all the writers at the same time like every day or every week whatever based on how much dye has been staked mm-hmm but how do you I mean I think the bag content it's kind of like subjective how do you yeah like how would you rate I would definitely like spam obviously like just posting like every day or posting like a lot with no real content that would be just classified as spam and 5 just be like deleted I see yes but I think I think there's like there's a I've seen this guy building a project to four emails so you basically send your personal token comes up or you send your personal token to vitalik full and then vitalik he's requested to to read the email but he's actually receiving his own tokens but if it doesn't actually open the email and read it then you basically lose value of his own token so maybe there's a concept that you can apply in your medium idea or you maybe it can be a mix between personal tokens in and a TC of mechanism it took him care to the registry I'm not sure but I seem to be email spanning mechanism was really good yeah I'm so it's like it's like if I said I yeah it's like the writers stick died as well but then you should stick die against so what is the punishment but what do you do if you're sticking to die you lose the die the content is not good oh yeah now yeah that would definitely be like a good mechanism to have them like every article they could stake some die or something and then if it is classified as spam then it would they would lose their die or something but uh yeah cool let's let's string let's try and get in a few other ones Andrew thanks very go ahead hello can you hear me yes excellent yeah snow first of all Dona other thing as a gravity and the thing I want to discuss was also relating to no loss very much inspired by cool together was actually an idea from standing over a was talking about it under thread basically it's no loss betting so instead of the interest on people's died being randomly allocated it is allocated to people based on a position they take for a very quick example imagine if the US presidential election you can eat a steak die on Trump or Biden and all of the interests are going to a pool you can't withdraw your stake for the duration of whatever the event is and then in the end it uses an Oracle to find out who won the election and then all of the interest is shared among everyone that state the correct outcome so basically it's no loss betting which is essentially it's a form of it's a prediction market or it's a way of game affine savings depending on how you look at it depending on how its marked at I guess but that's the idea it's a it's great idea I love it see it's a it's a it's a pull together for prediction market yeah exactly it's basically a fun way of saving money which is essentially what pull together is it's just a slice I think I seen it chemically speaking I think there's a problem because then you will have basically you can bet on anything because you know that you're not gonna lose to any money so then the not sure people will because you can participate in all the different beads now you can participate everything but your payout is proportional to how much you stay it from an outcome so if you choose the wrong one you'll get less money you win less money but it is in bidding system you want to be because you know you can lose money in a system where you can not lose money can you actually beat you know it's my gosh well you are you are tying up of your die for the duration of the competition so you do you have an opportunity cost you just might want to get I think you may get variable so again lately like like horse betting it's like the odds are like whatever money people put in rather than a prediction market where it's like there's a bit of an offer like oh yeah you you I commute absolutely me see the odds would be implied based on how much people are staking on each other and so basically be chosen by the market and it would be yeah they wouldn't meet be any kind of bid and offer the UX would actually be quite simple it would simply be choose a candidate of the US election to use that as an example it's just an example and then it simply I want to take a hundred die Biden's gonna win currently the thing is saying there's a 40% chance been winning and that's it and then at the end of the competition you get your money back and maybe you get somebody interest as well I think the UX is easier than existing prediction markets as well yeah you could you could you could take put together contract and then add it to nosiest or augur prediction market I mean I'm really you can make it a lot full and just make it a pyramidal betting market where you just you know avoid the one risk of the interest rates right deeper interest rates could be really high and then it's awesome or they could be like very low and then it's harder to get the like excitement going um but I mean I think a parameter like betting framework might be something useful - thank you very much awesome you can talk to if anyone's I hope you do cheedo go ahead yeah thanks so basically my is more related to trading and defy again so it's not about no lose water it's or whatever and it is about market making basically most of the market making models right now related to put liquidity and this is the the way that we are doing it with smart contracts but if we have a liquidity which is provided on demand with some market making boat or whatever you can help work to steal our interest you can for example provide some dye on demand and where there is demand for swapping for example each age for dye or before dye you can provide it but in the during the other time when it's not in usage you can state it in compound and all these things could be optimized and you can stake form works all the time but when there is an order which you can match you can just provide the liquidity and say quite 0.5% let's say which is the spreads from the market price and it is much more profitable than just taking in some landing protocol whatever so you can combine them with this more different approach of liquidity provision you can at the same time provide equity on demand and when it's not used you can lend in a compound or something like that do you think that it could work or yeah so you want to build a pool that shakes the best yield for making market-maker yeah it is like starting his computer and when there is a good trait which you are matching then you provide the liquidity and if there is not you're just lending can compound to rather yeah so the because I actually being working on that I mean in arbitrage arbitrage down the only the problem the problem is the first problem is to one that if you reach so you know you need like a limited size of the floor because otherwise the profit are too low to be shared across all the people that are putting a liquidity so it can only be for except if you if you're good chasing all the profit all the spread on the market but otherwise it's really difficult to get a better yield the end compound or whatsoever because you need it when the liquidity is no then it's great but anyways to I there's no incentive for people to keep their liquidity inside the pool that's the first thing and then secondly when you have access to you flushed loan any flash wrong they don't charge a fee then it's really difficult to compete against them how is that related to the flush hole I mean it is just for swapping quiet you know swap or let's say our pothole particulars from foreclose chain swaps so it is for BTC die or whatever but I mean wash walls how are they related to that okay so you don't like just it's only for market maker you don't like I'll be treasurer whatsoever yeah it's only for market makers which can provide the creature just at the same time okay we are right at 11 unfortunately I wish we could keep talking about this in Scott Julie and Tina do you guys have a few more minutes so you have to run what does it look like on your end I'm good yeah I'm good sunny and my size I'm good all right well it's it's snowing where I am so stop bragging are you I'm in the East Coast it's not East Coast u.s. it's not not pleasant so yeah we can't be let's go for a few more minutes try and get in a few more ideas if anybody has to leave really before anybody goes I just want to remind you if you have applied to hack money you have two stakes taking is the next step it's something that's gonna be returned to you at the end of the hackathon but you should have received an email if you've been accepted so check your spam check your emails make sure that you're staking and you're logging in to set up your team read logistics packet we've got a bunch of information that we've sent out so we want to start getting people into the proper mode and check on discord if you haven't joined if your name is not read that means you're not fully you're not properly registered if you're red that's good that means you're in the hack money section so make sure to stake start checking out the sponsor prizes and check your spam email in case you haven't heard any of this before all right let's try and get in a few more Joran looks like you're next you're next okay cool the the stream kind of went janky there you mentioned something about my name not being read on the discord just just DM me later you know we can work on that but go ahead tell us about your idea cool um so yeah so to jump on the pool together kind of bandwagon my idea is kind of like a patreon kind of thing for content creators and it's kind of come out of the old problems with YouTube kicking crypto youtubers off and stuff like that and we want to kind of use this discovery platform in order to bring people into the crypto space but they're kicking us off so we need to find our own platforms and we need to find a way to monetize those platforms so the idea is if crypto youtubers or anybody really wants to create their own platform they can add on this this piece that allows people to donate die and instead of it going directly to them it locks it up in a pool together kind of way where the interest is what the content creator is going to be paid out and this will also feed into the discovery kind of thing where we can use the the metrics of how much dies acting actually locked up for a particular content producer to kind of wait how much this person's content is valuable and then we can have that kind of the discovery platform um so it's a to play on pull together where the outcome doesn't go to one of the pool participants the outcome goes to a content creator and this could also be like for charities or for any other kind of crowdfunding platform but the the major the first kind of Avenue was the the YouTube kind of dilemma content creator kind of dilemma there yeah I mean I could definitely see kind of the motivations to just like transfer your money to stake with someone and you're gonna get it back definitely a peel to like someone that maybe just giving your money to like someone you're a fan of like it seems like like some people might want to give their money away but other people might feel more comfortable just like giving the intrusive way so maybe it like broadens the appeal of like who wants to park financially participate with their favorite influencers and that that part's pretty that that part's pretty interesting also yeah it also it seems like it lends itself very well to being like a very hard a harder to manipulate like kind of like a self show but so like out total value locked is like you know like how much skin in the game are people really putting in it's also sort of like this skin in the game issue and maybe even like a little better than if you've made of metric about like how much money is someone collecting on the platform because they could just give themselves like they could just like create wash donations like essentially give themselves money and rise up the leaderboard but if they actually have to stake money that's like a harder ask yeah exactly that's pretty interesting yeah it seems like I no idea whether I mean it seems like legitimately knew enough it's hard to like guess what the real appeal is but you know you'll never know and till you you know ask people they want to do it yeah awesome Tom let me unmute you and then you're also one thing I realized I didn't explain is how to actually raise your hand and zoom I only noticed it after Tom kept going like this but there's a little there's a little button in the interface where it puts up a little blue hand next to your name but I'll make sure to explain that for next time go ahead tom yes so my idea was sort of thinking around okay so recently with Frank my first day we've had issues with my PEC and at the time where most people once it's they leverage their decision of liquidity but there's a lot of liquidity on Mike centralized sable coins so that sort of led to us TC being integrated as a collateral type which was what I can sort of think about is whether like we can kind of make that what essentially we can incentivize users who are okay with centralized able coins to basically pull their die that they're holding into and kind of give up options to allow people to buy that underlying dying in return for a small premium in a centralized dip recording so kind of trying emit this kind of how far above the peggy actually rise without actually having any centralized little coins backing die itself so the way it would work is if you hold dying you've been put into the DSR but we equally happily so just receive some centralized civil coin you can put into contracts it kind of sits in the DSR and then should you can kind of create options to allow people to buy out this diet poss be like 1.05 USD c21 dine so it kind of gives a better revenue stream for dye holders that ochio centralized civil coins but if you are kind of a decentralization maximus you can kind of ignore it completely you'd have to worry about it and you're safe with as you were before you can benefit from someone disability without having to worry about any kind of risks of centralized coins being frozen and then at that point i have so the the Butera novel idea from standing at that point when we're talking about kind of options for different staple points I think it might be interesting so you get into just thinking for known USC several coins having run wrapping up kind of options into the case where you can say say you have various a euro single claim you can buy died but like to put into compound or whatever but at same time the bias it kind of yours monthly gets an option to allow you to zoom like some fraction of your original euro value to try and so it allows people to integrate well to put his face in define which is normally you have thought denoted while still minimizing their risk in their own currency tom was this was this two separate ideas is this I it's pretty and links like this like most of the interface can be have something so it's it's just a choice that we can have there is a benefit to having these options between u.s. dollar like stable things and then there's benefits of watching out into different currencies as well okay seems like a pretty big idea yeah I feel that yeah but it kind of breaks down behind nicely because I feel like the the die options if we discount the other currencies thing that's still a self-contained project so brings value I think any thoughts from are the first half of the idea sounds a bit like something that could maybe be built on like something like balancer if you put all your set the centralized stable coins um into like a balancer pool and then you tokenize that and then that kind of like beast hypothecated decentralized stable coin is then used as a collateral per maker and you see oh it would kind of solve that first problem where like you don't actually have the stable coin directly in maker sorry dad like a mad like think about we have a unit swop v2 pool where I have like us DC and Mike Gemini dollars or whatever in USD right and I have pool tokens which probably as long as both of those are going to dollar the pool tokens also have a state dollar and then with those pool tokens then be kind of just a to stable coin version of the first half of the idea or did I misunderstand the one so I'm kind of coming at it is I don't really want to have this pool open to kind of people to buy out your your coins at any time it would only be in situations where died is deviation of this peg so the thanks for situation like that see it's people that the dive providers would have to have a fair amount of their deposits also in a centralized data point it feels if I'm envious what if I'm providing liquidity to this I also have occasion like this way up to you the centralized civic language I may not want to have all the time I may not understand it yeah I think it Tom if you haven't like written this out yet I am I think I'm getting what you're you're trying to describe but definitely would help if it's been written out so you want to throw that into the hack ideas channel I think that'd be super helpful for everybody sure awesome let's there are three left three hands race so let's try and um let's do those three and then I think we can wrap up alright so go ahead hello everybody can you hear me yes so I'm working on an application that will help any valuable asset owner to tokenize the asset and use it as a Cola a collateral for for a loan so that's all my else that's the idea no can you utilizing physical assets yeah physical real real what I've said so we are different of rocket and rocket NXT I see so much greater okay yeah but how do you legally recognized we will work with like with institution with some institution or some business if if is like it is for a car or real estate so we'll be working with business or with institution that will have to to validate our yes I think I think this kind of project is the the the issue is just legal issues legal legal implementation because technically speaking is pretty easy to to have an NF t I represent a physical asset but legally I think it's it's where you've got most of the work to be done I mean if you can solve the problem that like the it's really valuable that like it's a really valuable problem to solve but yeah I think I sort of agree with Julian it's that the tech problem is is one part is not super easy yeah but the legal part is probably 10x harder than the tech part of these yeah I don't I don't see this is like for hackathon it's probably a little bit - yeah yeah I feel like like for hackathons I really like those crypto native ideas like because it's feasible and and also kind of just kind of putting two or three different mechanisms or like particles together those are kind of sometimes can create very interesting combinations like that actually can be like a few so I think instead of like a really big real-world idea which really requires a lot of like like legal recourse enforcement and hard to scale and has I think that's something that was probably more suitable for a hackathon I would consider but also I feel like um I think Keith's global has like gone should come to the point that I feel like all like real world ideas have been tried and tested and throw it out there for the past two years that um that we're at this point where it's it's a bit more kind of niche like a lot of times we seem to pick on very niche ideas that doesn't sound revolutionary but inside an optimization but I think those are the projects that will provide value to the rest of the then it seems like you're you're unmuted but we can't hear you might be a permissions issue or your headphones or something about now there you go I saw um my idea was I had it it's a bit raw so I came up with it just before this so um it's right now we have collateralized loans but we don't uncollateralized loans which in the real world it based on like a credit score generally so I think I've seen a few projects working on this so it might it might they might this idea might already be being worked on by somebody else I didn't know so maybe someone could tell me that but my idea is to you you use an effing NFC to represent a person and then basically so that could represent a loan for instance and then on a secondary market that nft would then trade and then that would create the rate for your loan basically so like even evens kind of prior to actually applying for a loan there would be this NSE traded which would be like other traders willingness to then lend to you and basically so you might say how the how is the critic score going to be formed well it would be it would be formed by just kind of like the real-world rough consensus like I would say oh this is my NFT you know I'd give the address a publisher on Switzer etc and then people would trade and I would like publish details about whatever I wanted like like my income for instance I like my job my or my basically some indication of my ability to pay it back and then so yeah that's basically the idea so you put your income on Twitter to get the one well no no you could put away you could put in in the public whatever you like so then how do you verify that is you try to city how do you verify this information well you you wouldn't ever you can verify in any way you like so you know one person for instance if they wanted to guarantee their loan they everything it notarized but that all on online you know if everyone's you see even you know yeah yeah yeah us had I'm not sure II from but do us had a system like this before the financial crisis like no doc loans um or they're called buyer loans and essentially you could like go to the bank and get a loan on on real estate without really providing any proof of your ability to pay and a lot of people took out these loans and they didn't like their repayment rates weren't that great it turns out so like there's like a there's a population of people that if you can make up stuff to get a loan they will I mean criminals or you know people they like do that is their job isn't it was Union Union protocol was trying to build unfertilized or unsecured loan yeah that's right I I saw them and they they're trying to build that but I didn't see it based on individual NFC's that were traded I think it's more like a gal yeah credit union credit union I think they use a down mechanism to then set the rates for the different loans and the decision making so this this wouldn't be a down mechanism this would be purely you have this NFT and then but just the meaning of the project implies you know that this NSE represents somebody yeah yeah I think the barrier that you have to solving I'm not saying you can't solve it is that you have to disincentivize people coming to you off and taking out a loan without any of any plan to repay yep so the disincentive for that is the same as the regular credit score is that you would then get no credit in the future from at least from this system but it's kind of like yeah it's it's debatable as how it would affect your real-world whether people trust you in the real world that's really debatable but like if this if this system you know continued on and you would no longer be able to get any credit you know from message' system and let's say let's say the current system you also get like annoying people calling your phone every hour of the day and then if you do ever make enough money if you all enough and you make enough money like you'll get taken to court and potentially get your wages garnished so like that doesn't apply to a lot of people that owe money like if you don't pay your cable bill you know you're not gonna get your wage yeah but like there there are some and also if you lie about your things to like get credit that can be fraud and like you could be like you know have like other larger penalties yeah so your point is that there's bigger incentives in the real world and therefore is a problem translates in these on citizen this project yeah cuz it's like a civil resistance problem because like you know I maybe I care about not getting credit in the future but like this imaginary person I made up to try to get a loan from you they definitely don't care about their future credit and so like how you do that is the problem they're part of the problem at least I think I remember like there was another project called zero collateral or something like that then it's a cascade of loans that are getting paid using the interest rate interest repayment on the previous loan there was something like that it's called two zero zero cholesterol oh yeah I think they're they're definitely focused on that kind of piece you can do that been in that uh like really trying to get that score into like your social reputation amongst your friends there's like or you could or you could talk you could talk a nice something days very precious to you for example you could tokenize your Twitter access let's say it's an NFC token if you if you cannot be paid alone then you lose your Twitter access for a period of time that until you repay the loan that you can you can retrieved the access to that Twitter I idea of like pledging your phone number and so if you don't pay back you get a message to anyone that calls you just saying this number is not operational because Jonathan has been paid back his loans or can't can't manage to pay back his loans all you do something something like they do in China they cannot take the public transportation any more than what they're you know I think we should take away your track of oil trillion yeah well I think III think like I like the idea of once again like not enforceable the real-world recourse but to have something really s takes that's why I like I I do think that my going a bit for like I think I think the the floating like the NFT tokenizing the credit part is easy but I do think the heart part is really to boostrap a the reputation system without an identity on teen identity and so like one of the like I think about like I would usually I would prefer like in this case to to go towards like an optimized version of what Union was doing so Union essentially having your friends stake for you with skin in the game with crypto whereas however like it's hard to get them any friends upfront so like but there are actually entities like in third world countries or like in other places where they know the local people and so they're kind of like the the local row bank who knows everyone or like the neighborhood like community leaders and who already are doing this kind of reputation staking verification for people so it's still kind of fully on chain like instead civilization but it's more kind of like a name I like a minor improvement other existing like the the Dowell membership staking like your friend staking but kind of like more cater towards an entity like make it super easy for to boost wraps the the credit system up front so to have make it easier for for for people who already have a capital I'll already have like a reputation network but not necessarily like have to have be like them like like like the credit score companies or that that's kind of like the approach that I kind of purely based on economic incentives but optimizing for like at the actual situations come so it's kind of like an oligarchical credit issuance like microstructure whoa all right I hate to cut anybody off but we're gonna just do one more person and then I'd encourage anybody who wants to keep talking to jump into the discord voice chat we've got a couple of channels there I think the one in hack money is called cafe so again I'll jump over there if anybody else wants to I'm happy to keep talking Tina really quick one thing that you mentioned earlier was that you feel like all the ideas that can be done have been done and so like people will try to find like the small niche ideas that will you know haven't been touched on and it just got me thinking that one of the things that we're trying to do with hack money is now that we have 30 days that's like an infinite amount of time compared to the weekend hackathon so there's a lot more time to iterate and and find something that's a little more feature hole and I think that's a really exciting opportunity for anybody who's participating so it's sort of sorry dude on that point I wouldn't want anyone to get discouraged because things have been tried but just because something was tried during 2017 the tooling the total addressable market the reasons people were in the space were completely different and like they're just so many fact like you know there wasn't a community of defy enthusiasts in 2017 there is like a rabid community of like I see oak launchers in 27 yeah it weren't really trying to like join liquidity pools or interact with stuff and so like if you never quite know what blockers cause some of these ideas it seemed good not to work but if you can like have another take on them with how much more how much I mean I'm still immature but it's way less immature and with a lot of the things that have happened in the last three years if you can like remix them with the capabilities we have now I think that you know I like I've seen like like I mean just Eragon right in 2017 it was like yeah let's do this and basically for the first 12 months of Eragon there was nothing on Eragon and like now you're starting to see if I just actually use it because the environment around aetherium has changed and there's just more stuff you can do because the space is bigger from like a foam like a builder and user community group even though it's smaller from a market cap perspective but that's not super important for building something that people will want to use yeah it's a good way to frame it even if it's been tried before there might be a new twist that you can put on an existing idea and the cool thing is with all these paths each global events you can look at what people have already done see what they did and maybe change their approach or you know remix it it's it's a it's a good backlog - or good archive to look through all right really quick Geordi why don't you tell us your idea you you are muted it might be year oh okay sorry yep good hi everyone really quickly to ideas following from comments from Tina one of them more crypto native and and super simple I think within the scope of the hackathon you may have seen the emergence of option contracts in D Phi with the likes of open or headache I think it would be pretty cool if you could implement a dynamic hedging position so that you saved if for example and this eath were dynamically hatched by put contracts in a way that you could basically implement the strategy hands-off so that it was like a robot traded hedging position I hope that makes sense that's the that's the simple idea and it's very kryptonite if and I think somebody will end up doing it because today if you want ahead it's quite complicated you have to keep an eye on the pricing contract the pricing you have to stay on top of it I think this could be super easily automated by by a kind of a trust less rural adviser in fact I've been running some back tests on it happy to circulate the results with other people and then the other idea is a lot more ambitious and it falls on the on the realm of real world and really what we're trying to do is orchestrate to communities okay on the one hand you have potentially elderly people who are homeowners and are low on liquidity so maybe I'm 70 years old mmm-hmm and the pension in my country is getting smaller and smaller and it turns out I'm actually a homeowner okay so the idea is that I transfer these home equity into a pool and then I get currency in exchange without having to vacate my home okay who's providing this liquidity this is on the other side and then on the other side you have basically regular savers who also don't trust the Pension Scheme in their countries and what there doing is they're contributing liquidity today into a pool and then in return they get this special type of home equity that as soon as the person passes away on the other side creates cash flows that return back to the liquidity provider and so what you have is like a circular economy that's linking people that have liquidity in the present time and are looking for real estate equity and and on the other hand people that do have real estate equity and need liquidity and so what we're thinking of is making a system emerge that orchestrates both markets any thoughts well I like I like the first idea I really like it I see makes a lot of sense to show you what I'm walking on I think it's cool like it yeah it seems like there were also some comments in the the chat as well some people liked that idea so definitely put that into the hack ideas channel if you have not already sure awesome well this has been really good I appreciate everybody who showed up thank you again to our speakers slash brainstorm helpers Scott Jillian Tina you guys have been awesome I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and respond thoughtfully I'm sure it's gonna really help hackers as they start to like flesh out their ideas and get their teams together again if you haven't staked for hack money please do so if you're having technical issues reach out we want to make sure everybody's ready to go when the bell rings on Friday there's not gonna be an actual valve but maybe we should have a bell yeah so they kick off be sure to register for that it's gonna be awesome it's Linda G from Skyler capital Spencer noon from doggy tail crypto capital think it's the name and Austin Griffith from the a theorem foundation they're gonna be talking about defy just have a general discussion on it and it's it's gonna be really great I'm looking forward to it so again thank you everybody for showing up steak if you haven't register for the kickoff and yeah let's keep the discussion going into the disparate if you haven't already all right also yeah no problem glad you guys could all make it alright yeah thanks for doing awesome yeah have a good rest of the day hi guys
