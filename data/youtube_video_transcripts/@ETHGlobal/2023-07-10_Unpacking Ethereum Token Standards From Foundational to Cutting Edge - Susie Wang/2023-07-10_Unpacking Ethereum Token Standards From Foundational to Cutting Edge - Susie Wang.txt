foreign [Music] so let's start since we've got like all the friends over here so hello everyone my name is Susie hello hello and just a little bit about me and also a little disclaimer so I used to be in charge like in part of some of the projects including some day fire defy social graph metaverse nft and also I used to be partnership and growth for BNB chain so it's a labor and blockchain and my expertise is lies in growth ecosystem growth BD marketing and operations so this little little disclaimer here is that since I have a background in those kinds of areas so like I won't be too tech savvy person so like I won't touch like a lot of details in the tech side but if you're willing to talk we can definitely like talk later about some tech sites I'm like always open to discussion but let's dive into the topic for today so before we dive into your C token standards we need to know a little bit more about EIP so EIP stands for ethereum improvement proposals so an analogy here is like it's a suggestion box for ethereum blockchain so if you have a cool idea for ethereum you either it can be new features or maybe changes to the system or maybe just sharing information you can definitely raise an EIP standard and there are different types of eips including standard track aips it's absolutely system changing and those are very big ones it can Define working mechanisms for ethereum blockchain and there are meta eips those are more about processes and environments and there are informational eips so literally it's sharing informations in guidelines and let's touch a little bit more about standard track EIP categories there are four categories within the standard track VIPs so the first one is core so it proposed changes to the required consent that require consensus or even modifying ethereum's core code so this is a really big one and other ones including networking for example like improving ethereum Network protocols so for example like how ethereum nodes communicate with each other as within this networking category and the third one is interface so for example if you want to make changes to stdm's client API or standards so for example like how we interact with ethereum it's within the interface and lastly it's ERC those are application Level standards and Convention and conventions so I want to touch a little bit about the review processes just in case like some of you guys here want to make an EIP proposal so the first you need to draft your EIP and then you will go through reviews and feedback sessions and then there will be a last call for contents where maybe like feedbacks and then it will be published to ethereum and if you want to write a good EIP there are certain standards so for example you need to be well written and thought out and also if you want to raise an EIP so single EIP should only cover one idea or proposal so if you have like several cool ideas you should be like raising several eips and also add authors and content creators you should view consensus and also deal with disagreements so you're the mother and fathers of the CIP standards so you need to take care of them so it's truly a big deal for ethereum Network so take it seriously who are going to diving deep into some of them so let's dive into ERC so ERC stands for ethereum request for comments so if you want to go to maybe ERC website you can see a ton of them including maybe this the status of them so including 20 721 and also like in the last session from vitalik He also mentioned like maybe 12 17 71 let's take that as an example so for example it has the title and subtitle standard signature validation method for contracts and table of contents abstract motivation specification rationale codes copyright set citation it's like writing an academic article so you need to be very careful about everything and also it has all the information on the website so go check that out I do want to I know like you guys are like more tacky than I am so you guys know a lot about codes and everything but I do want to mention about erc20 and erc721 a little bit because the those are something that we cannot really skip so the first one is erc20 which stands for fungible token so it's the brainchild of Fabian the metallic which was introduced in 2015 November so this is the first one size for all standard for ethereum token and also in the end and analogy that I really want to use is the sheer language just like English for all the token that is established on ethereum um so since we all use English so I can communicate with with you and I can communicate with you it's not really like other languages like Mandarin there are definitely other token standards that sit for maybe like some regions but not really like erc20 and some future functions including total Supply balance off allowance transfer approve and transfer from and also we have other speakers from open zapplet which is like I want to use the analogy of an open recipe so if you have all the codes from that Library you can make your own cake but you can spice it up with your talent just like adding some fruit onto that ERC token standard that you want to develop but it's not all sweetness it's not all like rainbow and sunshine about erc20 although it's a breakthrough so for example if you guys are around here in 2016 there's the Dow attack so there's a hacker finding a loophole within the smart contract of incoming token so it costs 15 million loss into the black hole and also there are some limitations I love this Meme and and um because like erc20 standard need to create a separate smart contract for every unique token type um or combination of customizable features therefore there's an explosion of the rc20 token standards and smart contracts on the market right now and also it's really hard for people to do those due diligences on those contracts and another contract token standard that we definitely need emphasis is ERC 721 we also have speaker yesterday from tagmat theater from Dapper Labs who is also the author of this token standard so it was created in 2018 and um this is actually making like the name just makes it um sound it's the non-fungible token so you guys all know about nfts so those tokens are one of a kind and holding its own special of attributes that is different from any other nfts so for example like azuki they have attributes like background clothing eyes hair mouth type Etc so which is different from any other ones and I hope you guys all go to pragmire yesterday because it was so cool and also you can get a crypto Kitty so one of the case study of erc721 is definitely cryptokitties I won't dive into two date too much details but if you want to check that out this is super important and with ERC 721 the limitations is that it do not really offer quantitative features so there's less computability liquidity and manageability with ERC 721 token and also it's not really good application for financial instruments um so like bonds insurance policies or vesting plans an analogy that I like to use so if you guys have watched the anime Yu-Gi-Oh um so it's the last century anime and also like car game um so if you I want to share a Yu-Gi-Oh card with my sister um so I cannot really tear it and tear it into half and maybe set it send her a half of that without losing its own asset so with ERC 721 it's not really enabling people to maybe divide those nfts and send it and yeah especially with financial instruments like bonds like invest like insurance policies where we need to divide it like erc721 is definitely not the case and I want to give credit to erc6551-6551 and also maybe 777 and all other token standards because we have a limited time today so I won't dive into two details but you can definitely find those authors outside and also in other panelists to talk about details about those token standards but for today like we're going to mention ERC 1155 and erc3525 which is in the system it tries to improve erc20 and er2721 so erc1155 is also a very foundational one it's called multi-token standard so imagine it's actually created by mid-journey a vending machine where we can get all kinds of food so if I want to get a soda and also maybe a candy bar all I need to do is press the soda number and press and press my credit card and sew the drops if I want to get the candy bar candy bar number credit card and the drops but if I imagine this vending machine as ethereum blockchain then whenever I press the play the card I need to pay the gas fee it's not very like time efficient or maybe like money efficient at the same time but with erc1155 is actually solving this problem because it's combining maybe the soda and also the candy bar in one slot together or maybe like some digital collectibles in one slot also so I only need to press the credit card for once and then everything drops and we need to give credit to engine which is the author of this token standard so it's a um gaming blockchain gaming company and also they use erc1155 for their gaming token Avatar in-game asset and land and as we mentioned like every token standard have its advantages and also disadvantages this is also like one thing I want you guys all take from the today's panel so the limitations with erc1155 although it's a breakthrough and also I think it's underrated it's very intricate and also we find each token has its own set of rules so we want to combine them together for example like the analogy that I use if I want to make soda and candy bar into one slot like soda is soda candy bars candy bar like why we should combine them together there might be some inconsistency like happening within the slide so adding on to Wawa um just one more sentence about that so I think for 1155 maybe there are some like real life applications as well so for example like real Asset Management Supply Chain management and so so other than maybe like in crypto industry we can definitely use this token standard in other areas as well so ERC 3525 is also adding another layer on top of everything else so it was introduced by the soft protocol team and also it was created late 2020 so not very far away so it's called semi-fundable token let's imagine something right now together so if I have a water bottle I'm sorry I did not really bring my water bottle today but let's imagine that sitting here so it's a container holding a unique item it's the indivisible most times and also it has to be used as a whole but with erc3525 just like this picture of a container having lots of models inside I can pour it into smaller bottles and maybe distribute with anyone in the classroom in this panel together so it's devisable and combinable and also it's a universal digital container and also it's visualizable smart contract so like this picture over here um if Alice wants to send Bob an nft of 50 bucks then Bob is getting like 250 Buck nft but with semi-fundable token which is erc3525 he can combine the 250 bucks together and form a 100 buck nft so fractional come true another example that I want to give you guys is for example I am a digital artist who is making a masterpiece for example this masterpiece moment is over here is I want to sell it right now probably I'm going to deploy a erc721 token and sell it as a nft but with the help of erc's 3525 I can fractionalize that maybe into different fractions and distribute or solid to everyone in this panel room today and each of you guys will get a little piece of that artwork so if the market goes up maybe I hopefully maybe later this year and you guys can divide it up into even smaller pieces and get profit maybe just selling that out and if you guys want to form that massive piece together maybe in the future to display in the library in the museum then you guys can come together and combine that so it's combinable and dividable at the same time and think about this aquarium so it's a transparent aquarium so that we can see like how many fishes are inside how many corals how many things are inside so it's a visual uh visualizable smart contract so you can sneak peek and assess the quality of everything within that smart contract um so with salt protocol they have like digital vouchers that you can see like all your financial investment and everything with that vulture without nft so that you can as an investor you can make informed financial decisions you can mitigate your risks and also promote transparency so let's think back to the financial crisis of 2008 so with that transparency maybe like we can mitigate the damage of that financial crisis with maybe the help of erc3525 or maybe other token standards and also it can help to do maybe Dynamic nfts where Dynamic semi-fundable tokens this is a picture of using chain link to collect some off-chain data within the oracles but with the ERC c525 you can easily upgrade evolve or adapt or improve your nft or sft with the help of other information this is a very clear picture and I found erc3525 and also like prc-1155 like in the middle of the spectrum where erc20 is computable but not really self-descriptive ERC 721 on the other hand is self-descriptive but not really computable but maybe like 3525-1155 they are having both of the asset and some data structures finally some tag information so erc20 is having the value ERC 721 is having the token ID where we call ID erc1155 is ID value metadata underneath and 3525 is also adding a slot where you can maybe add different slot into that token and ID and um 1155 also has batch transfer and 3525 has transferred to token which is also Illustrated here you can see that ID to ID token to token transfer but there are some limitations although it's a very functional token standard 3525 but it's very complex so there might be some like higher potential for glitches or security vulnerability so as coders you guys need to be very careful like when you're coding that um and also for users although I mentioned like how beneficial that fractionalized nft can benefit all the other people but it cartoon news right like for nfts I can just transfer to you guys but with fractionalized nfts we need more educational information on how to manage the shared a portion of those nfts but one example that I want to give you guys is X winner so it's a gaming platform and it's true free to play many or casual game with on-chang asset that is using ERC 3525 so with the help of erc3525 maybe in gaming we can see like dividable in-game assets like tickets like player characters skins weapons power ups Etc and also like with fraction fractional has nft I'm so sorry blurry ton um we can have more liquidity in the market so that you do not really need to sell a whole aft and you can just fractionalize that and maybe sell a portion of your nft which has like um maybe like less money invested in that portion and we can also imagine some new gameplay mechanism for Guilt so right now like the guild for GameFly is shrinking if you guys are familiar um so we can combine fractions for a ball stage just imagine like all of us in this panel room has a portion of a sword and we can combine together maybe to tackle ball stage together instead of maybe just trying to play your own game fight I do think like socialization is very important for gaming so right now with game five this is something that we definitely want to tackle and the second one is variety for game can be United so you guys know like variety is definitely the spice for our life especially with gaming if I play a game for maybe 24 hours I will get tired I just want to play something else so we want to have a variety with erc3525 we can have different slots for different types of game different gaming genres so for example we have maybe puzzle game we have casual game for slot one and Slot two and there's some games underneath so for example like 2048 we have Sudoku we have chess under the puzzle game and we have Smart contractor attached pose attach and algorithm attached so there are some demos Sudoku and Pac-Man and um I don't know I am a heavy gamer and I do believe in the future of GameFly so like with this concept we are building apps winner and we want to restore the trust and confidence in GameFly and right now I have been questioning a lot like whether game 5 is still a thing like game five is not only a thing it's the future and all the companies all the big companies in web 2 are investing thousands millions of dollars into like maybe developing their Marketplace and also developing game fat and with the help of erc3525 the token standard we can reward those time invested in those gaming so a minute of enjoyment of time that you put in that game is a minute invested so that we can have a United leaderboard for all the game instead of like maybe having one game with their own system algorithm we can have a United award for all the things and therefore we are here to restore Faith to reignite passion and to reassure the world that GameFly is not only alive but thriving with potential and also I want to encourage you all to think about something so as we mentioned there are all kinds of token standard in the market right now you can check the board for all of them but for Builders out there since ERC is definitely in your weapon you need to think about its function whether it's definitely something you need or not go check them out and to see if they're sharp enough for your use case thank you so much
