hello good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of heath global and i am super excited to welcome all of you to market make um it is super awesome to see a lot of familiar faces on our live chat and uh and even better to see a lot of new ones so a happy new year to to all of you um looking for a much better 2021 and i can't wait to get the show started uh for today so we're still having a lot of you join in but i'll kind of give a quick overview of what this uh next hour is going to look like all of you are joining us on on our live page which is at live.ethglobal.com you're going to see something like this i know we've been uh all joining a lot of live events and zoom calls and uh for eve global want to do something that's a lot more reactive and can adapt to uh how we can experience the event together so we've offered and made this custom thing for all of us that they'll be using for today so you'll be able to see this live stream on on your left side and this chat box on the right and uh we'll be able to talk to each other uh through this chat so if you have any questions for our speakers or for uh about the event you can ask them here and we'll be able to uh relay them on the live stream so play with the at the setting we encourage all of you to log in so you can ask questions and say on the chat and uh during some down times enjoy some low-fi beats so with that i want to kick off uh by telling you about eat global so for those of you who don't know each global is an organization with a very simple mission we want to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this by hosting events and technical summits uh online and across the world so before we jump into what we have in for 2021 and what market make is going to be about i wanted to start off by summarizing last year for us uh it wasn't just an interesting year for us it was an interesting year for all of us around the world we generally do a lot of in-person hackathons around the world and we kicked off 2020 by hosting eat london we were able to successfully pull this off as a 300 person event but uh we had to transition into doing online events uh nevertheless we did a lot of interesting and online events uh throughout uh 2020 and i want to do a quick summary of how that last year turned out so we kicked off by eat london and then we hosted hack money as our first ever d5 hackathon which was online and we got an amazing set of projects from this this event we had a few people even go out to raise money and build successful defect protocols uh in the ethereum ecosystem we then switched gears and we hosted and ran hack fs in collaboration with protocol labs where people worked on decentralized storage and mix that with web3 and then we finally did eat online which was our biggest event uh ever where we not only did a hackathon and had over a thousand people participate but this was also an event where we hosted five different summits uh focusing on what's happening in the web3 ecosystem from scaling to privacy to uh the future of ethereum 2.0 and i'm super excited to announce that throughout all of our efforts from 2020 we had uh over 1900 developers participate at our events and close to 4 000 people who attended our summits uh in person and online combined and all these people joined us from 87 different countries in this band 21 different time zones we were absolutely thrilled by uh this uh this level of audience and uh and we're excited to sort of uh continue building the same relationships and and reach even more um more of you uh this year and with that i want to kick us off with market make and i don't think market make will be will be any different uh we're excited to do this as our first event for 2021 and i'm proud to announce that as of this morning we have 450 hackers participating at this event they'll be working on a lot of interesting uh d5 projects over the next three weeks and these 450 hackers are going to be coming from 50 different 58 different countries and this ban across 17 different time zones so we're gonna have a lot of fun on our discord coordinating and talking to each other and seeing what everybody's doing 24 7. so on top of just the the hackers we also have over 30 mentors who are here to help you on the technical side if you get stuck or if you need help with any specific protocols that you're choosing to build on and we have 10 companies that are participating in the sponsors they'll be there to not only give you their time and and help make it easy for you to use existing working protocols to build on top of but they're also there to make sure that you succeed and you can take your projects to the next level and throughout all of that uh this is also a hackathon at the end of the day and we have over fifty thousand dollars in prizes for all the participants uh hacking at market make i want to especially thank ave for being our co-host for this event uh this event is probably uh co-hosted and partnered with with aveon and on top of that we are super excited to be working with the whole ave team they've been a delight to work with and uh it'll be even more fun to see everything in action as people build on top of ave and other d5 protocols uh throughout the the next few weeks i also want to thank the ethereum foundation one inch exchange chain link matic uma ens the graph avigati london's cap coin gecko and coin market cap for for being our sponsors uh and they'll be also uh hanging out and sort of helping out all of you as developers on uh being able to integrate and use some of their their services and sdks and apis uh into your projects so uh let's kind of jump right into uh this event i wanna give a quick overview of what the next hour is going to look like i'll kind of cover uh the agenda for the three weeks for the hackathon which talks about anything from team formation to what a check-in is to how you can get help if you're stuck uh on on some technical side of things all the prizes you can win and and all the talks and workshops and animes that we have but before that uh we're going to do is sort of have an interesting chat with uh two uh two prominent speakers in in our ecosystem and uh i want to welcome stani kulachav who is the co-founder and ceo of ave and anthony pompliano who is a prominent speaker in the space and an investor as well uh we'll be having a chat about what's possible with dfi and how we can actually merge this uh with the traditional finance uh system so please uh welcome stani and anthony so thank you so much for joining us thank you happy to be here i want to kick us off today by asking each of you uh just in general what d5 means uh to to each of you from how you see this and and kind of how your experience has been and obviously in 2020 we've seen a massive growth in in the d5 ecosystem and the the total volume in usd locked in in those protocols has exceeded 21 billion certainly not a number we can ignore so um kind of maybe with stani like what does that mean to you and how do you see defy as of right now yeah so uh i i think kind of like what's business finance uh pretty much is is uh instead of uh various kind of like uh uh financial uh i would not say maybe like uh services or platforms but but basically applications where there's certain interesting properties and one of the interesting properties is that pretty much anyone can access decentralized finance so you you could be anywhere in the world and have a similar advantage uh for example a person in uk us uh in asia and uh one of the interesting things here is as well that uh that permissionless access also gives you the permissions access to to build things uh into the uh decentralized finance so uh let's say uh ave might build some sort of uh learning protocol uh to provide yield and some some other developer uh other part of the world can build on top uh some sort of uh yield aggregator that balances uh yields between various protocols so it's practically um i would like to quote our ceo jordan uh when he says that uh defy is kind of uh improving what banking is in the back end system so if you look at uh traditional finance and the banking space what's happening there in the innovation most of the innovation is in the front ends the new banks they're they're improving the user experiences of for the mainstream but when you look at the back ends of the banks and what's happening there it's pretty much lagging with the legacy uh system that they have and and decentralized finance is is trying to improve that back end and make it practically open and available and because it's open to everyone to build and participate uh there's two functions there one is that the innovation is constant all the time so practically all of the developers can innovate openly and there's there's constant innovation and also uh when something new comes up because it's so easy to to switch from one protocol to another uh practically the liquidity is moving all the time so it's it's a kind of like a constant uh feedback loop of innovation that is uh happening and because it's it's practically built on the the the the blockchain ecosystem uh uh all the transactions are completely uh transparent you can see what kind of transactions there are and for example all the interest rates uh in mathematics and and also there's not this kind of like a black boxing that you see for example when you compared to something that we have been used to uh when it comes to traditional finance for example it's very difficult to quantify risks uh in wall street but when you go d5 the all the data is available it's up to the developer community and practically built uh those tools for uh for wider usage uh indeed that's kind of those are kind of like main uh properties at least uh uh for me anthony i didn't take it yeah yeah i think for me um it really starts with kind of decentralization right and decentralization to me is two key components one is uh there's no single person organization uh or nation state that has control or can manipulate um you know whatever the the platform or services and then two is it's kind of the ultimate manifestation of free markets because there is no manipulation there's no control and so decentralization to me is probably going to be one of the big themes of the 2020s uh and kind of beyond and that's true of whether it's decentralized kind of messaging application social media applications finance applications you kind of just go down the line and i think that we're going to see a big shift towards decentralization along with that what you'll get is a shift towards kind of privacy-centric uh type applications as well and sometimes that goes hand-in-hand sometimes they can be separate things but ultimately what we're talking about here is a return to kind of the personal freedoms and individual liberties that people have um and i think study really described kind of this idea that um individuals having kind of a level playing field to some degree right and so if you think about geography is is one key advantage that some people have capital base is another literally education or relationships on the kind of the traditional financial world for example can really serve as an advantage when you're looking for something as simple as a loan uh to buy a home uh or to buy a car but also for many many other things even just around getting a bank account can can really be influenced by a lot of these things that frankly don't actually matter and so i think that decentralization kind of allows us to go back to a system that has much more free choice has much more free markets and is ultimately liberating for uh literally billions of people around the world because it allows them to simply get access to financial services that aren't reliant on anything other than their ability to use those effectively and so when it comes to decentralized finance i think that what we should see here is uh some leveling of that playing field we should see you know a pretty significant inflection um in terms of human production um you know and i'm fond of kind of talking about that from you know decentralization uh especially in d5 i think is less about any one protocol any one application it's just an entire movement and frankly we need as many people building decentralized financial applications as possible because the kind of promise or the payoff uh if successful is so massive that we have to encourage the experimentation and innovation um kind of across the world right it's also important it's not just built by people from one part of the world it's built by people all around the world um in a truly decentralized manner no absolutely sorry about that yeah i want to build on that exactly because uh i mean when the ecosystem grows uh substantially so when there's more developers building uh different kinds of d5 products and not not just the e5 but anything kind of like unchained that that helps helps the society the ecosystem grows substantially so it's very difficult to create kind of like a parallel uh system uh next to the uh decent class finance with its core properties and kind of like name that okay this this parallel system that we have which might be created by the the legacy finance uh could be like the the d fiber the mainstream should be adopted so i think this is like very important uh why we need more developers and and users and building innovation so when the ecosystem is is strong enough and and big enough the only option is to join and and that's the the the the power of kind of like building so openly so the rate of innovation and decentralized finance is absolutely amazing how how quickly people build new things and and it feels like a never-ending uh story and that's pretty good when you get money well one other thing i would say and i think this is an important part to kind of address just a high level from a structural standpoint is you know decentralized finance is going to be um you know somewhat um you know kind of uh pervasive across the world from a geography standpoint but it's also going to be pervasive across the technical landscape as well and so um while maybe unpopular to some people in this audience i think that an important part of this is you know decentralized uh applications um so taking a decentralized exchange for example uh is really no different than let's say decentralized money something like bitcoin right they have the same ethos they have the same uh kind of long-term goal i think in terms of how do we decentralize the entire stack of the legacy financial world and so um you know i think it's less about kind of the tribalism of you know who owns d5 and it's more of just people seeing look there's a legacy system that legacy system works for some group of people but it doesn't work for everyone and in fact there's a such a mismatch in power and influence that uh the group that it works for can actually take advantage of the group it doesn't work for right so it can almost become this uh this weapon um in some weird way and so i think that decentralization uh can kind of be a great equalizer and it can be a great kind of peaceful protest to that system but it's really going to take people from all walks of life uh people with all kinds of different technical skills because that's the part that the mainstream conversation kind of misses is like you know i'm not a technical person i'm not going to build this right i can help fund it i can help kind of from an intellectual standpoint in terms of ideas but i don't have the skill set nor frankly the experience to go and actually build these protocols to build these applications and so we need as many people with that skill set kind of working on this stuff and i think that's a really really important part obviously what you know you guys are doing here at the global and stuff like that is a big part of that but it's just trying to get more talented experienced skilled people uh to understand why is this important like why does the world need decentralization when it comes to finance uh and then really encouraging them to go and build right and try to innovate and i think that there's one thing that we've learned from the technology sector it's that uh the best ideas can come from literally anyone right it doesn't always have to be from the person that went to stanford or harvard and so kind of encouraging that experimentation is really important because uh that's how we truly do push innovation forward and ultimately kind of reach that goal of decentralizing everything no it's a really great point and thank you so much for kind of commenting on each other's uh answers too maybe then a question for both of you is just from from uh taking in from what you just said uh you kind of said that it may be a protest to the traditional system do you how do you kind of see this ecosystem involved do you see this as like a shadow replacement where it'll actually be a switch or do we see that as like a parallel world that exists and people can choose to do that because they have a lot more control than freedom or just a lack of barriers um and sort of kind of just all makes another question we wanted to ask here is that just kind of in comparison to all of that uh do you sort of see the the wall street international finance will take this is uh decentralizing those assets and platforms uh and then the third is uh encouraging some level of pseudonymity in those applications as well so kind of privacy centric type applications and so when you get digital decentralized and pseudonymous what that ultimately is empowering is an automated system and so there's a lot of folks who uh you know i think kind of pit together or pit against the legacy financial world and let's just call it kind of the decentralized world i actually think that that's probably the wrong mental framework to use the way that i look at this is the legacy system is in incapable of creating an automated financial system right and what i mean by that is their assets are electronic-based they're electronic q-sip based assets or physical and so machines have a very hard time kind of transacting or sending those types of assets because they need centralization the business models are all centered around whether they're centralized institutions or individuals essentially um kind of wedging themselves into bureaucracy so that they can take a fee right like there's almost a financial incentive to actually make it more bureaucratic and that's how you get paid and then the last one is the regulatory environment is very kind of geographic based and that geographic basis to the regulatory environment is because there are centralized organizations servers and people and so you can kind of do that when you all of a sudden get that digital decentralized suit anonymous kind of world what this now allows for is a much more efficient a much more lower cost and a much more productive financial system and so to me it's less about like legacy world versus this decentralized world and it's more about everyone in the world whether you're a wall street institution or a random person you know in a country in africa you are simply looking for the lowest cost most efficient most secure way to transfer value or to conduct and participate in financial services and if that means that automation is going to get us there then of course all of the capital all of the um intellectual kind of horsepower is going to flow to that system and so it's less about like does wall street participate or not it's they're gonna have no choice right if there's just better technology uh they're gonna have to do it and you see this with the youngest generations like how many people uh would have gone to work at jpmorgan or goldman sachs or you know name your wall street firm and instead of saying wait a second i want to go participate in this new thing i think it is much more scalable i think it's much more important it better aligns with my values and ethos and i want to have a hand in actually helping to build it rather than kind of just go be a cog in the wheel cog in the machine at you know one of those wall street firms so i think it's just a foregone conclusion it's gonna happen everyone's gonna participate it just takes time yeah definitely i i i agree on the sense that kind of like if you if you have something in terms of technology that is innovative and and and it really helps people it's it's it says it helps people to to practically uh save cost due to efficiency and and also make the make the uh society uh better and and and so forth you know with the transparency you get and i think definitely it's very hard to kind of like uh go back to other direction you know backwards and and say that practically okay this this doesn't work so it's actually like i mean we've been living uh too long i mean years and years where you have a lot of skepticism on technology which is better and this is probably insane and it kind of like happens maybe more in in in finance but you know it's it's more rare that uh you know in in most of the technology that practically if you have something innovative uh it it's very difficult to kind of like pitch and and finance and and there's other fields like you know medicine and so forth uh where actually it's it's way different because you need results but for example finance where you can prove everything pretty much how it is and and when it comes to for example bitcoin and and decentralized finance i mean it it's easy to prove what what what's the kind of like use case and how it helps so i think uh when we look at the traditional finance uh i i i see that the there's at some point has to be a a moment where you have to kind of plug into the system because uh the system and its technology uh it's so advanced that it's kind of like very difficult to uh ignore i think we saw like a couple of years ago uh there was a lot of talk about blockchain and i mean the last uh kind of bull market and there was a lot of you know uh projects where uh there was several like banks trying to create uh permissioned you know private uh blockchains and and experiment in internally somehow and envision i mean experiments are totally fine but envisioning kind of like a uh world where you you have you know permissioned private systems between banks and that's how you kind of use blockchain which is kind of like uh very problematic because the whole idea is that you have a open ecosystem and open economy where everyone can participate you practically abandon a old system that is legacy and and funny part about the traditional finance is that you know some of the technology is very old you know it can be from from the 70s and and mainframe stuff and it's very very conservative field and the conservative field comes because uh at some way you have to protect uh the end users consumers from bankers or from basically behavior that that hasn't been very good so that is why we have this uh regulation where you know we we we protect people but when it comes to you know uh decentralized finance all of that uh protection can be actually built in smart contracts you can build whatever you want to build and those smart contracts will self-execute you you can't go you can't do anything else then this market checks practice is built for i mean unless you you have a governance and you change and the community wants to change and so forth but uh you know it's it's completely different approach and and when you have this kind of a ecosystem and technology it's it's very difficult to kind of say that uh well you can say but you know it's very difficult to ignore especially if the there's more and more utilization and i think like the same way as bitcoin uh the cool part uh for me is that for bitcoin decent class finance you can't stop people from using it so you can't say anyone that you can't actually hold bitcoin and not hold uh dollars or euros and say that you need to keep your wealth in in dollars or euros you actually can't do that because you know you can't get bitcoin and and the same way you can use these finance even if you ban all the front ends that and access points that are plugged into the d5 ecosystem uh the blockchain runs it's very difficult to close and you know it's even not worth to fight it it's just easier for kind of like for institutionals and and and the traditional finance to actually participate and then assess on their own level like how how they could get involved and i think now it's happening more than ever uh we've been building practically uh uh well financial applications on ethereum for for a few years now but now i think it's the moment where kind of like there is a bit of excitement and also uh comfort uh from the institutional size to actually unders uh understand war and and get somehow involved and i think main main reason is that the ecosystem has grown so bigger so there's actually so much things you can do as an end user in in decentralized finance and also the advantages are are amazing i mean it really democratizes many things it in terms of for example it democratizes the the interest rates so so practically whatever the governance sets for the interest rates they're applied gross protocol meaning anyone any part of the war that is consuming practically those uh uh or depositing into oven they basically are paying the same rate so that's like interesting and the same thing you can actually take and just scale in other applications and that's why uh defy so exciting because if you call your friend who is in australia and practically uh uses dfi you are actually talking the same language you know you don't have this regional barriers legislation and which is like very common in financial services and you can't talk about usd deposits with your friend in let's say singapore and and you know i love when we remove all of this like regulatory burden and just let the technology lead us that's the that's the like finest uh the kind of perspective i would see this thing going a lot a lot a lot of interesting insights from there so um what i'll do is i'll try to dig into some really quick questions and we can maybe just sort of get into that and have like a handful of other bigger things i want to cover so kind of my summary of that is uh kind of from from anthony's view like that it doesn't matter because the traditional clients will have to uh opt in and play with it and on the on sunny side uh this is where programmable money is going so it is unstoppable and uh you will have so much innovation that you will have no options other than to see what could be possible um i think those are super interesting points and maybe like one other way but i'd like to synthesize that is uh it's not just that um it's it's better or it's it's globally accessible from day one it's that uh because of this architecture and the fact that it's not a 50-year-old system you have the ability to do things that are just not possible uh and then i mean uh it shouldn't be a surprise when somebody learns about what flashlights are and uh and maybe we'll just all have stunning just give a 20-second explanation for a flashlight and what i want to ask for you is what's kind of the last uh d5 protocol you've used on ethereum and kind of what was that experience like for each of you uh on the flashlight so it's it's pretty much kind of like i would say uh flashlights are practically borrowing from someone uh buying something and selling something and and then repaying your loan at the same kind of like uh i blink so in in traditional world it sounds a bit uh you know very narrow where this could happen but on blockchain what's interesting is that uh on each block transactions are settled so you can do all crazy all kinds of crazy transactions that just fit into the blockchain on that particular block and uh and it doesn't matter which order you're doing those transactions the only important thing is that all the transactions are settled so so in in smart contract world what happens is flash loans is that you could borrow uh without any collateral traditionally d5 has been on the borrowing side collateralized over collateralized so you put value uh say ethereum wrap bitcoin and then you borrow stable coins against that deposit but with flash loans you just take uh under collateralized loan you can take as much as liquidity there is in indeed efi and that allows this platform functionality you basically borrow and then you can buy an asset from one exchange for example unit swap and and sell it in another exchange for example let's say uh balancer or in in in a dex and return the flash loan and and and practically keep the keep the profit so this is just an arbitrage uh where which is the use case here uh but eventually uh if you don't return the loan uh then your all your transactions will fail what you try to do because you didn't settle the last transaction and you need to settle everything in in that block so essentially like uh where you could use this uh uh is is arbitrage but also refinancing let's say you deposit it into um one lending protocol uh assets and then you borrowed another asset then uh you see that there is a cheaper interest rate on another protocol so practically normally you would have to return what you borrowed which you might have spent and then take your collateral go to the next place and then open the loan position again but with flash loans you practically just click a button and and what happens is that you refinance your position so a flash loan is taking whatever the amount you borrowed your first loan position is closed collateral is taking to the other protocol and you get another oral position and the flash loan is returned and you practice it refinanced your position this was very long explanation but it's it's it is useful uh functionality absolutely i summarized being able to borrow unlimited money for 15 seconds and uh and if it doesn't work uh nothing really changes and that's that's an interesting concept it's just not possible in traditional world so maybe i'll kind of go back to the question on there's some deep protocols you've used then you're excited about starting with m3 yeah so you know from my perspective um i always kind of start with bitcoin as like the decentralized money and i think that one's obviously kind of everyone understands it and uh the value is pretty well understood um well not a uh a d5 protocol but one of the things that i'm really excited about in this space is a company called quick node uh basically the ability for like infrastructure to get set up uh super quickly low latency a lot of things tell me what you're talking about in terms of the flash loans and the ability to kind of front run and arbitrage and do all that kind of stuff uh the infrastructure is really important so i've been pretty impressed with just the ability for folks to not only build out infrastructure that makes it possible but also to to see the feedback loop between people who want to use the protocols and kind of what they want to use something like a quick node for and how quickly that's like iterating right because i think a lot of people first start with like oh maybe i just want to get data off of the protocol and now all of a sudden we've literally got you know people trying to front run trades and do all of that so i think that's interesting and then the other thing that i think is uh probably becoming more understood uh by the legacy world but they don't quite yet know how to feel about it uh is obviously uniswap right and when you kind of look and see just the the market pulling and using that specific uh application um i i think is is pretty interesting and it's hard to kind of argue against just people using something and then the last thing that i'll mention which is a little bit different but uh it's decentralized and i think that we have not yet seen a lot of stuff built there but we'll see a lot of stuff to come uh is the lightning network uh which i think is kind of a very interesting kind of layer too and so um those are some of the stuff that you know i've probably spent the most time on um but i i think that there's just so much innovation somebody said to me the other day it's nearly impossible to keep up with every single thing that's happening uh because there's just so much and and uh it seems like every day there's something new and i think that they're probably even underestimating it because uh uh there really is just every day it seems like not only somebody coming up with something new from a mechanism standpoint but then there's like 10 teams working on different versions of it so it's kind of multiplying pretty quickly so maybe just kind of reading between the lines here are are you are you sort of uh optimistic that we'll kind of have a version of uh programmability and just the financial primitives on bitcoin that sort of kind of cover what's right now possible in ethereum or kind of how do you see these two ecosystems working together um or are you just fundamentally betting everything sort of still settles on bitcoin here at the end of the day yeah so the first thing i would just say is um i'm not religious necessarily about uh everything has to be built on one place or another like i again i kind of come at this as uh i think we have a pretty good understanding of where we are today right in terms of like what everyone is working on if you kind of pay attention and i think we all generally agree um across all of these you know tribes if you will or different communities uh where do we want to go right in kind of that decentralized world that we started talking about in the beginning i think the big question is just like how do we get there right and uh the best kind of investment thesis is probably just bet on it all right because like whoever the winners are going to have such outsized upside that like whatever the ones you're wrong on are is not going to matter um but but i think that the framework i used to think through let's say bitcoin and ethereum has really been bitcoin is decentralized kind of sound money and all of the infrastructure around it is like fairly centralized today right so if you think of pretty much like all of the applications uh all of the companies all the exchanges like almost everything in the bitcoin world around it is centralized uh and then in the ethereum uh kind of community really there is um this asset that i think is probably debated in the ethereum community like is eath money or is it not right and um you know i tend to fall in the the camp of like is it money it but it's a protocol and people are going to build stuff on top of it but all that infrastructure is decentralized right so everything kind of in that world you know from ave all the way down is decentralized and so what i think you ultimately get is like you want decentralized sound money and you want decentralized infrastructure some people are betting that you can take bitcoin you know with wrapped btc and stuff like that and bring it into the ethereum world and like that will be the winning strategy some people say no you're gonna build uh kind of decentralized infrastructure on bitcoin frankly i don't think that one we know yet and two i don't think that like anybody's individual opinion really matters like the market's gonna decide what the what the winner is if you said to me like what is my opinion i tend to think that a lot of it will kind of um you know kind of flow to the sound money and kind of be built around there but what i think is a nuance to the conversation that people haven't yet been really talking about is like what happens when there's just interoperability right like what happens when it's actually just you know a digital dollar bitcoin or some other asset like it's all the same thing because the technology has like relative feature parity and the applications are decentralized like i don't think this is such a black and white world where people are just like you know hey here's my bet and this is going to be right there's a lot of nuance here and again the market's going to decide and so you know you know a roundup unit swap is kind of an example of like it's hard for anyone to say like nobody's using unit swap like well no look at the data like yeah there's a lot of people using it and so if the market is adopting something i think you've got to pay attention and that'll only continue yeah i have to add to basically i i like the idea that basically bitcoin is is like i call it like hard money because like you know it's it's practically there you know there's there's certain amount and it's just like uh i i never had this kind of like perspective uh before uh because there was some inflation uh and rewards uh related to it but now it it actually came census you you actually have some supply there and it it will not change and that that's like a big thing and and i think it's it's um it's it's quite fascinating i i kind of have an opinion that uh i would love not to see the the bitcoin as a protocol to expand too much in in features because that kind of like stability gives its uh like uh certainty and you know like the the crypto space we always have the volatility what what not and and when you're building open open source uh technology there's a lot of like community actions especially as open it is like indeed fight things are just it's crazy incredible speed how uh people are just iterating new things and it really reminds me like uh the linux ecosystem where you know you have just uh the distribution virtual versions after another after another in communities uh becoming like closer you know there and many of the products are actually quite similar you know we have uniform we have balancer and and so forth so they have similar uh uh properties and and of course like uh i think it's pretty amazing that you can create a product and community around it and uh tweak the product so that's pretty much part of the open source ecosystem of course i would like to see more innovation but in terms of like bitcoin uh i i definitely would like to see like feature updates you know kind of like that allows more possibilities but not maybe like uh touring complete in the sense that uh you can build anything so you you kind of like so you don't have the ethereum uh burden there where you know everything's open uh you need a lot of diligence to build let's say decentralized uh protocols and have to be super careful but for example i would definitely like to see uh for example stable coin uh on the uh bitcoin network so so the the protocol is expanded enough to have like very uh interesting base stuff that you could build there something like very very simple like stable coin or or for example like certain type of uh uh time-based uh bonds so i i definitely like to see some some innovation there but like not not too much because that's what what bitcoin is that's what makes it hard money because you there is less um kind of like a uh risk taking and all new technology is always additional risk and what happens like uh in in uh ethereum is it's very fast but there's also like uh there's also like this very big problem that we're facing now is that you know you always have to balance between security and and also balance between the the innovation and one of the things with with ave is that we try to ship uh very frequently and and very very production very uh code with with least issues and and it's it's very uh difficult because you know smart contracts are public everyone can see them so so practically when you have a team of of let's say 10 to 15 developers uh building something it's it's it's quite uh challenging and uh the thing is that if there is a big protocol that actually explodes you know into certain bug and that already happened in theory back in in in the dao uh ages you know it it's it poses a risk risk kind of for the whole ecosystem because you can't explain to why their audience like what happened and you know and and what we learned and continue but it always leaves a a is a kind of like a stain and also uh a bit of uh skepticism and that's like uh that's why like that also creates a bit of tribalism you know when something happens and people aren't like very aware what what what was going on and so forth but yeah i i think innovation is what drives everything so uh it doesn't mean that bitcoin has to be very like uh touring complete but you know i would like to see some the innovative stuff there related to hard assets hard money and so forth so is that right if i'm am i am i hearing that that eat this money is that what i'm hearing at the end uh i haven't decided yet honestly like i i it's it's a different battle because like you know money is also kind of like you know payment money right so you know if i get eat and it's let's say like 1 000 today and tomorrow it's 2000 it's it's pretty cool but you know the the fluctuation there it makes very difficult to actually like you know use it in terms of payments so yeah i was just kidding so uh we got we got about 10 or so minutes i think we'll give us enough time for maybe one or two more questions um i think one thing i kind of want to ask is um how do you kind of see uh regulation come into play here uh like we've obviously this has been a pretty big thing for for bitcoin where we've seen uh this uh get uh sort of blamed for illegal activities or some solicited things and then probably been uh very kind of vocal about what the alternative has been until then but uh do we kind of fear uh once all financial primitives are also now accessible and global uh this will kind of perpetuate and or just not even the the bad side of it but for this to exist and actually scale to multiple uh millions of people we need to actually comply with the existing laws and sort of sort of go back to a system that we already are trying to replace um how do you kind of see that on the regulatory side uh kind of i'll prompt each i think i already kind of gave that prompt to anthony but maybe uh for astani ave also got an e-banking license recently what does it mean for a d5 protocol to have a banking license like let's just kind of contrast those thoughts here yeah so we don't have a banking license we have a electronic money license uh in the uk that we've received this year after a couple of years of work but what's interesting there is that uh ave is kind of very interesting as a you know project because we we as a team as a community we contribute building into the the kind of like banking backend so the decentralized protocols so we have the other protocol upcoming features uh new product offerings and so forth that are completely decentralized well complete that's a that's a that's a very difficult word everywhere but uh practically community governed uh protocols and products and what's interesting uh on top of that is that we're trying to create actually uh business models uh on top of that those decentralized uh back ends so we're trying to actually uh also on the front end compete with the uh so-called neobanks so we we kind of like want to get more adoption by allowing users to mainstream to to uh buy uh cryptographic stable coins other assets uh as well and and then deposit into the decentralized protocols so obviously like the front ends uh it's it's a it's a actual like a business model and what's what's there is that uh there's regulation uh involved our goal is kind of to have a you know end-to-end pipeline from from from a user that never actually has used the efi or even uh on my own bitcoin at any part of the line or ethereum and just being able to actually get all the way access to the decentralized uh protocols and that's the kind of like a uh interesting part but the actual back-end is is accessible by anyone and there's now like 60 different access points into uh in into the other protocol so that's the kind of like a goal but i would say uh in overall data regulation uh stuff uh i would say you can't regulate things like bitcoin uh or ethereum or or decentralized like real defy and and i see from my perspective that uh bitcoin is bitcoin is actually d5 so so it's it's practically a a a financial platform well financial network where you can make uh payment transactions ethereum is the same but it has this uh uh kind of like a uh operability that you can create many different things and ethereum is is also a financial network and it has inflation and uh staking and rewards so and and what spelled the d5 now on top of ethereum it's got kind of like continuation but on the second uh layer there on ethereum network layer uh kind of like a financial network and i think those networks is very difficult to regulate and as a regulator i will not even try to regulate them i would be more interested in regulating the the uh access points that are actually taking custody of user funds you know converting them into stable coins bitcoin ethereum and and providing access points into uh dfi so those are the the points so let's say if you have a a cryptocurrency exchange you might have to have a money transmitter uh electronic money license if you are doing custody you might have to be a qualified custodian and and so forth so i think you can't regulate stuff if if you want as a regulator uh where where you take custody but where things are already programmed where the regulation self enforcement is already programmed which is practically in bitcoin that if you send a transaction you can't send the same transaction to five different places with the same the exact same amount or like in always for example if you uh if you withdraw your fonts if you try your fonts and that they're in your custody and uh the protocol our protocol doesn't take custody those and the interest rates those are all programmed there they practically so it doesn't make sense even to to to regulate uh in my opinion those things you can't regulate the things where they the kind of like misfortunes can happen where people are actually taking possession of your wealth those can be regulated as as they have been but that that will be legacy finance like once people are getting more onboarded to this ecosystem absolutely i'll let you into the comments as well and then i'll ask a final question yeah i i think from a regulation standpoint uh technology usually pushes regulation right and so it is the classic example of uh technologists create innovation uh regulators have to catch up technologies create more innovation regulators have to catch up and so i don't know necessarily if there will be no regulations that feels like that might be a little uh too egregious and kind of too far out on the spectrum the better question is just like what regulation will there be um and there's also a difference between regulation in terms of like what are the rules and enforcement what can we do if you break the rules um and and so i think that you know that there's two schools of thought here one is that the protocols and the decentralization will prevent regulation there's a counter argument to that which is actually the fact that by creating this like automated finance world regulation is actually more effective and so i'll give you a quick example you know let's take a security uh regulation where stanley and i uh let's say stani is an accredited investor i am not uh stani wants to sell me some stock that he has and it is done in a reg d placement and it would be illegal for him to sell to a non-accredited investor well there's an argument that says in the legacy world if he sold me that stock and the sec or some other regulatory body found out they'd have to spend you know a lot of time a lot of effort and a lot of money to basically figure out what we did build the case go to court and then enforce that kind of law on us well in a automated world if all of a sudden the regulations are written into the code they can quickly identify via his wallet as the transaction is uh kind of being sent okay this is an accredited investor in this jurisdiction that holds this asset that they bought from this issuer on this date under this regulatory kind of cover who's now trying to sell it to this investor in this jurisdiction that's not accredited whatever this is a non-compliant trade and therefore like we are going to reject it and so i don't think we quite yet know the answers like that promise of almost like code is law and uh and regulate regulators are going to be comfortable with that uh that sounds great in theory i would love that world frankly in terms of like that would be a a pretty efficient world uh and would really help everyone it also just feels like that would take a pretty big leap for regulators from where we sit today so it might just be further out on the timeline but i do think that um when you get into this world of uh kind of automated and decentralized finance you're not gonna see no rules it's just a question of what are the rules going to be how global are they like do we come up with one set of global rules or do we still have kind of country by country regulatory bodies and then how are they enforced and i'm much more interested in the enforcement than kind of what the rules are because the enforcement is the part that actually matters right the the joke i always tell people is like jade walking is illegal it doesn't really stop that many people from walking across the middle of the street in the city right they still do it uh yes it is illegal there's just no enforcement and so i think that's where we've got to kind of understand is like kind of how is the enforcement done uh how effective is it and what is the kind of burden going to be on the development community as they build this stuff because that's ultimately what matters is enforcement not so much the rules absolutely um no this is a really good distinction between enforcement and uh regulation so um i want to wrap this up and i'll kind of put both of you on the spot and we'll kind of keep it slightly open-ended but i want to kind of just wrap this talk by saying uh uh by getting a prediction about 2021 from each of you uh you can uh kind of cover the i'll keep the theme on what do you predict for the world of decentralized finance at this year and you can kind of talk about anywhere from hitting certain metrics to any crazy thing you'd like to see that hasn't happened yet but we'll just get one answer from each of you and uh we'll close this chat so maybe with stunning pump do you wanna well i can i can i would say that uh one uh one significant bank will uh will deposit into decentralized finance that's my prediction for 2021. i'll go with uh things in motion tend to stay in motion so it's kind of the acceleration of most of what is already happening uh we'll just get bigger go further uh have more participants um i think that we're kind of at a momentum and a tailwind that will be very hard to reverse so just things that are in motion will stay in motion and kind of be better in the future than they are today great so with that i want to thank both of you for giving us your time today um we'll we'll kind of keep you updated anthony on what comes out of this event and hopefully you get to try a few more uh decentralized apps on on ethereum so uh thanks again and now we'll move on to the rest of the event um where i'll be covering the logistics around the hackathon thanks for having me guys thank you cheers so those of you who are still with us on the live stream i got about 15 more minutes worth of uh kind of quick things i want to cover uh and that's uh just going to be on how the heck is going to work the next three weeks i'll kind of go into uh this uh quickly where um we're just going to cover some highlights a lot of this has been already communicated with you over email but it doesn't hurt to uh write this down here as well the most important thing is is just uh on communication piece everything is going to be on discord uh which means that if you are a state tackler uh you get to connect your discord and we'll give you the permissions automatically to all the private channels for this event that's where you get to see all the 450 other people that are participating with you and you get to interact with them and are in the rest of the sponsors and the mentors and we also have dedicated channels for getting help uh whether that's about a company and using their protocol their sdk and kind of being unblocked on that to just general help around a web through development or front end or design so you get to use those channels and post those questions anywhere everything is going to be asynchronous in 24 7 so we'll be able to get back to you because somebody will be online at any given time on top of all of that we're also sending calendar invites to all of you for the key events whether that's this talk today to some of the workshops that we're hosting next week uh the the entire event schedule is also available on our website by going over to mm.egl and we also want this thing to be a synchronous so because we have so many different time zones that all of you are participating from you can uh tune into a talk if you are in that time zone and this works for you but if not the video will be available on youtube almost immediately after the talk ends and you can just catch up on uh the content uh at your own pace all the things that we're going to be using for projects in your check-ins and your submissions is going to be from your dashboard and you can access uh access your dashboard by going over to hack.global.com marketmake this is uh you're going to be your destination for giving serious updates uh figuring out who your team members are and assigning them to you to indicating which prizes you are going to be eligible for uh and in all of the judging process so some quick things about how the hackathon is structured and how it's going to work essentially the hackathon begins now which means starting today and for the next three weeks you can code on your projects and uh for those of you who are working on their projects with the team you can work with up to five members uh on a given project you you've about three weeks to summit your project and the way we uh kind of think about this thing is that all in terms of keeping everything fair for all the other participants almost all work that you're doing uh will uh should be done uh over the course of the three three weeks that means you are definitely open and then it's okay to use any existing open source libraries to make your lives easier but if you're working on a project or you're continuing to work on a project that you started before today uh you must disclose that and message us uh whether on discord or email so we can ensure that it is within the guidelines and rules for keeping this event fair to all hackers in terms of what it means to qualify to be eligible for prices uh this is a if they're a specific event and we would uh consider you as a finalist and a and eligible for a price if you are building on top of the theory and obviously there's obviously a lot of nuances in all of these so if you think you have any questions that have not been answered in our info center or on discord you can always message us or email us as the global team and we'll be happy to clarify this for you a quick note about check-ins so a lot of you uh had questions about check-ins and wanted to address them here what is a check-in a check-in is essentially an opportunity where we get to get an update on how things are going for your project this is a multi-week event and we don't have any expectations on how many hours you should put into uh your project that that is up to you to determine and work on your own pace and the way we sort of handle that and make sure that you're not blocked is by ensuring that once a week you just get to message us asynchronously on on discord and tell us what you have done uh since we last chatted uh this lets us sort of understand kind of what you're working on anything from being able to connect you to sponsors who are abstracting some of these things that you're doing to if you are blocked on anything technical or design related things we get to help connect you and get the help you need to go back to building and getting your prototype working uh your stake is returned if you respond to the check-ins and some of your project and all this happens on your dashboard so you just get to fill out a quick form and we give you the thing to paste on discord and that's the check-in as long as you do that within uh within 24 hours of every week during the checking days this works out really well for for everything and keeps the event experience really good for all participants the general kind of guiding principle we have for all of you is that this is kind of how we think you should divide up your idea which is the first week which is the next seven days uh you can allocate towards thinking about what you want to build and maybe collecting the team and uh and working on what the idea will be in the second week you get to use uh to build a basic mvp so you can prove that everything works everything is is good to go whether that's on the contract side or just a very basic version of it and then week three you use for polishing everything that you want to do and that includes making it look nice and easy to use to doing all the nice abstractions that you initially thought of and then also preparing for the submission which requires you to submit a video i want to really kind of quickly go into the prizes uh that are available to all of you as hackers and we'll kind of have all the access points out of what you can do to uh to get all the details on each of these prices the first thing is is ave this is a event sponsored by office of a lot of cool things for anybody who's uh building an ave and what we're doing is i'll be listing the prizes but i also have a video i'd like to show uh that uh that came from the ave team and they'll be able to cover uh who they are what they would like you to see what would they like you to build on and everything you can win so i'll have our team share that video now hey everyone we're really excited to see what you build on other in this hackathon so i'll just quickly go over the prices that we're offering so one of the prices linked uh offering is the most impactful award price so there's two prices uh of four thousand uh ausdc each so what most impactful means is it must uh it's most impactful to rv as a protocol so that could be include things like increasing the tvo of rv as you see in this graph but also it could be social impact or for the consumers or the users of rv so whatever impacts the rv uh protocol uh the most is is what will be valid for this price or these prices the next price is best integration of flash loans hopefully everyone understands a bit of what flashlights are in v2 we also have batch flash loans and also debt incurring flash loans so for this we're offering two prizes of one and a half thousand ausdc each we also have a best integration prize for credit delegation uh so credit delegation is it separates uh the act of depositing to borrowing and we have two prices of 1 500 a usdc each we also have a price for best integration of v2 governance so our we're really proud of our v2 governance contracts and how it works there's a lot of different features uh that you can make use of uh so we're offering two prizes of 1500 a usdc and also finally we have the event engineers award so this is a very special award uh that is 3000 ausdc for for for one team or one project and this will be judged uh specifically by the protocol core engineers themselves so that's quite a special price so if you're still looking for ideas uh don't forget to use use the notion link that these global guys have given you but then also we have our own uh rfps or requests for projects uh ideas here on our hack documents so jump on that link and have a look and also uh discuss your ideas with us in the discord as well whenever you want all right have fun and good luck everyone amazing well uh thank you so much uh ave for that a great summary of that video uh i'll kind of put the the actual prizes here on the slide as well even though all this will be available to you on on your dashboards and on our info center so click on summary there's twenty thousand dollars in prices directly uh for all of these categories which is the most impactful project the best integrations of flash loan the best integration of the credit delegation and uh v2 governance and then and now they have engineer award i would like to play on words um for the best hack in that category uh on top of all that any person or any any team that is building on top of ave will be eligible for a 108 usdc for their team and that actually is uh 100 usdc plus the interest one month on top of it so i kind of encourage all of you to uh really play around and use the other protocol in your hacks uh this is uh this is a great win-win for for all teams and the developers get to really play with what's possible and we have a team really gets to learn about what the interesting use cases are for for their protocol next up we have one inch exchange i'm sure all of you know what one of these exchanges and we're all super proud to to announce that this was a project that came out of new york in 2019 and uh with one inch we'll have surgery talk about uh what one inch is going to be doing for this event and the price is on your end hi everyone my name is sergey i'm co-founder of one inch one inch is a leading deck aggregator nowadays also liquidity protocol we are a hackathon team we are fast moving and mission driven most of our guys were hackers from uh several hackathons uh participated in the multiple gh global hackathons and uh we were born on egh new york uh 2019 and uh from hackathon to the leading dex aggregator uh with futures experience from several it is global hackathons we achieved around 11 billions of total volume and we we are funded by famous vcs uh with around 14 millions of dollars and this is a good example for you guys uh how you can just start with a hackathon project and achieve really really really great goals and build your project yeah so our bounties the first point is to create a leveraged position on ave using flash loan and one inch swap we offer three thousand dollars in one inch tokens um example could be uh create a three x uh leveraged position on eth or usdc along convert using user 1000 usdc into 3000 dollars of eth collateral and 2000 to usdc that and here's a small uh workflow how you can build that uh by get 2k uh use this in flashlight convert it to eth using one inch api uh put 3k usdc as collateral to ava borrow 2k usdc from rv repair flash one with 2k uh usdc a second price is uh our liquidation protection board also 3k and us dollars in one ish tokens so track costs of collateral and that using channing when the p l reaching user defined boundaries stop loss and take profit can be assembled in single transaction get flashlight equal to adapt repair use adapt swap user collateral uh to that using one inch api and repair flash loan um the third and fourth one is um create long and short funds for one inch token using uma protocol uh 1000 bucks in one inch tokens and open track so surprise us we are happy to review any invention you can build in the next time uh you can find our channels here we are on twitter we are on telegram discord and also take a look to our github repository so you see the uh we offer um bounties with a combination of other sponsors so we see the opportunity to build something useful really useful by combining uh our money legos one inch exchange one inch api and swaps with our channeling and uma as well so um happy building don't sleep work deliver and we are happy to review your uh your projects amazing thanks uh thanks so much sergey for uh all those kind prizes and uh the advice so um i'll kind of repeat some of the prizes again for for all of our sponsors but in summary there's eight thousand dollars worth of prizes uh being offered by one inch and then we also have five thousand dollars in link tokens by chain link uh 750 dollars from ens for best use of bns integration in the project we have five thousand dollars in usd team from uh matic uh then we have uh three thousand dollars from from uma and uh two hundred two thousand dollars and died from the graph for integrating the graph we also have four thousand ghost uh tokens from avegachi and all these details are available on the market make uh website and you can head over there by going to mn.edu global.com and you can also access this link and see all the prizes on discord and your dashboard also i mean we've talked about the team and how check-ins work but there's still a lot of you who are still in the position of figuring out what they would like to work on or they are looking for members on their team to to join or they would like to join the team uh we just kicked off the event today so there's still a lot of opportunities to make this happen if you are on discord you can head over to find a team channel and you get to talk to uh to the people that are in a similar position as you and you can find opportunities to uh to work with somebody if you have any complimentary skill sets or you have an idea and you need help on specific things that you'd like somebody to fill in on top of all that we also encourage you to introduce yourself uh in the ether eat the market make intros there's over 450 of you at the event and on top of them we have all of our sponsors and mentors and our speakers and our judges so this is a big uh big event and we encourage all of you to talk uh with each other and get to know everybody throughout the next few weeks and also if you're still looking for an idea you get to talk about uh your ideas or look at other ideas that you would like to work on by heading over to hack ideas channel you also have a list of ideas that we think you can easily pick up and build on and that includes ideas from our sponsors ideas from previous events and ideas that we personally would like to see source from the community and of course if if you don't have a team it's totally okay it's not entirely required for you to have a team it's absolutely fine if you'd like to work by yourself and and on your own as an individual uh it's just easier to uh to get a lot more done if you have somebody uh sharing the work so uh not the end of the world if you do not have a team we also have a lot of talks and workshops all of them can be found on the website so there's a lot of workshops and technical talks for beginners you can learn anywhere from how to use certain protocols to how to get started on web3 development and we also have a lot of talks and panels and emails from some of our sponsors where you get to ask them questions and do office hours with them all that information is again available on the info center but you can always head over to the event website and see the entire schedule for the next few weeks on on our website at mm.eglobal.com the last thing i want to kind of touch on is submissions submissions are due on sunday february 7th at 11 59 a.m eastern so around noon eastern time on sunday this is three weeks from now and we'll be reminding you about the next steps needed and how judging is going to work uh throughout your dashboard and on discord in this time but the thing i'd like to remind everybody here is submissions are going to be a four minute video uh that will will have you submit that summarizes your hack this is where you get to talk about who you are what you've built and show us a demo of your project and we'll also be sharing some examples on how to kind of structure these videos to any slides you can use to make your lives easier and one thing we'd like to kind of really highlight here is not do this thing last minute because this is the final encapsulation of all the work uh you put in to your projects for the last three weeks and you really want to make sure that you get to talk about all the interesting and the cool things that one should focus on as we will use these videos to do the judging so make sure you give at least a day uh for this video and we'll be able to do a lot of feedback sessions for your hackathon project and also give you comments on how you can make it easy for everybody to understand what you're doing and lastly i want to just remind everybody of the code of conduct all of you have already seen and reviewed our rules for this event this kind of talks about just the general code of contact um you can check this out on each global dot co slash rules we talk about what it means for you being able to fully retain the intellectual property of your projects and in how we want to make sure that this is a comfortable environment for all the participants so i'm gonna remind all of you again to be respectful and harassment and abuse are never tolerated and if you if you think something is uh is not up to par uh please don't hesitate to reach out to anybody on the global team and we'll be able to take action immediately in general even code of chronic aside if you need any help we're all available on discord and over email so don't hesitate to reach out to anybody on the global team and lastly we want you to make sure that this is uh not exhausting for you uh the reason this is designed to be multi a week event is because we know that uh you have other things uh whether that's work other projects or school going on in the same time and we wanna make this as spread out as possible so that you get to focus on building something uh because you want to and because it's fun so don't stress too much about it don't don't try to just building over sleeping i want you to have fun i want you to learn uh throughout this process and uh this is very much about learning as much as it is about doing and working on a project and uh and uh i really want this to be an opportunity for all of you to uh to play with what's possible on web3 so with that i want to thank all of you for being with us today
