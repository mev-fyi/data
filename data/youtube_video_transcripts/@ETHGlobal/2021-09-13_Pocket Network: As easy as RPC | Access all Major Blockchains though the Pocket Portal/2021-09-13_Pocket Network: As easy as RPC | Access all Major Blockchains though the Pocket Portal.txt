all right well thank you for everyone for uh joining us today um this afternoon or evening or morning depending on where you guys are in the world um we are here with enrique um i'll let him take a second to introduce himself with pocket um if you guys want put questions in the chat we will be doing q a after the presentation um and we will leave some time for that but i will i'll let him take it away from here enrique thank you so much for being with us i'm really looking forward to this one awesome i'm really excited to be here with you guys and being able to do this presentation so let's just get on with it so hi everybody my name is enrique and i've come to you to talk about pocket and we're gonna find out what pocket is what you can use it for and we're going to see some cool stuff with it as well but for now let's get on with it i've had the socials here uh if you want to reach out on twitter but of course this presentation and everything else will be available after and recording the stream for you guys now let's start first of all hi so again my name is enrique i come from the dominican republic that's in the caribbean if you guys didn't know and i do javascript stuff at pocket um it's usually front and stuff but i'm a bit of a jack of all trades so front end i've done smart contract work before sucker ups backhand i just like with three i do basically everything the list goes on and if you've seen my face before somewhere we probably met during my time at argon one where i did stuff with douse and yeah that was really cool as well but now with the team at pocket and i'm really excited to tell you about actually the centralized infrastructure which is really important for blockchain projects now let's get on with it we're going to be seeing this three things what is pocket network we're going to see an overview of the protocol which is really important and also integrating with the pocket portal we're going to find out about that later for now let's see guys let's face it we need people to run nodes we cannot rely only on centralized infrastructure providers we usually um a lot of people think that indexing will solve this problem and the reality is that you need to get your data from somewhere right from somewhere that data needs to come and it comes from a node there's no getting around that you can only you of course can put an intermediate step you can surf through a relational database or just index the whole thing and then create an api through it like the graph guys uh do which is pretty amazing but the reality is we need people to run notes to actually decentralize the network we're doing an okay job but we can do better now what's the problem running notes is expensive and getting more expensive by the day we see we have feed charts here and if you think about it you can actually see that the sync times get longer because the chain gets larger no getting around that but it's giant like the chain's pretty giant and even though we're getting better and better and more um and more optimized nodes we are still running into the problem that it takes a long time and unless you're a validator you're probably not getting any rewards for it so it's kind of an altruist task to run notes so as a community we need to push for our infrastructure to be as decentralized as possible so we're actually unstoppable now there's got to be a better way and this is where pocket network actually comes in so right that's a lot of talk right we need people to run notes how do we incentivize them to run nodes so this is what pocket network is all about pocket network is a protocol that incentivizes people to run full nodes through cryptoeconomic incentives that's all it does it simply asks people to run full nodes from any blockchain or any publicly verifiable database if what you wanted at that but more on that later let's focus on the node part right that is the important part now this implies a few things you as a developer can connect to any blockchain through the pocket network of course a chain that is supported on the protocol we've got like 13 chains going right now and more common on the way now also as a note brother this is very important to you it means that you can actually start in revenue from your nodes through the network just by opening up your nodes spinning up one or a few pocket notes and just getting into the network and driving traffic it's actually profitable already today and we've got quite a few highlights to show you so first of all we got more than 5000 validators from more than 100 independent uh node runners this means that we're truly and progressively decentralizing we if amazon goes down we're not going to go down we have node runners at home that run their own notes in hardware and the funny thing is these node runners these home node runners tend to have the best service in the network because they're so incentivized to earn pocket that they use optimize their setups to earn more rewards it's pretty crazy but it actually works we've done 250 million release just in the past week that's a lot of relays when i mean release i mean requests right when you use an app let's say earning five my crypto you're actually driving really through the network because they use this in production there are a few apps that already trust us and i have dreaming a lot of relays in the network we've got earning five my crypto one hive dark forest and the one crazy thing is that if you for example play dark forest in the last round or or you have used any of the services uh in one hive you probably have already used this and you haven't noticed and also for example the scaffolding eth the tool by austin griffith we're actually the double meaning provider so yeah it's very possible that if you're a developer you already use this now let's go and see the protocol overview because that sounds very cool but let's have a breakdown and see how it works right now if we're pocket network it seems like it's a lot of stuff but we've got two walkthroughs involved we got developers and we got no runners that's the simple part now there's a bridge between these two right there's something that connects them together that's the network itself and of course they're paired through sessions but now let's see all the all the individual parts let's call them three developers or applications sessions and node runners applications can acquire the native token of the network that's pocket pokt it's thicker and stake it for the selected chain or chains that they want to connect to now they can for connecting to the actual network they can use their javascript sdk for if they're opting for the free tier with offer um you can use an endpoint provided soon through the pocket portal now more on the pocket portal later we'll have some fun with it now as this application sent released to the network they're connected each session think about it a session think about it as a just like a session where you're connected to five different random notes in the network of course these notes are driving traffic for the specific chain you want right now this session is the mechanism which allows these nodes to recycle and replace the chat each hour it also lets the node runners generate they're basically the really badge which they will then send to the chain to earn pocket further work no runners receive the relays through their pocket notes right and then from their pocket notes they go to their data notes let's say they go to the ethereum full node that they're running they then serve the relay from the node and fulfill the request of the application and of course they earn pocket in the process and let's find out a little bit more about the mechanism for absent notes to connect together that's sessions there's stateless and deterministic there's no magic here as soon as you do a relay you get connected to a session you get assigned five different notes they last an hour serving release to you and then after that hour that new session is created the old one is deleted and of course then the relay batch that is created is then sent to the network to be validated included into the next block and then the rewards are claimed by the node runners so that's really interesting um now let's talk a little bit more about how the network actually works right because there's a little um interesting mechanism but there's more to it let's dig into the finality layer of the network we use standard main condensed consensus we're a big chain right so this thing works but we're using 10 number concession consensus with here proof of stake there's no unchanged delegation we want that to avoid centralization we want the network to be as decentralized as possible so we can actually scale we use uh the secret sauce from all about this to make a pocket network actually fast and reliable is the fact that we're using serial knowledge range proofs and merkle sum tree in index trees to validate relays in a batch right and then the distribution is 89 of the block reward is distributed to the to the actual nodes that fulfill those release right the nodes that receive the requests then one percent to the validators that included all the transactions in the network and 10 to the val now the down part is interesting because it means that um the network itself that is governed both by applications and the runners can then decide how to use this revenue to then further uh optimize the growth of the network so it means that there is governance in the chain it's unchained governance we've got a very linked governance process and you can join the dao by joining our discord and going through a pocket arcade you can join the screen see what's all about that today we're not not we're not going to look at that but of course you want to find out more about the economics and everything related to that you can also see your white paper that is in our um you know website and also just dig deep into the pocket portal and use us and see what it's all about you can also then spin up epic node we've got that on github it's all open source and our whole team will be waiting for you in this group to answer any questions we've got a very healthy note runner community that has grown organically by the day and they're always answering questions for the newbies so no we're not gatekeepers here at all we want you to run notes we want people to run their own notes at home a lot of us run our own notes and we are having fun with it we send we do fulfill relays and we do get usage it's pretty great actually once you realize what pocket's all about but now sure how do i as a developer right integrate with pocket network there are two ways first of all the maximally centralized way you can use pocket.js directly to integrate your app and send all the release through it of course that's a very involved integration method we're trying to make it better and it's the best option to actually make your applications decentralized and everyone should consider that option because it will make your app pretty much fully unstoppable now there's an easier method that we want to show off today that evolves using this thing called the portal that i've already mentioned quite a few times right so that option answers using portal you get an endpoint from there and when i mean an endpoint is exactly the same type of endpoint that if you will give you right you get that and then simply you connect your application with that endpoint and you're using pocket easy as that now let's look at the pocket portal right so that fancy named application is used in api gateway that's all it is it lets you connect to the network through an endpoint right of course uh there's some more things uh in there right it's not as decentralized we do try to keep a lot of up time right to fulfill all the services um we need to give and actually all the applications that use us right now most of the applications that use us are going through the portal because they get some added benefits to it as well that we're gonna see in a little while now why then use the portal because it's easy it's convenient and you're actually using a decentralized infrastructure provider and you're helping the network grow right basically it's just a cc a few clicks and you can mint a reliable censorship resistant rpc endpoint powered by the centralized infrastructure right now the interesting part is that we're internet so that means that your application is actually running in the pocket network it's getting state and you're actually using it you're driving release to the network you're contributing to the growth of the network just by using us so of course that means that if you have an app that is getting a lot of traffic right you can put us put that endpoint in your rotation and simply use it and you'll get good service you get good quality service and you'll you will be helping pocket network ground easy as that now of course we've got a few benefits as well uh a lot of you know it's it can be cumbersome to get infrastructure for your applications uh once it grows pocket it's a little bit easier we've got no arbitrary rate limiting there are no contracts no lockings no hidden fees everything's in the networks in the network you can read the economics to then actually realize how you can turn that infrastructure you get into an asset which is really great and yes of course we do have a free option we'll talk more about that and actually test it out right so we support a few networks ethereum of course we support it all of the test nets mainnet we got maintenance support for archival with tracing that means archival retracing basically means that you've got some added functionality to be able to sync success for example a lot of people use use this actually they sync their the grass subgraphs locally with a pocket endpoint and it works perfectly so then if you think about it you can you can for example who's your app in flick right ipfs then the for connecting to the network sure spin up at the graph node getting into the network you know use their network and sure but now these providers that will host the graph endpoint can then use a pocket network endpoint to actually sync their subdraft and guess what that's maximum decentralization baby just as easy as that and you just need an endpoint so that's really cool we also support other chains like polygon of course uh xdi we recently launched that and we we've been embedded for a little while but it's getting some real usage um if you play dark forest again you probably used us and it worked smoothly and for anyone that ran into problems we were there we were there helping out so yeah and also we support bc made it with archival avalanche fees and other blockchains that we're working on right the list is growing by the week and things are just getting better even the service is just getting better each day but we suppose tonight we we do support those networks now let's talk about the portal highlights and the free tier right so the free tier is i think it's really nice actually it's a million release a day right so if you think about it that's around 42 000 relays per hour that's a lot so you will probably not run into problems using the free tier for a long while when you do though you can just contact us and we'll be in touch with you and see what we can do to keep you using pocket and giving you more bandwidth right you have 10 plus change to pick from we already saw which uh chains uh there are you have up to two endpoints per account and of course all that can be fixed through deals that we can make with you guys you have then anyone you can keep track of your endpoint at all times right you can see the success street uh you can see the requests made you've made you can see the average latency you're facing through the node through the through the endpoint and we've got email notifications built in and we're improving the system every day so you get another also other types of notifications but basically you don't only get to use the network if you use the portal you actually get an actual ui which we can use to track your usage and of course this is not everything we've got some previously stuff that we're gonna see once we get into the portal so let's jump into it so now we're just gonna jump here to the network overview can you guys see this yes we can see it amazing great so we're here in the portal right um we've got a few things we can look at of course already logged in you can for example um come here and either sign in or just create an account here i'm not going to go through that we want to see the actual usage of the network so we're going to go to the portal straight away but you can create an account very easy really quickly and we'll be integrating things such as get unlocked in real soon and by the way i want to mention this is really privacy focused we're not tracking any of your data that's uh that can fingerprint you we do have some little analytics used to see page clips and whatnot but we're keeping track of your data with self-host on things and we basically keep your privacy safe so this product is not only to help the network we do keep you safe in the process but let's go here here's the network overview we get the total amount of release we've done uh in the past week right um right now we're getting a little some little uh slow speed issues with the time series database uh we're using so things may load slowly for now we've we've been getting hammered with music so we're working through it but it's a good thing but as you can see you get all the total relays you've done in the past seven i mean the network has done in the past seven days the success rate which is looking pretty great right now at 99 percent you can actually see the amount of uh relays straight we can see we have a network summary of apps states nodes states and pocket state right if you want to read more about economics you can click here and as you can see you can get to know the economics here and of course you can also read the white paper if you go to our website but now this is really interesting thing here's all the available networks that are in the network not necessarily in the portal but these are running through the network right now and getting released so as you can see we have a lot of products and chains we got of course our network pocket network mainnet archival uh ethereum archival magnet roadster and ring kb and all that yes right we've got a few in beta we for example very recently we just whitelisted celina so that's moving up to production real soon but it's live in our network and we got a few others but we want to see some ethereum stuff right so let's jump into it i'm going to show you one very interesting endpoint we're going to look at it's a public endpoint so we're going to have what we're going to have to watch out a bit about a few things but this is an actual being using production live endpoint that we're going to look at right now that is theater.js mainnet load balance endpoint now let's work through the whole screen the first of all the first thing you see is the name why is it called load balance what does that mean so if you think about it it is a public endpoint right so that means that you they probably want more bandwidth so we're doing some really cool things uh with the composibility that the ch that the network has with applications we're actually packaging a bunch of applications and each of them have an amount of release per day basically they have multiple apps running right so if we're out there getting five different nodes let's say they have around 10 apps right that means that for each application they get five nodes if they have 10 apps that means they get 50 random nodes serving relays that means that they're getting decentralized data from 50 different nodes that's pretty crazy because if you think about it those applications depend on one endpoint or just one node and if that goes down they have a problem here one uh five nodes can get down ten nodes can go down and there will be no problem they'll be getting their good data now as you can see we have the endpoint here you can click here to copy it you get a nice animation um real pretty i really like it but basically this endpoint is composed of a few things right you can see the the network right here then gateway.pocket.network and then the api path and this here at the end is your gateway id which you also have available over here right this is very important because it means that for example you can hot swap endpoints if i use changing that id we'll see how to do that later of course you can see the success rate as this is a public endpoint a lot of calls can fail right if you're testing for example a contract and you do about call that of course will hit that success rate but it doesn't mean that they're getting bad service they're actually getting really good service this is really helped it helpful to see if you're actually doing something wrong in your code and we can see the total requests they've done recently right you've got this average latency that of course can be a little bit higher depending on what call you're doing a lot of people that use either.js are doing very expensive operations such as ethot get locks which is a very heavy operation if you didn't know a lot of uh infrastructure provided they limit this call because it's very heavy unknowns but of course we've got flexible limits for that but of course as you can see the ladies is around 300 to 400 milliseconds it can be lower than that or it can be around that but we ourselves don't introduce as much latency as you may think and we are still have pretty good service even though you go through a few hoops to get your data you can see stuff like current usage they've got 99 of their endpoint used right now we can see the weekly usage with a nice graph that shows you um the amount of release they've been doing and the limit and if they're going over the limit i found that really cool and yeah uh this is really cool as well you can see the latest requests they've done this is really useful for debugging um at least i find it really useful because i tend to mess around with ethereum a lot i for example really like nfts so i tend to do some funny things with them and so if a call's failing i want to know which call it is right and i and i can see them all here i can see the result and the time lapse as you can see all of these calls can take very little time or depending if it's a call that it is more heavy depending if your call and contract it can last a little a bit more but it's still fine now of course uh we get more things we get the app status right it's staked it's doing good this is the amount of pocket that they they have staked in total this is provided for free as this as a community endpoint and the max amount of release they have per day now we of course go click more details and we get some very nifty stuff again apologies for the loading we're fixing that right now but basically here you can dig even deeper into how your endpoint is actually working you get the amount of total requests and successful and failed failed requests and of course once this loads you can actually filter through them here and actually see what's going wrong which is really nice but now of course that's the basic screen but we got more right so let's see you as an application developer you want to do some uh some more stuff right and let's say that you have to protect your endpoint right this is gonna be endpoint no need to be protected but you wanna close it off you want to let's say for example uh you want to only uh make it accessible through your website so people don't steal the infra and in crypto this happens a little bit too much so we can just go to app security here and then uh change things here you can see that you can require a private secret key that will get shown only when this is on and then you can also use this very nice thing this is uh you can you can add white listed origins and user agents for this this this means that you can for example if you only want to serve it through your website let's say you can put here super cool crypto app dot build that's your um that's your uh domain you can put that in there edit and then save the changes of course you can do the same with the user agents basically you can change each of this stuff and get as much security as you need or one for your endpoint easy as that now let's go back and of course i talked about notifications so let's go to notifications here you've got some some nice things as you can see um uh you can see the weekly bandwidth usage this is really uh useful when you're actually setting you know setting your notification settings because um let's say for example that your endpoint gets used a lot um and so probably that means that you want to turn up your 100 75 right but let's say that um you don't get used that much right you don't uh you're not doing many relays so sure you can then just turn off the little alerts i just turn them all on because i like getting my alerts and if my pro project blows up overnight i don't like to know so i can contact the team and get more release right but again you can then um change all of this here save the changes and then go back now of course uh we're not gonna test this functionality right now but you can also switch chains that means that if i wanted to change all the chains from the from this endpoint i will be able to uh to do so and let's say for example change this endpoint from mainnet ethereum to polygon right or convert this into an archive an archival endpoint that's really nifty but now sure we've seen this but how do you make an endpoint my account has a lot of endpoints as i create a lot of them but let's go through that right now let's click here so if you can see you get a welcome screen and uh you get into the freeze here so we can call this app if online app right you can call it whatever you want you can even add emojis if that if that's your thing i really like emojis but we're not gonna do that here now of course as you can see you can select the network we've got a lot of them so i can for example go and search from ethereum right here just like turn it up right or i can delete that and just like flick through the list as i want right here i want to use a three-minute endpoint right i want to test it it's called ether line up if you want to configure your app security just go here and then of course you can see all of this and you can go back when you're ready to create your endpoint you can then just say launch application the endpoint will then get created something some things will load some things take time but once it loads you've got your screen right and as you can see it's loading the applications it's easy as easy as that to use an endpoint so now at the same point we're gonna use it as soon as it loads and i'm gonna show you some stuff that you need to know about the network real quick so yeah as you can see we've got the screen here that was just in time now i got my endpoint and as you can see my gateway id is quite different but i'm just going to copy this real quick i'm going to go to insomnia right here and i'm just going to put this here of course you know this works exactly as an inferior endpoint for example or an all gaming endpoint will work you can just swap them and you can use them in exactly the same way right now i'm going to send a request you'll notice something here the first request for each session can take a long time this means that you're getting connected to the network and getting in a session so basically you're getting different notes and all that jazz but now we're connected to the network and as a and as they said were released the data keeps coming back real fast now it slowly will get faster as time goes on and as you can see calls are just taking less time now but of course uh this gets better the more release we sent as the session gets saved into the network right but now as you can see i'm just getting my data back real nice of course it's in isn't json rpc format because i'm doing a direct call i do a lot of these to test my endpoints but if you want to use it in an application the only thing you need to do is in your endpoint uh string you can delete your old endpoint and put your your pocket endpoint and that's all and as you can see then uh once the app uh refreshes in in a little bit we're actually gonna see that we'll be getting the usage but going back to the endpoint as you can see this is how it looks when you get usage looks real nice then with with that that's the portal really you sign in or you sign up you create an endpoint and you start using it right away that's it of course then let's go back to the presentation and let's talk about things that everyone likes we've got 8 000 die in prices total of course because of the ubiquity that pocket network can be used we got um some some different types of uh prices right first one is the shared price full of four thousand die you can you can then earn an equal share of the price poll right you can use a pocket powered endpoint in your app it's just as easy as signing up right now and getting that endpoint so basically it means that if you're going to use any of the chains that we support you can use an endpoint from us and you're running for this price real easy of course if you want to go the extra mile we've got some more prices right first price we'll get uh 1250 die second 500 die second 200 the third uh 250 die so we got two prizes here first is the best hack that adds a pocket power rpc endpoint for any blockchain support right so it means the best application that we judge is the same pocket we got three places for that and then the most creative act incorporating both the pocket network endpoint and the graph we really want to see people composing different tools in the ecosystem that means that we want to see people using pocket not only with a front end right and connecting to leaders we want to see people using pocket with hard hit we want to see people using pocket with the graph right we want to see people driving release to the network and actually using these tools composing them together to then show people that you can have maximal decentralization and also an apps an app that works very well so we want to see your hacks for creating something with pocket network and the graph that's thousand dollars to die in prices as well and again first gets 1250 die second 500 die that 250 die so yeah um with that as you can see uh you can get hacking right away you know you can just follow the other ethernet presentations to get more ideas and get hacking with that i can leave you with some resources that i really will recommend you to read you can do you can read the docs right we then we here explain everything from the network and the applications that i just explained you can read more in detail of course you can go for the pocket portal through that link as well and you can actually use it get your endpoint right away we've got a demo if you need um a little more of a tutorial in youtube and you can also join our discord we will really love if you join our discord you can join the dial right away uh you just need to go through the pocket arcade and do some work for that but you can earn a vote and actually get in the governance of the network that is very important for us because as a decentralized infrastructure provider we want to see engaged users so come join the discord come chat with us uh if you need support we'll be there if you want to earn a vote in the dial and you're really excited about pocket you're welcome as well with that thank you very much this is my presentation and if you guys got questions let's go for them thank you so much enrique that was incredible i i'm such a fan um as he said if you guys any questions at all um please feel free to put them in the chat uh we'll take a few moments to do that i know we're a little bit over time but i want to give you guys an opportunity to ask questions while you're here um if if no one if no one has any questions we can't end the session um but as was mentioned if you want to follow up take the conversation at discord there are pretty knowledgeable people from the pocket team ready to answer all of your questions one sec let's see if we have any in the chat right now i think i don't know i think we might be good um which just means enrique did an incredible job explaining everything i hope one can only hope um no i think this was an incredible presentation i want to thank everybody for coming out today joining us this afternoon um and enrique thank you so much for walking us through all that this was a great presentation um really really excited to see where pocket goes next and as i said follow up with uh follow up with the team in discord and take the conversation offline and uh we look forward to seeing what everyone builds with uh with pocket i'm really excited as well for that really want to see what people build the pocket yeah right on all right we will be closing the stream here thank you to everyone for participating and we look forward to seeing you in our next presentation
