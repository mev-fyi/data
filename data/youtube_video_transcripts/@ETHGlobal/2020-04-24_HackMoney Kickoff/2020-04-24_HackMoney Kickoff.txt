you welcome everybody this is Karthik and we're just gonna wait a couple more minutes for a few more hackers to join in and we'll get started right after that you you you you you you you you you you you you you you hello everybody I am super excited to kick this off and welcome everybody here so a few what's our so joining the zoom call but as of right now we have about a hundred eighty people in the zoom chat and about a little over 50 that are just watching this live directly on YouTube and Twitter so there's over 200 people watching this live right now and I am excited to begin so I am Karthik I'm one of the cofounders of youth global you may know me from the 50 email sent to all of you in the last few days and it's my pleasure to welcome everybody here for hack money now I want to give some context into what made us start this event so we've been thinking about doing an online event since last November and we spent the last five months really trying to understand how online is different from in-person events especially events that are cater for developers and not only that how do you actually ensure that you can scale accordingly and scale up and make your reach broad from a developer standpoint without compromising on some key things that we think are essential into having a really good developer ecosystem so we've been doing a lot of the in-person events right now or as of until now and when we asked our attendees on what could have been done better the most common thing we hear is I wish I had more time and and it makes total sense if you are a hacker and you are doing this for a weekend two days there's obviously not enough to to learn something if you're if you're new but also makes something that you're not only just proud of but others can also use and on top of that you kind of want to sleep too so there's not a lot of hours for the things that you want to do and it works really well as a playground to experiment but we wanted to actually have a bridge to continuity on what happens after you come up with something over a weekend especially if you're just curious about so that's just kind of on on the hacker side obviously needing more time to build your project is a great thing but on top of all that often times you need a lot more support a lot more help from anywhere from mentors to other other people who can help you be unblocked from a technical standpoint or just people you would want to get feedback from what if you're interested in in making this ready for your friends or family to use or somebody else on the Internet to just play with it what current work what are some of these things you would rather ensure before it gets into the hands of general audience those things you don't really get to figure this out so well what we wanted to do was offer a way for us to play with that as an iterative and see if we can solve that in and offer this as an online event of course the recent events around the world did push us into making this decision faster so with all of that I am extremely excited to say that today is the official kickoff of hack money and I'm super excited to have all of you here listening to me from all these places of the world so the most obvious thing that I want to address is that money is specific to defy it is a defining event and compared to all the other events we've done they've been very broad in terms of what you can work on and the reason was as we were learning about how we can actually make this efficient for the the experience for a developer but also the general experience for how we actually make this really cool and insightful and just productive for our mentors and our sponsors and you hackers we wanted to just double down on things that we see are clearly working really well and as we looked at the hundreds of projects we've seen at all the other events we saw that defy was an obvious thing that everybody was super excited about and the number of projects that leveraged d-flat primitives kept on growing so not only was just growing the fastest we also found this to be like the most amazing community that is there to help everybody out and I and helped each other learn and grow and build cool things off of each other's work and we get to then also focus on the experience exclusively and and make sure that everybody in this space particularly dphi is there to help you achieve your projects and get them to that next level and also let's face it money Legos are super cool and I just want to see all the cool stuff that that all of you have mentioned in your applications so four weeks ago we announced this whole event and the response we got was incredible as of this morning there are 300 hackers a little over three hundred actually that have registered and staked and confirmed their participation in this event they've indicated on their dashboards that there's going to be over 60 projects they're going to be working on more so rolling in as people decide what they want to do we have people from a little bit over 45 countries I feel like there's a lot of them on this call right now and people from 15 different time zones so of course the next four weeks are gonna be fun and nice coordinating a lot of the events we have playing for you but I'm super grateful that all of you are able to join us on this call and an hour excited to spend your weakening your evenings and weekends and nights and mornings with us here we have some of these these are the some of the countries that hackers are participating from I saw a lot of the city names in the chat here on this soon call and uh and I'm happy to say that we have people from every continent participating at this event and that just makes me super excited because not only do we just prove that this truly is a global phenomena we also get to make things that are super interesting to all of us and bring in all these diverse perspectives from everybody across the world and and use each other's work and ideas and ideologies to to make something that others would also love to use and NES I I know that Antarctica is not here yet but we can go into the whole legalese for if that's official continent in a country that has permanent residency or not so don't give me too much flak on Antarctica um so one thing I realized was that two of the slides just got missing and and I'm gonna have to make this up as we go along so essentially hack money global event and eath global if you're not familiar is it's an organization that runs events across the world and and the goal for us is to bring in more web 3 developers into this ecosystem we've done 15 events so far hack money will be our 16th event and are also our first online event and over the past two and a half years we had people or ten over 10,000 people apply to to hack at these events we've seen over 1,100 projects come out of these events and we've had people from over 80 countries now physically present at one of our events that to us is amazing of course there's so many other trade offs when you're doing something in person because you are physically in front of methyls limited by geography but this is what's exciting about doing this thing online so some of the cool things we've seen come out of well actually one thing I forgot to mention was as we kind of did the defy events we saw that not only we're be able to get 300 of you to participate in RSVP we also got all these amazing companies to be part of the mentors and sponsors for this event and all of them are here some of them are on this call everybody else is definitely on this cord to support you and actually help you understand and build stuff on a defy and this is kind of what makes a super interesting because not only do you have access to all these d-5 projects and being able to talk to the engineers the developers the founders there to understand their perspectives and how you can actually build something that skills but you also have access to over twenty one of these mentors who are here to help you anywhere from getting technical feedback to understanding what you should do in terms of getting advice and how do you think about scaling your project to thinking about marketing and distribution to even investing if you want to take this to the next level and we're super excited to sort of offer that and we're adding a lot more people to be able to help out as mentors and and just be there to support you in any form and that's that this is why we get super excited so this is my correction to the slide you've global you already know what that is because I just talked about that but we've done all these events and and this is what we get super excited for honey because over the 1100 projects we've seen so far some of the cool ones that you think about are our projects like set protocol one-inch exchange aetherium crypto kitties and even the origins of a Bitcoin all these come from you global events and we've seen just the amazing things that they've been able to accomplish in a place they have in our community but imagine what would come out if you've got thirty days instead of two and after we being every single application for this event and hearing about all the things are excited to build about I can comfortably say that I am about to be blown away by everything we'll see in about a month Penza and I can't wait to see all these projects and use some of them directly on a day to day basis because everything you're all working on is extremely exciting so we have 45 minutes for this call wanted to make sure that we had an hour so what I want to do actually is just give you a high-level overview of what the next 45 minutes will look like we want to definitely cover how this heckling is going to work over the next thirty days as you kind of build and start hacking we want to address a handful of questions that we've been getting over email and our discord which is how does team formation work what is a check-in how can you get help or what are some of the prizes that I can can win and also it's not just about saying I'm working on a hackathon just disappearing coming back in a month we actually have a lot of things planed over the course of the next four weeks where we're doing a lot of talks animées panels and workshops and also just actually casual hangouts where all of us just kind of join in and anywhere from just talk over voice to collectively watch movies and other things so I have all of that I want to cover in a few minutes but before that I actually wanted to invite three special people on on this call and and have them actually talk about their experiences in or defy and just cover sort of the things that they're excited about and that's Linda shape from scalar capital and Spencer name from DTCC in Austin Griffith from the theory foundation where Austin helps well a lot with the developer experience and I have a budget question when I ask them I want them to to kind of tell us about things they're excited about and also we'll have the opportunity to ask them questions so if you have any questions as an attendee feel free to ask them on the zoom chat and we will be able to bring them up here on this call and ask away so with that please welcome lindo Spencer in Austin to our virtual stage hey guys Hey how's it going perfect bow tie Austin so I have so much stuff want to talk about so we're gonna have to like think about based on the time how much we have to cover but I kind of want to start off by actually asking all of you what is the last defy transaction that you made oh you go last one I made was converting side to eath and then if to die basically upgrading my side to die and then wallet so yeah I mine yeah does it count if you're moving it to die I definitely was doing that like on localhost' earlier but I'm just gonna do it right now making I am going to invest [Laughter] $500 a month defy transaction was doing pulled together pods feature that that's awesome now with that let's actually start off with some introductions I'd love to hear a bit more about each of you and and just kind of have everybody else watching also I know who you are where I can start so I'm Spencer noon ahead of crypto investments at DC capital and I also run our network which is a newsletter it's community driven newsletter and we focus on on chain metrics and network health window okay I'm Linda I'm co-founder for crypto fun called scalar capital previously I was a product manager at Quinn base and I'm also an advisor to directs a really big fan of defy we use it and and participate it's scalar capital and so I'm excited to it everyone's building that's awesome so let's start off with something some like high-level basic stuff there's a lot of stuff visiting you and we've seen the traditional markets crash or or go up or down and my question to you is I guess as you can think about or see what's happening in the rest of the world from an economic standpoint how do you think that effects defy and in the crypto ecosystem Austin you want to go first and then enjoy yourself to do well yeah actually I'm gonna go back to my introduction because it's gonna feed into my answer to this question basically I'm a bill I'm a lowly builder in the space so I don't know a ton about be fine I know about the leg walks and putting them together and making code but I don't know a ton about geopolitical stances on stable coins so I think that like I am a builder and thank you everyone for being on the call but I'm going to basically yield that first question to someone who knows more about what it actually means I'm sure everyone hear me okay there are some fishes awesome so I think this is it's an interesting time right in defined traditional finance in the markets we're kind of moving from this period of stability to volatility and so when you when you think about what that means for defy a lot of the apps that we've had have been very simple kind of stable coins into a money market fund or something like that and generate some interest in its enough interest because it's five or six or seven percent where that's meaningful and now what happens when interest rates are so low that I'm making point five percent on an annualized basis it's really really nothing and so I think founders and entrepreneurs need to think more about what are the different use cases that will work in this paradigm and then there's some other things to think about too I think downside protection is one right so you look at companies like open created insurance against your eath you know the price going down or even I want to take advantage of volatility on the long side and you know invest in something I think we'll see a lot more products like that too but yeah I think in this in this time when we really don't know how the next few months and years are going to go we're gonna need to be on our feet to see what actually sticks yeah I agree with a like all of that I think I'll be interesting to see the difference between like a Fiat stable coin and if you centralized stable coin and the yields on that we're already seeing like some difference in the rates online compound in dydx and part of it could be like regulatory arbitrage part of it could be like just the trading pairs that are offered so it would be interesting to see like maybe as people are like chasing yields like we actually get some non crypto people in to be like well I can actually maybe are in slightly higher yields all needs decentralized stable coins of course that will bring me down to but it will be interesting to see like I think it's really difficult to predict right now I think like though the whole like macro news has actually been a really good narrative for crypto I think like just like the Fed printing historic amounts money will actually like bring more attention to Bitcoin and and people are gonna start learning more about etherion like defy through that so like I think that overall like this is a good opportunity for crypto to build really cool things that like are gonna reach non crypto people as well you know it's awesome like maybe Spencer you kind of touched on this a little bit but as we kind of look at the kind of the obvious differentiator that defy right now has which is a high yield but a lot of that is celebrity on on staple coins and like I think as of right now we're nearing about 9 billion of stable coin issuance a lot of them are fiat backed do you think that sort of shocks the whole defy stable Queen ecosystem or actually like something that Lynda touched on but like what other use cases can we actually have for for these table coins if eel does not be the end goal what does it yeah that's a great question I think it's tough to know exactly how much like if your supply that gets flooded of stable coins into the space in crypto how much does that come over to d5 we really don't know the answer I think it'll be interesting to see there are other use cases for stable counts right remittances I think there's been a couple of good articles written on how stable coins could provide an alternative or yeah an alternative to the existing infrastructure for euro dollars so these are just you know foreign entities who need access to USD and they're using tether or they're using you SEC and something like that so so who knows but I do think what we do know is that the rails of these table coins they're very seamless and they're very easy to use so that adding stable coins to a lot of different projects in this space that have historically had ease will actually make it a lot easier to use and I think Agra v2 is a really great example of that so like it's a lot harder to bet using eath than it is just a stable coin because now you're being supposed to volatility of eath price so I think like we're gonna start like adding stable coins into these projects and it'll allow for like a wider user base so I think like we're only gonna see a larger trend of that and I'm like I just think stable coins at 9 billion now is just like actually so small compared to what it's going to like it which is crazy because I think like early days you had all these like kind of like startups creating their stable coins and then you like larger companies like coinbase and circle creating their stable coins and I think that we're gonna have to trying to thanks directly is shipping stable coins because the banks are like taking on that risk anyways and then you're gonna see like the government's themselves issue the stable coins and I think it's just kind of like basically so much so many transactions and stable points which will be pretty crazy day see if you were to make a prediction Linda when do you think we see cover and back stable coins oh this year really yeah I mean I think like I mean I don't know like to the extent of how much it's like use but I think like there's going to be like some I mean whether it's China's digital currency or just like some announcement of like that there's gonna be serious efforts put into a digital currency oh that's that's awesome no I definitely was not aware of direct efforts going on in this thing but that is wasted or that not all of us thought so or Facebook I thought that's great so I want actually kind of ask each of you but maybe starting with Austin defy and just crypto specifically is is very much of a a good sort of mix of composability where you get to kind of put things together in different forms and permutations and combinations kind of come up with a trusting outcomes so as a developer kind of why is that exciting and sort of like what kind of do you think the potential becomes compared to like the traditional world where that may not be the case as much would love to gonna have all of you compare/contrast on with that but especially I guess yeah I think it's like when it's a mouthful of a word but permissionless extensibility right that to me is the exciting part for a developer the fact that everything's open source and everything's on chain or I can go talk to your contract I can extend your token without having any permission from you right like like a mediocre developer in a weekend can write a token that wraps another token but has a new mechanic that's something that no one has ever gone before and I think that's the really interesting really exciting thing that we're seeing I think really quickly should like just real fast just jam through like what are like primitives right so you've got you've got like you can you can basically lock up eath in a loan and get die and that keeps a stable token like over collateralization gives you a stable claim then you can use that stable coin and you can lend them and earn something on that right or you can put the eath and the stable coin into a pool and you can make money on the liquidity as it moves right or you could basically like now it's like insurance right I was talking with a partner from open about how that basically you can say if if I'm this token then my eat can I can always turn in my Ethan a certain amount so insurance is like this new also so I think they're kind of like lays out the primitives I missed one like everyone let me know but I think knowing that we have these these building blocks already and then we can add new blocks to it and any one in a weekend or a thirty day period can put together something that basically every single developer and user in the space has the ability to access you know overnight so I'm just really excited about what's going to come out of this and already what we're seeing coming out of this I'll pass it on now Linda um yeah sure yeah I'm also very excited by that I think like some an area that I've been thinking a lot about is like in brain Flynn talks about this a lot but like gaming plus t5 and I think like it's really cool because like you can maybe get people to understand finance a lot more but get them to like play it a lot more and be interested in finance by like game of buying things and then on the flip side like maybe like create some like really interesting economics in a game to like get people to like get really excited by so like I think that there's like a lot of cool things that you can like plug in together that like um that aren't just like the money Legos so yeah like I'd love to see if anybody creates anything like gaming and ePHI related like please reach out to me that's a really interesting kind of thing to talk about is how like as a developer my my skills in economics my skills in game theory my skills in in so many other different areas have to be upgraded to be able to participate in the system which is a lot of fun because we have to learn in time too be able to like mmm this lowly developer talking to your political economics like I don't know any of that stuff but it's really exciting to be part of this so I guess maybe like I know we've kind of seen already a lot of this answer on this thing but now I'll try to spin this thing slightly differently do you see sort of any common mistakes as people are working on the file like a lot of the things here are definitely different than the traditional sense because some of them are just not possible if you are in the web 2 world and some of these things are things that we don't really know the the second-order effects for because of composability or because everything is super connected with each other but maybe most like a light comment from from Spencer and Linda on this button and maybe one from a technical standpoint Austin like what do you think are some common either misconceptions from common mistakes that you see developers make as as they cannot look into playing with money so to speak yeah I think a lot of developers right we have all these different primitives that you guys talked about and there's there's this natural kind of feeling that why don't I just like take them all and remix them in a way that's like pretty obvious right and the more than I've seen projects like that it's the ones that do they obviously take those primitives but they use them in really clever ways it's I mean awesome you're talking about this yesterday I think pulled together is a perfect example anyone can say it all together in a relatively short period of time right and but it took an actually jump to be able to do that and yeah I think there are others examples of that too in terms of other mistakes I don't know if this is a mistake per se but I would love to see more companies or more developers build things that actually captured fees because you know we've all kind of struggled with this nebulous question which is how do you how do you value crypto networks what is it worth investing in and I think for me as an investor I spent a lot of time thinking about that question and now we have some ways some traditional methodologies to to be able to do that so you look at a website link it's a it's a great kind of MVP that shows all the different defy Prada balls and what's their annualized feat and it doesn't matter what you think about is eath money is it not or whatever you news WAP is doing about 10 million dollars in fees on annualized basis that's amazing no one can take that away from them and so I'd love to see more of that yeah I just so like add on to that like I think it's really interesting because like we're seeing more and more of these projects start I think protocol feeds or having discussions around that and I think like at a certain level like I don't think anybody would really like fork the contract and like it serious momentum around it so like you also have to have like a fine balance between like what are the fees and it like extremely high level you're like to rent-seeking and people might fork it but like there's got to be a sweet spot where it's like actually a really great fee for the protocol but then like no one's actually gonna fork it and like create something else so it'll be interesting to see that you know I did have a question about business models but we can kind of dig into that a little bit more but and we kind of seemed like obviously the potential of like what you can do with this thing and how you can combine these things to come up with new products but we've also seen a lot of the other side of that story which is a hacks things gone wrong or or just the fact that this is irreversible as a transaction in most cases I have there are consequences of not having the best guarantees around safety of your funds or the experience how should people be thinking about the safety of funds as they kind of launched your products whether this is a hackathon or just projects in general trying to become companies like how do you think how should people trade off or like what do you think people should do as they think about having people obviously play with the tools but then also make sure that they're not always entirely on the testing base like is there right balance for there's a developer an investor or general strategies around that I think the tooling like we can start the very developer level I think the tooling is getting a lot better for this - we're having we're seeing new tools that are making it easier and easier for us to debug these kind of things and it's less of a black box now so I think that's that's a plus we're seeing the the ecosystem as as a whole kind of build up more and we're seeing or auditing practices a lot of that I think that one one mistake that that we should make on the other side is the safety thing is really really important for a million dollars right but it's just it's simple solidity code and you as a developer get in there and break stuff like definitely don't be afraid of losing money when it's like a ten or twenty dollar even on a test net like get in there and break stuff for sure but then on the other level yes we need all of this we need much more due diligence we shouldn't just be cloning projects and putting new tokens in them and stuff like that so you have to be very very clear with your entire stack and understanding how everything works and making sure it's fully audited and putting bounties up and putting small amounts of money into it and trying it at first before you get to that stage of kaboom yeah I thought futures walk was actually a good example of this I mean they got a lot of what they did so so originally they release an alpha and they had like a really good amount of trade volume on there and liquidity like 1 million in liquidity and 13 million in trade volume and they actually that was like past I think the interest level that for an alpha and so they actually are ending their alpha literally to kind of minimize the amount of risk because they made it really clear like this is an alpha please be really careful and I think like I don't know like users don't necessarily always respond to that and so like they preemptively shut that down early and so I think like having controls like that at the very early stages no that's great I think and there there's the kind of common thing we've seen everybody do is have so a threshold based testing so just the way ceilings work on maker or like you don't want to issue things that you can't handle properly and we've seen that approach work but there's so much more room to play around and see how we can experiment whether that's adding the ability to kind of reverse some of these transactions or buffer them or just have people see how this would work before they actually put in real money and I think some of the examples including picture swap is a great way to test that out what are some of these uh creative like anywhere from ideas to concepts to pitches you've seen Linda and Spencer that uh that kind of fall into this fringes of this is about what now as possible with defy or things that you would like to see like are there some examples you can give us that may not be mainstream yet but you totally see something working out here well I mean Linda talked a little bit about gaming and I think that's a great category to focus on and maybe I would just take a step back right we've had with with today a lot of the legacy crypto assets that folks are engaging with so Ethan Dada but what about kind of bringing financialization to other types of assets and maybe it's in-game assets it could be an empty part I think that's one that's that's really cool and we've seen actually pretty decent volumes on websites like super rare and open sea where people actually care about this so if you take things like collateralized loans lending borrower and all that stuff and instead use instead of either using I don't know man n ft that could be really really cool and I don't think we've seen a ton of use cases about that yet yeah I like adding on to the art piece like I think async are doing some really cool stuff like I've talked to you about a car tech like having programmable art is just like such an insanely cool concept and be able to pool like on chain data and have that affect how your art actually looks is is fascinating to mean I think there's like so many interesting possibilities there like so we need to crypto and then so an area that like I would really like to see is just more of the like reputation identity aspect of defy I know that I can extremely difficult topic but maybe this hackathon being longer someone actually spend more time digging into this I'm just like how we have such high requirements for collateral and this isn't actually scalable and a lot of people participate in the system because of this and so being able to like build up a reputation every time whether that be like people vouching for you or that's providing your n mts in the collateral or just like building up the reputation by taking out loans and maybe over time you get like lower interest rates or something so like I would love to see like more people tackling this again really hard problem but I'm happy to bring Spencer about personal tokens or person tokens or their me tokens and stuff like that I think that's a really exciting new kind of innovation that's happened and and not just like I'm tokenizing my time but the tools that will come with that like once my time is tokenized and there's a market for it and maybe there's like a staking to do list that if it reaches some critical commitment then that person starts working on that thing and then there's money streaming to them there's so many possibilities that we can do with this code and that these these primitives that who knows what's gonna happen what when you apply a market to something that hasn't traditionally had a market applied to it yeah and I think with some of the person token examples we're dealing with a lot of trust with people so you know I'm gonna commit that I'll give you an hour of my time and you kind of just have to take me at my word and I know that we have this hesitancy with things like that in the space but because it's such a low you know order value we're talking about billions of dollars here it's okay hey they trust people sometimes and I think we should experiment with those fridges cases because I personally think they could just the spawns are really creative ideas yeah the best you can just buy an insurance policy against somebody's time in case to cancel that meeting so oh it says I think I said you put it really well but I think the best answer like to kind of track this is that what you actually are applying markets to anything you can think of and happy that is a very eye-opening and exciting concept because we've currently never had either the tool sort of the capability of doing so and in being able to say that something that is that is worth a cent or a dollar is now the same as if it was a trillion is exact same economics or the behavior and the system understands that or is independent of that it's just a very fascinating kind of technical primitive that we just never had been able to deal with because the granularity has never been able to scale consistently and that to me is the most exciting part when I look at it as a developer so I don't have a lot of questions and we're getting a lot of stuff from the audience I want to start asking that if anybody on the attendee side has any questions please type them in the chat and I'll bring them up here but the the one thing I want to ask you err before we kind of moving to only questions is Spencer you can I touched on this thing a little bit but other than just fils have you seen any other creative sort of business models for these projects to to sustain themselves or just things that were just not possible in the non defy world well I think I think in terms of business models when you really break it down to their core primitives they do end up mirroring what we have in real right and so there is that kind of element of value capture so a Creek of native example of that I think would be burning right and not a lot of people are burning assets and like the real world but maybe also things like aggregation right if we we talk about the unique things that you can do with composable defy primitives that's one that I think more people should spend some time on you obviously have one inch and some of them Dex aggregators but there are other use cases for defy that we could probably create as well um yes like maybe do you see things do you see what you just said it ought to it sort of we're not odds but do you think that actually is the only way you can actually have a system that cannot be easily forked because a lot of that is about the liquidity effects or just the aggregation part of this where things become either successful or more efficient I don't have a question but I'm actually just curious like have you kind of thought about it cut from from that perspective of like how does working change if you have a different model here or or do you think that is the only way you can converge on some of them being popular as services you could expand on that maybe a little bit more I don't really how what I'm trying to ask yeah I think everyone has this idea in framework in their mind that these are all open search protocols and so if they are rent-seeking in a way that users don't like they're just going to be forked and you know if someone has a competing business then it's zero-sum and I think in practice it hasn't really played out that way although we do see with companies like d-force take take you know code from other companies and start using it and I think who knows what happens it really is going to depend on a case-by-case basis but I don't think that forking is is this like crazy threat that a lot of people make not they know I know I know that's great um so we're getting a bunch of questions I think one comment I see is I forking is a feature but it doesn't mean just because you have that feature you can claim it so I have a couple of course I would ask but before move into just the questions part I want to end this off by asking each of you just kind of water some of the things that make you super optimistic about this base and and specifically the feature of defy and kind of what you were excited about over the next few months to a few years I I said this yesterday and I think that it taking a word from you partake when you were interviewing Vitalik and Joe you said compounding pace and I think that that that phrase that phrase compounding pay so we have compounding interest and a lot of other stuff in d5 but the fact that our development space is moving at a compounding pace and each one each time we had one of these hackathons we get new tools we get new primitives we get new products I think that we're reaching an inflection point now specifically with tooling where our tooling is now built with developer experience in mind instead of building a tool to get a job done we're building tools to make it you know great to use and to build on and I think that we're at a specific point right now where we're gonna see a lot of tools and a lot more of these primitives come out and just anyone with a free weekend or 30 days is gonna be able to sit down and just apply force to this in a way that we don't even understand yet and I'm really excited about that just the tooling the ecosystem the primitives and just that that compounding pace pushing us forward faster and faster no that's that's really no chance you're I'm really excited by just like the entrepreneurs building the space like I'm constantly meeting with just like brilliant people who like specifically chose to spend their time building in D Phi which is like a really great exciting to me and then like I also spend a lot of my time talking to institutional investors about crypto and like I've been like trying to talk to them about D Phi and explaining to them and like a lot of them like once you get past like explaining how maker works which take some time they are like wow this is actually really cool this is like totally just operating on its own and there's no centralized company that's controlling this or government and like they like start understanding this and thinking that it's really interesting so I think like over time like as we build more and more products that like might be familiar to non crypto people like I think we're gonna like light in the audience that like who's actually participating this and like of course abstracting away like the D Phi components of it so like I mean I'm just really excited because I think like the entire user base is gonna grow like a lot over the next few years yeah I would say that I'm most excited about just the all of these new protocols or existing networks actually that are that are decentralizing and giving ownership to their communities and having these be kind of community owned and operated networks that's like we have you like the opportunity to do this on a really large scale that's never been done before and I think you look at companies like compound they're really blazing a trail in terms of how companies in the future are going to let their users actually be the owners and so I'm excited about that and then in terms of things I'm optimistic for I would echo some of the things Linden talked about we're kind of reaching this inflection point where we have these interesting macro conditions and and some early use cases of early signs of product market fit I would say the Fiat stable coins being issued at an alarming pace recently is a good signal there and when you think about developers the rate of new developers entering the space is actually it's not you know we're not hockey stick it's not there's not a thousand more than there were a year ago and so you've all got just an incredible opportunity to take advantage of these primitives everything is getting battle tested and ready we have a new use cases it's almost the perfect storm to be a developer and an entrepreneur in this space so I'm really excited to see what happens over the next year no that is no good all three of you that's so well put I think kind of take aways from this answer is that abstraction is it's not a bad thing I don't have to worry about TCP and IP right now and web 2 and we will eventually get to what where I can just assume things work the way they were supposed to and not worry about the lower level of that stack and if I were to uh maybe incorrectly summarize Linda and Spencer's comment or getting to the point where we don't get called crazy after we describe how something works but everybody else so the more that happens the more we get closer to consumer adoption and that is also wonderful when you're like the Charlie mean when you're putting all the stickers on convince them what maker is just have them understand what a fleshly is and that we should be going so one last question I have for the audience and then we'll move on to the rest of the logistics for these events who's up I guess what kind of role do you think Dallas can play in defy whoever wants to take that I I want to tap on that just a second like the down part I feel like we've we've gone too far away from what a Dow was supposed to be like the a in the Dow meant that it was automated and there were markets that were happening and a lot of dolls I see now aren't very a so I'm hoping we bring the a box to the devil but I'm just gonna pass it on I'm all for experimentation at small scales like I don't think like we're at this stage we're like we can have a Dow be managing like large sums of money but like I think that those are actually really interesting and like I'm glad to see like I research that after the Dow hack and so like yeah III think that it that's really exciting to see and like people taking small pools of money and like investing it in different crypto projects like it's been a popular use case I've seen so yeah I'd like to see more a endow but yeah Capital pools thing kind of voting and other crypto mechanisms to deploy money and kind of run a business that's super interesting and more of it soon perhaps will will see a lot of these interesting things we talked about here in in a month from our actors so obviously all of you will be up to date because you are also on our discord but I wanted to thank Linda Austin and Spencer for taking the time today and really appreciate you sharing your thoughts in this space thank you happy Friday there's so many good names in this chat to so many people that know more about defy building than I do it's great to have everybody here know I'm extremely excited so what I'll do is I'm gonna go back to the PowerPoint and we'll just cover some of the logistics stuff and I have a handful of information that I want to relay about our sponsors and our prizes so well we'll go into that and get this back on track so back to hack money we have an amazing set of sponsors that are here to help you make this the best four weeks for you to make your project come back to life not back just come to life and I want to thank everybody here that kind of make this possible a lot of them aren't here spending all of their time and how to make sure that you were successful and and with that let you think he's in every one of them and that's of a compound unit sloth eternity foundation uma ENS chain-link balancer SIA P tokens open GSN pulled together Hortis and stark where a lot of them are all of them are on our discord and and they're there to help you and you can message them and get some help if you're stuck on anywhere from understanding how they work to do some SDK or code related changes questions and they're also going to be offering prizes and I want to offer a few of them to kind of share a few thoughts about who they are and what they're doing and we're gonna have a quick few words from our three of our sponsors starting off with Ave and stun ephraim ave just has a short video for us to to watch and i hope you get to hear what i'll be has to say hi everyone my name is study i'm from ave our base a decentralized money market where you can deposit different kinds of assets and earn and also you can borrow this assets against a collateral ave is also pretty well known from flash moans where you can borrow liquidity without any collateral as much as there's reserves in the protocol obvi is quite big protocol at the moment pretty much one of the known defied protocols out there for lending and borrowing and one of the interesting things about our bay is that we tried to embrace a lot of compressibility and innovation around the ecosystem and not just the ave ecosystem but aetherium and defy ecosystem now this is very interesting hackathon because it's basically focused on on defy hacking and it's more longer than the previous hackathons that we have been participating and sponsoring and mentoring in the it global community so in this particular hackathon we are basically looking like how well you can innovate and how finished product you can actually build within the time span that you have there's plenty of time but also good to know that time goes quickly so my advice for everyone is is that get a plan set up and start just building and one of the things we are kind of encouraging people to do is is basically trying to apply defy into something that might help anyone maybe in real life maybe some kind of a way to provide price stability for example for farmers or any other kind of application and second thing we're trying to embrace a lot is guilt hacking which is one of my favorite talk topics and I personally like to practice is basically trying to get more yield as we all know liquidity is the network effect of TFI and to get more requited liquidity you basically need to get more yield for the depositors or your users so that's like one of the things we are looking for here we have different kind of prices here so basically there is up up to 5,000 a die for grabs for the most coolest innovative and basically inspiring hacks that you can actually build and especially like if you do very cool things not just not it doesn't have to be complex but something really cool that involves other projects or it's very beneficial to the whole ecosystem that's that will be a pretty dope and also part of the hack money is I think making money more secure so if you are trying to hack in a way that you are improving the whole ecosystem or basically showing a new way to actually make the ecosystem more secure that's very appreciated and definitely will get extra highlight from us besides the ADI prices that we have we also have a backpack set we're giving up and we'll send you wherever whichever x on you are so this is like an official of a hack pack and and they've got it has a USB charger and also we're giving up our socks not this one this is used for a but but but basically if you happen over you will get your very own other socks and this is a pretty cool model actually that being said I wish you all good luck have very fun and try to come up with cool things and if you are stuck or something don't mind try to ask help there's plenty of people here around and everyone is pretty much reachable we're in Europe timezone but we'll try to stay awake whenever serving as my as many time zones as we actually can thank you thank you all and have a pleasant time Thank You sunny from Olli and just to kind of summarize of a is aborting 5,000 a day in prizes where you get 2500 and they die for the first place and 1500 1000 for second and third place respectively next up I want to actually call up Adam from compound and they'll cover compound sort of a presence at this event and all the prizes that compound is offering hi everyone I'm Adam the developer relations lead at compound I'm really excited to see what you all build in the hack money defy hackathon compound will have two bounties with prizes of CUSD see you also get to hear from us in a defy panel where we'll discuss some of the challenges in defy date for that is TBD before I go over the hackathon bounties I'll tell you a little about compound compound is an autonomous interest rate protocol made of aetherium smart contracts the protocol is made for developers that are building defy applications each of these assets are supported by the protocol users can supply or borrow any of these assets using solidity smart contracts or a web 3 library like web 3 Jas one applications supply an asset to the compound protocol they begin earning a variable interest income instantly interest accrues every etherion block which is about every 15 seconds and users can withdraw their principal plus interest at any time in addition to supplying users can also borrow assets from the protocol for example if the user supplies $100 worth of eath they can then borrow up to 74 USD see this works for any asset combination based on the posted collateral factors check out the compound homepage to see several applications that have integrated the protocol we also have thorough smart contract documentation REST API documentation and developer QuickStart guides to get moving fast and easy there are two compound bounties up for grabs in the hack money hackathon the first is for the most creative use of the compound protocols community governance smart contracts build an application SDK or API that has a practical use of comp and governor the price for this bounty is $1,000 of Cu SDC check out the QuickStart guide for governance which includes code examples that compound out finance / Docs governance is live on main net and Rob's 10 the second bounty is for the most creative use of protocol borrowing build an application SDK or API that uses the cito can borrow function the project's code must use at least one see token contracts borrow method the price for this bounty is $1,000 of Cu SDC contracts for borrowing are live on all test nets and maintenance will be holding office hours at 11:30 a.m. Pacific time every Friday during the hackathon you can also ask questions in the discord channel be sure to add Adam B good luck to all the builders and I'll see you soon Thank You Adam so as I mentioned our compound will be doing two prizes a total of 2,000 see us DC where a thousand of it will be for the best hack uncom on compound leveraging borrowing and the second prize for a thousand see us DC will be for the best hack that leverages compound governance and then lastly I want to actually invite noah from yuna soif to share a few thoughts on why they're excited about pac money and the prizes that eunice walk is hosting for this event hey hack money Noah from you to swap here coming to you from quarantine in New York City we're really excited to be sponsoring this event it's going to be a super fun productive 30 days and as in a bit of an incentive to builders we're gonna be offering $5,000 to build on top of you know swop v2 the prizes are going to be divided into first second and third place offering three thousand fifteen hundred and five hundred died and we're looking for projects that build on top of the UNICEF me to test that which includes decentralized Oracle's years.he twenty-year C 20 pairs flash swaps and a lot more really exciting features all the details on new zombie 2 can be found on you swap org and we're also going to be in the disc or throughout the event so feel free to you know pop in ask us questions and we're gonna be you know there to help you through we can't wait to see what you build and good luck thanks Noah we have $5,000 of guy in prizes from unit swap where three thousand of the of the prize money will go to the best hack that leverages UNICEF b2 and then there will have two additional prizes of 1500 and 500 die for second and third place for also a hack that leverages Yunus swop v2 so these were some adjust our key sponsors we wanted to highlight but there's a few more other prizes by other companies that they're available to all of us actors and I want to just quickly run over them and then cover the logistics we should take about five more minutes so chain link is also hosting a prize for $5,000 in total we're the most compelling projects that use chain link in their in their hacks will get 2500 1500 about a thousand bucks in in link tokens then we have uma and uma is awarding $2,000 to to two projects that equally sort of leverage the best use of an interesting interface that leopard is synthetic tokens and then the best way to incentivize and provide liquidity to other priceless synthetic tokens then we have P tokens and P tokens will award $4,500 to the top three teams that USP tokens then we have EMS and ENS will award $750 total in prizes which is going to be broken down into five $150 in Heath to the top five projects that make a good or interesting use of ENS integrations for their hack then we have poor taste powered by shape-shift and Portis will award $3,000 in eat or die and this will be for a project that best uses the Portis SDK to integrate users then we have bouncer and balance of we'll be awarding to dollars in prizes we're 1,300 a Vic will go to the best project they uses the balancer protocol and a runner-up prize for a $700 that also leverages the balancer protocol and we have open GSN and they will be awarding 1600 in prizes where a thousand dollar grand prize goes to the best use of GSN to paymaster and three $200 prizes for another meaningful use of the gas station network for a better UX for your acts then we have the tsiyon at work where sy is going to be awarding 1400 in prizes which will translate into to 500,000 saya coins to a project that best leverages Skynet integration which is their decentralize CDN service and of course even though I ran through all of this things super quickly you can go to hackathon money / prizes to get details on all of these with instructions on what the nuances are and also you can reach out to all of these companies and and the team members on the discord channel on their specific sponsor channel name so real quick I want to cover some of the logistics everything here will happen on discord we will obviously keep on doing some of these calls on online here which is on zoom or or discord voice channels but all hack money channels and all the participants are going to be added to a private group that gives them access to all the hack money specific channels where you get to talk and interact with mentors you get to talk and interact with sponsors you get to join a lot of our ad-hoc and scheduled events like we have a cafe channel that will just be just doing casual voice chats and we'll have a handful of other kind of fun sort of sectioning there of things we can do over the next month but the only thing you have to make sure is if you go to a hackathon money / discord you will be given a link to join our channels and if you have RSVP'd and stake properly on your dashboard you get to put in your discord username and this will give you access to the private channels on discord for hack money if you have any problems in this process or you're stuck or you don't see any of these channels please reach out to anybody on the mobile team and that will be able to help you with getting you to everything so some quick questions wanted to address the first one is how does a psychic on work will want to keep this thing super simple the hackathon begins today which means as of right now you can start building your projects and you can start coding with your team or by yourself there's a maximum limit of five team members per per submission so if you are working with a team you can have up to five people and you can declare them on your dashboard again if you have any problems with that please message us and the only kind of thing and when I kind of remind everybody is that even though you are totally free to use any open source libraries you can leverage all the the existing work in this field it's just that when you are starting a project you should have begun it also in that same timeline so we can keep this fair to everybody else so if you think you're in a position where somebody the thing you're working on it was something you started a while ago and you want to continue working on that we want to make sure that that is within the criteria of the event and if you are in that position please reach out to us so we can kind of just see what's what's going on for that particular situation another kind of obvious thing I want to point out is what is considered defy we want to keep this slightly high level which is if your hack involves anything in lending borrowing trading payments insurance or any financial services or products we'll consider it actively defy and this qualifies for a submission or a price and if you have any questions about if your hack may not be considered ePHI by is this definition or maybe in the fringes please reach out to us and we'll be able to help you with that as well the most kind of common question we got was what is it checking him the quick answer on a check-in is that we just want to make sure that we're able to help you with getting your project to the end state of being cool and and usable by anybody including yourselves and because this is a month long process we want to make sure that we can have some efforts around making sure that everybody feels connected with everybody else is participating so a check-in is when one of the youth global team members will reach out to you about once a week and just kind of get an update on kind of how things have been going what do you need help with or if you're stuck somewhere we can kind of help you with how to get unblocked and and as a result like we'll have on average about four check-ins for for this course and they can be done either over voice or a call we're just directly in text over discord because you have to keep in mind all these time zones so as you respond to the check-ins and you submit something you get back your stake and and that is that that's the the simple sort of process around how check-ins work some of you who have also kind of talked us about I don't have an idea or a team and if you are on the hack when you do score channels you will see two channels named hack ideas and find a team where you get to collaborate with others and get feedback or the front others who might be interested working on your idea but also over the past week we've reached out to a lot of you have indicated that they're looking for team and started working on a team finding and matchmaking process so a lot of you already would have those details figured out but if you are in a position where you need to find another team member or would like to join the team please check out the find a team discord Channel and we'll be doing a call next Wednesday where we're connecting everybody else and matching them with the ideas and the team members and the skill sets that they need and and also it's totally okay if you want to hack by yourself you don't necessarily have to work on a team but if you are looking to anywhere from learn or or find somebody with complementary skill sets you have the option to find somebody who is also looking for the same thing and lastly we'll cover a handful of stuff around judging and submissions over the next couple of weeks but judging and your submissions are due on Sunday May 24th at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time that is 30 days from now and we'll be walking you through a lot of those details and if you have any questions we're also happy to answer them and lastly the next four weeks are going to be eventful from our site we're doing a lot of things from our end to make sure that we're offering a very similar experience to the in-person events you may have attended and and you have an opportunity to talk in Iraq with everybody that's involved so this is just a quick highlight of what the next couple of weeks look like but we'll be posting most of this in more detail on the website and also on discord but over the next seven days will be hosting a tutorial on solidity and a deaf deaf stack set up using bid ler this Monday then I talked about the team formation call if you are looking to join a team and this coming Friday we have an AMA with Donnie from Ave so you get to ask him and the other team questions about their their company their process have flash phones work at anything else you want to know and then we're also doing office hours with a lot of sponsors so if you have any questions about using a particular SDK or a protocol you get to just join their office hours to this coming week and just ask them questions live and lastly I want to just make sure that you all pace yourself we don't want this thing to be exhausting we don't want this thing to feel like a restful environment we just want you to have fun what we're trying to do is also learn as we go through this thing for the first time what we can do to actually resemble an experience that is similar to what an in-person event would be and we want to actually learn from you too so if you think something could be done better if you think something is is going really well we want to hear about that and we'll help improve as we go live so we want to make sure that you're not stressed as you participate in this thing there is not a lot I expected from you is just we just want you to be successful so if you're in a position where some things are not working just let us know and we want to hear you out and if you've any other questions you can go to a hackathon dot money slash hacker where we have a very big doc that addresses the handful of other things that I haven't talked about in this slide and obviously you can ask these questions on discord and we can answer them for you directly and lastly please be respectful harassment and abuse is not tolerated in any capacity we kind of put our code of conduct forward as you were filling out and are sleeping for this event but if you have any questions about our our event rules and just a code of conduct you can go to if global Coast rules to learn more about how we actually manage and behave and all of our events whether they're in person or virtual hands and quit that I want to wish everybody happy hacking and we'll see you all on discord thank you so much for taking out the time today and good morning good afternoon good evening and good night - to all of you bye-bye you
