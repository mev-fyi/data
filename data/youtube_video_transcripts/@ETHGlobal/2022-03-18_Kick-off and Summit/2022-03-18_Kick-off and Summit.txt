good morning good afternoon good evening everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of eat global and super excited to welcome all of you to lf grow so you're watching this thing on equal dot tv this is the platform we'll be using for today's summits talks kickoff finale and the rest of this event this is where you get to talk to us live you can kind of sign in and say hi customize your avatar and if you have any questions in the future for our speakers or any of the talks you can type them in the chat and we'll be able to relay those questions to our speakers also for everybody who signs in and engages with us we'll be giving everybody a nftpo app as well so be sure to say hi and tell us where you're coming from so this event is brought to you by e global and for those of you who don't know what eat global is equal was an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits and lf grow is no different so we have both components here for this event we're going to start off with the hackathon the hackathon officially begins today this is the kickoff i was talking about how the hackathon is set up and how everything's going to work and then shortly after that i'll talk about the summit which is a uh which just begins in about 40 40 minutes uh and we'll have a jam-packed uh agenda of amazing talks and speakers are going to be talking about uh the future of kind of how we see this space and all of what three for the hackathon we have 500 hackers from 41 different countries spanning 13 different time zones participating and building new ways to think about social networks so i can't wait to see what comes out of this event next week and to kind of see where everybody was coming from we put everybody on a map uh and it kind of blows us away that we have representation from six different continents and so many different people from so many different parts of the world so we're super excited to see the diversity of uh what everybody is excited about the problems that you care about and the things that make you uh super passionate about working in this space and thinking about new ways to uh build social networks and uh i'm i'm excited to welcome all of you to this event and not just the hackers we also have 10 ecosystem partners who are going to be here this entire time and over 61 ecosystem mentors who are also going to be here helping you get unblocked or get help on anything uh that you need to finish your projects whether it's technical help understanding how you think about architecture or just even general understanding of how something is structured or built so you can better uh understand as well as kind of cater those understandings towards applying them to your projects and to top it all off we have two hundred thousand dollars in prizes that are going to be given away as part of this event and uh we'll go into what these prizes are and how everything is split up so uh stay tuned uh for those details so especially thank the lens protocol for being an amazing uh collaborator for this event uh and also some amazing partners like polygon studios live pier the graph ens toucan ceramic unstoppable domains chain link and lit protocol they're all offering different prizes for different ways you where you can use their apis sdks or protocols and we will be going through a lot of those details very soon so let's quickly talk about the hackathon so the goal of this uh session is to cover some of the logistics around how everything is set up and uh us answering the most common questions we get from all the participants especially first-time participants and any nuances that we can clarify so the most obvious question that we've gotten here is what can i actually build uh as i've kind of already prefaced this is a event about understanding how we can extend and build on the lens graph so the most common things that we think everybody can be excited about is looking at different ways to think about how we use social graphs in web 3 you get a really immense commutable as well as composable way to think about information identity preservation and just ways you can leverage any history from any other place and include that in any new mechanic that you are trying to do there's a lot of creativity around social crafts uh this also lets you enable a new way to think about claim and drops whether it's uh supporting a different way to think about white listings or user bases that can get access based on different sort of qualifiers there's also ways to think about how do we include this thing in governance and identity or especially how we work with dowse and of course as part of any network you have so much more room to think about visualization analytics and understanding where information is and how it's flowing uh between uh different parties so there's that's these are very high level themes we're going to go into a lot of that throughout the event through various talks also the website for for the hackathon and also you can see a lot more detail on what is actually possible on a technical level very soon as we have a detailed talk about the architecture of lens protocol so let's quickly talk about the next 10 days so what i want to cover is how everything is set up and what the next week looks like uh what it means to kind of think about forming a team how you can get help all the prices you can win all the talks and workshops that are happening as part of this event uh obviously the summit that's gonna happen just after this uh talk uh and uh how judging and submission works so let's start with communication everything about this event is going to be on our discord which means that if you are a hacker or a partner you should have gotten access to the lf grow channels these are all private channels which means only people are participating at the event will be able to see them so please make sure that you have logged in uh an authenticated discord from your dashboard and that you were able to see the lf grow chat and all the other channels on the screenshot this is where you can go to get help and have any information about or just kind of keep up with any information about talks agenda any changes or or just kind of how judging and everything else has worked um directly and this is also where you can get help so if you go to the mentorship help channel you can ask your questions there and you'll also see channels for really specific protocols so you can ask the teams over there for help on how you use something or if you need to clarify or if you are facing any bugs you can kind of get help in multiple places there on top of all that for every talk workshop that's being hosted you are also going to be receiving calendar invites so you can quickly see when everything is normalized to your own time zone and the entire event schedule is on our website we really want this thing to be as asynchronous as possible which means that even though we have people from so many different time zones we understand that you may all not be available to attend any talks live whether it's through work or school obligations or anything else so everything that we're doing as part of this event is going to be recorded which means as soon as it ends it will be available on our youtube and you can kind of find all these links the agenda what's up coming all the deadlines or any other changes on our website and you can just head over to lfcrowd.educable.com to get the latest information about everything on this event so let's quickly talk about how the time zone or the hackathon works i'm also looking at questions from the audience if you have any questions about the logistics feel free to ask them here and i'll be able to look and answer them for you so the hackathon officially begins now which means you can start building as of uh two hours one and a half hours ago you can start working on your projects you can have up to five members on your team and you have now the next nine days to hack and submit your projects submissions are due at 12 p.m which is noon eastern on sunday the 27th so this gives you nine days to work on something get help give us feedback or ask for any feedback and kind of submit the projects and then judging will begin the day after in terms of rules and criteria the rules are fairly straightforward everything that you are submitting must be done from scratch which means that anything that was done as part of a submission for this event should have started today with a traceable and proper github history so you are allowed to use pre-existing libraries we do not want you to read web wheel so if you have any open source libraries that you want to put in or any other boiler plates that are available already you are more than welcome to use that and start there to make your lives easier but we we will ensure that everybody else has done all the work just during the course of this event and not before and uh we will also enforce that uh people are not committing just the day before so you should maintain a proper gate of history uh and any anything that we see that does not uh look like it may be uh fully traceable or it was likely done before this event will be considered disclosed by project in terms of other things that we want to add you have to use lance protocol as part of your submission this is an event entirely about thinking about how lens graph can be introduced in all of your different ideas and only rsvp hackers will be eligible to win any prizes which means that if you submitted a project and you did not have your team member listed officially on your dashboard at the time of your submission or right now and you end up winning a prize you will not be uh only the people who are listed on the team will be given the prize at the end on top of that there there can always be a different edge cases and we totally understand that so if you feel like something is uh going to be different for you or your team please email us and we want to understand what that situation is and handle that accordingly so reach out to anybody on the global team preferably over email and we'll be able to address your concerns from there and of course uh there's a every gloomy question of what if i'm new to all there's a lot of you who are coming in uh from the web 2 side trying to understand what could be possible you want to also want to make sure that this is a an event that lets you uh explore what could be possible and this is totally okay to sort of use as an opportunity to understand what what is out there so what we recommend is you should head over to find a team channel if you're still looking for projects or other teammates or you want to join a project and you can offer a specific skill set there's a lot of people here already at discord asking for needing help with various uh skills or specific expertise on different technologies so if you are one of them you can absolutely ping and reach out to any of those other members and we also encourage all of you to introduce yourself in the elf grow chat channel we're curious to learn where everybody's from and what they're excited about and of course uh it is totally okay to hack solo you don't have to necessarily work on a team if you prefer not having a team or if you would like to just use this as an opportunity for yourself to challenge yourself to see what you can build that is totally okay too and a lot of you have already attended the brainstorming and the team matching sessions yesterday and earlier today so a lot of you should have still kind of gotten all the information you need to understand what you can do to pair up with somebody if you're still looking for a team and of course there's a lot of talks and workshops and there's a lot of amazing content for beginners uh so and and people from every skill set so we'll be making sure that you have a chance to kind of look up and catch up on all these things that come out of this event so all these talks panels and workshops will be recorded and streamed and we also have a summit right after this thing we have an amazing set of toxic speakers coming on and we'll be kind of going through a lot of those details very soon but uh you can check out everything directly on each global youtube channel by heading over to youtube.comglobal and for all the details around anywhere from judging to submission to the timelines to any criteria around how things are looked at all that information is available on your info center which is also linked on a lot of the calendar invites and your dashboard and uh once again the website is alif grow dot heap global dot com uh so another kind of uh thing here is that if you missed any opportunity to uh participate in the team building session there's still a lot of people who are on discord looking for teams and you can uh check out and catch up on what's happening on the discord channels if we're looking for a find a team channel and uh start start talking to people there the reason we do the session as a zoom call is to uh allow for one or two opportunities to have everybody talk at the same time asynchronously on a call so you can have more context and then kind of go back and forth faster but uh depending on the demand we'll look at addressing if there's another thing that we should do today or tomorrow also one thing to note is that there is a notion of a check-in for this event so there'll be two quick check-ins next week on your dashboard these are just uh simple questions that we ask everybody on understanding how things are going and this kind of lets you lets us get give you the help you need which is anywhere from uh understanding where you're blocked where you need help or if you are still stuck after a couple of days of anywhere from not getting somewhere or still and not being able to understand if something is possible but we get to route you to different people whether it's our partners or other developers out there or just being able to answer okay you should think about doing this instead or anything to unblock yourself your stake will also return as you respond to these check-ins they'll get these just very simple forms and they'll appear on your dashboard early next week and we'll also notify everybody over email and discord that the check-ins are now available uh it's just a way for us to understand how things are going so nothing too formal and just more of a mini survey and submissions are due at 12 p.m eastern on the 27th so this gives you nine days to work on your projects and submit them on sunday and this kind of leads us to how judging is set up so the judging oh i have a typo here judging happens on the 28th of march not on the 14th um and uh judging split into two different tracks uh there's a main judging which will be from nine uh 12 p.m to 2 30 p.m eastern and then there's sponsor judging for any prizes that you are applying for which will be asynchronous the way main judging works is you have four minutes to demo and and submit record your kind of project we will require video submissions so on sunday as you are submitting your projects you will have to record it up to four minute video of what you have built and how everything works and who you are and for why you built it and that is what will be used by all of the prizes consideration as well as the uh the judges at on on monday and we really recommend that you don't do this thing last minute because uh it will require you sometime to get anywhere from the video right to seeing if you actually are able to put everything you can and you want to in a four-minute limit so please kind of give at least one to two hours of just a buffer to make that submission happen and all these details again will be available on your dashboard so you'll be able to do all of this thing uh via dashboard and we'll have the judging section on the info center be populated to give you all the nuances around how do you think about this thing including examples from previous submissions that you can use as a reference as for any sponsor judging for any prizes that you're going to be applying for all that happens also via your dashboard and asynchronously so on the submission form as you're submitting your projects you'll be able to specify these are the prizes i'm going for and based on which prizes you select we will be sharing your projects with those projects and uh the protocols and they will be reviewing all those uh videos as well and and reaching out to you if they have any questions but this will not be a live uh session like the main judging so all of our partners and sponsors will look at uh all of your recorded videos and use that as a way to understand what's happening and they'll reach out to you if they need any clarification so all that happens asynchronously and of course i want to talk about the code of conduct for this event the rules and the code of conduct is listed on eatglobal.com rules but the gist of it is that please be respectful and harassment and abuse at in any capacity will not be tolerated uh in our community and we will take immediate action if we see somebody being disrespectful uh also if you have any kind if you need any help or clarification please reach out to anybody on the global team whether it's through discord or email and we will be able to address any of your concerns or take action appropriately and immediately so that covers a lot of the logistics uh i'll i'll see if there are more questions coming in but uh without kind of further ado i want to quickly take a second to talk about our partners and thank them for kind of being part of this event so we have we asked them to record a video about kind of who they are how everything is set up on there and why they're excited to be kind of part of this event and then while we're doing it together uh with a lot of them and uh without further ado i'd like to sort of welcome uh stani from lens to talk about lunch protocol welcome everyone to the elf pro hackathon this is an amazing opportunity to hack on the future of social media especially with the web 3 components so today's social media has a lot of different kind of challenges and it's being built in a way where there isn't much of a ability to contribute as a developer and lens protocol is going to change that it's going to change that in a way where you as a developer can actually focus on building better uh social media applications without uh creating the network effect and the platform effect that normally would have to to compete with uh traditional social media uh platforms essentially what lens protocol uh is uh it is a web 3 social media protocol that it's built completely on smart contracts meaning that the profile creation is tokenized as nfts followings uh relationships are tokenized as nfts and the protocol itself has modules different kinds of follow logics uh collection logics and also reference projects that can be changed or as a developer you can contribute to create new ones uh so the protocol is modularized uh to various different kinds of use cases and the idea is that uh if we have web3 built in a common social graph it means that you as a developer uh you can focus on actually building better user experience or or focus on building social media application that focuses on particular um uh use case or a niche or uh essentially uh creating something completely new that uh no one has thought about yet um the torah is very simple um to [Music] to use and there is an api as well so lens api helps you to do all the middleware heavy lifting so indexing nfts and and getting the data that you actually need to build uh very amazing and beautiful uh front end we at this hackathon we're looking uh to see a lot of creativity creativity in the design uh the user experience and also in your idea and also i want to say that hackathons are the best places to to meet new friends and it's an experience so essentially you should whatever you're building you should enjoy the process uh enjoy contributing enjoying uh building and and exploring the the lens protocol itself and also if you need any kind of help reach out to the global team uh reach out to our team we're happy to help you we're happy to brainstorm with you and support you thank you so much and have amazing time during the elf grow hackathon awesome well thank you so much tony and now we'll we'll just hear from him in a few minutes but uh the other one we want to talk about is eric i was gonna talk about life here so without further ado let's hear how you can integrate live beer eric tang and i'm the co-founder and cto at live pier live pier is building the video streaming infrastructure for web3 and we're really excited to be here at elf grow working with you all on decentralized social applications and that's simply because well in today's world almost all popular social applications have a significant video feature however all of these applications have a broken underlying economic incentive layer right and part of the reason is because it's so complex and and it costs so much money for the on the infrastructure layer to build these types of applications so that only companies with the pockets can actually succeed and as soon as these platforms get to a certain scale they start to exhibit very strong anti-competitive behaviors and they start to hold their users and their data hostage for example if you are streaming on twitch and you want to be able to make money on twitch then you have to sign up to be a twitch partner which means you promise that you you will exclusively stream on twitch and not other platforms um another thing that happens in these platforms is that they take arbitrarily high take rates right youtube is famously um taking fifty percent of the take rate uh what that means is for every two dollars uh that youtube makes it only shares a dollar with their creators uh for a platform that their entire application experience is to share creator content to their viewers this is a really high tax in the web 3 world um all of this changes right and and that's really rooted in the fact that users now own their content and they own their data we're already seeing this happen where applications are built around this fact and multiple applications are built on the same set of data for example the most popular nft application in the web3 space openc has only a two and a half percent take rate it's not because openc wants to take a arbitrarily low take rate but it's because openc simply does not own the user's data right an openc needs to be competitive to all the other nft platforms that are around the world now we're just at the beginning of this evolution right and we're really excited to see what kind of ideas you the hackers are going to come up with so live pier is offering a prize uh prices that total up to sixteen thousand dollars uh for this hackathon um and we've also created a lf growth specific hacker quick start guide which was shared in the discord channel in there you will find sdks and tutorials and even code examples that you can clone and use that to help on your hack so come find us in the discord tell us about your hacks we'd love to we love to help you and good luck awesome thank you so much eric and uh yeah i mean this is one of the uh interesting pieces which is uh we kind of when we talk about decentralized social media networks we're usually looking at uh like a twitter alternative or just a way to think about uh posting content but there's so much more to think about and social content and media consumption and just videos is a massive part of how everything is growing so uh i'm super excited to see how people think about ways to think on all these networks as we look at different forms of media other than just text too so this should be really fun and i can't wait to uh to see what everybody builds all right so let's go into all the prizes so we're just at the tail end of the prizes and we can go through the rest of it uh with uh our summit so first up i'm going to talk about all the amazing prizes that you can win with lens so without further ado let's welcome stunning again to talk about all the prizes that you can win gm all for all electro hackers so um we have some interesting bounties to announce um so we have uh three tracks in total so the track one is the front end track and the idea is to reward uh the best implementation of a front end build on top of the lens protocol so the first price is 25 um thousand uh dollars worth of um uh price and and the second one is ten thousand and third is five thousand and then we have category prices uh 1250 each and different categories are audio curation uh matchmaking social gaming commerce creator strategies composable content forking for example if you create some sort of an interesting uh meme template application on on top of uh lens protocol and then we have eight category is the uh moderation so essentially you can build any kind of a new uh social media experience with the lens protocol and and based on the implementation uh criteria criteria such as the the design um how nice the user experience is how beautiful the application is novelty uh originality uh the technical accomplishment how much effort you put there the potential impact and of course creativity and and fun also we have a protocol track so uh 20 000 um uh for most creative new modules so 5000 for the follow module 5000 for the reference module 7000 um first and and 3 000 for the second collect module so here you can be very creative and contribute directly to the lens protocol with these new modules and same criteria here and especially creativity usability is very valued and then third track is the tooling and that's 30 000 uh where the bounty is 5 000 for uh migrator to the best uh web 2 vampire it's essentially creating a migrator application where you can log in with your existing web 2 social media profile and then be able to migrate your profile by creating a new profile and even migrating your previous bus into the lens protocol also 5000 for the best marketplace for rents nfts uh so here we are looking also creativity efficiency and usability as well uh most creative five thousand four most creative use of uh ml so machine learning uh so you could create different kinds of algorithms follow algorithms recommendation algorithms uh collect algorithms 5000 for the best feed algorithm 5000 for dial tooling and that could be helping dows to create uh dial lens accounts and make uh from multisig and 5000 for graph explorer it could be dashboard visualization something like etherscan but will be more of a lens scan so it's all it's one hundred thousand word of bounties so it's going to be very very interesting a lot of things to do enjoy and have fun thank you thank you so much tony and i know you went through a lot of the prizes uh very fast but uh but you can kind of take a screenshot here just it's a big breakdown of everything that was just said so in the first second third place prize and there's going to be a lot of tracks so this is the front end track with 50 000 in total for various different categories and modules and then a second track for protocol specific things where you can create different modules and different variations of how you would think about any world uh with how these modules should be changed from how web 2 is structured so it's 20 000 for this side and then there's a whole big massive section on tooling uh tooling just gets me excited every time but uh there's a lot of things you can do here in any of these categories to win any of these prizes and don't worry this is not the only place where all the prizes are you can head over to our prizes page which i'll link uh very shortly to get all these details including documentation and links and uh even videos on how to get started so next up i want to talk about live pier we'll have page from live here talk about all their prizes i'm pierre and i'm going to talk to you about the prizes we're offering for building the future of decentralized social media with live peer do you think video is core to the future of social media want to create the next decentralized twitch youtube or tick tock live pier is web3's open and decentralized video infrastructure layer and we make it easy for you to store and stream video in your application as a presenting sponsor for lf grow live pier is offering 16 000 in prizes 4 000 for the best web3 video creator social platform like youtube or instagram 4 000 for the best video streaming social platform like twitch four thousand for the best short form video social platform like tick tock and finally four thousand pool prize for projects that integrate with live peer remember you need to have completed a live peer integration in order to be eligible for a prize we're excited to see what you build and we're here to help sign up for a product session with me or time with one of our engineers to help with your integration good luck have fun awesome so just to summarize uh livecare is offering 16 000 in total one for best social creator platform one for best streaming social platform and best short film video so there's a lot of video related things that we can do here and there's also a cool prize 4000 which means anybody who uses uh live peer will split this amount equally then we have polygon studio so the best social media adapt built on polygon will be receiving five thousand uh the best app that uses uh web3 identity uh as its core will be receiving 3000 for the first place and the best implementation of polygon affinity design in adapt will receive 3000 and the best following five dapps that leveraged polygons specifically will win 1 000 each then you also have lit protocol which is a way to think about how do you actually make give consent to your data across different audiences so the best private data solution on lens will receive four thousand dollars for using lit uh then we have the graph uh and the best use of existing sub graphs uh and integrating that into a new social network world receive 1500 and the best new subgraph creation as part of this event will receive two thousand dollars in total the first place gets 1500 and the runner up gets 500 and we also have chain link offering four thousand dollars in link tokens to the top five project or five thousand dollars uh into top five projects that use chain link for their projects and then we have ceramic and ceramic is uh offering two thousand dollars with the best social app that also integrates ceramic uh network and the sdk into their app for managing data and the best integration that uses nftd id account types will also receive two thousand then we also have two cam protocols so two can protocols offering four thousand dollars in total for the best use of tools and networks that sort of bring in carbon markets on chain uh especially as part of these interactions and this is going to be an exciting one to see how people think about using these things uh in in new ways of thinking about web3 platforms and just to kind of summarize all these things are available on lf productive google.com prizes you can see all the details documentations and boilerplates for getting started with all of these protocols so finally before we get into our our summit i want to just remind everybody to pace yourself we really don't want this to be exhausting for you this is very much about learning and experimentation we really want you to have fun so uh we're kind of bringing in new technologies and protocols to see how everything uh can be in the future and this is an event where 500 of you are going to really try every different variation of everything that you can see that excites you so uh without further ado i want to welcome and congratulate all of you for being part of this event happy hacking and i will see you all on our discord and with that we are ready for our summit so we have an amazing day packed for for all of you uh just to give a quick overview we're going to talk about just jumping into uh what we think about the future of central social media looks like with legions tiny and biology shooting watson uh we're going to give a more detailed technical architectural interview of how ledge protocol is set up we're also going to talk about other ways to think about new ways social networks should grow from protocol site and what we can do to extend them then we'll talk about just how we think future of on-chain creation and cooperation looks like if you have a social identity that can be uh commuted and composed uh we're going to have juan vinay and jonathan don't talk about just unstoppable thoughts and how we actually think about data preservation in this context of everybody having access to everything always on chain and we also want to talk about just the impact of how we think about public goods and carbon credits and climate and how that integrates with web3 specifically with social impact at scale and lastly we're going to talk about how anywhere from tooling to collaboration to ideas that we can think about on making it easy to work with dallas so uh let's get started i want to bring on uh our three amazing panelists uh steinkirchev legion from various involved universities 29 as our panelists um i want to welcome all of you here i'd like to ask if you turn on the videos and now we'll talk about our round three of basically decentralized social media this has been a very active conversation we've had with a lot of you here and uh kind of the goal is to kind of finally see that this is now being put into action uh a lot of it from our learnings from these chats before and uh i want to quickly uh ask everybody to give a quick introduction on themselves on who you are and what you do so i'll start with uh lee um i would love to kind of understand uh who you are for the audience uh to know and then we'll go with biology and study hey everyone um lee here and i am a general partner at variant fund we are a first check crypto fund investing in the ownership economy really of the belief that crypto enables digital ownership which facilitates new user experiences across the board in a variety of different categories i've been a consumer investor for many years i previously spent four years at a16z covering consumer networks including social networking marketplaces and other kinds of multi-sided networks and then um i left in 2020 to start my own fund investing in the future of online work and the creator economy so it's really nice to be here with everyone today amazing um apology would love uh you to give a brief intro sure yeah um i'm belgium of austin former cto of coinbase uh former general partner at anderson horowitz investor and a bunch of web three things tweeter and without further ado starting um i'm sonny kulacha from the uh founder and ceo of aves so um we're a team that we that uh builds and creates web free protocols um and and over the past years uh i would say past five and a half years i've been building uh decent as finance and and now we we have built the lens protocol and kind of like creating more tools for developers to uh build the uh the future of flip tree uh social um i think myself as a kind of like a more of a technologist and and uh curious community member uh and i'm super excited about the uh the hackathon here a special hearing that we have over 500 hackers which is insane so yeah that's that's my introduction pleasure to be here well we're excited to have all of you here so i want to start off by just kind of uh being just kind of understanding how each of us interpret that when we said essential social medias this means different things to all of us and kind of just jumping right in i want to start with biology and kind of get your understanding on when i say decentral social media when somebody says this how do you think about that and what does that mean to you sure so i mean the way i think about it is if you think about bitcoin bitcoin's back end is open and paypal is not you can print out every bitcoin transaction that's ever happened um everybody in the world can do that with a computer an internet connection just download the blockchain and do it but you cannot do that for paypal it wasn't set up that way only the paypal engineers have root on their database and so that's why i think of what blockchains are is they're the next step after open source you go uh they're not just open source you also have open state and open execution open state meaning the back end is open and public basically every um every record can be printed not necessarily every row in a database it's not a sql structured thing but every every record in the blockchain can be printed and it's also open execution where if you run a node um you are able to see every op code and insofar as people didn't trust a ranking algorithm of some kind the decentralized social media implementation of that people could run the equivalent of a decentralized twitter node or facebook node to actually interrogate the opcodes and actually see the ranking algorithm is not shadow banning them or biased in one way or another way or or that it is and so once you have an open back end once you have open state and open execution here's some things you could do for example if you had a properly decentralized twitter you could print all tweets you could load them into a database print all tweets at a particular string print the entire social graph sort every follower by the number of tweets they like you could do sentiment analysis you could send antenna encrypted messages to other users using their public private key pairs and perhaps most importantly you could integrate this with every aspect of your back end just it's basically sits next to your postgres because your slice of an open state database is actually yours you have root on it it's more like your space on aws or github than your space on twitter it's much just locked down much less restricted by api so that just completely changes how you build because so much engineering time spent maintaining flaky integrations with these social media apis which can basically just de-platform you at any time and and protocols are just much more much more potentially reliable and stable than that um and and that's that's what this this space means to me amazing i think you'll end up prefacing the rest of the the set of questions as well did you go deep into any of these topics but uh what does that would lead like how do you think about this thing and how much of this do you agree or disagree with about your speech or about disagreeing nuances on yeah i i would echo everything that biology just mentioned um i think it's interesting to consider decentralized social networking um in contrast to the current state of social networking which is extremely centralized um so today the state of the world is one in which there's essentially a very small handful of centralized social networking companies that effectively control all of the means of content production and distribution for all of the users in the world and that really is predicated um or is due to the fact that the data and content and basically like all of the identity and relationships and every piece of data created by these users is privately owned by that handful of companies rather than being publicly accessible as an open utility or through that open state as biology was mentioning and so the implication of that is that the existing social networking paradigm is actually quite coercive where as a participant in this landscape if you want to be able to reach people or participate in content creation that reaches anyone you really have to go through this handful of centralized gatekeepers in order to do that so i think of decentralized social networking really as the opposite of all of that where um if we start with the base layer of open state then you could have many different developers all building different applications and interfaces on top that showcase that information in different ways and compete with each other to offer the best user experience and there could be a proliferation of different discovery algorithms or different content moderation approaches that really serve up different types of social experiences to users so i think that's a really exciting vision of the world and the implication then is that users would have a lot more choice and agency in the systems in which they're participating absolutely and uh and stunning without further ado okay i i i definitely think there's like uh kind of like what what's been echoed is that uh you know decentralized social media it creates a lot of uh choices uh choices for the users choices for the developers and you know the way we have built that too is uh we got this like enormous efficiency by uh centralizing a lot of data and making it as efficient as possible uh and then using that data to basically um uh knowing and understanding what the users want and and and selling them to and the the kind of like a uh difficult task here is that you always need to follow this particular model uh when you build a social media uh business or application and you don't have many choices there so what decentralized social media uh helps especially from the builders perspective is that you actually can as a builder when you have this kind of like a social graph as a public good and you can focus on actually building that particular user experience that you you want to achieve or a certain use case or or maybe certain kind of like um i would say build an application with certain values for example maybe you are more interested in building more humane social media or making it more private or maybe the future of social media for your user base might not be uh what's your reach of followers uh in the crab uh in the in the graph but maybe um you know the quality of those followers and how much engaged there are and when you would have to create a new social media application from those perspective you need to build this big platform effect uh and and to compete with the users and get those network effects and in web3 social what i uh kind of realized is that if you make you know this particular piece as a public good and everyone is pretty much sharing resources which with each other the networking the data what happens is that you can just switch your focus on on whatever you want to build so you have more choices as a builder but at the same time it's kind of like a waterfall effect going towards also to the end user meaning that as a user you can start actually voting with your uh i will not say voting with your feed i would say voting with your wallet uh and your lens maybe profile uh amongst those applications which actually serve you the most and that might be the user experience you're looking for on the same content distribution platform or it might be just an algorithm you prefer more to use even within the same application because you are not uh stuck anymore on building towards the same uh mode for example you might have users that are more interested in actually discovering new content uh or maybe just getting more uh deeper content on particular uh topics and this allows developers to actually you know like maybe first time ever to compete with with big social media uh platforms like um twitter instagram and and facebook and so forth because essentially everyone who is building on top of uh same graph are actually growth hacking for each other and that's like the kind of like uh uh value proposition from from my perspective and there's a lot of lot to be said about the ownership so you are essentially uh building something that is owned by the users uh you want your profile uh you want your connection with the with the audience especially with the uh nfts and and then you can actually take the take that audience uh kind of like elsewhere or you you can meet them in another application so there is definitely like a lot of advantages there and also compatibility maybe now that we have this common uh i would say like a graph maybe we'll see applications that uh couldn't be built before because no one is actually invent to social media sharing those resources uh on on this kind of like a scale and i think that's a very big opportunity for for now all the developers who are building social now absolutely i mean i think we're we're all sort of echoing similar themes here which is a good premise to think about alternatives and uh an anabology you've written a lot on this in the past on just anyone from how to exit twitter to uh just what a good alternative would look like so maybe my kind of question to you is what do you particularly disagree with sort of how existing web 2 large kind of consumer social platforms are set up with and what do you think they can do better we kind of understand the sense of resistant argument but what else kind of goes in in that sure so you know censorship resistance is one way of thinking about it but i think a better way of thinking about it consensual resistance seemed like more of an edge case much less so today but an even better way of thinking about it is in terms of digital property rights and one way of thinking about that is in the 2000s um the deal that social networks were offering seemed too good to be true or amazing deal because you know you had free they gave you free distribution to everybody in the world and hosting and all of these content creation tools and you just had to bring yourself and hit some keys and relative to the 1980s for example or even the early 90s when distribution was very scarce and you you know to be on tv was this huge thing now anybody could you know stream on youtube or post on blogger or twitter or facebook or what have you this was this huge huge huge thing so initially that was a great deal but as time went on um now that's become actually sort of considered the standard package and now what has happened is basically rather than being neutral platforms these platforms have a huge thumb on the scale and lots of people are you know whether it's youtube's adpocalypse or their people are getting down ranked in search results or you know there's various issues where as more of life has now gone digital people don't have a share of what they're creating and they don't have control over their digital presence becomes more and more more important as becomes a larger percentage of your life one question i ask people is what percentage of your hours are spent your waking hours are spent looking at a screen and people you know realize wait it's actually more than 50 often for many people for many information workers so most of your life your remaining life will be spent in the matrix in some way and if you don't have root over the matrix if you can just be boom just basically locked in a box in that matrix and all the doors are closed and your money is taken away and you know you're silenced like that scene from black mirror where the guy is just mass blocked and nobody can can hear him anymore that's actually possible if somebody has root and then those people wouldn't be able to hear you uh and and you just be totally powerless and so you know against that uh the alternative is people to have control and have economic rights and that control means private keys and the economics also means private keys so it's it's both the freedom and the prosperity those are kind of you know they they go together people talk about the freedom in terms of sensory persistence but it's also the prosperity in terms of digital property rights the reason that's so important is crypto creators will be so much bigger than even internet influencers because they get a direct cut of what they create billions of people are not getting a cut of what they create when they do they're going to create a lot more of it and it's going to be a lot more useful because they're going to be doing it in return for cryptocurrency and not simply likes and rts and so on and so forth i think the internet looks very different when that happens um and i think we need to accelerate that absolutely no i think and by the way if leave sunny if you any of you have any things to add on just feel free to jump in i don't want this to be like a take your turn type of it's a setup uh but i think you touched on a really awesome uh kind of theme here and lee you've written a lot about this as well which is just kind of how does this turn uh everybody into an ownership sort of side of the economy here so i'd love to hear your thoughts on what changes in this world and how do we think about marketplace versus social labs or are they the same in this context yeah so i really like to ground a discussion about um the shortcomings of the existing social media platforms in kind of the concept of user freedom where today it's the fact that network effects the combination of network effects plus closed data is a recipe for user coercion and a lot of people will say but creators and users are free to just you know exit from these platforms choose not to use them you can delete your facebook account whatever but i think people who who say that users have a choice i think it's actually quite hollow because there is this pool towards these platforms because they control and represent um so much distribution and network effects that are proprietary to these platforms and so this has created all sorts of issues um for users and creators in the current social media paradigm i recently wrote a blog post called the creator economies in crisis kind of outlining really the parallel um the parallels between the gig economy and how it's turned out as well as the creator economy where the gig economy had made all these promises to to the supply side about being your own boss um kind of being free to work on your own terms whenever you wanted and obviously didn't quite live up to that because the platforms the apps controlled really every level of detail of how the supply side actually was able to work ranging from pricing to intermediating the customer relationship to determining whether or not you could even work on the platform at all and a similar set of issues are now arising on the social media platform social media platforms with respect to creators where you have this exploitation of creator labor this underlying insecurity because the algorithms and discovery is really controlled unilaterally by the platforms as well as intermediation of all of the relationships with one's audience and the result of that is that you have this entire class of social media creators who exist in this kind of state of economic peril where they at any moment can lose their livelihood and access to their customer base so i i think that's a huge issue today um so i very much agree with biology that like the current state of um the creator economy and the economy that has arisen from these social media platforms it's it's not just about freedom but there's a huge part of the economic opportunity that is lacking because people really don't have a choice in the platforms that they're participating in uh absolutely i think uh maybe one kind of question that we get all the time is um if uh nobody disagrees with anything that's that said but i guess the question is like how do we think about whether it's psychologically or from an experience standpoint how things would look like if everything was tracked and it feels too transactional like does that take away any of the experience or how people look at any from consuming information to interacting with uh anywhere from their peers to their friends like is that an actual fair kind of counter to uh having everything tracked and just being being on your own sort of mercy of understanding how you parse that information because it exists there's both good and bad about that i think um the good is that all of these basically unmonetized actions people are you know if you think about it like the netflix co once it's something like our competition is the time you spend you know having a drink of wine with your significant other or something like that right and that's because basically there's 24 hours in a day and they're just essentially fighting to take as much of your time as possible and these loops are built to be as addicting as possible and that is something that benefits that centralized company and you know the thing is on the one hand you can appreciate how hard it is to build these companies it is really hard but then you can also you know appreciate that it's actually extremely um difficult to uh to have something where you know you've got a loop like that which has been optimized for addictiveness on many people and it's draining so much time and then not have that be compensated in some way and so so that's a good part is now people actually get compensated for their time the bad part is as you say things become more transactional i think on balance though there's some good to that too and the reason is so much on social media is empty posturing so much you know is hostility and so on you know it's funny like when my friend said wow there's all these you know if i was a teenager there's all these famous people you know that are online and what do people decide to do when they're kids a lot of them decide to just troll these famous people rather than go and be like hey you know i'm also into art and this is a great artist maybe they can you know teach me something and here's you know like that's like a much more positive kind of thing and i think you could you might be able to get more of that if there's more mechanisms for economic alignment as opposed to simply like zero-sum status right and so uh so that's those are some of the things i think about where i think on balance there's certainly negative some relationships become more transactional we'll probably see also uh once everything has a price um you're going to see a lot of things that you didn't think of as being priceable now have a price like sentiment you know people will be able to trade memes and hashtags and so you'll be able to short and say this social movement i actually don't think it's going to have staying power i think people are going to basically sell on this and probably that'll be like a like a social market alongside it lots of unpredictable consequences so i can't say i know every you know aspect what's going gonna happen i think on balance it's probably better to add some degree of scarcity to the mix here because otherwise that scarcity is hidden and it basically exists as root on somebody's server um instead of put that back into people's hands yeah i want to add there because uh it's it's actually fascinating because like normally when you look at how uh all this kind of like battery uh platforms work you know you have databases and you know you have data in in someone's in one company's database and it's valuable you know but that data is valuable for for kind of like a dats uh party and and the stakeholders that that is that the data is shared and and essentially uh what happens is that it's the users that are constantly giving up that interactional uh data and and kind of like uh signaling what uh you know what kind of things uh you like in life and it's a vast amount of data but you know the value is captured there in in my opinion so i have this like one theory that the value is is going towards uh those stakeholders and and this uh monetization system and the users like we kind of have built previously a system where you know the users are there to use the product and and they're the customers and we're just shifting in a place now uh and an environment where actually it's you know these networks and protocols built for the users uh and it's meant for them and the value should go you know back to the users and and and it's really interesting because uh in uh blockchain what what is happening actually you have you might have the same information of value as you would have in a traditional uh data systems but that's data is kind of like you know it's um accessible maybe but also it's in a uh ledger that is distributed and you might argue a bit even like in a way that's uh because you have the same data in a distributed system uh and you know that you have this kind of like a um transparency there but also the access rights for example that um you might be able to transfer that value or interact with that value or you as a member of the community that builds a bit more uh value into that and i think uh uh there's definitely a couple of uh issues here one is that you know we in the web 3 we transact quite a lot in public we love transparency uh and we love seeing new information and and what people are doing and using then then it's kind of like up to us building applications and use that value in a way where uh we uh create better applications for us better user experience but also like use the data in a way it's beneficial back to the users but in the first place we're already getting part of that uh value anyways but if there is for example an application that it has been built on top that actually for some reason um you know you know you're not aligned uh with how the algorithm processes your data or uh like how it collects some infor additional information it's so easy to just uh change the application and have the similar experience so i guess like taking that uh big player the the social graph and and and decentralizing a lot of components of of social media it creates a an environment where you know those platforms and values they have to compete so you actually are competing uh not only of the user interactions but uh with their values and you want to be aligned with the users because if you as a you know um social media application developer uh you're not aligned with the users uh you will essentially lose them to somewhere else because it's very easy to create a new application when when you have this kind of like shared resources and i think this should some way drive the the um this kind of like a competition on you know listening the community more better and and also the the users you know maybe now it's time to actually even the off-chain algorithms to to actually kind of like express uh what those algorithms are what kind of data they use and how they are actually good for you and if you don't do that what happens it's someone else will do that and they can spin up very quickly and i think this will this is the radical kind of like a change here that we have the opportunity from the developer and user level to actually uh create a new ecosystem to make things better and uh you're not tied into the system and this is something that's um let me mention that um you know if if you lose your account in in twitter kind of like for some reason or you're afraid that's like your living hood but now you have the you have the basically the the value and it's up to all these uh applications to show you how you can get most out of it absolutely yeah let's say i think maybe a question for lee and biology what what would you say the ingredients are for like a really good alternative that's crypto and web3 native uh for just think about new social platforms and i think they'll cater us for the rest of the the conversation what are the or what are the are they out there that's right the ingredients for a good alternative to a web3 native social media platform i mean i i do think the single most important is crypto identity whether it's ens or solana names or um you know like orbit or a bunch of other things that are out there right and um the reason for that is if you you know we're gonna probably need a better term than connect wallet uh because it kind of sounds like this thing's just gonna drain your money or whatever right probably gonna you know need something like that but if you've seen like web one web two web three like web one is username password web two is log in with google facebook twitter linkedin etc then web three is currently connect wallet meta mask or something like that that portable identity is way more important than i think many people think because when identity becomes portable back-ends become liquid like you could have the if it's truly one click and you could truly log into a new service as easily as you load a new web page that means the billion user tables suddenly become liquid these gigantic ice blocks that are facebook's database and twitter's database of all these users where there's lock-in those all become liquid and can flow between platforms potentially as easily as just clicking and we you know the thing is that when you talk about something like that it's kind of like the transition from taking photographs with you know cameras taking photographs of digital cameras at first digital cameras were clunkier in some ways than normal cameras they had worse resolution if you remember the first iphone camera that wasn't the first digital camera the first iphone camera was much worse than a typical but it was portable it was everywhere and some people used it a lot it got better and now it's way better right and so the same way like once web3 identity hits that flipping and it is you know it's got you know millions of users now hundreds of millions of include all holders i don't know how many millions of ens users are but once that's there and once you have like services are built for that first um eventually and it'll take a while because a lot of momentum in these things by 2020 not 2025 but let's say late 2020s maybe 2030 you have a crypto phone where that's built in and you have identity that's actually you know fundamentally on your private keys and people wonder how it could have been any other way because your identity is linked to your money and all your digital property and how could we have ever lived whereas on corporate service once that happens now exit digital legs it becomes much more powerful that means these big services don't have as much lock-in need to actually you know fight for their bread every single day which is good when it's a huge corporation it should be doing that providing a service to people and then what happens is that's why i said you know what's the scarce resource of each decade right the 2000s it was bandwidth and the 2010s because of social is attention the 2020s i think it's block space just figuring out technically how to put all this stuff on chain and then when we've liquefied every single big company back in with web3 in the 2030s i think the scarce resource will be loyalty that's to say every single community because people can leave at a moment's notice they're going to actually need to provide something that is more than simply utility they're going to need to provide value to their community and i think so that's where the 2030s go that's loyalty so seeing ahead a little bit uh yeah thanks for the alpha there's a good post uh one of my friends wrote this called the billion user table on this uh john stokes wrote this post which explains that this is a little more detail one quick follow just just as you kind of talked about entity or you just like is the argument that it's a propagation game and not anything else like are you just fundamentally saying we just need more people and that's when you can actually do a mass mover or is it okay i mean well i think what's here's the thing you can do and this is something i've been thinking about at i what i want to see are vampire attacks on you know twitter's like user base facebook's user base like linkedin etc like in the sense of just like you know sushi swap like you know i'm pro unit swap um you know i think hayden's a pioneer and so on and so forth i think in a macro sense it is good that that vampire attack occurred because it made you know you know swap to like a token and so on kind of good things happened i think overall as a function of that right you know when when protocols compete you win right um and so like effectively vampire attacks once you get to a certain scale you could do something where let's say you have a million people with an ens social network or sns social network or something like that urban social network whatever that is that's working right um they all have 100 friends and so they could decide okay this thing is working we what's our growth strategy our growth strategy is we invite the heck out of our friends and we do the following um uh proof of sperm okay so proof of spurn um means that you are posting let's say a tweet or a post or something that is like your last post your tombstone post on that social network and so long as that's up your tokens or whatever vest in this new thing but any further action that you take publicly on that social network means that you haven't actually exited from it right so something like that would sort of be like you know proof of exit or proof of spurn or something like that where you spurned the old web 2 network for the new one and if you get a bunch of people to do that collectively you're like you know moses parting the red sea right you get collective exit collective migration sort of like the mass migration of people to miami just you know sf is done and now we're all moving together right um and i think you're going to see something like that online uh where it's like a community migration and then social networks actually start becoming community aware because there's a culture to that community once you have tokens integrated with social networks you know right now you know like people don't really care if someone moves from twitter to facebook to instagram whatever they don't really have a culture but people definitely do care if you move from bitcoin to ethereum to solana to something else like that once crypto tribalism is integrated with social networks those are truly online digital tribes that have a lot of community and association and i think that's going to be very important for the world to come both both in positive and negative ways amazing i i i think this is like a perfect time to kind of think about or rather ask donny on just what made you start lens and can you talk about sort of just overall um how do you address all these things that we brought up uh and historically consistently been brought up about the the criticisms of existing social platforms yeah i well the the start of the lens i i think it was more of like an accident in the sense that we uh we were um kind of like helping out in a in a uh nfp auction contract and realized that um actually one of our developers realized that you can like be on the current nfc standard there's a lot of things you can actually do a lot of cool things um and uh if you innovate on on the smart contract area and from there kind of like we noticed that uh one of the ways to do you can actually uh of course any organizationality profiles but also you can create dynamic content dynamic entities and essentially we ended up testing a model where uh you have this kind of like a follow nfd so uh if i'm following uh balaji i'm the number one follower the number one fan i get the token id one and if there is let's say ten thousand followers uh you know all of those follow relationships are tokenized nft so if i go into my any wallet uh open c and look at that follow nft it reflects kind of like the latest content of biology so if there's a picture of a cat and reposting a picture of dog the content changes so essentially like we realized that uh actually like trying just having this experimentation um you know you create this um kind of like a permissionless distribution channel between you uh and your audience and this could be a pretty cool thing for uh wider web 3 social and of course like in our team like uh battery social was something that's uh was very fascinating uh and and and you know we're always looking what to innovate in larger uh that 3 space because we see kind of like the free space as an economy so there's decentralized finance but also in economy um you have e-commerce you have social you have greater economy and all these different parts but you need like a value network to transact so whether it's whether it's like a monetary value uh or social value or something you know that we didn't even realize that is considered valuable until we put it in uh on chain and um i think for us like uh approaching the whole like web3 social uh was somehow um important to approach from developer perspective and and see kind of what kind of idiot ideas we will have because what they learned from the the ave protocol experience previously in in dfi is that you never you're never like building by yourself you're building as a community and ecosystem and you you basically want to uh grow together and that's kind of like i think uh lens protocol is very fascinating uh protocol but i'm pretty sure the the stuff that will be built during this hackathon will be way more uh cooler and our protocol becomes the boring uh kind of like a back end and i also like expecting that people will build those uh migrators or vampire attack in a some very classy nice uh way amazing um lee i think i want to tap into something you said earlier in one of your answers and uh i mean i would love to kind of get a glimpse of what you think the set of opportunities is in web3 to kind of let people choose their own algorithms yeah i think obviously um in the past few months and years there's been a ton of criticism over the existing state of social media and whether they take too heavy of a hand in content moderation or to light a hand like they're blamed for all kinds of social ills and events that have transpired in the past few years really because there is only one content moderation policy that can be upheld at a given time on a given platform and it's built in this very monolithic way so i think the opportunity is really for users to be able to choose among a set of different options available to them in terms of type of content they would like to see type of discovery experience they would like to participate in and ultimately choose an experience that maps to um like that maps to their beliefs or views and and degree of um discoverability and content moderation i think that is that is kind of the north star goal of decentralized social media i think there's also obviously a lot of um downsides to that potentially as well that probably don't get addressed often enough which is you know if the existing social media paradigm has created all of these filter bubbles then a more decentralized social media landscape would probably enable that even more where people would opt into the set of discovery algorithms or the set of content moderation policies that best corroborate their existing viewpoints a thought experiment that i like to pose to people is do they believe that existing social media platforms have prolonged the pandemic usually the answer that i hear is yes like you can imagine a world you know pre-social media in a world the current world in which we do have social media in which world would the pandemic have lasted this long or would the pandemic be longer and most people agree that social media as it currently stands has proliferated misinformation about the pandemic and the vaccine etc so in a world in which users are opting into their own algorithms i'm not sure how to solve a problem like that to be honest um i think it's one of the open questions around the next generation of social media yeah the tricky part this i'd give kind of a couple of comments on that one issue is that it's not that like necessarily centralized governments did so well on it either right like that's you know one of the issues is that um you know especially in the west people either react with apathy they react with apathy first and then panic right they only have kind of two modes and so like the sober careful like okay let's do vaccines but not say it's just the flu nor triple mask after vaccines that sort of like you know kind of scientifically reasonable sort of thing was was not as much there and um so it's not obvious to me that the centralized authority will get the right answer if it gets a wrong answer it's catastrophically wrong and so you might tolerate um some people getting it wrong in order for at least one of those solutions to be correct there's more system robustness even if there's more loss in an average case there's less loss in an extreme case and you know the other thing i'd say by the way is you know with spanish flu in you know 19 you know 17 19 18 ish um that was something which was heavily censored by governments it's kind of the opposite of today because like states were gaining power at that time rather than kind of losing power that media was centralizing rather than decentralizing and it was actually a much more lethal virus uh by everything we can see like about 100 million dead you know cover 19 is not nothing it's going to be about 10 million dead worldwide you know oh when all said done if we're lucky and no nasty new variants arise that's still pretty bad but it's not 100 million dead we're fortunate it was exponentially ramping in the early days but kind of stopped around like 7 500 dead a day as opposed to 75 000 where it easily could have gone and so the thing is we but but the spanish flu because it's so censored people kind of didn't even remember that it had happened it was sort of literally orwellian like kind of memory hold wiped out and it wasn't a common point of reference and so on because governments at that time thought oh if we have control we should censor it to stop panic but lots of people died and we don't know maybe it's because like we've run an experiment um perhaps covet 19 would have spread to more people and we would have not gotten a vaccine on time had you know like folks not taking prevention measures or maybe maybe it would have been exactly the same you know the counterfactual is sort of hard you know there's folks who do this thing at this at the country level and they'll say oh well sweden had this policy others had this policy but really what you want is actually a huge table with individual cases and you actually want to diff that against you know the pharmacogenetics in the background and so to see what actually you know or the immunogenomics rather like what variants might have made you more or less susceptible tldr is i'm not sure that you can say that the kind of very powerful states that exist in the 1910s did a better job um maybe they would have been better but i think they have much higher downside risk if they get it wrong so that's my counter-argument lee not not gain saying anything you're saying but the counter argument is centralization has catastrophic risk when it goes wrong i mean i think what we're sort of getting to is that obviously there's well to kind of back up a little bit i think it's going to be obviously hard to know you can run these types of experiments uh counterfactually or or rather just look at that and change some variables and see how this would pan out but we we kind of i guess are agreeing on the fact that at the end of the day this is more about how people get to choose their own adventure um in in this kind of world whether it's a billion people and building rows existing in a single place and everybody having a slice of how they want to experience something or just being able to understand like what uh this would mean if they were to ever exit or just wanting to get more control um and kind this kind of leads to the question of like i mean sounds like we've done this thing with identity and and once you get to skill everything is a social craft at the end of the day uh and it's even more powerful in terms of things being actionable uh for uh in kind of what three so is this something that i had like any of you uh agree or disagree with uh if so like what do you think the set of the opportunities are because i feel like one thing i want to reset everybody on is every time we say we need a new social network people think it's a twitter or facebook alternative which um kind of mentally thinks uh puts us in understand this is like a tax communication platform and but there's other different ways of thinking about media platforms it's just like what does that look like and and sort of what do you think about just social graphs at the end of date that are web 3 native maybe sony you can pick us up sure so i've actually thought about this a lot and i actually think people don't understand that web3 it's not just people calling it web3 it really is the third web and here's why like let's say the first web the dub dub dub you know that's an open web and google could index that it's actually very difficult to index the open web it's non-trivial but you can do it with crawlers and and so on and for example you need to do things like you have a fine amount of download bandwidth and you have to guess whether a given site is going to update and then spend that crawler bandwidth to go and download it and maybe it only update a little or not you know or a lot and so you have like cisco prediction algorithms just for whether to recrawl a site and so on and so forth and actually crawling is a very complicated thing and it's a million different formats and you have to do wrapper induction all the stuff it's if it's a database populated you know page how do you know you've got all of it are you breaking the web app by crawling it et cetera et cetera and then the social web is even harder to index because it's on facebook and twitter and linkedin's servers and they don't want to let you index it linkedin did lose the high five case where scrapers you know now in theory can index linkedin but they're still not making it easy for you in theory individuals can do like a data export but really it's not just data that you want to export it's your identity and your connections others the social graph it's not just you as an individual that wants to leave it is you plus your social graph that's your community your subculture right and so what what people don't get about blockchains is up until this point they've mostly been hosting financial data and it didn't look like you know web 1 or web 2 data it didn't look like you know html pages or social pages but now it's starting to as block space increases you have things like dso and mirror and you know urban and capsule social like essentially you have decentralized storage of posts and identity and other kinds of things and the consequence of that is actually profound because among other things it radically simplifies indexing one way i can prove this is already going to be a big deal is anybody can set up something like btc.com or blockchain.com or blockchair.com or so on you can set up a block explorer it may not be as good as the production ones but you can do that because that gets back to the early point these are open state services the back end is open right so anybody can set up a front end for them and that's already happened in fact multi-billion dollar businesses have been built as block explorers either scan and blockchain.com and so on and so forth that shows that the concept of an open back and where you build clients for it is super powerful so the thing is that indexing because it's easier searching web3 is way easier than web owner web 2 because rather than that crawler problem where you have to go and ping a bunch of sites and you know so on it gets all pushed to you you just get a block every whatever seconds you just get a block of all the updates imagine if you got a block of all the updates on the dub dub dub right that's insane now of course they have lots of pointers out to them you wouldn't necessarily you know the data availability problems non-trivial thing to solve but we're solving it that's why i said block space is the scarce resource of this decade it might take a while but we are solving whether it's zero knowledge or many other scaling techniques will be solved in different ways in different times now you have this super parsable thing you don't have to do all this inference maybe you subscribe to a bunch of different chains but still it scoped the problem in a much much easier to solve way and you get something else that i think people underestimate you have a web of trust integrated with everything okay so your digital signatures is a first class field in every single blockchain that you're indexing in this way and what that means is you know like so the social web had some of that of course because you had identity but you still have fraud you still have fake profiles and so on and web one is even more plagued by this where you don't know whether a web page is written by a human or an ai or something like that that's why google search quality is dropped off to such an extent that's why they've just relied on pure money as the ranking algorithm where more and more of the time their first page is festooned with ads they don't have the sort of non-commercial community signals that's why people will search on twitter or reddit rather than google increasingly to find people real people talking about this but now with something where people are effectively signing their social posts their other content with their ens or their sns or their other identity you now have digital signatures as a first class feature that's huge and they're open they're not like the closed social web and you can also of course include the balances of these users to see how real they are you have a much richer set of signals for effectively integrating the social web with the open web with now the financial web which also makes more money and i think google has been caught completely sleeping by this i think facebook might be the only one that survives maybe twitter uh as well because they've actually you know facebook said they're doing nfts with instagram zuck still runs his company and twitter is actually pretty crypto aware but the others that have not been making moves on this google hasn't even done a block explorer which has nothing to do with you know issuing a token or anything like that i think they're actually in much bigger trouble i'll say one other thing which is a big chunk of google nowadays with google search is actually queries for recent events they don't actually show the historical stuff if you may have noticed it's hard to find historical stuff that means that if it's recent events their index is highly biased towards things that open state platforms which are less than a year old a large fraction of searches on google will move to new clients so they're much more vulnerable than people think because the full scope of what they index and the difficulty of indexing it may just get transformed you know sometimes the way to solve a problem in math is you just define the problem differently right you know and and so this problem has now been defined in a different way research becomes easier it's got more signals google doesn't have the core competency around it and and they could just get boom disrupted like this the directions already happening in block explorers but they don't realize how important that is amazing um no i think that's that's the alpha leak not not that block space argument um we are at time so i'll just do two quick questions and then we can call it i want to respect your time uh maybe just one question that actually just came in from the audience and similar to what you just said biology but i'll have anybody kind of come in is we're obviously seeing twitter and facebook and i go jump into uh integrating nfts and just other kind of web three primitives um do you think uh like how do you think about competing with them in that world like do you think that's an advantage to them or do you think that solves them sort of prolong uh their their relationship with their customers or is that that doesn't matter because somebody will overtake them that's what three native i think about is that question for me or leave i just i was like i'll keep that open it's an audience question i think uh i want to make sure that from a time standpoint anybody who wants to take the first step can go for it yeah sure i mean basically i think i think twitter and facebook i mean crypto is kryptonite to large companies right so because it has risk and you know what's much scarcer than budget is risk budget okay because budget you can kind of make more money but risk especially like regulatory risk pr risk like larger companies once you have an average of many people once you have more risk-averse people in the organization it's really hard to take a risk i i respect zuck a lot for taking you know even if you know i think that they should have started actually i said this at the time they should have started by just integrating bitcoin and ethereum you know into whatsapp with like off-chain payments or something like that that's what they should have done rather than starting with uh you know like libra dm but i respect him greatly for trying that when they were already under a lot of scrutiny like only like a founder actually has the risk budget right so companies that are founder list typically don't have risk budget and uh risk budget is you know this thing is like on any on any accounting statement they'll show the reward right they'll show the financial return but they won't show the risk that was taken to get that return that is not actually accounted for it's invisible to people many times and that's where there's low risk and high risk returns and so i think once you think of cryptos kryptonite to most large companies i'm actually much more bullish on you know frankly places like india israel outside the us for the most part as well as small you know startups and stuff within the west because they don't have the baggage there's a huge internal immune reaction from a lot of web 2 companies either both their their executives and their customer base against web you saw this with you know unfortunately with discord with kickstarter with other companies like this um people will make you know also the kind of neutral argument hey we can't afford the risk right whether they agree with it or not so i think for the most part with some exceptions like those two maybe they'll make it and in fact if you look at the history of silicon valley very few companies have actually made the leap between technological eras you know microsoft apple are unique in terms of like reinventing themselves every decade but lots of other companies like dec like gateway computer they're big in one era and they just miss the right angle turn for the next one right so we'll see but i actually think a lot of them are gonna are gonna fall we'll see yeah i'll just add to that um for the person who asked this question i think the exciting opportunity in my view with blockchain is to actually build social networks that couldn't have existed in the previous paradigm so social networks that would have been impossible to jumpstart from a network activation perspective or to get past that zero to one stage i think that is the opportunity that now exists with blockchain and tokens um and so i would worry less about or think less about um being constrained to more skeuomorphic social networks as they exist today and adapting that for crypto and more thinking about um what entirely net new social networks could exist that that currently don't and that might sound quite abstract so i'll give an example i think one of the open opportunities still remaining in social networking is to build a local social network like you know 20 years into the development of the internet we still don't have a view into what is happening in a 5-10 mile radius around me there's no app that i can open where i can see in this moment who is around me who's doing what what is happening in my neighborhood in this place where i am and many people have tried to do that but the amount of network density that you need to reach in order for that for that experience to be valuable to any given user is so high that i don't think any app has ever gotten there and so i think that is an opportunity and perhaps the solution to that is leveraging tokens to get that level of network liquidity sorry go ahead tell me i just want to mention that i i think what's significant significantly different now is that you know many of these you know social media website social media platforms they they are very big but i think what's what's going to happen is that um when we have a a kind of like a decentralized graph and uh you you lower the barrier to enter to the competition of building applications and building uh user experiences and it it means that uh as previous you might need like a bigger theme to deliver a social media application and build something now you might need just maybe one two developers maybe we'll see from this hackathon something very very interesting building a couple of weeks that's uh very exciting for the whole um you know social media space so it doesn't like lowering the threshold is where kind of like we bring more people to compete and build applications and and more people to use them uh as well so i think like uh i would not say that's uh like it's hard to compete against the the uh the the the bigger participants and stakeholders especially when we're in a situation where uh it's so easy to build now a social media application which means that there's more and more innovation when the when the kind of like a bar to enter is lower and it's the same in decent just finance you know it doesn't take much of actually uh building a protocol it takes a bit time but essentially even improving a protocol might take less and there's like less financial kind of like a security risk on the smart contract so i could imagine seeing a lot of interesting stuff coming up and and when you have this innovation coming from everywhere it's just like a constant remix culture so when you look at open source development it's always been remixed culture like linux distributions and everything it's all it's it's all remix absolutely yeah let me say one thing which is i half agree with lee and i have disagree and i'll say why right so part i agree with i absolutely do think that new kinds of social networks will be built um and i think that they uh i think many of them will involve finance as a first-class feature because every user you can assume every user in a crypto social network has a balance and can send encrypted messages where you couldn't do that in normal social networks just like instagram and and snapchat assumed you had a mobile device and open to the camera whereas facebook and twitter started out as non-mobile so they were built around a different set of assumptions right so i definitely do think new kinds of social works will emerge with that said somewhat related to what standing was saying like the back end change to a web3 social network is so challenging that and gives actually so many benefits because it makes it fully programmable like the early twitter and to some extent that early facebook were that that uh what people might just do is essentially have almost exactly the same client like a familiar client that everybody knows and just put all of their energy into innovating on the back end and making that actually work first and then kind of the new things would sort of come out of that so without gain saying what you're saying i think that would be the like sort of the like an engineery you know mindset approach which is the front end has been debugged people have figured out what rts and likes and so on are freeze that have that be exactly the same and just open the back end and put all your energy into that and developers will then take it from there and innovate on other kinds of things that's like one approach um and you know different folks are trying different things farcaster diesel all these folks are trying different things so awesome well i think this is a perfect note to uh to end this panel on i want to thank all three of you biologist donnie lee for taking the time and also going a little bit over oh i've i've got a little announcement uh uh well i just all right i'm just tweeting it now boom okay new book coming out uh and uh if you probably everybody here will like it um new book how to start a new country it's finally coming out you can pre-order it now arrives on july 4th um perfect so it's uh my top tweet right now so if anybody in the chat wants to see it i thought i'd save the best for last um and i got a nice little blurb by mark and vitalik and brian and so on so check it out i'll be out in about three months oh i will pre-order this right now thank you so much and uh i really appreciate this all right thanks everybody thank you so much okay so with that we are ready for our next talk and that is us going a deeper into how the lens protocol is set up so you can actually learn about the internals of what you can actually do from a graph standpoint and uh without further ado like to welcome david and josh to go into all those details josh david appreciate this and uh i'll let you uh get started awesome thank you thank you so much let me get our little presentation up here uh gm everyone my name is david uh i'm the product manager for social over at ave companies and that includes lens and i'm super fortunate to be joined today uh by josh uh josh stevens he is one of our amazing leading lead back-end devs uh who helped create the lens api which we're going to get into uh later today we just want to give a quick overview of the lens protocol uh you know why we built it what you can do with it uh what are some awesome things you can hack on it try to give out some ideas some alpha as well as what the lens api is why we built it and and what are some of the things you guys can build with it um so without a do let's kind of jump into a quick overview of lens protocol so you know why did we go out and and build lens well web 2 social media is broken um networks they sell your data um i think this is mentioned a lot in the last session but you're paying with your personal information uh to get distribution there's no such thing as privacy the reason you're not paying for facebook you're not paying for twitter is they're taking their your data they're turning around and selling ads um and additionally your data is not portable as a creator as a user i am bound to the network i'm working with um if all of a sudden facebook or youtube decides to turn me off for any reason i've lost my audience i've lost my content i've lost my connection to my fans and and that can spell the end of a career um in addition i have no ability to go between uh any two services um it turns this uh you know this this social graph into a moat uh whether or not the app is better uh if i'm a startup and i've created this really great new user experience these new fair algorithms or something that people like uh i have to boot start this you know jump start this graph uh and i'm at a huge disadvantage even though i have an objectively better product and lastly user data centralized right we we've all seen what happens when large databases exist they become targets for actors uh act bad actors things can get hacked data gets leaked never a good situation uh the last thing we need is is is more scams uh and more hacks and so the goal with lens is to use web3 tools uh to bring power back to the users back to the creators uh and really change the game theory of web of web to social it's currently zero sum uh you know facebook only makes money off of data in their system as does twitter uh as does tick tock and they're all incentivized to really lock you into those ecosystems build in positive feedback loops uh using web3 we can turn on its head and we're going to do that um with lens protocol um we're going to allow developers to build apps and tools on a singular composable and decentralized social graph so so what does that mean it means that we are going to have all of the data built using nft technology owned by users um on on a permissionless blockchain um you know we are we are currently building on polygon our test nets are on the mumbai test net we're getting ready to go to mainnet soon and it allows app developers to focus on the user experience on a ui ux and content moderation um rather than user acquisition and for creators and users you own your links to your audience you own your content and you own your monetization um and if you don't like a certain platform and you want to go elsewhere it's as easy as clicking currently today connect wallet um i agree with whiplash you said the last session of hopefully we get better terminology so with that let's let's dive into a little bit of of how lens works under the hood what is the actual kind of infrastructure that that we're building um the first kind of key primitive is is the profile the profile nft um if you've ever worked with unstoppable domains or ens very very similar we have this this nft that represents your profile it's got your handle for example i could be at david josh would be at josh uh it lives in my wallet i can have multiple in the same way that when i'm on twitter i have at david e silverman my nice fancy professional account and and a couple of anons where i like to you know post post things that i want to keep personal um it's minted upon creation um i can have other metadata on there maybe a bio um but i also have this special array uh that i can fill with publications um this is where i kind of post my content to and we'll come back to exactly what publications are are in a minute in addition it has another field called a follow module and we're going to come to that a bit later as well the next thing we have is is following um we represent follow with a follow nft um if if my wallet davidev.eth wants to follow at josh i'll i will execute that transaction using lens uh and i will receive a at josh follow nft it'll say that i follow at josh um it will have an a token id based on the order i followed it so i'm his fifth follower and it'll also have a reference to his latest publication which is really interesting because it means when i go to try to render this follow nft in any wallet whether that be you know rainbow or even a smart contract well like gnosis safe or i go to openc or zapper um it's going to resolve to whatever his last publication was which means every single wallet uh has now become a distribution mechanism uh for for my for my uh for me as a creator a content creator in addition these follow nfts have built-in governance and so every creator has a built-in social token just without the erc20 um let's say josh uh tweets out a bunch of really great developer alpha he you know he he publishes out a lot of great stuff on salinity he can pull his audience you know should he be should he be doing on snapshot you can say i want my first 500 followers you know have them tell me uh if i want to do uh some more stuff on on maybe ave v3 or if i want should be diving into alchemix v2 and his how let his audience kind of decide what he wants to build we then kind of get into what a publication is so a publication uh is just really kind of a a bunch of metadata that says where to find content and and some things about that content um lens takes it's completely agnostic as to where the actual data itself is stored you can reference a place on chain you could also reference ipfs ar weave uh ceramic you could even reference old web 2 a url or or an s3 bucket um and that just tells you where to get the content and in the metadata you can fill out anything as you normally would you can even say what application it's posted with you can also add this thing called a collect module which will produce a collect nft this allows any publication to be turned into its own standalone nft where the creator kind of defines the minting logic let's say i post this really great image uh of a recent trip to london um my i can set monetization i want to allow you know anyone to be able to collect this that's our term for mint for one eath um and when they go through and pay me the one eighth all of a sudden they have a collect nft in their wallet uh exactly mirrored from the original publication i can even include additional logic uh for mirrors mirrors is how somebody retweets uh so if somebody wants to share my content let's say i post that really great image of my trip from london and josh decides to mirror that on his own feed and somebody collects it from seeing josh's feed i can actually specify a certain amount of that uh mint fee to go to josh's wallet and so we can actually even incentivize curation entirely on chain um publications come in in three types regular posts which is uh the plain use case i've posted an image or i've posted a piece of text or i've posted a video using live peer um it also has this concept of comment which is um a reference to another another publication as well as some additional content so i can comment on someone else's uh image with a with my own with a with my own image maybe it's a meme with my own text this is a great image or again any other arbitrary content and the last type of publication is a mirror just a simple reference uh that's the same thing as a a retweet or a share or two uh formulation now as a as a web three developer how can i kind of build in interesting uh extensions to lens well lens kind of has these things called modules and they allow you to build arbitrary logic onto uh onto lens protocol and they come in three places and they they are really powerful the first one is the follow module and this is set on on a per profile basis the follow module it runs it's arbitrary logic that will run uh and it has resolved to a boolean yes or no to let you know whether or not a follow nft is minted so when mywallet davidev.eth tries to follow at josh his follow module will run and using some series of conditions will decide whether or not me david e v.e the wallet is allowed to follow him and we can do really powerful things with that right i can say that only people who hold certain nfts are allowed to follow me maybe i want to restrict it to certain nfts on polygon or i could even use a chain link oracle to say you have to hold an avax warrior on avax or a board ape or a punk on mainnet in order to follow me um i can make it payment you have to pay me five eth to follow me uh i could make it you have to have some pull-up or been at these different events you can make it as complex as you would like uh any of these so long as it kind of just comes back to a zero one value additionally you can have that follow nft go to a smart contract you could use that to you know build out subscriptions if you don't top up this contract every now and then uh you know one with five matic every month um i'm going to pull away your follow relationship and now we've built kind of subscriptions the next one is a reference module and this is run before somebody tries to comment or mirror my piece of content so i post an image let's say uh via my david profile if uh at josh wants to try to comment or mirror uh the reference module will run on a per-publication basis and decide whether or not remember a boolean answer at the end whether or not josh is allowed to reference either comment or mirror and again i can do simple token gating uh only people with 32fwb are allowed to reply to my content uh only people who have certain nfts are allowed to reply to my content and i can combine this with other higher level integrations a really interesting use case would be what if i wanted to build a completely private social network uh on top of lens well i could have the actual content in a publication be stored in ceramic encrypted using lit protocol another sponsor in this hackathon and i could have the the access control uh b you need to have at least 32 in your wallet to get the decryption in order to see what the post is and i can also have the comment collect uh and mirror functions all require that i have 32fwb in my wallet at a given time and then the only people are allowed to engage with my content view you know i'm sorry read and write need to be in my community and so that's that's reference and the last area is collect i think collect is really the most powerful and that is logic that is run to decide whether or not this kind of collect nft uh this nft that references this original publication uh is minted so the example is i i post an image and i can say you know for one eth this gets minted out into an nft that you can control i can set a cap hey here's you only can do this five times uh you do this five times with incrementing uh so the first one is one eighth next one is 1.18 we could also do really complex logic and community has really jumped at this we we have a the community wrote one that does defy aware nfts so i will sell my nft for 5matic but before the transaction completes it takes thematic deposits it into ave and sends the a tokens uh to the creator so now creators have kind of you know self-driving nfts um we have another one the the great folks over at um at klima came and built in the refi collect module um which you could even extend the logic further and say hey take some of the you know look at how much gas this transaction used convert that to carbon offsets take some of the incoming um the incoming funds convert it using toucan to base carbon based carbon token retired on chain and now my entire transaction is carbon neutral so that's some of the stuff you can do with collect and different ways for people to build on top of lens and what our goal with lens is to really foster a broad diverse and evolving social ecosystem fully composable and transferable on-chain social graph you can go from one application to another you can bring all of your followers you can bring all of your content you can bring all of your nft and nfts and it's composable to any other application whether it be nft mentors whether it's defy or other blockchain applications that are yet to come can build on top of these existing tools that we're building follower nfts allow for social dows and new types of social tokens governance mechanisms including snapshot delegation and compatibility with ave governance as well as governor bravo are fully built in and lastly the real key thing is modularity we allow developers to focus on the experience and the front end and leave the network effects to the protocol you don't need to create a bootstrapping plan you know as users start using any application built with lens your application has access to all of those users as well we call the protocol lens as the lens plant enriches the soil around it and allows other plants to grow around it and that's kind of our view from the ecosystem changing from a zero-sum game that we currently see in web 2 to a collaborative sum game in web 3. now in addition to just the web 3 um you know the web 3 hooks that we have with modules josh going to talk to you about the lens api which is something that we have built at ave to allow solidity 3 solidity-free web 3 social development josh cheers david um bear with me i have got covered but i should be okay um so yeah we have um built a api for all of this so if you're building a social media site uh the key things that are super important is you know speed um you know if you're on twitter etc etc if you lose that speed it becomes unfun uh scalability um and traceability all these things are super important to be able to get to um now we were building an api anya for our own internal needs but we thought why not share that with you guys so the api is it abstracts all the complex things about the the protocol away so as david's been talking about how many amazing features there is um like modules different kind of modules that take in different input parameters all these kind of things um the api abstracts that away to a simple enum uh with you know standard stuff to pass in if you want to enable a reference module that only your followers can comment it's a boolean and it will construct the data for you the sign type data and then you just send it on the client so uh it's more of more of a helper tool and a traceability tool um and we think it's super important that you know if we're going to build the next social platform that we have tools so web 2 developers can just focus on building a say board ape community or you know anything like that without having to understand the protocol completely because it is you know quite overwhelming with how many features there is um so that's the idea do you want to hit the next slide david um so build front ends fast with the lens api so you don't have to worry about indexing or querying the data or re-orgs or speed of fetching the data and everything's done super quick so we have an indexer watching the data we index that data so we can grab it quick um and when you get a publication back all that data is extracted for you if someone said hello world that data would say content hello world it would extract the um module for you saying you know they have a fee to collect this which is naught point nor eat um one if uh and then you have a simple way to be able to construct that and redeem it with another function called collect so all these things allow you to um you know really just focus on what you guys need to build and want to build um you don't have to deal with any real data so we have crons watching the data making sure that the hash still exists and then removing them away um from the queries if they if they don't exist anymore uh we have full caching layer on there to allow this to be super quick uh you know the the queries are really really fast you're gonna grab everything that you want um you know some of this data to grab is super complex like you know a publication can include you know how many times it's been mirrored how many times it's been collected how many comments it's got a publication is an unlimited pointer so what i mean by that is you can have a post and a comment and it can go unlimited depth and it can keep pointing and pointing and pointing so um being able to scale that like how facebook and twitter do really quickly to have that user experience is super important um you don't have to worry about pre-filling the contract data or validating it and what i mean by that is we have these website methods that where you know you just pass you want to collect a publication and all you literally do is pass the publication id it will construct you all the type data for you it will a validate that you conform to all the modules as well so say you have to follow to collect this publication it will validate that for you and throw a web to error saying hey you don't follow this person so you can't collect it does that for everything for uh you know if you don't have enough balance if you don't if you haven't proven um enough for the token uh all these things allow a much better development experience where straight away you know all that's gone wrong with the program or what you know and this person doesn't have enough balance et cetera et cetera as i said before it's a web 2 style interface so if you go to the twitter api it's super easy to just go and get all the followers or you know following yes it's heavily rate limited and but we took inspiration from the kind of you know the web 2 interfaces and just as easy it is to get the followers that are on twitter it's just as easy to get the followers that are on lens uh it's just as easy to grab all the publications it's just as easy to get everything a user has collected um and all these things is super important for growth for the lens protocol um and i think what one of the biggest things is there's not a huge learning curve you know the whole api is built using graphql uh you know it's super easy to fetch what you need when you need it um and you can just focus on the stuff that you want to build so all the documentation is is there for you to use uh and yeah we're super excited for you guys to use it and give us some feedback about how it helped you or how we could improve it uh yeah it's uh super cool awesome thanks josh a few other things i want to point out about the api that i think are going to be kind of key and also point a bit about the strategy we're doing with lens you know the first thing is we want to give web3 developers really awesome new powerful tools to build with um some of the ones we're super excited about are these defy ware nfts with collects we're really trying to see what people can do with follow nfts and this concept of social dowse um on the web 2 side right we want to make things easy and approachable for brand new developers right not every single person wants to be an expert in solidity or should be an expert in solidity the reason web3 social is going to win out is because we're approachable for everyone and that is really the goal with the lens api we also want to make sure that every single application built on lenses on the lens api is going to get a top-notch set of features so beyond just access the full social graph there are built-in queries for for search for timeline for explore common pages you may want to put in a social graph in addition you know we have it we have a data science team the same kind of app you know we've we've kind of said that avi is working on its own front end the same algorithms will be powering that are going to be ported through the api so as as those algorithms kind of get built out and improved your application will gain from that as well we think that's kind of a big thing we want to help out not everyone's a data science expert you can kind of pump in from an existing awesome data science team and the last thing is really making easy to use tools so people can focus on novel and unique um experiences we want to abstract away the blockchain for developers who may not be familiar with it and that's really the design goal of the lens api can i just have one more thing just to put it into perspective how much easier that it makes for you um to unfollow someone actually to do that you have to burn the follower nft of that profile now that profile itself every profile has their own follower contract address right and you could have minuted three or four different tokens in there and on chain there's no way to go hey how many tokens do i own of this without looking at the insta indexer but with the api you literally just go i want to unfollow this profile it'll construct all the data for you it will do all that all the joins that needs to happen and all you do is sign and send that transaction and then you can follow that person that's just one of many examples where it really helps the development of anything that you do on this protocol definitely a big thing i also want to i want to shout out is you know we have our bounty tracks i think i think you know we teased this at the start of this session we're really looking for people to build front ends on top of it i know there was a uh some some people talking in the chat like is there a reference ui well we hope that people build a reference ui there's been a couple of great tools uh in the lens community that's been built so far inside of uh if you go to the lens discord um i think there was there was a simple explorer a profile creator and a way to build statuses and that was running on our on our test net um for anyone building please make sure you use the new test net um we're looking for protocols people who are going to build some really novel interesting collect modules reference modules and uh follow modules i think there was a a brainstorm session we were doing in the uh in the voice chat of discord and somebody was talking about it they were thinking you could do you know on-chain private dms with read receipts using custom collect modules uh lit protocol and ceramic um not saying that hits a couple different sponsors for the hackathon and partners maybe it's a cool thing to build um there's tons of really awesome things that that can be built here and on the tooling side we want to make it so that this is still a friendly place for developers um you know building explorers building vampire attacks to help the entire network gain from stealing users from instagram twitter snapchat uh tick tock i'm probably gonna get in trouble with legal for saying all these names but i'm i'm calling out targets we want we want we want these uh you know we want people we want everyone to kind of gain from web3 social show that there's more use cases for blockchain than just speculative tokens and then lastly you know stani said earlier in the last session you're never building by yourself but you're always part of an ecosystem and we've learned this really really early on with lens the community has jumped through our bounty program and built more modules than we even built as the original genesis team and has given so much feedback we had to redeploy a brand new test net just for this hackathon to make sure that people were using the most up-to-date feature set um and so we really encourage as you guys are building please provide feedback what else do you want to see in the contracts what else should we be putting in to all of these different uh to all of these different uh primitives or you can write updates the primitives yourself you know um come help build this next generation social graph and same for the api what else do you want to see in this api how can we make your lives easier as developers how can we make this community grow how can we do it all together how can we really help this ecosystem so you know we we are we are going to be around uh all week in the eighth global uh discord we're gonna be in the lens discord we're gonna be on twitter um to really really definitely want to want to hear from you on what we can do best um so that's uh you know that's that's lens at a very high level um as always you can reach out to anyone on the team for questions feedback and comments and we look forward to seeing what everyone here builds and we hope you guys have a great hackathon thanks guys um carter sending it back over to you hey we're back kartik broke away from the had a little technical issue there so we're going to go to a quick break thank you guys that was awesome much appreciated and um everybody we can uh hold for just a couple minutes till our next talk comes thanks everyone [Music] [Music] all right sorry about that i just uh i had some technical difficulties on on my end everybody um i think we are a little bit ahead of uh kind of uh we're a little bit ahead of schedule here so what we'll do is kind of take a quick break and a lot of you've been kind of watching this for a good uh two hours already with the logistics and the last panel in the discussion so uh while we wait for the next set of speakers to kind of join in and get ready for our next talk we will take a quick five minute break and uh and then come back so uh we'll just kind of put on timer in the meantime enjoy some little five beats and we'll see you all very shortly you all right welcome everybody hope you had a good uh quick five minute break and with that we are ready for our next talk so next talk we're going to talk about what does it mean to kind of get more creative on building on top of lens and for this panel we actually have three uh amazing people so we have rich ramon and simon from we3 and they're going to be talking about all the things that you can do and how you can extend uh your creativity with with lens so without further ado let's welcome all of them here on stage unless and to turn their videos on and i'll let you all get started hey everyone uh nice to meet you um i think we should we just get started kartik absolutely yes also uh we should have flipped the video on so at the live stream you can see as well one second just going to the start of our slides okay um give me one second uh can you see at least my slides for now yes okay um [Music] okay cool um so okay uh rich simon are you guys ready too so i can kick it up absolutely go for it okay cool so uh welcome everybody thanks for being pro this is talk number three four uh so still staying with us and excited to have uh quite a few folks here to kind of like listen to what we have uh uh brought to you today um today it's a lot about kind of like what can you do with lens and what like how to think differently about what products or innovation you can build on top of it and uh kind of like what where where this could lead so i think we already heard a lot from stani and uh josh and david of like what lens is so i shortly just kind of like want to introduce us in the call and maybe rich and simon once you talk you maybe can just introduce yourself very shortly who you are and kind of like what you do but uh i'm ramon i'm part of we free we free is a web-free design collective so we're a bunch of designers who realize that webfree is growing exponentially and it's one of the most interesting area for design to come in because it's early because we don't really know yet how to use it best because it's still hard to use and so we came together and we realized there's a lot of space for making the space more accessible more inclusive uh opening it up for the next generation of users and we we primarily do this through helping through product and uh brand strategy product design and brand strategy and really help kind of like building narratives from like early ideas to actually bring it to uh the market uh maybe a little bit of how we got involved in lens just to kind of like as a little bit of disclosure we have been working with them since quite a while in the background to really shape the brand and the the brand itself of lance but also kind of like help expand what lens could mean for the ecosystem i think stunning was saying is like it's really about building an ecosystem and so what we have been tasked to help out in the last few weeks is really kind of like pushing the edges of like what lens could do in several places and really have to kind of like shape that so with that i would love to shortly talk about why we or we believe or i believe social graphs matter or what social graphs are um being a designer in that space i think it took me quite a while to understand what the hell is a social graph why does it matter and i i or we use the metaphor of kind of like it's a little bit an iceberg so like we know social media we know news feeds we know friends list we know that it matters to have friends online or being able to connect to them and like write with them through messengers but it's really kind of like just the top of the iceberg that we really see here and there's like there's so much data and connections and content or connections that below the surface that are part of the social graph that are not really accessible for us but they're also kind of like the bread and butter of like the traditional web 2 platforms like facebook twitter and all of that so kind of like think from for most people that coming to the space talking about the social graph it's really just kind of like the top of the iceberg but like what is really exciting is like what lies below that and what we mean with that is like that basically everything has a social graph right when we started to explore lens it was a lot about like is this social medias is this a new news site is this a fee this is a friends list like what is it really and the reality today is that basically everything that web 2 touches and potentially web free will touch too has a social graph has a social component where we connect with each other being it from sending and transacting from one wallet to one wallet kind of like following someone's on chain activity to kind of like the more traditional web 2 applications like twitter or all of that so when thinking about where lens is going i think one thing a wrong button is this is bigger than decentralized twitter i feel like when we start to ideate in this space we often end up with decentralized twitter uh a new news site it's like the the go-to things and we really wanted with this kind of like exploration and what we're going to show you today to kind of push what what an open graph can enable for an ecosystem itself what we what we mean with this is that it it's about how the a news feed is curated what we're seeing there but like we start to zoom out there it's as much about music movies and entertainment right we share playlists we get recommendations we play together we watch things uh let's play video on twitch together so it's kind of like all of those has a huge social component how we kind of like connect with each other and do things together and like that can be even broader in the sense of like uh in in the realm of like uh matchmaking so like it's it can lean from car uh creators matching to create something together on tick tock through a duet to kind of like actual matchmaking through dating to finding collaborators in a dao so like a lot of those are built on social connections and and doing that so it's like web free is already inherently social and we need to get to the next step there and that can and i think like when we think about where social graph can be helpful it's as much about social media the metaverse governance shopping working gaming it really can encompass all of this which makes it sometimes really hard to start but also kind of like shows hopefully how broad broadly applicable like a protocol like lens could be so with that we wanted to kind of like highlight what are some core challenges that we think we can address through new new experiences and new product design and one thing is there's a huge chance to kind of like give more power or control uh to users so we surround like with web 2 facebook twitter snapchat you name it tick tock we surrendered a lot of power and control for convenience right we give away control over over our data with sign in with google and now we have wallets so like we're really kind of like in the state of empowering the user again but like this empowering is also kind of like frightening but like it's actually really kind of like a new paradigm shift for social media that you're in control of your social graph of your connections and that you can shape it and control it and that's quite a novelty so like the question for us really should be so how might we balance the control and the power that we gain with kind of like also ease of use through better ux and ui design here so that we still get some of that convenience back number two that we think is super valuable here is like around uh insights and the the reality is we have a information asymmetry in the current uh social graph world right uh platforms like spotify like google like all of that they have a ton of data on us and we might potentially even have access to that but it's really hard for us to understand and acting on that like so platforms often more know about ourselves than we do and i think with opening up the social graph now of that again this power of insight this reflection and understanding can shift back to us so kind of like how can we use web-free on-chain activity this general more transparency in this space to to give not just not just to create more trust but like also more insights about ourselves so what if if those open graphs that we talk about kind of like really allow us to understand and reflect about ourselves our communities and new ways next i think it's important to kind of like acknowledge that lens is a protocol not a platform and i still stole this one from one of my favorite paper called like i had platforms uh protocols on the platform but i think that this kind of like idea of like portability that you're able to choose how you experience content or being in control of that or moving moving your friends list or your friends list is moving with you and doesn't have to be established again it's quite a big change in like how we understand like uh open graphs itself so this idea of portability is not novel for us i feel in web3 where we have wormholes where we have talked about crosstrain and like we're trying to figure that out but like this idea of like that social media is not a unique universe a world garden but it's more like the marvel cinematic multiverse or things coexist and connect with each other i feel is quite a novelty and like so thinking about this what we're going to talk about is kind of like leaning into the last point is the more power we have the more we understand ourselves and the data that's established through those places and kind of like we create more portability that allows us to completely rethink what a front end could be like how we interact with it right it's like if you don't like how what data you get out of the front-end or if that could be more like you you move on you build your own and like that that is a quite normal approach to kind of like go often also going a little bit more back how the internet was like a long time ago so what this allows us to do it's kind of like it allows to kind of like lead with better design because there's more competition hopefully more choice and like also oh not everything has to be brought you can also design for for niches itself so with that that's kind of like a little bit an intro how we got excited about working with lens itself and like why social graphs matter and i'm handing this over now to uh rich and simon to kind of like dive a little bit into uh some clusters of ideas that we had so far rich simon i'm going to mute myself but please free to move on nice um thanks ramon um yeah so we've got a few ideas that we've been uh tinkering on you know obviously such a such a big space such a big area so much opportunity of where to innovate so where do we begin um well we've sketched out a few um ideas that we'll share with you just to get the juices flowing and you can consider these as kind of like interesting territories to explore um some of them are really kind of like the natural breaking points of where web 2 social media sort of breaks down or where you might find the cracks there um and other areas are really where sort of web 3 enables us to create something net new um so you hear us talk a lot about what ifs we'll be sort of posing a few questions i really really these are just kind of prompts against which we think um would be interesting to explore so you know let us know what you think riff with us ask questions and throw ideas down in the chat as well so let's uh let's dive right in yeah absolutely you're going to hear a lot of what ifs from us for the next little while so so settle in but we're kicking off with some ideas around uh lens tooling because uh when we're we're building something new here something from the ground up which means that you know we get to start pretty fresh we get to set up the tools and the systems that help make us make the most of that sort of like green pasture of new social um the issue is right now much of today's tooling for social is completely boxed off it's like pretty hard or impossible to change or to interact with so it's it's really exciting to start to think about breaking that and giving users the power of the tools that make the most of that new social so we've been thinking a little bit about some tools that people can create to get the most of their lens social graph and if you give it a little scroll now we've got one here all about verification because right now the verification is controlled by social media platforms and not really the communities that grow into them or grow to use them and that can like stifle the innovation or it can lead to even verification being a centralized platform swim cough cough blue tick uh so what if social media verification meant more than just being a real person what if it instead sort of captured any kind of label that was meaningful to community or to an individual or set of individuals it's like broadening this kind of uh this idea of verification to an extensible system of tags that could be attached to you know users to communities even to posts would help us open up a rich new set of experiences so again some what ifs like what if a distributed fact-checking community could tag post that's researched and evaluated as like trusted maybe what if a curated collection of articles written by award winners could easily be created and automatically kept up to date what if an idea could even be traced back to its roots and its tree of posts and replies and lastly what if a company's online profile could be tagged with this global carbon footprint but speaking of influence and that sort of like sense of meaning to community how about kind of getting a sense of where you as an individual community stand in your graph yeah so um another thing we're sort of thinking about is really the you know what's the default visual expression or sort of the visual viewing paradigm of your social media experience and you know today the typical just to give it some context so you can sort of understand you know where the ideas are coming from but the typical viewing paradigm really centers around like an infinite feed of content um that's designed by the businesses and the platforms really to drive as much engagement and uh as much consumption as possible and i don't know if you guys have seen the social uh dilemma but uh the guy that you know invented infinite scrolls sort of often regrets kind of how that's led to a lot of mindless consumption so you know things like your relationships and what you actually might learn about them um seem to be things that are really like secondary features in in today's social media experience so you don't really see those things that they're just they're just lists of contacts in secondary features um with something like the open social graph though i mean i think what's interesting here is that because this is these experiences are being powered by that data it's like this ever-growing model that's capturing information about your relationships with people you know groups and communities and even businesses um now that we have ownership over that what's also interesting is that we also have choice or possibility about how data is actually expressed or visualized so you know the question that we're exploring here is uh you know what other ways could you express or visualize your social graph you know what other new paradigms might we create to view your experience and in this little illustration we've got here my digital roots um you know we're imagining something more of an interactive graphical view it's like a sketch uh but of what your relationships look like and um this is something that could emphasize relationships over content so you can imagine different filters and and different toggles you switch on and off to kind of you know explore your network um but you know what else could it do perhaps it could actually help you see the degree of your influence or your reach um or even your exposure to different types of people from different groups perhaps you could also even see like timelines of your relationships and how your connections have flourished or diminished over time and you know perhaps even understand more insightfully like things like your frequency of contact or the dynamics or the interactions of your exchanges with others so there's a lot of insight that can actually be drawn that we're not privy to at the moment in sort of web 2 social media and these are things that could be interesting and when you sort of frame it in the idea of like you know could you actually improve your relationships with people it starts to become quite interesting and then you think about um what could this mean not just to your friendship circle but when you start to consider teams or professional networks like what happens then um and uh yeah to sort of like close out this little sort of territory like ritual sort of uh chime in now on um what tools could be like to make most of your experience with it yeah you give us a scroll there i'm on yeah so right now um you know we're all using the web and we're all subject to these really opaque algorithms that are kind of ruling the current social media experience you know they're deciding what to show or even what vanishes into the ether and what doesn't get seen um by users and we've got very little sort of influence over what we actually see um because those algos are trade secrets you know we're unable to show how the inputs and the interactions can influence the kind of contents that we might then consume so what if we were able to have greater control over our feeds over the way we can assume different media across platforms set our own rules even our own standards our own algorithms by which to kind of sort uh filter and discover that content then the open graph uh not only allows anyone to build their own front-end experiences but also perhaps the very engines themselves that define her content breaks through to the surface you can infuse a point of view over which content should be prioritized and filtered based on different needs and different tastes at your own whim so a few what ifs what if you could choose from multiple open source algorithms or lenses by which you could view your lens feed what if there are easy ways to manage permissions around what personal data a front end might use to personalize recommendations or what if those algorithms were like completely transparent and tunable to the point that you might even be able to jump in and sort of change a change of lever to see what you what you're viewing and then this is a fun one what if you could even flick a switch and have a completely different content experience even like view the world through the eyes of your friends celebrities or like total wild cards from the other side of an echo chamber but that's enough about those kind of foundations that kind of tooling what about what we should do specifically for creators yeah so i mean obviously this is you know when you think of web3 and social media it's very much synonymous with creators and the creator economy it just feels like there's so much potential to create new types of experiences for creators but also for fans as well and i think like we're interested in um also how you can sort of foster connection from nuanced data around tastes and preferences how can that inform empower new types of connection between creators but also between um creators and fans um so if we scroll down a little bit one of the things we're wondering about is the idea of collaboration and how matchmaking could serve um greater collaboration how how lens sort of might facilitate that and to give it some some backstory i mean today you know creators around the world you know they collaborate with fellow artists and writers and musicians and brands to develop fresh content and often it's about furthering reach and actually growing audiences as well as you know experimenting with different types of content and you know you tend to find that it creates new dialogue can bring communities together and all that sort of good stuff but i think what's sometimes challenging is you know how do you find and signal that you're sort of looking for this sort of collaboration whether it's for like a project or for an art piece or for a dao or for brand how do you find the people to work with um so the question we're exploring here is you know how might we use our insights in the open graph to match creators together and catalyze new content and created collaborations so how do we make that seamless more easy and we're thinking about tools for things like audience insight and matchmaking so in our little sketch here you can imagine a creator is seeing different types of of uh potential matches or collaborators that are being served to them and here we've got a kind of like a tinder style where you're where you're seeing different types of folks perhaps matched on certain criteria or content preferences or perhaps it's about you know like how you're signaling certain project ambitions um and then next to that like the idea of like this merged graph so this is interesting when you have like a visual overlay you know what what if you could have two creators that could easily and perhaps visually compare and contrast their audiences um to see where they overlap in taste and preferences but also to sort of see the gaps and the differences where they sort of might grow so these are a few ideas just around matchmaking within the context of creators but matchmaking of course is a theme that is going to run through lots of different verticals as well so you know what as you as you take this forward you know think about like what does this mean across different platforms or even gaming or finding collaborators and dowels to start projects together or even dating um but that's sort of a little bit about the creators now let's sort of think a little bit about uh the fans as well yeah what about flipping that about the sort of the fan experience um because fan engagement is obviously huge for growth um and access to you know maybe if your creator access to the data about your followers um you know or uh is pretty limited on today's platforms it means that you know it could be pretty tricky to have sort of like valuable interactions or even even any it's all discussion to understand the sort of your fans and your followers oftentimes it's even like fragmented across different channels across different apps uh it's really hard to have a sort of central discussion uh to engage in sort of like feeling across different channels so we're thinking about how how might we provide creators with tools and resources better understand their fans even deepen their relationships and really unlock the full value of their fan base and thinking that on the flip side as well how can we also like bring it open it up for fans to basically get closer to the creators uh when you know as their time is valued as well and their their engagement is valued so like lens can potentially enable creators to engage with their fans in any way they want and really get a 360 view of their fan base of their followers maybe giving options to engage or to build connections that otherwise might not be possible so i have some just ideas what if creators could really get reports and breakdowns on who their fans are who's consuming the most content what they love what they like who they from get a sort of holistic view of everyone that's involved and then maybe on a recognition point like what if creators could even recognize individual fans with rewards perks personal experiences maybe and gifts perhaps even some direct contact as a way to sort of thank them for that support and show them that they're a valued fan but then onto monetization over to you simon yeah yeah yeah so um yeah this one's really about monetization commercializing content and um uh you know this is something that i think bugs a lot of creators today and it's very difficult to find a way to have a viable sustainable living on on webtoons or social media you know there's always a few issues at play i mean platforms take a large cut of any profits you make anyway but also creators aren't always just free to focus on their content because they have to worry about how do they beat the algorithm you know how do they climb higher in the rankings in order to kind of better position themselves to monetize um their content and while also having to you know maintain towards community guidelines or guidelines on rules set by the platforms which seem to be ever-changing so it's it's a sort of frustrating loop that i think a lot of creators get stuck in so really it sort of feels that um it's a system in which there are limits to the freedom uh of how you might sort of thrive both financially and and creatively so you know one question we're thinking about for for lens and uh what it could imply for creators is it's really like what if you could release some of that pressure you know um and what if you could put more control and better tools back into the hands of creators um in how they commercialize their content so they can both thrive financially and and creatively so you know um obviously with nfts and the sort of the boom there like creating content on chain is going to enable new forms of monetization uh different systems and and also the way uh that could be tuned and targeted towards different audiences um also it kind of lowers the barrier for new creators to enter the system they don't have to fulfill you know minimum audience sizes and things like that to kind of actually participate and actually enjoy some revenue from their work um so a couple ideas here like one of them is this idea of a dashboard right so monetization dashboard you know what if it was easy and simple for folks to um automate or configure different options or systems by which to monetize their content so in the sketch you can kind of see you know maybe it's an ad model the traditional admiral model that i switch on a match made to brands uh perhaps it's pay-per-view or sort of surge pricing or even subscription and on the right you know perhaps i can just customize each post in different ways for for different audiences maybe there's members i have or early bloomers or just like what is it for everyone else um but also you know beyond this too you know with content sort of minted sort of released on chain i mean um we're also imagining tools that can track content across apps built on lens so that creators can you know monitor and track and receive income or royalties for or attributions for any content that's used by other creators on on lens apps um and then the middle idea here is around membership right so um obviously we're seeing this in different forms on certain platforms like patreon etc but um you know what if creators could design their own membership programs and where they define the tiers of access and different perks and rewards that uh their different audiences might have and um also can they even pull in their audiences or their top fans in into their into their kind of orbit and actually help them grow and incentivize those fans and audiences in different ways with uh financial rewards or tokens so tons and tons of opportunities as it comes to uh monetization um and then now sort of back over to rich for a little bit on uh dowels yeah i hope everyone's clinging onto their seat in this avalanche of ideas but we're getting there but um yeah on to dyers because thousand collectors they're like integral to the the way of thinking even the identity really of this sort of web 3 social world well oftentimes the tooling and front ends that we work with today they're they're you know they're they're uh limited uh you know for for individual use um or potentially even the ones are sort of there's less of a social aspect to them it's more about sort of the hard financials or the governance as we heard earlier we've been thinking a little bit about how dyers can have a sort of collective presence giving them you know almost like a social soul of their own on the social graph so you give a little bit of a scroll there there we go lovely uh yeah so like social media today really is built for individuals um and groups and companies like do have profiles the user experience is you know still orientated really around an individual person who controls the organization's account or perhaps you know maybe a team in bigger organizations and alike as well and those platforms really are not set up at all for any sort of decentralized or ad-hoc communities that may have you know a range of ways of organizing themselves that it might not fit into these so strict buckets so like what if there was uh different voices in a community could come together under one profile maybe one pop-up ad hoc profile without giving any one person complete control and we kind of have this you know we have multi-sig crypto wallets where we can you know let a group of people follow you know a collective policy for transferring digital assets so how about that for sort of a profile if you like for for managing you know a social presence of a collective yeah what if a community could have a profile a publication channel with a user interface that really suits its governance style its tools maybe what if you could have pop-up sort of uh communities around these things what if there was like local fans of uh taqueria in los angeles were able to compete to win the right to post a review under under a shared account and then what if digital native companies could easily distribute control of their social media feed to every single employee so that everyone kind of has an ability to contribute to to the presence on the web and if you give us another scroll there on um yeah we've got a sort of sense of how you can make decisions about identity uh but how do we sort of get a sense of the members beyond just uh you know a pseudo-anonymous address and those have become obviously significant organizational structures in the web through space bringing in completely new ways of organizing communities treasuries voting on change distributing funds but you know they're focused on right now maybe enabling the sort of those financials and the operations um they're becoming increasingly harder to manage uh and they're becoming very fragmented and siloed across lots of different platforms like we all know the discord problem uh so what if tires were built on a suite of tools that really help to integrate not just governance and finance but also a sense of identity and a sense of community and communication and those onshore tools for diaz renault they're you know they're typically centered around the voting and finance like i mentioned and they're by default sort of pseudo-anonymous with no identity no sort of social presence attached to any sort of voting or anything but what if you introduce sort of social connections to individuals and content represented on chain then tools can expand to include that social and productivity features that otherwise you know would exist you know completely off-chain in other different silos so one of those at a dashboard for members that automatically showed the collective interests maybe the authorship and the favorite content of its members what if those had a set tools that enabled them to have one view of their operation their communications solving that discord problem and what if those uh had more elaborate voting systems based on group membership allowing some communities to run in sort of representative manners perhaps with boards of committees empowered to make certain decisions alone we just opened uh opened three sort of boxes just now but there's a lot more to explore and i'm going to bring it over to ramon to take us home with the wild card section thank you so that that went broad um so we talked about kind of like the idea of like an open social graph and how empowering that can be we talked about kind of like building potential new lens tooling that kind of like helps expand the ecosystem system itself we talked about kind of like the idea the ideas or concepts that kind of like to put to evolve to create the economy itself and we kind of like we know that dao tooling is a huge emergent space that needs a lot kind of that that is growing and thriving right now and uh needs this social character so kind of with those things one thing where we wanted to end with or go now is like looking a little bit more and like how could this manifest itself into front-end experiences or looking into that space and so we have a couple of sections here that we want to run through through a little bit to just inspire you to kind of like see how the world is already super social but it can now like where we can hopefully now put a web-free twist on it or make it more web-free native and a big belief we we have a big belief that music isn't inherently social we go to concerts we share playlists we have a deep connection to artists themselves and like we want to like like we want to get like be connected to them we often are more willing to pay to an individual artist a significant amount than to to kind of like to a service so kind of like how can we rethink the relationship between an artist and uh us and create novel music platforms that take this web free mentality of ownership and relationship together and kind of like build new uh primitives uh that are like enable new things to do there i think it's also going there with uh with the the gaming world that is social by default right it doesn't matter if you play alone together in with others around you in in a in a game like fortnite roblox or all of this but like those game become more alive if they're if there are real people around you that you can interact with but gaming is not just inside a game it's like the whole world of of twitch discord all of this this kind of like economies and worlds around games itself that like even in this even in this chat right now we have a chat going on on the side where we have a conversation going on and that we use the prompts to bring into our live conversation right now here so kind of like how can we move from those very broadcasting tools to kind of like more interactive elements and conversations and like that that bring multiple worlds together in novel ways so so one way is like how can we how can play be even more social like what would it be to build the ios game center on top of lines to easily find find friends to play against with like we all probably had our virtual moment in the last couple of weeks where we just kind of like also loved to show up how good we were on twitter or not as me but like the idea is kind of like we love those connections we love to compete we love to kind of like like comp challenge our friends and like a lot of this kind of gaming is super social so but right now it's locked into specific world so can can we do this even make more social and what this makes me also super interested about is like i spent way too much time building up my gta 5 character in gta online and like that is a part of my identity too what if an online an in-game character has its own social graph too and how can we build those world around that one thing that we haven't touched yet but like we want to go back is yes we talk a lot about lens tooling and like dao tools and all of this but like e-commerce is one of the prime reasons the internet access and thrives and grows and like what we know from history is that wherever you establish a market a community will build around it no matter if it was the silk road a marketplace in a in a southern european city that the whole town is coming together to kind of like exchange gossip and news and whatever happens around it like markets build culture right and like even like looking at like the like marketplaces like d-pop or facebook they're in they're extremely social too and i think we can go to the next level like where we can actually see what our friends are up to what our friends are recommending what what they are using right now or not using where we can maybe get early access to it and even like rich was talking about uh rethinking algorithms based on our preferences there's a lot of like ways how we can rethink shopping itself and like let's be honest like instagram turned into one of the greatest shopping malls in all time so like shopping is social so how can we gain the control a little bit more back and like using it for us the other thing is i think we sometimes miss that even the way we work and all of that is social too this talk was created in figma and bigchain right that's how how we at least as our team are working it's like you're following other people around in a file and like you're building connections there too so no matter if they use notion github figma or all of those tools even google slides there's a lot of like social elements and moments that we create and i think again it's it's about kind of like making sure that you find your friends that you can create new assets and all of that together that makes it extremely powerful to think about like what does it mean when we have an open graph and we bring it together with the composability of web3 together with the potential new business models that we can make think through that come through defy and blockchains and generals to kind of like create like rethink work social gaming and all of that together i want to end with one of my favorite things is like i think we it's easy to get super heavy weighted in those conversations and one of our like favorite ideas that we just want to leak here and show here is like yeah around the ideas of memes and a little bit background here is like for me the when i think about tick-tock or all of memes it's like this is web-free culture like someone creates an expression and others start to build on it like memes are composable by default like that's how they work right we're building on top of each other and it creates this ecosystem of reactions and interactions and evolutions and all of those like they grow and like so one thing that we started to think about and even like just kind of like how can we build a social network just around memes and i think that just sure that for us shows um the actual power of lens itself right we can we could build the next evolution of apple music or spotify we can lean into it building a social network but it can be as small or nerdy as just a forkable meme creator on chain that kind of like shows you to build how your memes are spreading and evolving over time and like that that for me makes this super interesting so to kind of like summarize where we ended with our thing is like we we started with that a social graph we really just kind of like at the tip of an iceberg here right we talked about it's really about empowering you us ourselves it's about kind of like that this is bigger than twitter and facebook and covers other things and it's really about expanding what lens can be from visualizing our networks to rethinking about how we label things and organizing it through better algorithm it's about kind of like better matching between creators more insights from our relationships between odd fans and audiences and new business model and also kind of like the whole aspect of community itself so this was a lot of talking from our side and we hoped that we at least could bring up the iceberg a little bit and like show a little bit more potential of like how big this opportunity actually is especially when we start to cross-connect the services that we build on top of it all together um i do think we have a couple of audience questions so i think that's a perfect moment to kind of like close this uh conversation and like hear what are some questions so let's freaking build this together awesome well thank you so much for uh going through that amazing talk and um what are so many amazing comments and how well kind of thought out everything you talked about is as well as uh just overall the the detail of the attention you put into uh preparing this so it was super insightful so the few questions i want to ask and that we'll kind of go to as many as we can uh until we kind of run out of time but uh i i guess so the first kind of question that comes in is from kind of your perspective having been on both sides like what do you think is a difference between being a designer what too and and now what three like are there any specific things that stand out or how do you assess or contrast both i i can't take this one i think like on a crafts level it's not that much a difference but what is different is that you have to think more about building for a community building with others you have to appreciate that everything is composable like if you design a brand it's about you have to embrace memes and that others will take the brand further so it's a lot about giving control away and like and enabling others i think on that one on a product design lens i think the reality is that we have to acknowledge we are still in a super early nerdy stage it's very technical often you you have to understand some of the smart contracts fundamentals to kind of like like especially in the more complicated like defy areas to kind of like really push what design can do and the reality is i think there's just not as many of us designers out there so you can't find that great inspiration first so we need to find more of us to really push what design can do in this field absolutely and if anyone else wants to add something feel free to go for it i'll move on to the next question all right cool i'll do the next one so uh kind of the other piece is uh you talked about uh essentially kind of how you present information and and what will be a good thing about how lens can make that easier but um what would you imagine sort of like the user ends up feeling uh and uh so let's try to read this so how do you imagine the users might feel different when interacting with the web through based social media network um like what kind of different emotions would they do you think they might experience compared to the current social uh kind of norms or just networks out there and do you think this is a different emotive experience too or is it just a different way of thinking about where the data is and who controls it at the end of the day and it's a bit of an abstract question but that that is a great question and i don't think it's one that we'll know the answer to until we start to build stuff right we start to put things in front of people engage reactions um but ultimately i think it's hopefully we'll be evoking an interesting reaction that the whole sense of ownership really is is what what a huge piece is here and hopefully a sense of i guess um i guess a lot of trust has been degraded from some of the sort of bigger centralized or social media providers and i'm curious to see uh and at least from from research that i've done on other projects but how uh how folk are sort of perceiving those current uh social media providers now versus sort of the newer ones which are decentralized by default and sort of you know have a lot of sort of trustless stuff baked in as well so i think lots just lots to see but hopefully a little bit of interesting stuff against the backlash of the centralized incumbents i think two things to add like i really think the the fact that you own your content and you're in control of it and you can decide what happens with it will change quite a bit how we think about what how we create content what content will be created and how content is curated i think we haven't touched that space enough that creators are important curators are the next big thing the other thing is like i actually think rage quitting will be a superpower as like where in the sense of like if your data is portable and you're in control you actually like rage quit is actually something that can be a force for good right where like where if someone builds a better user experience a better way to moderate the content as you wanted to see that has better privacy section it's not like you're locked into a system you quit and move over and i think that hopefully creates a lot of new competition and innovation of like actually exploring what this world even can be yeah big plus one to that a lot of stuff that we heard from lee stani and velazio earlier around this idea of like a race to create the best front end the most novel most interesting and hopefully that's just going to drive a great user experience which we're all excited about great and now we have the final audience question i want to ask and then we can uh get to the next talk is um how do you feel about the real-time distributed collaboration sort of world and web 3 do you think that's going to be interactive like like this this call we're in um or do you think that's more on kind of the broadcasting side where we're like uh twitch where people just kind of consuming what somebody's doing but it's not really interactive honestly i think that the reality is uh kovit and corona the pandemic changed the way how we think about collaborating together right i was at ideo before and post-its were my life and now i haven't touched the post-it for two years and like i do this all through through figma and it changed the way we work before that i couldn't imagine it and like the technology might sometimes still buggy not there but like i think real time async we find new ways and we we use it in appropriate ways right sometimes we want to lean back and just enjoy twitch and sometimes i actually would love to kind of like be the annoying person on the side that can actually influence as an audience twitch for the ones i'm watching playing and i think there will be new forms of interaction that can be enabled through those things and like it's probably like it's not a or b it's a gradient of things that we are enabling here absolutely well simon rich thank you so much for that amazing uh talk and this was just great so thank you so much thank you bye-bye and with that we are ready for our next panel so uh collaboration is a very recurring theme here for today and uh what we're going to talk about next is just what the future of creating new things on chain looks like whether it's music or artwork or anything else in between there's a lot of room here and there's a lot of tooling as well as uh context that we can kind of bring in from how we use tools existing uh in the existing web 2 world and to kind of uh talk about all these things i want to welcome karma dot wave dot olive allen and moderating this chat we cooperate early so i'll welcome all of them here on stage and i'll let them turn their videos on and say hi thank you kartik it's good to be here man how you feeling today it's uh it's great to have all of you here so all right i'll let you take over and i'll get out of the way awesome hey guys what's up my name's cooper and i'm joined by an awesome panel here today we got some amazing creators on board so i want to spend this session really helping you understand what does a creator go through when they're tokenizing work on chain we have visual artists here we have musicians we have curators on the panel and so in this discussion i want to really talk about the creator economy and specifically the tools that allow people to tokenize their creative work so we'll start out with a quick round of intros carmel kick it over to you first and let's go ahead and go around the horn and tell everyone what you're working on sure how's it going all i'm karma i'm a musician music producer and world builder i'm currently exploring different experiments within web3 so that being song camp um that being wave world which is a social garden and really exploring how the ownership economy is going to impact creators and how value flow is going to flow throughout that so excited to be here and get this panel started good to have you here kate how are you feeling today hey i'm feeling good what's up everyone my name is kate i make music as dot i'm pretty new to the web3 space uh currently just working on some drops with catalog and sound but really excited to see what other tools begin to emerge uh for music particularly around uh reaching new audiences so yeah love that and last but certainly not least all of how we filmed this morning hi i'm great um so i've been an artist and created in web 3 since like 2018 since the nfc has emerged um i don't know i've been through a lot throughout the years and currently i'm working on my solo show that opens in new york on april 30th yeah exciting nice why don't you tell us more about that i feel like this is a really good place to start where you can kind of help people understand what does the life of a creator on web3 look like and how are you going to be able to bring that to the masses um i guess a lot of the creator is the same i mean throughout time so you just you know like creating work hoping you know it makes sense you know every single day that's what it is i mean web3 difference is that um time goes much faster right a lot more going on a lot more noise which is good and bad at the same time um yeah i mean as i'm preparing for the show i'm i'm taking a bit of time off to focus i i don't check social media as much um yeah web 3 can be very very distracting because there are so many people from all over the world versus traditional art world when you're just like in your scene in your city like new york l.a whatever right and that's about it but this is like a global economy it's really economy at scale which is fascinating and challenging at the same time yeah i want to start i want to start there because i feel like you being around since 2018 you've really seen the whole wave of on-chain creation platforms so things like foundation zora um super open c you know i could name five or six other ones probably i would love for you to just give a quick overview of when you're thinking about tokenizing your creative work what does that process look like for you and how does that change from when you first started to maybe some of the options you have on the table today well i've been a founder myself um i was building an early marketplace in early 2018 um with mixed degree of success so i understand the whole process i mentioned my first drop in early 2019 on openc and it's been a very challenging process like it has changed a lot since um with the emergence of new platforms that made it easy that um needed to work for creators and etc i i feel like now it's so like i don't know you don't even need to explain how to mean your work it's so easy like i see a lot of my friends be like not even asking before to be like oh my god how are you even doing that it's so complicated so challenging like how do i still metamask how'd that go on openc but now process simplified so much and um it's a delight to see uh i mean there are tons of platforms they're in and there's a new platform like emerging every single day i feel like but uh honestly as a creator um having so much choices i i resort to having my own contract and maintain my own work because i i don't know i i don't think platforms can do as much for me at this point than before i feel like in the early days there were four like main platforms makerspace nifty gateway what else super rare and maybe open c but nobody was like using much for minting uh and yeah everybody knew what's going on what drop is happening and so where to get stuff but now if yeah it's just like if you don't see it on twitter like you don't know what's happening if you miss an email there's so many platforms there's so many creators that what became a challenge even though all the platforms play to be created curated at some points to some degree right like it's like you always seem to plug in 24 7 like not to miss your favorite artist your favorite musician or your the drop that you want to get so and i know a lot of people are only 24 7 and that's a full-time job for sure i mean as you probably know yourself yeah absolutely yeah i would say um you highlighted something really important there which is custom smart contracts i want to come back to that in a second because i think that's a really fascinating conversation topic okay first maybe turning this over to you as a musician who's been tokenizing their creative work can you talk about the process with uploading to catalog and sound and maybe what that experience looks like yeah um i have been kind of shocked actually by how simple it's been um you know coming from 10 years of experience in in like web 2 music industry and dealing with heaps and heaps of paperwork not getting paid um you know having to hire an attorney for you know some of the most simple of tasks to then be able to upload music and write a quick description get it out there and then you know immediately receive value if someone chooses to collect that it's it's just a whole different world so that's been really really fascinating to experience um yeah it's been surprisingly easy i'm keen to see uh you know what um sort of what like further tools emerge for uh creators to be able to not only collaborate with fellow artists but also build in structure for artists to um make sure that their teams are also getting paid um one of the benefits that i see of this greater efficiency is having artists who are maybe at a earlier stage in their career be able to hire managers or hire agents hire people to assist them at an earlier point so finding ways for them to also be able to collaborate with their teams i think is going to be important in the future yeah i'll give a quick shout out here to a project called xerox splits i know that this was born out of an east global hackathon but they're doing really great work right now on routing on chain payments would highly check it out for those who haven't heard of it and i guess kicking the server to you karma i think you have really good lens on this because a lot of the work you do is with collaborators you know it's putting people in a room together funding experiments to bring this together um what does that experience look like for you and what are some of the platforms that you guys are looking to when you're choosing to make your creative work yeah of course so i would say yeah the marketplaces like catalog like sound that are more curated there's always like something like manifold if you want to go through your own contract as far as collective creation which we do a lot in song camp and actually right now i'm part of camp three which is called cam chaos which is an experiment where 80 people 50 musicians and the rest are operators economics is basically going to release as one headless artist and we're actually really using xerox splits that was one of the biggest things we needed in our camps to orchestrate this whole thing some of the xerox splits devs are in it so i would say for collective creation i think the splits and selection did a beautiful drop on sound have really changed the game it was something that was so needed for musicians um and as kate said right like the traditional way royalties work it can be so backlogged it can be hard there's a lot of administration so i think using smart contracts to really um be able to track all of this and have it be transparent is such a game changer and on the other side of things it's like i've made music since i was three and to have people value like a wave file right and pay for that where i've only ever made money from other like avenues of music is really a shift and i noticed it even myself as a musician and collector because for me it's blurring the lines right i think the lines between what is a musician what is the collector what is a fan is kind of getting blurred and we're going to allow for this new bottom-up um creator economy to emerge so i would say that's the that's where i'm currently at love that yeah i'll definitely give a big co-sign for song camp and chaos it's a fantastic community of producers and for those of you who aren't aware there's a weekly call every monday at one pst i'd highly recommend checking it out i know that karma just mentioned manifold which i think most people in the critter economy recognize is sort of a leading tool kit if you want to be more independent with your sovereignty around mintang i know you mentioned you have your own custom smart contract now can you talk about what that process looked like for you you know manifold made it like back in the day when they didn't have a platform um i was a part of uh chris's auction back in july um oh my god it's almost a year ago jesus time flies um and they were making smart contracts for everybody who was uh dropping their artworks and started stage um yeah and it turned out to be the most convenient way for me in terms of tracking provenance which is important and yeah collectors like tend to prefer it so like they know it's my smart contract that's the provenance it's real you know and right especially for one-on-ones it really does make sense for larger drops i i don't think it does you know it's something else i'm planning on like making a game it's like a larger project um this year like next year um release and yeah definitely we're writing different contracts for that but for one-on-ones like providence of artwork uh uh manifold contract is great and i think every artist should look into that because the platform's like no i'm only i was like early artist on nifty gateway and like go find my work like it doesn't on the back end it doesn't really show that is my work necessarily or anybody's work because it was minded from one wallet so everybody is made from one wallet and it's virtually not distinguishable within like one quality right so it's not the best provenance going forward like now you know and you have to get my but tomorrow it might cease to exist and like you wouldn't really find it like 10 years 20 years from now it's virtually impossible to prove that it was your artwork in fact meant it's that time so that was a big big flaw i think they are realizing it right now yeah and smart contract yeah yeah i think it's really a testament to the times you know like the fact that nifty gateway was able to realize that they needed to offer self-sovereignty with smart contracts um it just wasn't something i think anyone thought about at the time but i think it's a good you know telltale side of where we're going sorry karma i know you want to add something no worries i just wanted to add on that for creators um i think it really is important that if you are going to go with a platform some platforms will actually create your own smart contract so that exactly what you're mentioning right that your smart contract is going to exist if the platform fails right because we know how crypto goes you can see 2017 music platforms so i think sound is minting their own smart contracts and i do think it will be a trend towards sovereignty on the smart contract because that's really the game changer the fact that it's not at the platform level it's at the protocol level though yeah a really important point yeah i want to stick on this point for one second because i think for the hackers that are listening this is really a fascinating design topic when it comes to creating your own custom smart contract when it comes to minting from your own custom smart contract are there any issues you guys have experienced with sort of that ease of uploading relative to some of the more convenient flows that we talked about with the platforms or what are some of the current you know maybe blockers or design areas that exist within the smart custom smart contract space i don't know if manifold has a front end i'm not so sure about it i'm doing everything through a back end like through either scan but if you think about it's not very convenient if you don't know what to do so it's like not for everyone i don't know if they have like a front-facing like uh user-facing platform right now i have no idea they might yeah i would definitely echo that sentiment i mean i work with a lot of creators on building out their web through products and i think that the biggest issue i see right now with custom smart contracts is conceptually it makes a ton of sense i think people want to have self-sovereignty and be minting tokens from their own source but i think the tooling to be able to do easily as a non-technical creator is very difficult you know if you're able to navigate ether scan if you're able to go into terminal i think that it's fantastic but one thing that i would really call out to uh the developers listening to this is that the tools around creating custom smart contracts and being able to easily mint from those contracts i think that there's a lot of designer there that's anything from expanding the scope beyond one-of-ones to doing additions and generative art two does very simple tools where i can go in and just plug and play you know i don't have to be an ether scanner terminal to the playlist so you know i guess um kate maybe turning this over to you as a question you know someone who's kind of newer to the web3 space what is the conversation around sovereignty looked like for you has it been important is it something that you've learned about over time or when did this really come into your orbit as being you know a discussion topic to even have in mind um yeah it's definitely important it's something that i know i've been talking with a lot of other artists about particularly around like how much power are we giving to you certain platforms versus having you know full control over how we want to mint and then release our work um so i don't really have like a i guess a clear answer or definitive thoughts on this yet but um you know i think it it is something you know that is important to consider and and as amazing as some of the tools are and some of the platforms are that currently exist um i think it's going to be more and more important also for people to just have full autonomy or full control over their own contracts not be reliant on other platforms to mint their work or distribute their work um and figure out ways of of doing that and like going forward so yeah nice and then one topic i want to get into here you know the metadata of nfts is something that i think is a little bit more low-key from the average collector i don't think we talked about it very much but i'm really curious to hear maybe all of i'll start with this on your end um how do you think about metadata relative to your nfts that you're creating and where does it kind of slot into the the conversation right right right i've been thinking a lot about it i know there are two ways to save the amount of data right now i mean um obviously um three ways actually it's not true um ipfs like the old-fashioned way but most reliable like um air beef um i don't they say it's better i don't know it's hard for me to tell if it's better or not but like you have to get tokens but in the u.s you cannot buy tokens so it's a bit of a drag to be honest um i don't know it's bad or not but i don't have tokens so i have to like stick to ipfs and a third way is actually um embed art on chain itself but like the size of the file should be very very small but if you maintain like fine artwork it's mpx4 and it's like a large large file it's kind of borderline impossible the gas piece will be astronomical if you do that i know some projects some of the projects pfp projects do that very successfully but the size of the files are very very small and the pfp's allow that it's like a small like avatar thing maybe pixelated it's a small file so it's possible it's about the for my artwork not really at this point so i'd be able to expect the way unfortunately unfortunately yeah and i guess karma kicking this over to you have there been conversations around this with relation to music nfts and sort of the differentiating metadata standards that might be used relative to crypto art yeah i mean i think in general music and i know people are working on this from the catalog and then songs team suffers from a lack of metadata standards um from a curation perspective and a discovery perspective and i mean yeah what all the places that were mentioned is basically where music is being uploaded i do think that uploading midion chain is a pretty interesting thing i know beats foundry is doing that i like that concept um but like was said like if you want to upload a wave file it's gonna be so expensive to mint on chains so right now primarily it's happening on ipfs and i know glass.xyz i'm into the video on there they're working on r weave so i do think for like the builders out there um in the catalog disk score there's a music nfts like metadata standards and i think the work around that is going to be super important just so we have composibility between platforms and between protocols so i think that's really where the biggest bottleneck is in music um as far as metadata standards yeah i think this is a great transition because we've been talking in the first part of this panel about sort of the technical layers of creation so some smart contracts metadata i think the social aspect is something that's really important and unique relative to sort of the creator economy that's being developed now so i guess stock kicking this over to you how do you think about minting your music on platforms like catalog or sound versus you know a typical distribution system where you just put it through a distributor and it's on all platforms do you see any bottlenecks with that or how do you sort of view having different platforms um you know host different content that are kind of existing in silos right now yeah um i think the biggest difference for me right now like putting something on catalog for instance versus um like spotify uh is catalog or sound is a very very small very niche community still at this point so you're you're reaching um a small like fewer number of people but very potentially like high quality quote unquote fans like people who genuinely want to engage with you on all these different levels um so i think just as far as like volume of users go like that's that's a very big difference um it's it's something that's highly highly curated um versus like a spotify or apple music there's just this massive volume of music coming through and while while there are ways that we are sort of curating it while you know there's playlisting there's all these different options um it's so much more saturated so i'm i'm eager to see kind of what happens as these platforms continue to grow and expand and get more users not just on the collector side of things but get more and more musicians involved or creators involved yeah i forgot where i was going with that so i lost my train of thought but that's been the biggest difference is just i think number of people who are actively engaged um yeah yeah i love that and i'd really echo sort of the quality of the average contributor right now and the people that are collecting these works but i think you know one of the things that we take for granted for things like spotify and apple music is you can search any song in the world it's going to show up you know irregardless of the streaming service that you use it's typically there and so i guess karma kicking this over to you from a collector's standpoint how do you think about music discovery right now in the lens of web3 and what are some of the challenges you see around you know not being able to find music right being kind of too buried because it's only in one place do you see any areas of improvement there yeah yeah i think that's where most of the building has to be done as far as like curation discovery and social and really taking a bottom-up approach to it right like what type of curation wasn't possible before that now is possible i know you made a great tweet actually around gatekeepers versus curation right and it's a really tough problem to solve and we see it across the sentiment of musicians being like i want to be on catalog and sound but i can't get on and i think it's really important to keep in mind that there's a reason that it's being curated the way it is right because if we just leave it open there's going to be so much supply that the demand is not going to be there to keep up with it plus a quality control issue right so i do think the approach and these platforms are already going towards that route is slowly like giving it to the artist and then the community and then hopefully like actually just creating a new type of incentive system and what i would like to see is curation at like a protocol layer that works across the platforms so it kind of just takes a little bit of that curation power away from them but like right now to be honest it's all happening off social and it's mostly twitter right like let's be honest it's still like most of discovery and curation is happening as a result of attention harvesting algorithms right and it wasn't like made with bad intentions originally but i think they have emerged to be these new information ecologies that they optimize for time spent on site but not time well spent right so for me personally as a creator like i'm a lot more into having a small amount of listeners that are like actively listening to engaging with it and having this huge huge reach but it's not an or thing right i think it's a it's an and thing right now web 2 is acting as this reach and web 3 is acting as this depth the question is is how do we start solving the problem of reach and bringing it into a more web3 native way so that's like where my head's at around things and maybe even rewarding people who are curating i think curators themselves and it's like collectors are almost curators i think that's going to be a really large emerging trend yeah and i think that's a good area just to kind of give a shout out to the sponsor of this panel you know lens protocol i think is a really awesome solution for this you know i'm hopeful that there can be a world where instead of us doing all of our distribution and social experience on web2 platform like twitter there can be something that's a little bit more on chain native like lens and so i guess all of turning this into a question for you how do you get in contact with your collectors today you know like when you have this event coming out on april 30th is there a way for you to contact you know holders of your nfts or what are some things that you would like to see in that regards just being able to have a more direct line of communication with them um honestly yeah that's a challenge that's um reaching out to collectors like that's real challenge like you're relying on twitter algorithm regularly and maybe instagram like okay a bit better but honestly it's been a headache i don't have a good answer just reaching out one by one and i've been doing it for a very very long time like a lot of my collectors i don't even know like you know like for like 2018 2019 i don't know where they are literally i don't even know why football is that active like if they're on twitter like yeah maybe i should have been cataloging it better fair maybe i don't know it's interesting boring like i'm thinking i'm actually thinking about it right now it's like very hard to reach those people and it's very hard to reach anyone and the crypto space was a lot of noise if you guys have ideas solutions please do like do share yeah i mean i think this is um it's really interesting because in web 2 we have email lists right and if someone buys your product or if they subscribe somewhere you can send them an email and say check this out we don't really have that on chain right now you know again just to give a shout out to lens protocol i think that there's some promising signal in that direction you know in particular being able to query someone's on-chain activity you know did i buy something on catalog did i buy something on sound did i buy something on foundation nifty gateway openc whatever it is and starting to build more of a social graph you know i'm excited for this next chapter of web3 social because i think it's really going to power you know web through native artists i think to all of this point very early in this conversation right now if you're a creator in web 3 you need to be full time on twitter for the most part i mean obviously i think it's really important to take breaks and not be on there but i think we see time and time again that a lot of the success web ducators have or how tied in they are on a day to day on twitter and so i guess um thought i'm going to turn this one over to you because you've been you know really crushing in that regard recently did you ramp up you know your social activity specifically on a platform like twitter with relation to your activity in the music nft community or what did that process look like yeah i did make a conscious um effort to to start ramping that up um and it's definitely been i won't say like a point of strain or stress it's it's work that i'm happy to do like i love i love creating music and so anything i can do to share that with other people in whatever form that may be is wonderful um but i i think you know going forward i would really love to see ways for creators to reach collectors and also reach new audiences that really prioritizes like the medium that they're already working in versus their ability to you know be funny on twitter or um you know for me also i work in audio mostly and um a a platform like instagram is really prioritizing images it's visual and so it's like the success or failure of a post about your project is not even based on the work itself it's based on this other aspect of like you know a visual representation of the music and and so that's been i think really challenging for for musicians specifically we don't have a lot of platforms you know maybe audio is something that that prioritizes the sharing and discovery of just the audio itself um or you know the web 2 version of that could be like soundcloud where there was also that social aspect um but i i would love to see like more and more tools um that integrate like the social aspect of music sharing and community yeah let's stick on this for a second because i think a lot of the process for creating on-chain work does have to do with the social layer of it as well i mean i think that we see now that twitter spaces play such an important role in getting the distribution out there you know doing these things like having private sales on a platform like foundation you know karma i want to kick this one over to you because i think you're most um you know active in this space what does it look like for you to be able to relay what you're working on to the community you've built in web 3. can you talk a little bit about sort of the relation twitter and discord have and some places people should be keeping in mind help you know talk about distributing their creative work yeah 100 so i think primarily it's happening and it also depends on it like i'm a more web three native creator and i'm cool with that like i'm still doing things in web too but it's very much so like i'm i love web 3 and for me and people asking this a lot it was very organically i feel like i was drawn to the way things were happening because of its eclectic nature i felt like finally in my life i could take all my different disciplines and kind of put them into one but it really is happening on twitter and discord and like almost funneling into discord from twitter the way i see it i think twitter spaces were a huge game changer and i do like that conversations are happening right that it's not this news feed based thing people can hear each other's voices but i think and this is what the builders should be thinking about it's the design principles and the design model and the ethics around how these networks are built and they're incentivized to just keep you scrolling right they're incentivized to show more sensational content so i think really building and i love that idea of including audio including the medium that we're already creating in baked into the social layer and it'll sound like definitely touched on this and i think it's a big reason for their success um like i've met people because we've been on the same sound pyramid and then we are at an event and like now we're friends right so i think that social layer and also for the builders the reason that music didn't have its pfp moment was partially because there was nowhere to display them right so i think having ability to display these things and use these things and interact with them in the social layer is going to be game changers so yeah great point yeah i want to shift this conversation over to the consumption side of things because i think it's really important we talked about minting nfts with custom smart contracts we talked about distribution on different platforms the social experience around marketing but how about after you collected nft you know where are you showing that off where are you displaying it how are you experiencing with that um there's two really awesome topics here both with crypto and music i guess first and foremost all of with the crypto art side of things when it comes to people displaying the work that they've collected from you what are some of the platforms and solutions you recommend and maybe where there's still some you know open problems that people can be looking into um right like um me as a collector myself to be honest um i don't display my energies as much honestly and unfortunately um i just put them in different wallets and just i'll look through on open sea like what i have the inventory i'm like okay i'm checking out okay so still here good i have like wallet for fine art whatever art for something to flip this time like a project whatever i got like i'm ashamed of getting that meeting that shit's like i don't want people to see my lens you know i organized different wallets and like yeah i check on them sometimes you know like i'm like attached to ledger some hot wallets you know like okay still here which is like not the best way not gonna lie so i wish there was like a better tool more secure tool to organize it somehow but it is what it is right now i don't play my lens or whatever pfps i just i have them i ordered them um in terms of my artwork um well different like collectors played very differently um i have works that i sold both print like high quality print attached was the animated nft that's the way uh collectors love that um or there's some like high quality frames right now like logo frames they have square frames um like pre-order only uh some people have that um i'm gonna have them in my show so people can just like buy the artwork take it with the frame take it home so i don't worry about the display like uh like it's it's yours it's all included um i feel like that's that's in an easy way yeah i mean some people just put it on tv you know like good old way and they have it right there all people have put them on their phones like you know like that this display i i've seen that uh oh and like someone else like you can customize um apps on uh iphone some people like did that i know that i put some of my bears some of my work for that i mean that that's a fun way to have it with ui got all times but yeah i mean i think most of the people just like have them you know in their wallets and like look at their art sometimes like you know like hey my pokemon card is like all with me like oh my nft is all with me still okay nobody sell them my apes good doing good yeah right i mean they're tools like spatial like whatever you can have a metaverse exhibition but i feel like it was a trance back like a year ago people did like i was like a number of online exhibitions collectors would just like build a building a museum what not a lot of people building museums but crypto art and they put like your artwork on their central land land and yeah yeah yeah i think there's a still a lot to be done in this regard i'll give a quick shout out to two that come to mind for me um gallery.so and on cyber i think are both fantastic platforms to display art but what i'm hearing from you and i think this is a really interesting conversation topic is that people have very different assets in their wallet you know they have nfts that they're proud to own nfts that they're just using to flip nfcs that they're not proud to own right now they all just exist in one spot now on openc i can go and i can hide certain assets but it's very difficult for me to categorize though by different mindset and so i think you bring up a really good point and something that i see being you know a trend moving forward here is going to be let's call it vertical specific wallets so right now if i have a wallet i have all of my nfts in one spot but specifically for someone like myself that's collecting a lot of music nfts it doesn't make as much sense for a music nfts to exist directly next to my pfps and so i think a big area that we're going to see moving forward here is what do a music-specific wallet look like and maybe turning this into a question to you kate when you're selling your music entities to people how are they experiencing those or what how do you think they're experiencing them and when people want to listen to your music in web 3 you know what are some of the ways you think we can do a better job of allowing that to happen natively on chain yeah i at this point i'm i thinking about this um from my perspective also as a collector there's not really i think a great way to share or display in some way like our collections like when i think about collecting vinyl for example it's something that i love doing um and as a dj too when i get the opportunity to like spin vinyl that's like a really fun opportunity to you know share these pieces of work that i've gone out to to find to like dig from the back of whatever bin at a record store and there's like a story behind each one and so that that social process also of like you know going out somewhere gathering with people and sharing this collection is really important to me and really special and valuable and i would love to see um sort of a web 3 version of that i don't know at this point what that could look like but i just know that so much of like music collecting um when you are like gathering i guess vinyl i keep bringing it back to that um so much of that is is very social and it's not as meaningful unless there's other people involved where you can share that with others so i think figuring out a way to to make that more of an experience for collectors is going to be important going forward absolutely i'll give you uh give a shout out to future tape here i think this is a product that's working in the direction of that but i think there is still a ton of design work whether it's displaying it as a playlist whether it's having it as a vinyl collection you know i think one of the most exciting things about music nfts there will be a social layer associated with collecting and to your point maybe there's a day where if i want to dj my music nfts i can only play it if i own the music nft you know and there's some cool edge cases that emerge there and so i guess karma i want to transition this to you because i know that song camp talks a lot about this no have you guys been talking about you know music consumption display the social experience around it and you know again just ask the question any blockers that you're seeing right now yeah no i think this is honestly something i think about a lot because i have all these music nfts i'm like what do i do with them currently what we do is we play them on bpmbot which is a discord bot we built to play catalog records and uh like we recently like the last month or so added zora and sound and that was interesting because honestly that showed me the power of just this cross-community collaboration because i was just in the sound discord i'm like i want to play my sound nfts and then another dev is like i'm down to help build it so i'm like oh let's just put this in bpm we went into the wave world and we built it over a weekend so to me like that's the first step right like at least having somewhere to play it i mean right now i don't play them in my car unless i play them through discord which is literally what i'm doing i'm playing them through discord not the best but i think also thinking about like what is the offline version right like i was on the plane how am i listening to my music nfts um i have future tape but there's no way of like downloading them offline and it really is about i like vinyl as well and it's like what is that displaying of the vinyl look like in a postmorphic world right so like what can you create to display music and interact with music that wasn't previously conceivable um whether that be through smart contracts or some of the stuff lens is building but i think that's really where yeah that's where my head is at and as far as displaying them like i have a gallery that i did it but like i feel like there needs to be a more music native one right like i would like something with like spatial audio like you've ever been into gather town like you can go buy it and interact with it um as well as like irl ones i know eve denver they have these motion sensor like for visual art so that to me is interesting as well right like how can you include the listener as part of the creation process because once you attach your identity or some type of emotional connection to it and you already get this by buying it from having skin in the game but that layer i think is what really also would be interesting to explore because i think that's what kicked pfp's off right like having that status and having that way of like identifying with it because of the blind mint so interested to see what people are building there yeah i'm hearing a very big need for more projects around the consumption layer of nfts and i guess really just to round this out um right now we've talked about minting your work we've talked about the platforms you get it on you know i want to i want to toss this one over to you and have this be kind of our last question for the session but when you're getting your work out there into the world and choosing to have people hear about it or discover it more what are some of the ways that you're doing that what are some of the you know areas that you're hoping to see some better improvements in all right that's my main point like how do i talk about my work how i tell people about it like i've always been like shy to self-promote myself maybe it's a cultural background i don't know what that is um i i don't know if i display my high value nfts i don't know i'm weird about that it's just such a weird thing um i never had a discord uh which perhaps is a great tool like to get organized i'm like not very organized with those things i'm not on twitter every day sometimes like i'm on twitter like for three days is it like my engagement drops low like nobody like sees me for for quite a time um yeah but i'm active on instagram i i guess it's a very web 2 way right like what artists did back in the day they use i mean they still do like it's nothing change they use instagram and most of their collectors are on the ground literally watching stories and they know what's going on like that's our world is on on the instagram like everyone that's how people discover things still even in web 3 unfortunately like that like um mark zuckerberg's like own thing which is sad and twitter is like bad algo it's like i don't know maybe i feel like what flickr means you should kind of like move into like better tools of discovery tools better conversations and maybe for me personally as a creator i i feel like i really need to work on like being more active doing spaces doing my own discord channel and like expand in that sense right like yeah i'm actually really trying to solve that that's that's been my problem for quite a time like how do i reach out to people like yeah like who do i know like stuff like that so like how did i do that i think it's a competition you know i feel like there's definitely a pressure right now if you are a creator in web 3 to be hyper active on socials i don't think that that's a mindset that suits many people and for most the creators i know you know they don't want to have a discord they don't want to be in there every single day talking to their fans they want to make art so i guess uh mental health suffers if when you like on social like 24 7 and you don't have time to do the artwork you need to be in a prostate flow right like if it interrupts by the message whatever you kind of lose it that that's like it's web 2 as well right especially in music you see that after kobit hit and people stop doing live gigs the industry went towards looking at tick tock as a metric right and like all the labels look at tick tock so i think it's it's a general thing with these algorithms being built from an incentive model where the advertiser is the customer and the creators are influencers which to me is like you're literally just worth your influence your art is nothing right like if someone else has influence we'll plug you in there and to me like that's the world i don't want to live in right i want to live in a world exactly like you're mentioning that's incentivizing creators to have a balanced approach right where they can be like okay i share my work i talk to my collectors but it's not predicated on feeling like i constantly have to like be on there right because everyone feels that i feel like the platforms want to make you feel like that because you will buy more things and spend more time on there so i think it's really like from the ground up building with that design principle in mind yeah kid i've seen you tweet a lot about this do you have any closing thoughts on this topic yeah um i guess just to to ditto what the others have said like uh i don't think um our current incentivization to to just be constantly active constantly um socializing or connecting with people is is healthy for a lot of artists um and it deprioritizes the actual work that we're trying to do um so you know any anything that we can do to not only meaningfully connect with the people who are either collecting our work or experience experiencing our work or wanting to connect with us like that is wonderful i think like having fewer but more meaningful ways of engagement would be really beneficial um excuse me and then also just meaningful ways of of reaching new people again that doesn't prioritize like your constant activity on on on a platform i think would be healthier i love that well guys we're right at time here and just to give the audience a quick recap of what we talked about i think there's a huge need for easier to use custom smart contracts that seems like a pain point that everyone was feeling here i heard a lot around the consumption layer of nft so how do i experience and display them and then lastly on the distribution side how do you get your work out to a web 3 native audience and have direct communication with collectors that have bought stuff from you on chain and so i guess cleaning it up here um let's go around and see where people can stay up with you post this conversation all of i'll kick it over to you first i know that you have a big irl event coming up in april 2 so tell us where we can stay up with you and learn more about it uh so it's april 30th um my solo show called um welcome to the metaverse it opens at postmaster gallery new york it's tribeca i'll post more info and a flyer like um like two weeks before some people won't forget it like it's like it's a month and a half it's way way at once i will notice so yeah it's irrelevant um basically opening uh from six to eight is a bit of a party like everybody's welcome i'd love to see everyone it's going to be fun goodbye to your friend artwork uh educators matter words love it i can't wait for it karma what about you man where can people stand with your work sure so i'm karma wave on twitter and all other platforms you can find my music on sound i have a i'll give you a little alpha little catalog release coming out um and yeah it just happened with me on twitter my dms are pretty backlogged but like i'll get to them eventually like back to our conversation i think going with the seasons of life so right now i'm in a music creation process but you can find me karma wave everywhere love it kate what about you yeah i am uh dot music uh most platforms d-o-t-m-v-s-i-c um putting out a bunch of new music this year and in all of the places so you can find me um in web 2 spots or on sound and catalog um going to be playing a bunch of festivals this year too so if you're at any of those come say hi but yeah love that and uh last but not least i'm koopa troopa very thankful to have been hosting this panel kartik thank you as always against this space and it was a wonderful conversation cooper thank you so much for moderating this amazing chat and kate karma and olive thank you so much for being part of it and giving out so many amazing perspectives really appreciate this thank you guys good luck with the rest of the hackathon thank you so much all right with that we are ready for our next amazing discussion so the next topic we're going to talk about is on uh social data and unstoppable thoughts uh it's it's a pretty uh broad and abstract topic we'll kind of dig deeper into kind of how uh we think about it and uh for this conversation like to uh welcome jonathan uh from startlinglab to uh to join me um welcome jonathan i'm glad that we're able to kind of talk about this and uh hi thanks karthik awesome to be here really excited awesome so i want to start off by just kind of getting uh more context for everybody else and kind of people understanding what you do so we'd love to kind of get an intro on who you are what starling is and uh and just everything that you uh spend your time with sure so the starling lab is based at stanford and usc and we are focusing on how to use web3 technologies to advance human rights in in three domains history law and journalism and we've been at this for about three years so um we've understood that as with everything in web 3 you got to be patient because stuff breaks and you got to figure out not only what are the possibilities of the tech but um our our big focus has been how to actually integrate different solutions so rather than thinking about one protocol or one solution that can try to do everything instead we're realizing that there are different tools that are out there that can be integrated together to create really robust solutions and so that has been exciting because you can imagine in the types of things we do across the different domains you need to be flexible right today journalists don't know how to use these tools right straight out of the gate so you need to listen closely as to how they get their work done or for that matter we're starting to work on work in the ukraine it's a fast-moving situation it's very dynamic and our we understand what the lawyers need but we also know that web3 tools are you know struggling to even work in a basic way so we need to simplify and create robust solutions and and that's really what the lab's all about to just cut through the hype make real stuff happen amazing is that more kind of a comment on like how do you guys decide what to spend your time on is it a project-based thing or is it like a situation-based thing obviously you talked about ukraine but how do you sort of measure the outcomes as well as what to focus next well um we got into this because we realized that there was just natural and intuitive things for us to do so we started by focusing on taking vulnerable data and sensitive data and seeing if we can get that on chain and that started with historical records that was a natural thing but what we realized very quickly was that we could start our chain of custody actually upstream right rather than just taking records as they are when we create new records could we start let's say with video or images with a chain of custody that gets on chain in the camera itself right so part of what guided us was realizing that there were these interlocking things so we have storage we have capture and then finally verification that was another area that very naturally led us to think about how as experts are reviewing information and trying to build confidence and context and clarity about it we needed to provide tools there so that essentially was our our approach to creating a framework and all our metrics are around how we can deploy into case studies that are in the domains i spoke about by using this type of framework again and again amazing and kind of obviously there's a lot of room here to kind of go deeper into all these things but uh i guess specifically focus on just what you what you just kind of are spending your time on now um what are some recurring themes that you sort of get into as you talk to the end users of these technologies are like what stands out when they think about what three leverage kind of uh solutions or any recurring themes around like this is what you get complaints about all the time with web3 technologies yes yes um wow it's a it's a big question well i let me talk to this by talking about the problems in general and then we can kind of create the subset for web 3. um you know today i understand you guys are focusing on hacking around social media and you know with lens and all sorts of really cool things that are being experimented with in creating new types of social profiles and methods for sharing information etc and what i can say is that the number one thing that we're addressing is that the social media platforms of today have very little context around the information which is distributed within them so as an example if i send a photograph on to you on twitter one of the very first things that twitter does is it actually strips out all of the metadata that might help me establish the veracity or the authenticity of that photograph so it becomes a massive problem because people are essentially with that original choice which has some wisdom to it but um in my view it's outdated um we're now really just struggling to catch up from behind so a lot of the challenges that we're addressing and a lot of problems are that there's just bad hygiene people haven't done proper schema they haven't thought through the interlocking protocols and figure out like actually what's the optimal workflow essentially it's just bad planning so um i i would say that the number one challenge that we're seeing in web 3 is that it really it can't actually address those problems um it takes humans to actually come up with better plans and better strategies and then use new web 3d technologies to help build confidence around good choices that you make at the beginning because if you're authenticating something it's it's really it's garbage in garbage out right right so i think that's that's like the number one thing that we see is that it's just people have rushed stuff is clujie they haven't thought through all the best practices so that's in the human rights context while we want to act and we want to be responsible at the same time like the stakes are so high and so we can't afford just to put stuff out there that's rushed that's kind of one one one big piece that we look at just clarity and structure the second which is um really important is about performance and thankfully that's getting better with web three so i know there's you know the story of the last 18 months is surely a story about efficiency in terms of cost and performance and so that keeps getting better and better and i think that we're now at a point where inner chain work is also going to get better and better and so that i'm really hoping becomes a major accelerant and a story of 2022 is that we can start to use different protocols for different things and that maybe i kick it off with an nft but then i immediately go into using three or four other protocols to achieve the type of consensus that i want to um and the type of distribution that i want to and and i think that likely will produce more complaints right because more systems more problems um but at the end it is really important because we're going to keep web 3 decentralized and we're not just going to go and recreate the bms of web 2 right and end up with the same problems that we kind of got us here in the first place that requires us to be dedicated to this idea of interoperability and so in spite of all the challenges um it's worth it and we're hoping people keep at it no that's an amazing answer um kind of coming back to sort of what you're spending your time on now um i mean this event to sacramento is all about thinking about new ways to create social media platforms that are kind of crypto native or web 3 native and there's a lot of ways you can slice that there's a lot of ways you can think about what you want to pick on there's there's i mean there's a lot of text there's a realm of kind of possibilities around just other types of media consumption and all these things are sort of being tried on for the next two weeks but um as you can look at the situation right now that's out there in the world like what do you believe is the role of social media in gun documenting uh anyway war crimes or any conflict yeah well to give you some context because this is very applied for us we about three weeks ago as the situation ukraine worsened and the war began we realized that we had to spring into action and our lab has been working for years on doing perfecting various forms of documentation for war crimes documentation human rights violation in syria now that conflict which got started 11 years ago at the time it was um if you remember karthik it was the arab spring was dubbed like the facebook revolution right kind of unofficially and you had all of these giant well at the time they were kind of growing but web 2 platforms that were offering a new opportunity for people to start to document things just with their mobile phone right it was this incredible revolution and they thought maybe naively certainly naively at the time that would be enough if you could just document it online then you're good to go because the truth would be out there and dictators would come down and google has estimated that with that spirit that there are now more hours of documentation on youtube of the syrian conflict than there are actual hours of the war in real life over the last seven years that's kind of the torrent of information okay so now 11 years later here we are we have a tremendous challenge in trying to bring people to justice and people are documenting like they've never done before however the torrent of information that's coming in there and also the mechanisms for authenticating the information it's we we still have a really really difficult task ahead just showing the photo is not enough as we saw zielinski was just featured in a deep fake video that was claiming that he had surrendered so he had a lot of challenges you know just around trying to build trust right at the same time just because you document something doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to get into uh be admissible for evidence so there's a whole set of protocols that you can take to ensure that something has the best chance of being admitted in the court case and if that's your goal for documenting war crimes as an example we need to take preemptive steps and then the last thing and this is really critical the part of the problem with um the rush in web 2.0 was that everyone just put stuff online and they had just no idea as to what to do with um dealing with the safety of the people that were featured in the video and i think my biggest concern right now is that we are rushing and doing all forms of documentation which is critical but that record of all the things that is that people are putting up can be very easily taken and spun around from a tool that is just simply a tool of documentation for good to being a tool that now is used to surveil and to condemn people to find people in their homes and take them away and imprison them etc this is the reality that many people in ukraine may face as and how russia proceeds in capturing territory and potentially taking over the country and so while the initial intent is very important to preserve that there's a spark of good here the reality is that this can all go wrong very quickly okay and then the final thing which is that as you're trying to arbitrate whether or not to keep something up content moderation becomes really challenging and what we have found is that youtube and twitter and facebook were put into this really difficult situation in which they had to decide what information do you actually keep up right so if you want to protect people or maybe there's terms of service violations around like the brutality of what people are showing does that deserve to stay up in spite of it being against common sense in terms of service right and but if you take it down then maybe that would be then destroyed and potentially unavailable for war crimes investigators so trying to find that balance of how you deal with securing the privacy of the individuals involved but at the same time getting information to the authorities that can act upon it and making sure it's admissible all these things you could think of as problems we think of good as opportunities and we are really excited because we have been working well let me take that back there's nothing exciting about any of this um we are passionate and we are dedicated to the idea that web 3 can potentially help and so we're very carefully looking at how the tools that we've been working on could start to make a difference thank you so much for uh for that uh just kind of thought process around i mean there are a lot of challenges here and there's there's no perfect or right solution there are multiple ways you can think about solving each of these um and as you look at all the time that you spent understanding like what should be done here as a next course of action he's kind of if i'm understanding this right please correct me if i'm wrong it's kind of the clarification here that this is more of a nuance between moderation and the content existing and the fact that like the data persisting is still separate from what should be done with it and right now the completion is that in in the web 2 world if the data doesn't persist that it means there's no other way somebody would find out about it because suppression is real directly tied to the existence is that a fair statement or is that kind of where we are starting off it's all about authority right card tech it's like somebody has to make choices right and in the web 2 world the platforms have said we're the ones going to make all the choices so we're going to set the metadata standards we're going to set the modes of content moderation we're going to figure out how to deal with identity and security right and that worked for a period of time it kind of bootstrapped us to the point in which you know everyone got on these platforms but now obviously we've realized that well i'm not so sure that i want um mark zuckerberg determining you know the quarters of warcraft's documentation doesn't seem like they may have all of the interests of everyone in mind here and indeed i mean to be generous to some extent like the platforms have been active this time around and doing a lot more um and they've been consulting with the international human rights community but the same challenge persists which is it's about agency right and so what i'm trying to emphasize here is that if web3 you know people talk about like cryptography and crypto and all that right well what exactly are the features that we really want to use right so the first part of it is that we want to use the ability to encrypt and when you encrypt and if you have the agency to encrypt that also means you have the choice of who to allow access to this information and you can then choose who can decrypt right so that that first thing if it's put in the power of the users we already think that that's a better solution or if it's put into community where a group of users can come together and make that choice that's great separate but related is the other part of the cryptography coin which is authentication so that i know that as i distribute the information and i want to lock in all the facts around my initial documentation of something i can authenticate it using a hashing algorithm and signing algorithms and then what that allows you to do is ensure that no matter where this goes no matter where it stays stored where it's consumed et cetera that we have some providence and we know where it came from and we know that if it's been manipulated or not which is critical for chain of custody and web 3 is built on these primitives right that you have authenticity that you have some method of protecting users with anonymity or pseudo-anonymity with encryption so as you guys are building and hacking away over the next couple of days like really think about it's like how how can you allow users to try to flex these really powerful tools on their own with their own agency but then also in groups that expand and expand and essentially keep that agency with the users rather than the platforms now this is a this is really good kind of way of thinking about because what i was going to ask next was just go into a bit more detail around what are other lessons learned from how existing web 2 networks do this and how we actually kind of think about making a list of everything we need to address and as we're thinking about a brand new way to uh experience in a way a social network in in web3 it's kind of like a choose your own adventure uh sort of thing which is the data is separate from the users which is separate from the platform which is happening in the user experience which is separate from like the front end and the platform you're going to look at it from and there's multiple things that you can tweak on every layer of that stack and the question becomes like what is important uh to focus on and what is ephemeral versus what is actually variable right um yeah that sounds daunting right because you're you've essentially disintermediate it functions yeah exactly and that's a lot of pressure right if you're if you're a developer and you now have to essentially make all those choices um yeah i'm extremely empathetic in a sense that it's like this is um i think what the engineers are facing the next couple of days are you know they're obviously like a multitude of choices but also multitude of responsibilities um so so let me give you the the one thing that where we when we consulted with the leaders in the human rights space they said to us it's actually really simple what you need to do is create platforms that allow for you to air grievances and to provide feedback so you have to basically assume that you're going to get things wrong at some point it's it's assured right every major type of implementation is going to stumble in some way because that's what happens when you work at scale right that's what happens when you make something public and so you know if you look back at like web 2 and you think about well did they really listen were they actually humble in their approach and trying to say you know what we're screwing up and let's make some some choices that might actually make a difference right or did they give agency to users to start to develop solutions around like better information right about what was wrong um i think at the end of the day um we can say web 2 failed in that respect the early experimentations around like voting around proposals and trying to get feedback i mean i think you may remember this right there was facebook advertised this right as as like a key thing they were going to do right i forget what the threshold was it was something like 100 000 votes or something like that could could yield some sort of change you know it should sound familiar right like dao governance and stuff like that right and of course they didn't stay committed to it um in park is you could argue maybe some part of it was impractical but also they were arrogant i think in retrospect they would admit that so that's what we need to flip on its head right is we need to think about not just governance for the sake of decision making but you need to make people informed through this process and so you need to be super committed to finding ways of getting feedback from users and then creating grievance processes that are structured ahead of time not blatantly once like really bad stuff happens um so i i'd leave that message with everyone it's like don't this is not an afterthought it's um this is this is actually core to the success of your platform is being able to hear these types of things absolutely um i mean i i kind of listed some features that i i think are just uh from a framing standpoint things that we need to solve for in this world and uh you kind of have direct experience thinking about and addressing some of these uh in production uh for lack of a better term um so so kind of a new perspective what are some of these key requests that you get and or key features that all these new platforms should have and actually you cannot think about breaking down or solving or checking for like what is the right check that hey we have a sufficiently good enough solution if that check meets yeah well the first thing is thinking about identity right it's a super core and i'm imagining that everyone's going to spend a bunch of time focused on that and you know identity is complicated because it's obviously multifaceted and i think most people are realizing that personas are what is going to be one way out of the problem with identity which is that you can have essential identity that defines that you can essentially speak for and have agency but that you might want to present your persona in different ways under different circumstances you might want to have a lot of choice around that and that persona in some cases can be anonymous pseudo-anonymous you know you can you can make varying levels of security features around that so i think that's that's one of the the core requirements of a social network i think we're to re-architect this is you know it is to to find ways of establishing a multi-faceted identity that then leads to the second piece which is around content moderation which really flows from this concept which is that you want to find a way to generate community here so now we have a set of personas that can come together and they can help manage some complex tasks and um that a core feature really important and when we think about for instance content moderation you know it's one thing for instance to have content moderation happen for a broad distribution of content it's another thing where it would be content moderation for a bunch of war crimes prosecutors right and so you know clearly they have different needs and agendas and um in in future requests so i think that having the ability to shape community with a whole set of different requirements and uh around what the community requires is um uh organically that's super important okay and then the last thing which i'll mention is is really about authentication and provenance so much of the problem that we have right now is that information is flowing with very little information uh amend the data accompanying it so you have photos that have no time and date you have challenges around establishing location and even things like the veracity of information like it's like it's underlying hash right has it been manipulated or how can i authenticate it as close to the source as possible now this one holds tremendous promise right like we're already seeing for instance images from other wars being recycled in the ukraine conflict because it's just they're evocative right they get people to to think and and to care right but of course those are that's falsified information right that's a big problem did you also find the nuance in that third point about how much of that kind of is already coming in as a feature for just being on the blockchain versus the additional information that you would have to uh amend or append cool yeah i'm glad you paused me there all right well let's think about it so the first thing is about ordering right so blockchains are really good about establishing like the order of events of something so if you can register something we we have at minimum we know what happens before and after right we have some relative sense of time and then we can align that with potentially like real time say this date this time so that that is kind of the first thing the second is that if you in that record can pack in things like location as an example or information about the device that took uh the image et cetera you can help start to build confidence that when someone says hey this actually happened that you're gonna say well i have now additional information there and that's giving me some more confidence that yeah indeed this happened the way this person claimed that happened or has it's not a deep fake or it's not a a shallow fake or you know some sort of recycled image so um that's really important but i'm gonna be a little bit of a stinker on this um the immutability right of that type of record is challenging because today i might want to disclose that information and tomorrow um i may not right today i might be free and able to do this type of capture safely tomorrow there may be in a completely different security situation and i now need my anonymity right so choice is very important to ensure so as you're developing these features it's not about um opting out it's about opting in and that's like really important because of the the nature of the the immutable nature you know of these types of um devices in our systems and i'll tell you by the way card this is fascinating this is not abstract fear at all um as we were developing cameras and applications that did exactly this it would take a photo and you would know it's in this exact time and place right it hasn't been changed um our security researchers um let us know that actually 10 years ago north korea actually pioneered a lot of this work and has made that a standard feature of every phone that is shipped in north korea that's approved by the government so that form of authentication powerful amazingly helpful if i choose to do it but when it's forced upon you then you're it's a completely different ballgame and now we're in the in the case of surveillance so that's those are the table stakes right that i think the engineering example of uh double-edged sword um yep um wow so uh i mean i think a lot of it is i feel like otherwise i'll type out twisting i don't think it's a solved thing i think there's still a lot of improvements to be done it's uh it's more about i think we get a lot of things built in uh in this world especially on the persistence and the availability largely the availability as well as kind of the immutability of information and it feels like a lot of what we're thinking about or talking about here and especially discussing is that a way to think about moderation and different ways to improve moderation how do you think about breaking that down like it is it's just a world where everybody says bring your own algorithms and if you're doing this for war crime then you have a different script you're going to run on the same data if you're doing this thing for like understanding what could go viral you have a different sort of algorithm are we going to see all this fragmentation and bifurcation here like how does that world kind of change and evolve from your perspective it's complicated because i don't think we've done content moderation successfully even with billions of dollars being spent on it and you know platforms that have maybe not a um a moral interest but a but a profit interest that they put forward to say we got to solve this because this is hurting our brand this is hurting our you know our reputation so um let's let's try to unpack it i think the biggest challenge right now is that there is no way to actually moderate content within community and so i think the the the ability to create more robust groups that can make choices around the types of things that are acceptable and the values that they want to stand for is is an important step forward now mind you that can go you know that that requires you to make sure that people like actually are doing thinking about their values right and that ideally those values you know are stated they're clear and that governance is built around those um so that i think is the very first set of types of features i think that we would want to see here about content moderation is to instead of thinking about it as a centralized function that a platform needs to handle instead we're starting to localize it to affected parties to stakeholders right the second thing is that um their content moderation you know is tricky because obviously we want to promote freedom of speech as much as possible that's a core tenet of democracy but the reality is that not all forms of speech are protected right and so um again like spending time preemptively to figure out the nuances of how you want your community to deal with this and then maybe forming webs of webs right where good practices from another community might be something that you can now have like a doubt type of relationship here where then you can have those values disseminate and probably the key to that is really transparency so that you can understand exactly what's going on here and remember even that was something that we didn't really know what the standards were in web too right there were these kind of investigative reporters that would uncover like crumpled powerpoint presentations that explain like how content moderators take down content and they were like insane to see because some of them were really wrong-headed right so um so i think making just a lot of that process more transparent and more governable is going to go a long way won't solve everything but it certainly will be much better than the current state of affairs absolutely um so to kind of give you a little bit more context into this event um a lot of people so we have 500 developers who are working on creating different ways of reimagining social networks whether it's on the twitter or facebook site or media content or live streaming just different ways we can have more consumer social interactions and it's all leveraged on lens protocol and kind of the one key interesting piece here is that kind of what you're fundamentally sort of facilitating is a standard around how people have a shared identity that gives them the ability to just get a graph of all the users who have also interacted in any same realm and i think that's to me a super interesting sort of primitive because we kind of have almost everything open uh and and transparent on watching you can inspect this you can inspect the metadata you can inspect kind of a to b transactions and destinations but there hasn't been a strong incentive or even a lot of attempts right now to really figure out a way to think about how do i in a way roll up the activity or or the identity of a user on a different platform and sort of leverage that to make sense of it on another whether that's like a reputation sort of uh score or or aggregation if this is what you've done that comes in and this is kind of one of the bigger problems with social networks too like i can't quit twitter because everybody i followed follows me must do the same thing or or i have sufficiently enough of an audience that i can say i'm going to quit this thing i'm going here please follow me and i hope that majority of them do um do the same principles exist as you're going to think about in this kind of ukraine case or the war crime sort of side like does a network actually matter or is it largely about the outcome of uh kind of the situation and and that sort of thing or do you think this actually enables more interesting cases or not wow that's like there's so many there's a lot here so i'll try to break it yeah i'm well just i'm just excited to think about i think about how i can answer this some in a clear way because i think there's a lot of possibility right um yeah the first thing i just want to talk about is as you've described here the possibility of creating a social network that has portability as like a key feature right so i have portability of my data my identity et cetera and um i just want to put out there that portability does not equal interoperability right so i can take my data and maybe i have it but like if i can't use it on the other platform then forget it there's like nothing there and so i think that's really important for people to distinguish and stay ahead of because you saw this like when the hand ringing kind of came out with web 2 they said well you can just take out your data okay but what can i do with it right and and by the way what type of data is actually being taken out right in many cases the analysis of my data which was arguably the most important thing that the platform was doing that was still kept proprietary so i think portability and interoperability which are now by the way requirements under things like gdpr um they they are are really important to build into the design and um and and i think it we still need a lot of innovation there so that's that's a that's an important piece um the other thing which is complicated about this but but i think an opportunity is that you really need to figure out what what are you betting on and i think what we're all betting on is not that you have portability and interoperability and identity and um [Music] you know and the ability like robust forms of security but you're really like betting on emergent behavior emergent features and that means that like your design surface is not just around the primitives of how i'm going to do something at a tactical level but that you really want to think about like what are the emergent things that are going to happen when this actually gets deployed and at scale and so i'd urge people to think about like getting the lean prototype experimenting with some things but then really being it's that next stage of the innovation which is actually where you're going to find out what you've got right it's because what you're looking for is changes to the fundamental content and the behavior that is um basically that emerges from the features like i'll give you a funny example but it's a good one until netflix decided to go in and basically like stream things in the way that they did and make their catalog available in the way they did um the phenomenon of binging wasn't possible right and so what happened is that you now have a new pattern of viewing right that's the first level innovation but then the content changed right like the actual television product like yet variable length you had like new ways of thinking about episodes and series et cetera i think that's a really intuitive example to say yeah like it used to be that you had linear content which was distributed on broadcast television that occurred weekly in half an hour chunks and you know it's like wait what you know and 20 weeks and then you get to wait another six months for the next times and then here you see 14 episodes dropped in the same night and people going crazy yeah exactly so the the innovation is not just about the fact that okay here's the content it's available to you in one day it's that like oh yeah this story is like way different than a sitcom right or some whatever kind of classical television uh format and so i think that's a good analogy for what's going to happen here like you really you want to say like okay we're making things interoperable we're making them portable we're making them secure and authentic but like okay now what and so um that's i think the broader conversation that you guys are probably having but with respect to war crimes documentation i think that there is a really interesting phenomenon that it we're on the cusp of which is that right now the challenge is that this type of work is centralized through the investigative authorities that are doing this work for the most part and i think that there's still some wisdom in in having experts deal with content of this kind that makes sense to me but engagement is still really important and that what i think is going to happen is that communities are going to rise up and they're going to say we want to be a part of accountability here and so as open source intelligence gets out there and people going to start processing that information i think the emergent behavior is going to be that we have now open forms of analysis as well as just open forms of documentation and that people are going to say two things one i want to use cryptographic protocols to actually retain the integrity of this information and to preserve it and so i think the archive of this war is not going to be centralized in one repository or like one aws instance right i think it's going to be distributed i think that we're going to find that there's i think it has to be well one would hope right so we're working on that and that's what will make it resilient because if russia even decides to attack or destroy or turn things off okay great well now you know this information is out there and it's the wider and the more diffuse uh pattern of that storage the better off we are and the emergent behavior is that people are committed they're not forgetting they're engaged right as because preservation is a very high form of engagement and then the second thing is that they're going to look at the content in some cases where it's responsible to allow people to look at things and they're going to find evidence that maybe investigators can't find because they're too stretched um and so those um i think those different types of parallelization which is kind of what we haven't seen in moderation like if you like they're largely i mean there's a fair amount of good but largely i think a lot of not great cases where you see kind of reddit mobs hopping up and they end up trying to solve certain things or find clues from just little information and it does end up often leading to results but that's also one sort of side of moderation at scale and we just haven't been able to do that um largely yeah social exist and central networks yeah and the chaos is basically that it's like this with the analogy it's a mob right so it just forms on its own and it's earned and then it's instructed to essentially go and kind of through the crowd the thinking of the crowd right go and attack something um i think in this case like that's the power of these types of solutions that are on chain is we can start to delegate we can create more structure we can think about ways of of encouraging participation but not having to be so unruly um so i hope that that's a that's an emergent thing as well um in i can tell you having worked on the syria conflict which is now in its 11th year and that still most of the major war criminals have not been brought to justice in any meaningful way by the way none nothing on the international level and sparing work done in domestic courts in europe um the reality is this is going to take a while and that what we really need to be thinking about here is a solution that's not about these intervening weeks and months um it's about this is a decade plus right type of uh work on a on on account of a growing challenge with no way to call it this is done this will mutate in different forms um i i do want to end on a note that sort of uh helps uh the attendees for the hackathon sort of uh get some more uh direction towards what they should be thinking about i think one thing you did point out which is a really good thing i should i would like to repeat is just the immersion behavior i think a lot of us when we think about oh let's have a decentralized social media network we're saying okay i need to like have some insurance from getting banned from twitter or youtube so i just need to clone that and have the same one-to-one mapping of what this would look like now just that the data is more distributed that doesn't that doesn't count as emergent i think the emergence comes from the fact that we are seeing use cases that either just are not possible or we can't think of yet or we haven't figured out how to put that right combination in place and obviously nfts did that they did that with music just now and that's kind of an emerging theme we're seeing that with just how people interact and sort of form graphs and and that's a a really interesting thing but the hard piece about this is that we're hoping that there's something new will come up but there's no way for us to kind of prescribe or or give a category because by definition it'll be impossible and uh and while i i will kind of put you on the spot but i'm not going to have you answer that question i'm curious like if you were to kind of give some guidance to the attendees here to think about what they should build or what different ways you would like to see social media networks evolve granted they only have 10 days to try something out and do a minimal viable product what are some things that you think are important um one thing and you know we can direct people towards um looking at some um really cool things on authentication so proponents is really a cool feature that we are looking for in social media networks so the ability essentially to track content when it's first uploaded then who gets to basically how it gets shared and then finally how it's consumed in the end um provenance is a really interesting area to think about for innovation so and specifically with images and video which are are really important um the other thing i'll just come back to um i i will beat the drum again on issues around grievances and feedback so really cool mechanisms for um content moderation that are driven through like awesome methods of feedback and um and grievance of wrestle is like a is seriously the biggest challenge that social media has at the moment and i think small experiments here might be really really cool to check out like how if you have like a massive queue of complaints for example how do you how do you sort through that right how what signals could you bring in that could allow something to jump up to the top and that that people wouldn't game the system necessarily right so i think some of those kind of dynamics are really cool um to think about um and finally um i think the idea of the personas is really powerful and and going to be a tough one uh for people to look at and really meaty um so i'm hoping people if i'm a user on the platform how can i exist in different spaces and shape reputation in my activity um in a meaningful way what does the web 3d version of that look like so you're saying that my address or my identity underlying is the same but it morphs based on the platform i'm on because there's a second sort of abstraction of who i am and how do you kind of manifest that on chin is it just like me saying this is a list of topics i'm interested in and that's sort of what i filled in for a different platform or or how would i kind of dedicate my persona i mean declaration is certainly really important because you obviously want to make sure that people can retain their privacy and disclose what they want to disclose so i think that's important um you know the other thing is just is keeping certain things sequestered in a way right that's another piece of the puzzle right so if you really want to um potentially you may not necessarily want to associate one persona that i have to another persona right so thinking about some innovation about how i could potentially keep different parts of my identity separate that seems really important um i know you know privacy norms were really challenged in web 2 and zuckerberg kind of famously said that you know privacy is like a generational thing um uh i i think that time has not looked favorably on that quote at all i think there's right a lot that we've learned about why privacy really matters i think a new generation has maybe new ideas about expression that's really awesome but i also think that they recognize that choice and agency that comes with um intended encryption and you know some form of um of security um means that you can actually have more robust expression if you have things like security and encryption because you can in those types of settings maybe be your more authentic self right yeah exists um you're right yeah so so that if we can play with those ideas and now say okay how does that relate back to an identity that practically i can use that that's really the kind of area of innovation there's a lot of things that are actionable from everything you've said today so i want to thank you for taking out the time and making this amazing chat happen and kind of working on something that's super important and relevant right now so i really appreciate this and uh thank you so much so great to be here big fan of the community and looking forward to doing even more can't wait to have you back thank you so much jonathan cheers so with this we are ready for our next talk and the next panel is about discussing social impact at scale so we have three amazing people here uh marcus from climate raphael from zuken and scott from get coin and we're going to kind of cover a lot of things that we want to talk about on how we think we can spend our time and resources as developers or as users in web 3 to sort of make all this more impactful for for the space so i want to welcome all of you here um i want to start off by asking the first question which is love for everybody to kind of get to know who you are what you do and sort of how you got into this space and now we just gotta start with scott and we can go to uh marcus but uh scott welcome and uh free to take over awesome yeah kartik thank you so much and i'm just excited to see this topic being discussed now actively um in the space honestly it's been kind of a wild few years on the bitcoin side where we sort of started as a community of uh i guess just software developers looking to grow and sustain public goods in sort of the open source software digital public space and i think what we we're kind of seeing now is honestly just a complete evolution of that into this regenerative finance movement and that's honestly being sort of my mission in the space since i started in the space so it's sort of in a sense like a dream for me that this is happening and i think that you know what i'm hoping will happen in the future is just really getting more of these sorts of conversations happening across the space um but you know my my real background is kind of boring i did machine learning uh back in 2015 kind of got into dallas in 2015-16 the dow hack happened so there was a period there where no one really wanted to talk about dallas for a while um but then i joined bitcoin as a co-founder with kevin in 2017-2018 and that's sort of like the a little bit of a backstory of that whole journey um but yeah i'm just super excited to see this sort of evolution and i'll pause there just because i feel like we have a lot to discuss on that topic later absolutely um marcus would love to kind of get a bit of intro on herself as well as hi everyone um thanks cardik for having us and uh to the lf grow community uh welcome from klima dow glad to be here um so uh ultimately klima is trying to bring the voluntary carbon markets on chain and create a regenerative economy where the fundamental asset of economic activity is tied to environmental services in particular the mitigation of carbon emissions um i personally came into the space um around the time that klima launched a little before um my background is in data science and data engineering i've been working in the web 2 world for about six or seven years um i first started learning about crypto personal investment a couple years ago um took the deep dive into d5 over the last year or so and um when i found klima it all kind of clicked and i was excited to bring my data skill set to bear on this uh exciting new space of refi amazing and raphael last but not least we'd love to learn more about yourself too yeah i'm super excited to be here because actually this is a big flashback for me i've been at east london i don't know if you remember carter i was sitting in in the audience um watching you speak and um so yeah toucan which was still called co2 can two years ago um essentially like our goal is to build you know technology that can put you know climate action at the heart of every financial transaction and we realize that the fastest path towards doing this is to bring carbon on chain as a money lego or as a building block for others to build on right and um yeah marcus is here kimoda obviously being um the most important protocol right now that is building on on toucan and uh hopefully you know one of many protocols uh that can unlock what we now call refi um yeah i'm really happy how this term refi came together i i remember i think like two years ago we tried to term the coin dxe5 for decentralized climate finance but refi is just so much more elegant so yeah it's up here but um yeah like i'm i'm excited to be here and this is a little bit nostalgic maybe we're super excited to have you too i think it's uh this is one of my favorite parts here which is anytime somebody who kind of comes in at the hackathon and sort of ends up pursuing their projects to be more than just a hackathon project and sort of comes back and gives back to the community that is a perfect cycle moment for for us and and just a global team um and it's just wonderful to kind of have these experiences and and interestingly we've had this happen for every single event we've done in the past six months and it just pulls down you know this is a this is a thing so i i'm beyond excited to uh to see this um so i think he kind of brought up a lot of interesting points already because uh this sets up the theme for we want to discuss next um starting with you raphael i would love to kind of understand like what does it mean to be to regen for you and kind of what do you think it's important obviously there's a bias here but would love to uh to uh kind of still get that answer from each of you yeah i mean that's a tough one actually so for me the the the main the main problem that we have right now is you know climate change is a huge coordination failure and um when i first looked at this problem two years ago i was coming also coming from the dao perspective and i was like cool we have these amazing coordination tools smart contracts are great at that and we have this huge coordination failure how can we you know put the two together and for me um probably being a regen is applying some degen uh blood towards a regenerative cause so um it's you know let's try things let's experiment let's move quickly really like one of the key thesis no that's probably not the right word but you know what i'm going to say behind toucan is um we want to put the the the mind share and like just the innovative power behind 3 on to work on the biggest problem that we have as a human species so um yeah for me being a region means um trying out failing you know experiment and um and see what you know where it leads us and honestly uh climate change is is a money problem also right like in both that we need to allocate huge amounts of money and other resources towards solving the climate crisis but interestingly money is also potentially part of a solution um which i'm sure marcus can talk more about so um yeah i'll stop here we can jump right into marcus um marcus what does it mean to be a regen for you and uh why is it important now for you yeah so to me the the real difference between a d-gen and a regen it comes back to like the structure of economic systems um so i think often um well historically um externalities have been a way to get ahead in the capitalist system right you you can basically get something for free by you know polluting or you know taking water from a public source or um yeah basically externalities are a major problem for traditional capitalist systems and regen refi represents this idea opportunity to create financial systems create economic systems where incentives are aligned where um the long-term health of the ecosystem is priced in to on the cost of doing business and uh you know the hard part though of course is that as rafa said there's money on the line right because there's obviously uh when you internalize uh an externality that incurs a cost um and i think until very recently in legacy you know corporate world the cost of addressing the externality of pollution as an example um of carbon emissions has not been the cost of addressing that has not been justified um there wasn't social pressure there wasn't a feeling of urgency i mean the case of the um you know major fossil fuel companies basically covering up the science on global warming is pretty damning evidence on that front um but there's now this opportunity to to turn that narrative around right to um for instance one of the things that i think is really you know i think there's an opportunity to create collaboration where there once was competition and that's what refi ultimately means to me that's this incredible answer and um i'll just let's got jump into yeah i definitely think the positive externality piece is at the heart of pretty much everything we're talking about here because and actually i would really credit toby shawn and the other internet crew for writing a really great piece on this positive some worlds which kind of highlights the fact that what we're building and actually what daos are able to kind of produce is kind of a club model which or commons model depending on how you frame it which allows for positive externalities to actually be produced uh kind of as a side effect and i think that that's something that previously was very difficult to extend so if you look back to like ostrom's common model uh commons model rather in sort of like that framing that the problem is really that you have local resources which are kind of scarce and you need a way to manage them you need a way to ensure that people are using them effectively and um what hardened sort of in opposition to ostrom was originally stating was that you would effectively end up with this tragedy of the commons where you would never be able to do that effectively you would always end up with basically someone defecting deciding just to go off on their own and not really work with the group and ostrom was able to show at local scale that you can actually do that pretty effectively and there's many cases in which that's happened but in a global context it's very easy to pass on externalities very easy i guess as marcus mentioned just it's very easy to pass off pretty much everything um that is you know not useful to you as a company or as even a government to some other external party and so with climate change you see this most prominently but it's also true with things like open source software with things like even you know right now as we're seeing uh with some of the crises that are happening uh with things like peace it's very difficult to get people just on a global scale to coordinate and i think what's interesting is this idea effectively of you know public goods on the one hand but also global common sort of management which is enabled by these style structures so that to me is really the sort of like the positive externality piece of that is at the heart of why we can actually basically enable these uh kinds of solutions today in ways we couldn't before so that's uh a bit of a tldr you know it's it's really good framing too because that is fundamentally i like the fact that you're looking at measuring the impact and not just the process and that's kind of a good way to think about this because otherwise you don't make progress and uh so i think i feel like one thing i missed asking which i should have done before this question is actually giving the audience a better understanding of what each of you actually do in terms of what the protocol does or what the company does so uh there's obviously a big climate heavy focus on this panel in terms of two out of three of you are on that problem but bitcoin specifically is a really good probably good sort of solution and company out there uh so i'd love to start with you scott and then i'll learn more about you can and and clima and just kind of go into what is it the the platform does how do you do it uh some of the impact that you can kind of talk about and just how does how do things work behind the scenes and under the head um so let's start with bitcoin and then we can go to uh clima and 2k awesome we've yeah principally been focused on quadratic funding which is a lot to really get into but in short it's really a democratic way to crowdfund contributions in a way that kind of allows for a community to signal its preferences according to the will of sort of the poor many versus the rich and a few so you could imagine if you have 20 grantees which actually we do right now sort of have year round going for grants around 13 where you can see this in action but the idea essentially is that over a two week period let's say you get a sense of what the community is signaling and you use this method which actually was created by glenn wales that we had saved in vitalik to effectively distribute a pool of matching funds from larger players in the system so in the end you end up with kind of a preference ordering for a given set of public goods uh within a specific community context and you can almost almost imagine those communities as kind of their own commons right so you know someone like a group like polygon or a group like um ave or group like um you know anyone else who's kind of uh got their own ecosystem could you know kind of curate and decide on what they care about and what public goods they want to fund in the context of their unique assistance but the beauty is that those end up actually themselves creating positive externalities because it's all open source software so that's kind of the tldr of just you know what we're aiming to do with the tooling that we have and we've started to like as i kind of mentioned at the beginning expand on this notion in the context of you know things like climate we the planet around going now uh and things like uh longevity human health um peace in the case of funding uh in the case of ukraine and ultimately those are to me exactly as robert kind of mentioned the problems that i think are just missing solutions in the context of you know existing institutions um and so you know we're kind of broad in terms of what we focus on in terms of impact open source software was the start but i think there is this broader recognition in the community over the last few years that there really is a potential for us to actually bring this impact back to the physical world which of course everything that we're doing relies on amazing um marcus do you want to jump in sure um i have to say though i think it might be easier to understand what clima is after toucan explains how they bring carbon on chain sure here there you go yeah cool um i mean so two can really uh at the at the core is um is a way to connect the web to carbon market with web3 right so um there's a bunch of like small comp like you know modules to it the first one being the carbon bridge so essentially this is a way to connect to what we call source registries so um what's important to know is that we so we only bring credits on chain that are verified by nonprofits and so-called carbon standards in the real world so we're not like the auditing the auditing body we're really just like technology infrastructure that allows anybody that holds these credits today to to move them on chain and so um on the other side of you know when you use the carbon bridge as a user you get so-called tco2 tokens which are project specific carbon tokens so that's important because they carry all the metadata and attributes that are that are relevant because you know carbon is a very diverse asset actually like carbon credits you know can be generated by planting trees by protecting trees by having solar energy or like direct air capture so it's like a really broad field of use cases that can produce karma credits right and so um we want to make sure that these that all this data is is represented and then now you can think of credits like a semi-fundable you know karma credit is like semi-fungible so what we want to do is if we want to create some commoditization and harmonization to this asset class based on like logical um like homogeneous groups and so a good example for instance is the nature of carbon ton which we launched a couple of weeks ago which essentially is like a pool where you can deposit nature-based tco2 tokens or nature-based carbon credits into the pool as long as they match these criteria so you can think of it like a you know i'm from berlin so you can think of it like a club that has a bouncer and it only allows certain types of carbon credits to go into the club and um and what you get on the other side is a it's what we call a carbon reference token so um in that case it's nct the nature carbon ton and that now has obviously much deeper liquidity and it has more like um it behaves more like a commodity right and so there's right now there's nct the nature carbon ton and bct bct which was developed together with climadou back in october to serve their their theory of change um of moving your price floor up um for carbon and um yeah you know the main idea like the main the main thing that we want to unlock is the builders kind of using these building blocks to create you know novel applications and this way i'm excited to see what comes out of uh this hackathon also and um yeah so there's also two can bounty by the way so building with carbon uh and and and social graphs i think i'm i'm excited to see what comes out of it cool i'll go ahead so thanks for setting that up profile um so you know as as rafa was describing uh carbon credits themselves are um sort of like a commodity um but they're heterogeneous and what you can has done is brought them on chain um this sort of legacy web 2 um financial instrument essentially brought them on chain and made them into a tradable asset an erc20 um but that's not really that's sort of like the beginning of a d5 protocol rather than the end right because there's the market that needs to be created if we use an analogy here um to like a sort of antiquated concept of like rail travel um so you know there's someone has to build the rails and then there's a set of cars that carry some commodity on that on those rails right um if if toucan is like building the cars and putting you know allowing people to put their tonnage into the cars um klima is trying to own the rails so we're establishing and holding long-term liquidity for carbon assets on chain um we started out with two cans bct um we since added mco2 into our sort of liquidity rail ecosystem and the idea is that the klima token is sort of the reserve currency of this new on-chain carbon market where if you want to acquire bct if you want to acquire nct if you want to acquire mco2 or any other carbon assets that come online clima is your medium of exchange right um and the reason why clima climate has been structured the tokenomics have been structured in such a way that the supply of climate is tied to the amount of carbon held in kalima dallas treasury so basically there's a liquidity flywheel inspired by the olympus protocol where klima is minted and issued in return for bonders bringing an asset to the treasury so that whole olympus protocol stuff is quite complicated honestly but a good analogy to um to have in your head when you're thinking about olympus style protocols is the federal reserve system which i understand many people may not be familiar with that system but the basic idea is you have some treasury of assets um like in the old days it was gold and silver would be held in the federal reserve and then dollars would be printed where each dollar is backed by some amount of gold in the treasury um so klima is very similar the klima token in order to issue one klima we have to hold at least one ton of carbon offsets in the treasury um so that's sort of like the top level but if i um if i step back and like think about what is klima trying to do ultimately we are trying to create on where the fundamental asset in that economy is carbon offsets or really more generally any kind of environmental service that can be tokenized um so starting with carbon offsets makes a lot of sense because they're an established market they've been around for about 20 years and there's already existing demand um but one of the things we're really excited about moving forward is the opportunity to create um an economy where as a supplier even you could potentially perform some service right uh you know whether that's planting trees or switching to solar renewable energy um but to create an economy where anyone can participate as a supplier of some ecosystem service and as a consumer of the tokenized versions of those environmental services um to be a little more clear about like what i'm actually talking about um you know carbon offsets are one way of uh of financializing an ecosystem service um another idea would be something like a uh you know an ocean cleanup credit um or a wetland restoration credit now the hard part right now is this is a very immature industry and there aren't great methodologies for those more specific types of environmental services um so we're sort of starting with carbon offsets as a simple already existing environmental service that can be tokenized but the goal really is to create an economy that incentivizes preservation of our planet rather than destruction of the planet it's super insightful this is amazing and i love kind of the the scope of the impact which is you finally get to work at problems that scale with the help of anybody who wants to part of these communities and that's a really unique thing that i think we've seen in in what three um uh there's a common theme that's been touched on here and marcus you just kind of highlighted that um we're gonna point out that the carbon credit markets have been around for a couple decades already and everybody has kind of been talking about these things for for a long time in general uh i guess from each of your perspectives and maybe we can start with scott here what do you think has changed over the last couple of years that have sort of created the surge in everybody wanting to focus more on an impact or refi and kind of what do you think that the factors have been that sort of sparked this i think honestly like kind of what marcus mentioned the tooling is just there now where it wasn't before in a lot of ways there just wasn't really an easy way to you know even in 2017 2018 the idea of even though many people were building kind of products at that time the idea of having users at scale doing this sort of work was like kind of unlikely and now we've realized that actually that's really not even the model that you want to think about you really want to think about building entire kind of like collective communities um almost like effectively greater collectives in which these kind of actions can take place and that generally speaking most people are actually very interested in doing this because if you look at how the traditional economy is run over the last even five ten years it's generally not being very good for the average person and i think that ultimately people are just looking for ways to find more meaning in the work that they're doing um there's some great thinkers on this topic actually including yvonne ilitch or highlight just as one that folks can probably check out later it's too much to get into here but i think that ultimately that search for sort of um you know really finding solutions to the problems that we're facing is something that just naturally has almost taken shape in the context of a more absurdist post-modern society that we're in the the other last thing i'll just notice i think you know from my perspective i think that people ultimately just learned a lot over the pandemic about how much we can coordinate globally uh in ways that we're just not possible or really you know as i mentioned like the tools weren't there for before and so i think there's also been in light of all these things that kind of cultural social shift um but the details of those things are like way too much to go into i'm sure rafa markets can dive in a bit more yeah i mean what you said is just jumping on it like i think we're just in like very turbulent times like you know as you know i live in europe and you know europe is like i've wore really close to me and like this just one example but i think in general as as like a human at human level we're kind of in a transition phase it feels right and it it's very clear that the the model that we thought was uh working hyper growth etc globalization like we just you know we just looked at the bright side we completely ignored some of you know that we were basically destroying the the basis of of life and so it's just so clear but it's really hard to get out of that right it's like it's like we we we're like addicted to growth and we're um and also on like the personal level right like it's just everybody's just like why should i you know where why should i give up my car where so like it's a it's a really fundamental problem um and i think what has changed so you know i remember two years ago when i talked about crypto and carbon like nobody cared um but like also in crypto i think the the tone has shift shifted right it's kind of like an industry which um which now has you know like there's been a lot of criticism actually about the environmental footprint also crypto i think that has actually played like the nft like the nft hype which has been you know bringing a completely new set of users actually to web 3 that we're maybe more more climate conscious has i think done a lot of good for this climate and refund movement um and kind of opened open the door but generally i think as scott was saying like people love to work on something that is meaningful and now you can actually work in the most fascinating industry of the world and do something meaningful like so you know i think it's um that place that plays into it it's just like um yeah doing something meaningful can be fun and um and people because of this transitionary phase are are willing to think outside of the box right something that climate would just not have been possible even if it i think was techno like if even if the technology was there like 10 years ago i don't think like people were ready to to rethink money at that scale right and what crypto has done is that it you know it's it made reinventing money really easy and this just opens up you know a new like a new playing field and uh so yeah i i guess this is it's just interesting times and like turbulent times are always interesting times and that's where kind of major shifts happen yeah yeah i think you know it's just speaking from my personal experience relatively new to the web 3 space and was really inspired by klima to drop my my meat space job and go full time basically as rava was saying you know with to take this opportunity that isn't presented very often to work on something meaningful and you know on cutting-edge technology um so i do think there's a sense that like the pressure to do something at least in like the climate space specifically has been growing and growing and public consciousness does seem to have shifted in the last couple of years um to the point where like corporates are under extreme pressure you know to have esg plans um and like the mainstream public is fed up with inaction on this issue specifically i think um the the other thing i will say though is i do think there's been some important innovation in d5 specifically that has unlocked some of these new economic systems that weren't really practical um before like i know that some of the early um klima founders had kind of an idea for this concept of like a new money system built with carbon as the backing but the idea of like a on-chain treasury managed using a bonding mechanism similar to the federal reserve was really not it hadn't been implemented until olympus came around um and so it's really these lego blocks that have been created that now allow us to build more sophisticated structures that enable refi to exist as such that's a really good point and actually this was exactly my next question which is there a lot of that from a timing standpoint is also because you have now an abstraction that just previously wasn't there or we just hadn't figured out how do we actually enable certain things to exist in a simple way aside from what you just said marcus what else is um is kind of just enabled by blockchains here that sort of helps you accomplish the goals for each of your companies yeah i in the carbon space specifically there's a huge opportunity because the legacy carbon market is um pretty uh antiquated to use a nice term um so there's a huge lack of transparency most of these deals are done in back rooms you know behind closed doors pricing data is not public so like most transactions are not um you don't know how much people like microsoft and amazon are paying for the tons they're acquiring um so there's a level of transparency just at a pure like financial level that the blockchain brings that is right now absent from the legacy markets um at least in the carbon offset space so that's a big opportunity um the other thing i would say is that um this sort of interoperability aspect is really um promising because um you know in the old world if you want to retire your carbon credits if you want to claim them um it's like a manual process like you're talking like spreadsheets and email level of technology um and so if you wanted to automate offsetting that is like not really practical to do some you know larger entities have set up api connections and stuff but it's not practical for a small project to offset automatically um whereas on chain it's just a contract call um so that level of abstraction has really created um the opportunity to create an ecosystem rather than a series of like walled gardens where you have to go through um like a web to centralize authority to offset your carbon yeah just like jumping on that you know carbon credits really are packaged positive externalities right like somebody's going out is doing something and somebody's verifying somebody else is verifying that like there has been like a state change essentially right so let's from no trees to trees right and the the delta in that state range is then given out in terms of carbon credits but so it's a carbon credit really is a bunch of data and signatures and right now a lot of pdf documents that are uh kind of packaged together right so um but ultimately we're dealing with like an intangible asset that is you can see it you can smell it and so i i personally think that environmental markets are like this is this might be the killer use case for for blockchains right or it's definitely i believe it's definitely one of them right um because because the integrity of that process is so important and um because you know and just adding on top of what marcus has been saying is not like every jurisdiction i was trying to figure out how do we how do we address climate change and so there's a bunch of different carbon markets actually right like we talked about the carbon market as if it was one thing um when we talked about the carbon market actually we talked about the voluntary carbon market right now but there's like event there's like a compliance carbon market and that one is you know it's different for colombia than it is for the us than than for europe so um everybody's like doing a little bit of their own thing and then we have these credits and some of these are accepted in one jurisdiction and not in another so um like we believe that having that like you know neutral piece of infrastructure that's what we call the meta registry that um everybody can issue on and that everybody can retire and like everybody you know can can do so programmatically um this can actually unlock a much more homogeneous global carbon market that i think we need to have in order to address this at scale because climate change is a global problem and doing regulation on the like local level i don't think it's going to cut it um so yeah i'll stop there but um i'm really like actually my conviction grew grows by every like every day my conviction grows that you know two years ago i thought crypto might be a good market to sell carbon into and now like in the last few years i realized no no it's actually like we're now kind of leapfrogging from web one directly into web3 carbon markets basically yeah no absolutely it also says scott i know this is maybe not 100 overlapping but i'm sure there's an answer for for get going and giving out grants too so we'd love for you to share one thoughts yeah i mean for us it's it's pretty simple which is like in again like three years ago five years ago dows were not really a topic that were very popular um and i think that the idea of that i mean downs are a nebulous term but really what we're talking about like when i talk about them at least what i'm trying to kind of get out is the idea of these global internet native organizations and almost like kind of you know commons uh based organizations that to robin's point have the ability to create their own currencies and govern themselves according to their own rules and really all that we're doing with the tooling that we have with prophetic funding and so forth is providing a rail for them to basically figure out what their preferences are how they should prioritize what they're you know funding and in a way that effectively allows them to uh you know build things that create positive externalities i just think that really you know we we did that for so long with mostly the support of the dream foundation and um now there's just hundreds of orgs that want to do the same thing and are kind of um leaning on a lot of the principles that folks like actually aya like in the talk together like the subtraction mindset uh sort of principles um from from that side of the space and that to me is really just at the heart of everything that we're doing i think one one thing that um we sort of in a way acknowledge but didn't touch on specifically is i think all three of you are in an industry that is that as a proxy for like uh the enterprise side or just the legacy world also is is a pretty big player and kind of my question so i've got two kind of two-part question here so the first piece here is for the current non-blockchain solution that's out there for the problem you're solving um what does that kind of look like in terms of the partners that you have to work with their reactions about the technology or what do you have to convince them to actually think about these things or accept your solution as one of the other integrations like what does that look like and then similar to kind of on that theme what has been anywhere from challenging to the still stuff that you have to do behind the scenes that interacts with the real world especially for a lot of stuff around carbon credits i assume it's it's not just a software only problem um it'll be obviously to think so so what kind of goes on behind the scenes what are those conversations like what are the challenges there and kind of how do you think about that part of the world also now adopting to uh the newer solutions yeah i so klima has a bit of an interesting positioning here because we we're ultimately aiming to be a credibly neutral market facilitator right we we want to work with everybody basically um and so that gives us an opportunity but also a challenge um because you know the opportunity is we are able to interface with standards bodies you know we're able to interface with um with legacy carbon players and sort of get feedback from them get input from them um but when it comes to actually bringing um consumers of credits on chain there's definitely a dichotomy between the sort of um legacy consumers who are already operating the market already you have expertise and how to offset versus the entities that maybe want to be doing that but don't have the resources or the funding to do that so that's kind of where we've been starting in terms of our outreach we have a partnership program called palima infiniti where we're basically um working with enterprises partnering with enterprises and protocols to offset their emissions it's kind of similar to a like consulting model that many legacy carbon brokers employ where they'll like uh be hired you know for a few hundred grand to you know calculate the emissions and um and handle all the offsetting activity um so what we've been what we found is that we basically for the legacy consumers we need to fit into their box we need to kind of um show them that there really isn't that big of a difference between um consuming on chain and consuming in the legacy world um at least in terms of the underlying you know legitimacy and quality of the credits um so there's definitely like a fud aspect where you know people who are um experienced in the legacy market want to um throw shade at tokenized carbon um either from lack of understanding or because they feel threatened um so i'd say that's our biggest challenge is like trying to keep everyone 3-3 like trying to keep everyone realizing that like there's a positive some outcome it's better for everyone to move the market on chain um especially in the light of like um uh legacy players whose business model is potentially being disrupted yeah i think you're mentioning a good good point there is that like i think it's it's a mixture of curiosity and fear for the legacy carbon market but in general i think it's the curiosity is winning and this is because it's you know it's a market that historically the volunteer carbon market certainly has been a very small market and uh it's been mostly driven by ngos and you know a few few few corporate customers but there's a very there's a new wave like the customers of the last 20 years are not the same as the corporates that are buying today right you know microsoft and um you know blackrock et cetera they were like carbon offsets were not that big of their agenda like 10 years ago and so we have there like the card market is now in a phase where the demand side is much more demanding also in what they want to see right so they're asking for more data driven asking for more transparency in the process etc so you kind of have a market that is didn't have the time to adapt to its kind of popularity and so um so curiosity i would say is definitely winning because people understand that they need to innovate they need to you know adopt digital um digital technologies and you know why not go all the way so i but yeah so also just adding is that the carbon market also has been a place of fraud historically like there have been incidences of fraud um back in you know 2010 and 2008 etc so um there's this i think there's this fear um with regards to crypto that you know just a bunch of cowboys that are now trying to like fraud people and i so i think you know this adds to that the fact that there has been you know fraud historically adds to the skepticism but um but yeah like generally i would say um [Music] it's the curiosity is is definitely winning and um i have no doubt that um like we too can definitely you know pay a lot of attention to make sure that the the tokens themselves are linked directly to the option asset and that it's like a two-way link basically so yeah if somebody takes the time to actually look how that is created it's like really hard to say that you know yeah to not understand what's going on basically also interestingly uh the answer to the fraud situation problem is is being actually digital and having traceability so yeah it should tell me about it yeah yeah i also want to make sure that you get a chance to comment on this as well yeah i think actually it's funny the fraud piece is particularly relevant for for us because really you know what we're trying to do is figure out ways to in an incredibly neutral way but also in a way that is sort of ensuring you know legitimacy of the donations measure the impact that's being made in a way that wasn't really possible in a lot of i would say not most but like a large portion of web 2 philanthropic initiatives and i think there's a problem right now of mostly people similar to the realizations we mentioned before in the context of other parts of sort of the economy but there's a realization that a lot of these large you know foundations which which have lots of money don't have a lot of transparency into how they're sort of you know spending that funding and i think that ultimately what we're realizing is that in a lot of those cases using these tools uh whether it's quadratic funding or whether it's you know there's a lot of really cool work happening around the conviction voting conviction related funding too there's retroactive funding which optimism students and amazing work on all those tools give us new ways to basically deploy funding that just weren't really there before and that weren't really nearly as transparent i think as they can be now and i kind of also want to get to uh wrapping this up on respectful everybody's time um so kind of the final question is like obviously we kind of talked about how these things are sort of uh being done right now and kind of the individual standalone impact that all these solutions would have i think what's interesting here and kind of also why this is part of the actual electro summit is that there are still more amplified and exponential uh benefits of this being part of a larger network whether it's from a graph or just being able to port anywhere from your history or background to to other uh solutions out there whether it's on the d5 side or other social networks or any other on-chain activity so kind of from each of your perspective how do you kind of think that having sort of a notion of decentralized graph of everybody's impact or activity would amplify a refi uh like looking at just kind of lens altogether or your wish list of all this um how can we make that better for refi yeah i just want to reference a book that is very inspiring um for klimadow and kind of ties into this question um it's called the ministry for the future by kim stanley robinson and one of the really cool aspects of that is that um basically in the book uh a decentralized social network is the driver of mass adoption of crypto and the use of a carbon back currency to basically save the planet from climate change um so i think there's a really exciting opportunity here to leverage um like social pressure social um essentially social proof right like you can show your friends your colleagues that you've taken you know you put your money where your mouth is um so one of the ideas we're really excited about is this notion of like a green check um right so by um basically going through some verifiable on-chain process you can attest that you have you know made a pledge of like what you think your missions are um publish that pledge and then you know showing that you on chain offset that tonnage to you know meet your your pledge um and then you get a little check a little social proof that you have actually done this action and you can share that um with your with your network yeah i would agree is i think i think this is one of the key missing components right so um it's it all comes back like you know climate action is something like why do we do that right like uh you know i live in berlin i've lots of friends who you know who are very conscious of these things and i think actually you know and i've learned a lot about like environmentalism from my friends so for my you know for my peers essentially and i see other doing a behavior and actually i might copy it so i think that this um you know this is how humans work and having this ported into the virtual space which where you know we spend more and more time in you know the metaverse essentially and and porting that into the metaverse and allowing you know people to express themselves and to show like the impact that they have uh actually creates a new new currency right which is status and which creates new incentives ultimately for people to do the right thing because uh you know we know from from behavioral science that people like if nobody sees you like people do pretty horrible stuff right but if other people are looking uh people start to behave you know in a much more 3-3 positive some like you know way so i i'm super excited about um about that component being being brought unchained and uh yeah like as i said earlier i can't wait to see like what comes out of it and um you know like not just out of this hackathon but you know we've been we've been we've been in conversations um and i really want to make sure that this is deeply integrated into kind of the the climate positive and not just climate you know like climate is just one problem that we need to solve it's not it's not the yeah it's just you know it's it's not everything so um yeah i'm really stoked and i think it's really important yeah i think there's a lot of really interesting ideas around like almost a regen sport and that's actually being something that we've seen play out in previous rounds uh on bitcoin where people effectively end up donating projects and they end up with actually real rewards as a result of that from you know projects that end up kind of graduating and going and doing their own thing and then giving back to the community that supported them i think in addition though there's this kind of question of on the one hand there's incentives for like extrinsically motivating people to do the work they should be doing there's also the idea of and this is true in open source software and i think it's just a really important point to hit home is there's people who are also really already intrinsically motivated to do things but don't actually have the financial means to do them and i think that it's often you know historically an open source software and i think this is true in the case of uh you know the climate space and other sort of like global commons as well there's this problem of just generally people not being willing to uh you know not necessarily sorry that they're they're willing to but they're necessarily able to take the time to do the work that they want to do and i think that's actually you know kind of going back to our previous conversation where there's just this mass sort of realization that wait like the collective hallucination that we had before doesn't necessarily uh you know align with our values and now we have you know all these tools to sort of allow that intrinsic motivation to shine through so um i might be overly optimistic about the natural state of things but i think that's a really key piece yeah optimism is important in order to stand up in the morning i i absolutely agree and i think one kind of cool piece about this thing is that especially at a hackathon you get to try all these possibilities at a smaller scale and just see what resonates or what actually the impact could be and use it as a proxy to decide what direction you should sort of choose or go in more on so yeah i'm super excited to see kind of seeing a couple of interesting carbon outside use cases with new social networks that come out of this hackathon and everything that you set scott i think makes absolute sense um yeah like this is very much needed and i'm glad that people are actually thinking about this thing as a priority not just as a a side thing that they should signal that they care about so uh thank you so much uh all three of you for giving us a time and kind of making this amazing chat and uh wanna thank uh for thank you for your time cool thank you kartik thanks so much thank you thank you all right with that we are ready for our last talk for this summit so the last topic in this panel is on the future of on-chain collaboration and just kind of how we think about dials all together and what we can do if we have a notion of more interesting listening about software so for this panel i'd like to invite joyce patrick alex and jess on stage i'd like to ask all of you turn the videos on just will be moderating this this discussion and uh i'll let you always take it from here okay wonderful i'm super excited to be here and thank you everyone for joining us thank you patrick jess and alex for being here we're saving the best panel for last and today we'll be talking about the future of on-chain collaboration which means a lot of things so why don't we get started and have everyone introduce themselves i'll kick it off first my name is joyce yang i'll be your moderator today i'm the founder of gcr or global coin research we are research investment dao and next maybe patrick or jess feel free hey hoppin patrick i'm currently a product engineer at mirror we're a web3 publishing tool we've worked with a lot of dows over the past year who have used our crowdfunding tool to bootstrap their treasury and use it as a form of membership for discord servers a lot of these products came from c club and gonna be a good transition to jess what's up folks jess uh co-creator of c club and mostly just fascinated with that orange couch kartik had there i'm hoping somebody's making a meme of that that looked way too good uh yeah c club is is a dow that builds and invests in other tokenized communities or dows some call it a web three there you go kartik what's up uh a web3y combinator we're trying to re-imagine what an accelerator looks like as a network and having a lot of fun doing it yes uh hey everyone my name is next massmarge ogc club cohort uh with the alex token that was my way of moving to the united states with the isa uh social erc 20 token now i am building showtime a web 3 social platform that is coming soon on the app store um and yeah trying to imagine what social media looks like in web 3. yeah awesome thank you everyone for that intro i think to get started off um we'd love to learn a little bit more about how each of you work with other members in your dow or project and the challenges around managing that maybe alex we could go start first sure so i've been part of many dows actually those were my only way of collaborating with people ever before my job at showtime and so the way it works was usually social consensus so like we minimized on-chain collaboration as much as possible and by default we used the mology framework which was popular two years ago i think now mirror is more like the best practice if you want to launch adele um um authenticity club if it's more serious um but um yeah so minimizing social collaboration and really keeping it as tight as possible and really like progressively decentralized later on and i feel like the same is true at the time like we do have smart contracts there are people building on top of the protocol someone built like an instagram to nft on showtime website without or knowledge or like pool sweet did like a valentine's day drop and what's really cool is that we can just you know uh do a dm group and very quickly i trade it on smart contracts without much uh collaboration human expression needed um so i guess yeah if it's for using smart contracts as as little augmented correlation as possible if it's more for like investing in projects like media cartel uh then it's like as much human quality as possible and that and they're like the less on-scene collaboration um uh needed so yeah i guess it depends on on the use case and can you just share some challenges there just as a follow-up so i guess uh some challenges well i guess all of the current infra challenges so um you have to be a true crypto native today to participate in taos um you have to understand discord you have to have gas uh like ethermatic on polygon to get started and you have to understand a lot of knowledge and get your wallet started and get an understanding of noises safe so i would say those are the challenges to onboard people um and um yeah i think that that's already a big big blocker yeah jess i feel like you've been nodding there what was the the first question again the first question is how do you work with your current dow members right now so you know c club has had the pleasure privilege of working with uh you know probably more than 50 projects we have 20 in our current accelerator batch right now and i think like the there's a ton of consistencies and just a kind of ton of variability um but i think like the the hardest challenge of like the complication is just that the human layer as i think alex is sort of hinting at right like we're somehow believing that we need to reinvent the wheel significantly obviously there's reinvention to be done but there's a ton of history and lessons in just you know dealing with human beings and and uh collaboration and structure and all those things that come out of you know a long long long history of exploration and and um and innovation and organization design that i think um you know we're sort of intersecting with uh at the technology level and i think still a lot of that hard work to be done is in the soft side of things like you know how do we build trust how do we um think about compensating people in an organization that doesn't have you know the ease of hierarchy um how do we know who owns things and gets things done so a lot of really boring stuff that gets people to work together i think is really where we're at right now we've come through this big phase of nft's endows being popular and interesting and easy to do and exciting um i think like the hard work right now is like how do we turn these into sustainable long-lasting networks that create value for their members and part of that's tech but i think the hard work right now is uh on the human to human level that's great and patrick and so my experience with dallas have been part of some but the one maybe unique perspective is from mir and just watching projects go to the life cycle and we would like to model dows like through different phases and i merely focus mainly on the first phase the bootstrapping or like one of the early phases and so our crowdfunding tool you basically can use it to raise eth and put it into your treasury and then with that e you can basically have governance proposals or you can have working groups you can give them allocate specific budgets and so one thing that i've noticed with the projects that do well versus the ones that aren't as sustainable is that it's really around kind of paradoxical a lot of people talk about ownership but to justice point around like just general like organizational best practices many of the dials just have a lot of part-time members or people who don't feel like fully invested in the project and so it's kind of like yeah this lack of clarity lack of vision there isn't a specific point of contact and so it kind of ends up being just kind of this thing where people hang out a bit and then slowly over time people sharing they stop checking it they turn off notifications they leave etc and so i think the main thing is really having a core team strong core team that has a vision has a specific mission purpose and there's like i like to think about in terms of concentric circles if you don't have that core team it's very hard to really build a sustainable project whether that's a product a protocol a dow just an online community etc and so yeah again having that strong core team that has a vision is organized is willing to take ownership and push things forward whether it's governance proposals whether it's treasury management whether it's projects to drive revenue et cetera that's that's probably one of the main things yeah i totally agree with all of what you mentioned and it sounds like coordination leadership and what alex mentioned is on-ramp and on-boarding users and members into the dao ecosystem are some of the big challenges that we encounter i'm curious what do you think is currently missing when it comes to when you're collaborating with other folks meaning you know when we are doing uh or working in a project or a company in the web 2 space historically there has been guidelines or rules or or tools that are provided and what do you think right now is primarily missing in the space besides these soft skills and kind of on-ramp tools that you mentioned i mean lots yeah i think like the if we zoom out like what what are dows which is just like a massive term but it's like it's on chain organizations and we're using new rails that allow us to you know collaborate regardless of jurisdiction or where you are in the world um often it's amount of time you can you know there's just a variety of ways we're building these sort of new organizations on new rails and that you know we've come to a 20 30 year innovation cycle of building sas products for building you know digital or digitizing our meat space businesses and i think we're gonna go through a similar sort of evolution here probably a bit compressed so like very easy things to do in you know traditional business like set up a legal structure set up payroll and uh health insurance and all the sort of basic things are still a challenge to do or nascent at least and tools are being built from it um and that's not even sort of touching in on like the more novel ways people are working together you know many people contribute to many different projects what does that mean you know where do you pay taxes all these sort of things uh but i think like the the biggest thing that's missing from this is really like a clear understanding of what the business is that people are in when they're building dows i think there's still a big question mark around many many many of the concepts that are out there um i think sort of like an honest look at the space right now is one where there's a lot of great exciting opportunities we sort of have some insights on where value can be grown with some insights on what valuable token mechanics might be useful for these organizations um but we're still exploring exploring so um you know i think one of the the interesting things about the point of the cycle we're in right now is that people like that early majority or early mainstream or maybe early adopters are excited about dows um you come in you're like i'm ready to go do this dao thing and are sort of ignorant of just the how much further we do have to go on across all layers of the stack and you know including conceptually so uh that makes me incredibly bullish i think like that's the place we should be in right now there's so much energy and excitement and capital coming to the space um but i think it should be directed in at solving the biggest challenges which is like you know why is this and for what use cases are these structures better than others um you know we have some insights at club but we're really excited to see many many more people push those core questions forward thank you alex yeah i totally agree with just i think because we were so early people can throw terms like dows or craters or nfts but those are extremely vague terms and i think actually vitalik talked about it's like denver and encouraged entrepreneurs to think of use cases and like actual actions that are less vague and have a precise use case because i feel like if we get lost into the grand vision of dao's of like a wikipedia wikipedia-like giant that can reward millions of contributors it's awesome but it will probably happen in like 10 years or 15 years and so i would say like what is a realistic next step iterative step that we can take um and you know kind of like in the 90s like wordpress like people thought they would do micro blogging and like have those long form content but turns out twitter won by like a very simple 140 characters length and i feel like the same is true for dials right now what we are exploring at our project is what can we do besides entering a dow by buying i think crowdfunding mirror proof there was a really great use case but i feel like earning is something interesting that can build your reputation like rabbit hole is doing but instead of earning from a d5 protocol like representative is doing maybe we can explore earning from doing something participating with a crater or a dow and then earning a token for free scaling solutions like polygon and soon optimistic roll-ups and secure ups could help make that gas-free instant and cheap that could onboard like orders of magnitude more people than buying because buying as we talked about like suffers from all the on-ramps and infrastructural uh weaknesses that we have today yeah patrick yeah and so with dows there's like tons of different components there's like yeah operations like payroll that's like compensation there's governance and then there's this other component like around business model and like token incentives but to alex's point i just think a really interesting one is around reputation and identity and like credentials and understanding like okay who are the people that are best suited to do this specific thing for this doubt or out of different like service dials that maybe focus on specific things like tokenomics or governance or design or product or protocol etc which are the best ones to help with our specific problems and yeah i'm really interested in seeing how people can build up reputation through doing things on chain as opposed to yeah just taping into tokens and flipping them and yeah especially with l2s where it's like the ideal scenario is you basically just download a wallet you don't need any tokens and you can start earning by producing content whether that's uploading nfts whether that's by writing whether that's by posting or just like you know whatever your creative skill is you don't need any token to start off with you can basically just start publishing and then now i kind of view likes in web 2 as like this virtual currency that just lives in a database but the cool thing about fungible tokens and nfts is that you can like treat them as likes you can make them very cheap especially on l2s or side chains and from there you can basically like build like a similar sort of like engagement mechanic of hey i want to like this person's nft but you can use it you can do that in the way of collecting as opposed to just like liking it and just storing a database and then people can basically build their reputation based off of who's collected their nft very cheaply or who collected at a very high price and how much have they posted and published and stuff like that i think there's a lot of creative stuff there in terms of building reputations through on-chain interactions and data yeah this is super helpful and i think each of you addressed really great points around the kind of what we're lacking in the space but it seems like there's obviously a lot of dow tools and dao is really striving for kind of best practices and and and expanding their usage when it comes to tools i think when you're talking about onboarding since each of you work with many early small communities and creators what are your top recommended tool sets right let's just say name top five of them of what do you have your creators and nft creators walk through and use when you actually first have them join your doubt alex i think i have non-consensus take on down onboarding i think people are solving like completely the wrong problem when they're talking about this we're talking about data onboarding i think a large number of the tools are sort of missing the boat here as well uh though you know not all i i don't think like i think there's a world where we have a million people dowse and people are participating they probably look a lot more like a social network and on the opposite side i think we're going to have a large number of dows that have a small number of people but who are using the power of coordination and broader token holder token ownership and and this sort of like composable tax act to have an immense amount of leverage out there and so the challenge with onboarding right now is not about getting joe schmo to join your dow and do a bounty in my opinion it's more about how do we build up like areas of value creation and find the right people to go do that value creation and so they start to look a lot more like the evolution of a startup than they look like the evolution of an app or a membership site or a patreon and so um through that lens like there is no traditional tech stack that we're that we're using with any of our projects specifically um dows are just such a huge variety we have some that are you know we'll probably have a team of three and out do you know millions of dollars worth of dope things out in the world and others have you know thousands of team members and um you know what we like to see the think of these projects as like the center of their own universe and so they're pulling in all sorts of different tools to enable that experience and the reality is like that the simplest tools right now are human beings engaging with human beings as they come through so i think like the the work that the kraus house team is doing and the cabin dow team is doing and um and even the c club team as far as like how you hit their discord how you feel like you're a part of something right away how you're brought in and you know opportunities to engage are created but importantly also teams are able to learn about contributors and ultimately make that match as opportunities arise so not a tool challenge again a human challenge and uh we're not trying to people who are trying to scale things to millions and millions of users in dows right now i think are um yeah maybe a little bit misguided well i would counter that like i'm happy to give some tools um for onboarding people as like our teams is mostly engineers so the first one would be like get a wallet set up as easily as possible and so today there is magic link and web free os x taurus which work pretty well your number which is like the normal web to social onboarding method uh but there's also new competitors coming like slide or um paper xyz to do like easy nft checkout so that's one considerate like getting your wallet set up then like uh i would say uh the whole nose is safe ui space i think multis is pretty interesting you can do management treasury in terms of things and that could be helpful to like have people view what's happening in the treasury um then obviously mirror is awesome to spin up your dow on mainnet a really great tool to crowdfund then something else um i just forgot oh yeah i think backdrop backed by c club is pretty awesome uh backdrop is essentially in the dow discovery space so you can just browse for all the dials and i feel like spinning up is one part but discovering which java you're excited to join is also a great tool so that would be my my tools alex you missed out now it's the one place you can go to see all the proposals and information coming through it's not just discovery it's going to make your governance life so much easier love it love it and patrick last last comments for you yeah i would say yeah probably i guess basic level yeah there's the wallet in order to hold on to the assets such as ether nfts or erc20 tokens instead yeah there's a most likely gnosis safe just so you don't have control just centralized with one person and so you have multiple people that can authorize transactions and then yeah it's basic level you really need other than that is a group chat tool and tell you that that's telegram or discord you can get pretty far just from there it's a lot of those that i've seen start from there and then if you want to do more advanced if you want to open up to more people maybe you use a crowdfunding tool like mirror and then from there you can also you know of course there's also governance proposals on snapshot and then there's like forums for and more like asynchronous communication discord's a good one and then yeah those are the general ones but i would also i could go just this point around the most important thing is i understand what is a mission what is the problem you're solving what is the purpose of this who's the core team what are people responsible for and i'm really trying to focus on that as opposed to getting caught up and using 10 new fancy tools yeah there's so many fancy tools out there and always a shiny thing to look at and try out right i think as dow users we always wanted to see you know find and optimize for the most efficient and best tool that works for our dell um i'm curious maybe just to level set for folks when you're looking at dials that are either wrapped by nfts or tokens or a combination of the two what have you seen worked really well between those two different types of tokens uh fundable and non-fundable and can you give some examples um i would say that the dials that seem to do the best are investment dials because it's a very easy use case very easy to rally around and so nft investment like blizzard was done really well um constitution dow although it failed to reach its goal uh was still extremely impressive to rally around like 42 mil in um in a few weeks or maybe one week that was really impressive so i would say investment dials right now is the easiest and also like the long tail of all the mirror crowd funds that happened um like cabin dow also like basic club started on there like yeah a bunch of others i would say like weird dow crowdfunding ideas usually tend to do well because it's like surprising and so like krajos dow i think it's called for like a basketball team maybe we should raise like billions of dollars because it's very expensive but if they do it's like a very funny goal and like it's easy to run your community around something novel and crazy the crazier the the better crazier the better that's the tip that you have gotcha from alex that's i love that you live your life like that yeah um yeah like i think like the we always say that we're we think tokens give community superpowers and it's our job to help figure out what those superpowers are and how to best apply them and so we don't start off thinking about any specific type of token we're really interested in what the community is trying to achieve in their direction and then um you know can start making recommendations on you know processes methods that would make use of fungible tokens or non-functional tokens um i think what we're seeing right now for this last little while is that you know non-punchable tokens are probably a better tool for early early stage projects and i think we'll see like if you want to see a model that i think will be rolled out across dao's generally it's probably what board ape has just done which is like nft is collectible slash membership thing preferably with some sort of governance built in you know not a centralized organization that's running it but i think um you know dows can take that nft launch membership generate some capital for a treasury um do do more releases of that and or just release a fungible token on top of it so you know we're in the early stages of a game plan like that with um a number of projects you can see some of the early stages with pool suite through their nft drop um you know i think the the kraus house nft sales or and and token vargas crowdfund was sort of like a hybrid of that i think we'll see less and less of those hybrids i think they just complicate things a little bit and i know mirror is sort of moving that direction as well as we're seeing some other partners as well um and and then yeah of course we're seeing like some really great use cases of fungible tokens um that as you know organizations communities grow and more nuanced or detailed ways of rewarding work need to be created that's where fungible tokens really thrive and or through scale of course there's additional burden that kind of comes with market making etc so i think you know we're still in the early earliest days of some of these ex experiments want to see all sorts of ideas and so we're excited about a number of different projects that are leaning into fungible non-fungible uh and you know i'm sure it'll be other variations you know i think what um uh the team over at camp chaos right now um they're building this is the um third camp i guess from our friends over there and they're rolling out this really interesting token model it's actually around splits so like the value that'll come from the music that's um that's produced there so i think we'll see more and more more token types emerge [Music] gotcha so just to summarize it sounds like you're seeing earlier communities do nfts and notably some examples are like ape and and board eight yacht club and then also for a segment of the taos uh makes sense more with a kind of profit sharing type of token want to be want to be careful there we're seeing numbers of different types of tokens that are that are emerging here and nfts or fungible tokens or two of them that we're seeing used well and i think we're also seeing new token types emerge but you need to be careful about the the structure and method of those yeah yeah gotcha thank you for climbing patrick yeah it said yeah mirror the way our crowdfunding tool evolves because basically that is like it's a token distribution tool for a lot of projects and kind of the evolution of our crowdfunding protocols we started off where it was only issuing erc20 tokens mainly because that was like about a year ago this time of year go a little bit further back and yeah we're really inspired more by d5 and d5 didn't really use nfts as a governance mechanism or membership mechanism and so it's all right if i use it work for them should work for creators and communities so basically use that for the first few months and then nft started blowing up okay let's tackle on nfts to this protocol and so not only do you get the fungible token which even to that point i was like last summer people were like okay it's still good for governance or for other method mechanisms as well and we just tacked on nfts as like this visual representation and then from there a few months later we realized that yeah just for optimizing for simplicity it's best well depending on the project but do one optimize for simplicity which i would recommend most projects do it's easier to just have one token type and usually people can really understand an nft more than a fundable token and the medical model is simpler where it's okay one nft maps to one vote as opposed to fundable tokens and where do you buy them and okay wait but it doesn't look like anything or they can't use this in my profile picture and so ended up the evolution of our crowdfunding protocols then we basically designed this version was only nfts and we've prioritized other things in the meantime but that's definitely something that products have asked for and i would recommend for projects that are looking to just get started keep it simple and there's a bunch of like i think the eight example is really interesting where it just brings in a lot of complexity where now there's like two classes of stakeholders there's like the nft holders and there's the people that are farming the token or buying the token on on amms and it just they ends up kind of creating this like group of mixed incentives and so i'm not sure that's necessarily what you would want and i think nouns dial is really interesting in terms of using nfts as a form of governance and membership and having that as a singular token and you know thing with nfts that are so interesting is that you can turn them into fungible tokens you can just you there's different tools where like fractional where you lock up an nft and then you mint fungible tokens based off of them and so you can end up telling the you can turn the nft into fundamental tokens but then turning fundamental tokens into an nft is very more difficult and said that's kind of my approach if you want to optimize for simplicity use nfts and then you can end up evolving into bundled tokens from those same nfts if you really want to like one actually one really interesting example was zora's latest protocol where they basically have like a lot of products like for example unit swap and d5 they said okay token holders can vote on whether to implement a fee switch to go from so that token holders get a uniform treasury gets a percentage of trading fees but they haven't turned it on but that's basically fungible token holders deciding where zoro with their latest protocol basically implemented something where there's one nft that decides the whether there's a fee switch but then the interesting thing is that i believe right now that that better energy is owned by the multi-state controlled by zora but eventually there's different ways of distributing it and basically you can create fungible tokens based off of that so that's pretty interesting model and at least like mentally it's much simpler to understand like whoever controls this one nft controls like these different mechanisms for the protocol so there's just a few examples yeah that's really helpful and i wonder if you know with the world with the ape token and the nft now coexisting and of course i'm sure they'll figure it out but it's do you think that you know zoro might issue a token as well down the road right and then everyone would just have to figure out who are the stakeholders for the nft and who are the stakeholders for the token i don't know whether zoro is going to have a token and i have there's no offer here but i am just curious like why wouldn't you tap into both the markets when you can't yeah i think i think it's about like what are you trying to do like why so many teams will start with nfts is because it's actually really hard to bootstrap a market and you know having your liquidity live on open seas a lot easier than having your liquidity live on uniswap whereas you're an early stage project but you can see like the exceptional value and impact that launching a token could have i mean i don't know what ape is at today but you know there's obviously significant value there and that value a big chunk of that value lives in a treasury that all token holders have you know some say over and uh you know i think the the path from nft to to apecoin is pretty clear they did a great i think a reasonable job in distributing tokens to existing token holders so um you know they have this on-chain graph of ownership and a reward of people based on that so is it can be perfect are there better ways probably but i think this um i find it very unhelpful for people to get locked into ideas of like i need to do an nft or i need to do a fungible token or this is the pathway to go and rather it needs to be like you know tokens give your community some sort of superpowers there are a bunch of superpowers laying down here like which one is most important for you now and and i do think like a general trend people learn as they get deeper into the space is just how much more flexibility there there is if you have that layer zero social consensus in what you're doing right so people believe in your team and what you're doing um you know or in that project they're going to come with you wherever and you know c club has had multiple tokens over the the year and a half we've been around and those are all about you know rolling out better more useful things for a community based on you know the the understanding and opportunities we have today so don't get too locked in on it amazing tool is amazing and you know there are plenty of other cool use cases they don't even have tokens whatsoever so yeah yeah i totally agree and and this is a really worthwhile kind of takeaway for our folks who are listening and who are looking to build dowels or build tools for dallas for sure um um maybe just a quick fire around since we don't have that much more time but we're in this dow cycle if there's one are we in uh maybe alex if you want to go start or or just if you're smiling feel free to drive it um sorry go ahead to me like each cryptocycle is less intense than the previous one so we are in the latter stage of the bull cycle where like right now there's music nfts and other trends that like try to push the open c layer one collectible as far as possible but it seems like we explored the layer one infrastructure space enough and then we're gonna see a wave of infrastartups and a wave of consumer and and other startups in the next year or two that will innovate but right now we are like in the end of the nft boom that started around the time last year that would be my my view for dallas just to clarify well to me and ft's in thousands tokens are like as we talked like with ape and stuff like i agree with patrick that you want a unified value flow you don't want to have two distinct value flow creates misalignment um you want one value for that you may be fractionalizing or maybe splitting to me that's much smarter but like yeah like well yeah the dow i mean everything i said about the nft stage like applies to downs like right now we've done all of what we could with no uses and with mere and like some stripes are trying to incubate uh to be created at c club and now like maybe more infrastructure not necessarily doubtfully i don't think we need more doubt tooling but i would say more like blockchain solutions and and like a lot of other stuff that will then create a new many new use cases but i feel like we are the late stage of like this boot market and that it applies to dows as well my answer is a general shrug don't really care i think like and i say that in the context of like this these last two years year and a half has just been transformative in the web three space we have mainstream ish adoption we have you know it's we're in the new york times c club was in forbes what's up i don't know if that's good or not but like let's go vitalik was on time today like people are paying attention um most people have exposure to the space the honor apps are there like all this there's just this you've been building for the last three four or five years like it's just night and day today and so um yeah i think it it sure are there will there be cycles in the volatile markets yeah of course um but i think right now it's very clear that there's a there are businesses to be built here novel organizations to be built credible innovations that are happening there's an immense amount of money that is recognizing that as well and it's backing it up uh if you're a private founder in the market today building something interesting in the space probably never been a better time to do it um both capital and you know infrastructure and understanding and so um yeah i think it's a little slower right now and those of us that are building are very appreciative of that i think and i don't know when the next bowl or whatever hype comes but my hope is that um you know we get to continue to work with really talented creative individuals who are putting their hearts and souls into building these organizations and that they're going to be you know long-lasting and powerful organizations in the world and that's what we're focused on right now and when i look around this table that's exactly what i see here as well people who are just really thoughtfully building for their community for their use case um and making huge strides at it so that's bullish it was a permabull market if you think of a life like that yeah yeah for sure for sure it sounds pretty positive to me patrick dao super cycle but yeah that's it yeah i definitely look at it less in terms of like cycles even though it's useful just like understand the market and what's going on but more focused on like yeah what are like emerging infrastructure that you can use to build better product experiences better protocols would solve different types of problems or the same problems in new ways and yeah i think that really interesting one on the horizon is we're already here just really early is around scalability solutions either for ethereum or alternative layer ones and thinking through yeah in a world constrained by high gas fees like that that leaves yeah that's just like a certain class of problems that you can solve with the now in a world with much lower transaction fees and what are the problems you can solve what are the product experiences what can go on chain what can you do with that new data that's on chain composability etc and so that's what i'm really excited about in terms of the cycle yeah there's just so much in that space alone in other spaces as well look around like yeah privacy solutions with like zktec etc but yeah i think just thinking through what are the opportunities that scalability will provide and yeah i know that's definitely lower than we will be at some point in the future not too far off awesome awesome and and one last question that i'm particularly curious about and very relevant to the title of this uh this this conversation which is supposed to be focused around on chain collaboration what is one tip from you for any communities out there and builders out there to 10x their on-chain collaboration tip or tool you cannot recommend anything uh long-term or short-term short-term launch a token with ill farming yes i'm probably weighing you right now that's a that's great advice for the short term we've seen like i think one of the most uh powerful tools is just a good tldr and you know having you and your contributors be more active in creating tldrs and sort of taking ownership around communicating and clearly and consistently and and multiple times um i think yeah information asymmetry is the biggest barrier and tldrs may be our only useful solution right now i love that we're gonna use it for for gcr i think that sounds like an amazing tip actually i would say memes definitely i'd say one project that i'm really impressed by is mad realities and they their tldr is the first decentralized dating show and the long-term decentralized media network and so for those i don't know they raised they raised some funds to be able to hire people and now they're streaming this dating show where contestants are voted on by nft holders they're streaming it on youtube and at the same time that they're streaming the show or they're filming the show they have discord channels open voice rooms chat channels it's like it's very interesting everybody grew up like watching american idol and like texting on your flip phone and like and there's not really like a communal social experience whereas this is more like internet native like in real time you're talking to people you're going throughout the season together like a lot of people talk about i wish i could watch reality shows with my friends but this is actually something that is building infrastructure for that and if you just go to their twitter account their memes are hilarious they have a certain brand and it just feels like hey you want you're rooting for them and they just make you laugh a lot you want to be a part of it actually one small thing from mad rallies that i think could be generalized to dial members is highlighting your dow members because in my realities you have to like promote yourself kind of like the mirror crowd fun uh right race sorry the miracle right race i think the the job that mattered just did it like everyone has to post a video online just like highlighted future dao members and that's something good because we never see other dom members but like the the lead or chief person and so i think that's something that that they've done well and can be reproduced in other towers these are awesome tips and i think you definitely need to check out that show um apologize for the dogs but i think we're wrapping up now and really appreciate just alex patrick being on the show with us today and i i'm really sorry this is i'm glad they were embarking during the daytime that's how my life is as well so that makes my heart sing a little bit the couch is back back uh well patrick jess thank you so much for those amazing answers and joyce thank you so much for facilitating uh it was awesome to hear kind of all those perspectives and i think uh the most interesting piece here that that is that everything we talked about is still in the the early phases of sort of how we think this is going to evolve obviously i think the how it actually kind of formalizes and and what it solves on will be much different than we can imagine but what gives me hope is that this is in like the very uh right direction from like we are thinking about the same problems and we're thinking about the same challenge we need to solve it's just a different path that we'll end up kind of converging on but uh it was kind of good to hear that i i hope that all the hackers that are watching this uh sort of get some insights on how do you make that specifically more actionable for dao's where managing communities especially at scale and not only just the numbers-wise but also just different ways people are contributing for different roles and um i think one thing we kind of inherently sort of just ended up talking about without explicitly calling it out is you are describing a new social network at the end of the day these are groups that care about specific problems and have different connections with each other and uh being able to say how do we make this easy for them or how do we give them a different community or a view on how they manage their world or their day-to-day is uh it's gonna be an interesting topic that i don't think has been explored too much so i hope that uh up to 500 people that are hacking and building new social networks for the next two weeks uh we see some innovation or some new creative ways to manage uh communities so thank you so much again and um really appreciate you all taking the time thank you pleasure thank you hi everybody this marks the end of our summit so i want to thank everybody who kind of stuck around and obviously everybody who engaged with us on the chat we'll be getting the po apps delivered to them at the end of this event which will be two weeks from now so stay patient on that but i want to thank all of you again once more and for all the hackers happy hacking we'll see you all on discord this means all the workshops that are still pending for today will end up being on uh with links so that will be on your calendar embedded also on the discord and any questions you have about how to use specific protocols or apis or sdks or anything about this event can be asked on the lf grow channels on discord so with that enjoy some willful beats and i will see you all next week take care everybody you
