behind me [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] together [Music] okay [Music] yeah yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign is that this is a hackathon [Music] it all started right here in the city with deep Waterloo [Applause] from all different backgrounds here I meet people who are storytellers who are artists who are developers in various different ways you get people from all four corners of the earth together kind of working that's that's just brilliant [Music] there's a lot of people who just want to invite more people in hackathons that to me is like the core industry [Music] youth Global Waterloo what'd it do good afternoon everybody my name is kartik one of the co-founders of Youth Global I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the closing Ceremonies for youth Global Waterloo this is our biggest event in Canada and I'm super excited to share this with all of you and we have a jam-packed next hour and a half with for you today 900 attendees are here from all across the world 650 of them are hackers from 29 different countries and almost half of them are first-time developers into web 3. so for everybody who submitted a project please give yourselves a massive Round of Applause [Applause] we have people from so many parts of the world all six continents and almost 200 cities and we're going to talk about all the things that have happened in the last 48 hours now now this is a hackathon which means this last the entire weekend the last 48 hours and all of today is focused on Builders and what we're going to do is we're going to focus on showcasing instead of talking about things so let's get right into it 650 hackers worked super tirelessly and some of them well through the whole time without sleeping and collectively they submitted 168 Projects please give yourselves a massive honor Applause for so many incredible things that have come out of it just this weekend and I want to thank all of our amazing judges who spend all of their morning in early afternoon talking to all of your teams giving them feedback and hearing about what everybody else was excited about so please join me in thanking Frankie Evan Benny zawa Ross Jeffrey Ilya Aiden men Maria Charles Julian John Jeremy Akil nimasca Jerry Brantley payment James and Adrian those were our amazing judges I also want to thank all of the amazing Partners who want to be giving all the prizes right after I stopped talking and uh without and I know all of you are waiting for the prizes there's a lot of amazing teams that have won a lot of cool stuff so please join me in also thanking all of our amazing partners chain World coin air stack apcoin polygon the graph falcoin Uma XTC sismo unlock hyperlane near delvex MTP risk 0 es and Sheet Quant stem compound maker lit quick note metamask highlight and chain save so all of these companies are giving amazing things and will tell you who's won what very soon but let's go back to all of these 168 projects what the next hour is going to be about is telling you what came out of all of this weekend 168 of you some of these projects then you went through judging and through the judging process we selected 11 finalist teams please join me in congratulating all of our finalists for youth Global Water 2023 we have Aqua Net smarter contract fukuru Rola mates maldau AI audit code picks Z Bay token rescue buddy piggy bank 6551 nft and token bomb Titans all of these teams are going to come on and demo what they build to all of you we're going to do some live demos all 11 of them and we're gonna cross our fingers to hope that Murphy's Law doesn't Murphy's Law doesn't kick in and after that we're going to talk about all the prizes but before we bring on our very first team I want to take a quick second to thank all projects listed here that came out of this weekend I'm going to move away so all of you can recognize yourself take a photo remember this moment just because you were not one of these 11 teams does not mean we're not good enough our goal was to highlight some of the themes that all of our judges and we're excited about in this space please do not be discouraged if you were not one of these 11 you have won so many of you here countless other prizes which you're going to be seeing very soon and we really want you to succeed we really want you to come finish your project after this weekend ends and if you need any help if you need us to connect you with anybody whether it's our judges anyone else in this space or any of our partners come ping us send us an email find me after find anybody else on the global team after and tell us what you need and we want to see you succeed and we want to see all of these projects be worked on after today so congratulations give yourself a massive Round of Applause for shipping something in a short amount of time and for everybody watching this you can head over to eat global.com showcase to see every single project this means you can see screenshots source code everybody who did what protocols how they use different things in the background and everything else around what came out of the hackathon on this URL so with that let's bring on our very first demo for today please welcome the very first team Aquanet [Applause] howdy any Cowboy devs out there need a yeehaw informed the Wi-Fi went down uh yeah we're just connecting the ethernet real quick I think we're good okay all right to kick things off my name is hex I'm an engineer and these are my teammates I am octo I'm the UI ux designer unibrows artist visual designer and we built Aquanet Aquanet is an AI driven social media platform where you can create a personality for your nfts and the initial problem we are trying to solve with this is that we have all of these nfts that look like you know like cartoon characters but they don't really have a personality so we thought we would generate some Ai and give them a personality and let them interact with each other so here's the sign up flow you basically just are minting a soul bound token to your nft and we used token bound accounts for this so every nft has a contra address that it can receive erc20s and nfts too and this is basically sending your profile nft to your nfts wallet so right now it's mincing the nft and it's also generating an AI username and bio for your nft and it's also creating its first post so to do that it's looking at your nft's metadata so on this one we have candy mohawk tongue out so this might give us sort of like a wacky type personality for this nft and it'll generate a username similar to this and also a bio so we'll see that in a second it just takes a minute to reach out to open Ai and generate its profile um and it's going to take a minute because it kind of it waits for a few block confirmations before it mints it so the smart contract is gated on ERC 6551 tokenbound accounts so you can't mint this nft to your external wallet it's only to nfts yeah we went for the Windows 95 theme um all these icons are custom so I'm so just not sure um yeah try refreshing so once you've created an account you'll see is that the one you just meant it okay yeah so it created this account just now you can sign into it and this is sort of your social media Network so you can see on this profile it generated skull duck T and it created a bio based on its metadata like I said before and it also has some friends so these are other nfts that also have the account nft um and you can see on the timeline there's already a few AI generated posts from these nfts and like I said they're all based on the personality so you can kind of see how nfts could interact with each other based on what they're posting and if you we also have a token bound wallet that you can see in here you can see your nfts and your erc20s so we have another account that has a few more in there that we can show and these are all the tokens that your nft owns so you can kind of get the idea that your nft really can build a personality off what it owns and also how it interacts with other nfts um anything else you guys want to say cool thank you guys awesome that was our very first demo for today and without further Ado let's welcome our second finalist demo team smarter contracts [Applause] yeah hi everyone we are smarter contracts yeah supposedly I'm human tagi Sean and Mohammed we are Waterloo students so uh yeah let's just uh there so in terms of what we did the smarter contract all of us know that we have a smart contract but they are not absolutely smart right they are sometimes dumb so our goal is like can we have a more smarter contract that could understand better things so let's go and have an example for example some chains are better for computation and some chains are better for storage so the idea is can we divide the contract and call different functions on different chains to be more efficient like you can understand odd on Mars that has limited resources and need to be super efficient in terms of what we build we we design our own Universal deployer as infrastructure use the hyperlane to deploy the different instance of the contract on different chains and then with the gas estimator which is smart actually here we can understand which function should be called onward chain before going to a deep dive and demo on what we build in terms of the economic each day there is 10 million dollars spending on gas so with a simple calculation we understood we can save around 30 percent with the smarter contract powered by hyper chain let's Deep dive to our product item thank you very much so let's just get this thing going because it takes some time I'm just gonna call it so here's the thing we wanted to test uh whether or not we're on the wrong right path so we talked to ourselves what is the simplest form of calculation that we can start addition multiplication and subtraction of course you cannot go more simpler than that my wallet is connected and yeah basically right now I'm on Alpha horse which is the attestant of cello and I would like to multiply nine by five same place four and this is the terminal so we are actually logging everything that we are receiving from the server and I'm going to show you where is it yeah so basically the gas estimator determined that the cheapest chain to do the calculation is Fuji Fuji is the test net of our lunch maybe yeah so everything is being sent to Avalanche of course we are deploying this smart contract on every suborder chain right now the hyper the supporter change that Harper Lane has provided and yeah it's going to take some time and in the meantime we are going to have a technical all right thank you so much for your explanation so here we're gonna go a little under the hood here so we have a user who wants to call a fun Channel with some functional idea and some arguments in order to enable the user to find the cheapest chain we have our SDK to estimate the gas to estimate the cheap health chain and then we'll rely on the hyperlane to Route our function call from the search chain to the destination chain so here we have inside the destination chain executor which basically match a function ID to the actual implementation so here we route a function call from a searching to the destination chain we call that inside the extension chain and then we return to the source chain to have this state here thank you so much let's see the results hopefully it's there uh yeah it's sending the acknowledgment uh we can wait or I can show you the previous runs result so when it's going to finish there is going to be the box here I'm going to show you afterwards we have two links the hyperlink Explorer links and yeah as you can see the first message is sent from my uh main chain Alpha horse to Fuji which sends the function call and needed input data arcs and the second one is from Fuji to Alpha horse which gets back the results and here we have blocked the result which is like 45 da of course uh yeah so yeah this one is finished too basically the same links so the proof of concept is here and what we are going to do for future is to use ds.proxy in order to enable any sort of smart contract to be deployed in this template that we have provided so imagine in near future smart contracts that are deployed on multiple chains and actually they are intelligent enough to know where to do each type of calculation function call or storage so that's actually smarter contracts thank you very much awesome thank you for showing us what multi-stand world could look like our demo number three is team token rescue buddy please give them a big round of applause hi there I'm Xavier with token rescue buddy and I'm Asar I'm Vlad all right and here's the problem so uh with the new blockchain atmosphere a lot of apps are now multi-chain and people are moving to Smart contract wallets uh such as eip4337 the problem is there's a big ux problem uh smart contract wallets go on one chain at a time and they usually have to have a unique address which means that you also make a new wallet for each chain you go on this is different from normal wallets um in the way that uh it doesn't work on HD automatically and it's pretty bad ux in my opinion because what if someone sends you money on one chain but you don't have your wall deployed in the other one uh this actually is a big problem in fact optimism a pretty big Layer Two actually lost 20 million dollars over 20 million dollars to this uh ux Pitfall and a lot of centralized exchanges are unwilling to recover tokens due to the difficulty of uh this big problem so I decided to make this uh there's also a lot of other people posting about this online uh it's a big problem uh it's been in here for a while in fact this was the CEO of gnosis safe uh one of the wallets uh who's trying to discuss how we can solve this problem introducing token rescue buddy it's the safest most intuitive way to recover token set on the wrong chain we support ethereum polygon gnosis arbitrum BNB and much more and this is something the community has wanted for ages so let me show you how it works all right so right now I have a wallet deployed on polygon it's only on polygon in fact I will show you guys that it's only on polygon so right now we're on arbitrum and we're looking at the same wallet address and you can see here it's still an eoa it's just a regular address nothing there yet so let's say my friend one sent me some money right and he sends it over on arbitrine by accident instead of polygon but to the right address but the wrong chain so right here I'm going to send some eth to this address here on the wrong blockchain though all right so as I saw you guys before usually you expect this to be going nowhere and I'd be throwing out money but using the app we have we can actually recover this ethereum that I sent to the wrong address by accident all right and here's where token rescue buddy comes in so all you have to do is paste in the origin chain address that you want to clone oh whoops just like that and then the origin chain which is polygon and then which chain you want another clone your safe to so I'm going to clone my wallet to the arbitrum because that's where the money is and I can't access right now all you do is hit deploy and then just like that so is deploying to save and boom successfully deployed now if we check back over here at the same address as before you should see this change yep see you change from the address the contract and now we actually have a wallet deployed here and we can access money and now uh hopefully this will show up in our wallet here yep and there we go we're setting it up right now and we have access to the funds we previously lost okay one token and perfect in the top corner there you can see all our money is still there even though we sent it on the wrong chain this always a huge problem that uh is still a big problem for a lot of newcomers especially because some people don't know what blockchain they're using right so using this you can get your money back even if you send it on the wrong blockchain thank you guys [Applause] awesome just seeing more functions for create two is just going to change a lot of things I think just seems like everybody took the the talk from italic really seriously on how do we make multi chains a lot more obvious so congratulations next up is team rollermate please welcome them on stage thank you I'm her mom from Uruguay I'm Eric from Mexico I'm Arturo from Mexico and we are royal amate it's a mate you know the mate the drink okay it's a roller match I'm sorry it's a problem it's a prime minister a payment protocol to make it I'm sorry yes later you may need a mempool-based roll ups so send money with gasless to four Cent a transaction cost using mainnet so we know that in the past day we have some some complaints about vitalik saying that he was in Argentina and he has to make a payment on maintenance and he has to use a centralized exchange so this comes with a lot of conflicts and also it's a lot of conflicts about this in the space about the cost of the transactions so for 15 bill you have to expand a five dollar transaction sometimes so okay don't worry here we came to the rescue so what happened until yesterday in Argentina Venezuela Nigeria turkey El Salvador many businesses are accepting crypto so we call them crypto business what they are doing now they say pay me on binance so they were Traditions saying how we do this is five dollar transaction no possible okay but are the rules so what happened now with rolamate they say pay me a minute it's zero extra goods for you and what we say yes sir beer for all the nuns so gasless or force and transactions on mainnet what yes hello mempool mempool is where the where the nodes stores the transactions that are going to be processed and is free to use is validated is a source of truth it's not unique it can change they can disappear transactions whatever but while out there and if you are using correctly it's a source of truth it's like the ram of mainnet transactions the drop is uh it's a lie because in fact there is not a big consensus about what is a drug what not icon came with a transaction form 2017 if it's still compliance it's still gas it denounces valid and whatever should be processed as well and it's easy to Leach and sorry we are going to abuse a little about the protocol so how this work first of all if you want to spend money you always have to set a deposit okay this is everywhere because it's very important so you will pay a transaction to make a deposit in a minute contract that is their role amate a smart a Smart Control mainnet okay this will be rolled by agnosis a smart contract that is used Uma and a graph that we are using to use uh we are we are using to have a very gas short gas transaction we are using a substream not a subgraph so we get the blog we don't need to emit an event when we get a deposit this let's save an extra five percent of gas and then we process this so stream we validate with Uma and then this the balance will be added that you have this money okay then here is there where the machine happens we are going to use not abuse so if you are the user a that you you say okay I have this money you will make a transaction with just 20 000 a gas units to the wallet B okay this transaction if it's a correct sign net and is a correct extractorate and and compliance with with all the the others that are not that much uh things will be valid will we go to the mainnet RPC and will be distributed broadcasted to the Wallman pool so then we can take it using the app the APA now of blog native there is other options that are even better for the protocol for this uh for the roller multi protocol and we get with blognative we validate also with Uma and again we're using the site the site change to have the balances I want to just show something very fast here so I I was sending to italic many many these transfers in the past days so we have a here a transaction that is a captured here by the main pool here I'm reading the main pool so if I at the end I will do a an example if we have time but you can do it we you can just explore the blocks here and you can make this transaction just using metamask okay I don't want to extend the load so to withdraw you have to pay again you can withdraw after one week one month one hour if you're a restaurant that this is the the most uh common use case you will get a lot of payments with zero cost and then you will make the withdraw on the end of the day you will pass the gas what will happen is the roller matter is Mercy romanat will use the bridge and the bridge will go to nurses and we'll say yes or no you can get this money or not it's very easy the roller made a smart contract don't have balances it's a zero Zoom contract so the withdrawal will be the same that the deposits and well up here is the only time when you pay and okay roll Ahmed will offer at least 95 percent save on minute payments and a frictionless business onboarding we are taking this opportunity to onboard a lot of businesses on the space and we are going to make a demo how we are doing this foreign how to use the how to use a chatbot in telegram there is no charge now it's sorry it's a okay now it's working we made some Integrations here in the chatbot is used like you send a message for register these register command sends you an email with a code verification you pass this code and after some seconds you get confirmed actually and that is that there is the quality that we created with lit protocol and now you can start to charge a face or game by in in crypto yeah yes with this with these restaurants we just sending a message to a lot of telegram can start using the protocol without any other step because with this they can receive a transaction for any crypto we3 adopter using metamask okay that's it thank you thank you that would save a lot of gas fees for a lot of people across the world this is a really cool hack leveraging the mempool all right next up is piggy bank 6551 nft please welcome Nicholas on stage everybody is everybody still awake you know my name is Nicholas and today I'm going to show you piggy bank 6551 the goal of this project is to create nfts that act like piggy banks where you can put eth into the nft and you need to burn the nft in order to get that eth back out so here's the collection on openc on Gurley which I encourage you to check out I'll show you a QR code in a second but just to give you a snapshot of how it works here are all the nfts in the collection so far each one visualizes how much eth is inside of the piggy bank currently it also has some structured data in the attributes of the nft that represent the same information and whether or not it has been burned yet and all of these visuals are generated on chain with an on-chain SVG metadata rendering token URI function so I'll explain to you a little bit about how this works and then we can do a demo and see that it really does work so for this hackathon I wrote two contracts the first one is a fork of the 6551 account implementation my version of the implementation essentially breaks the execute call function and the 1271 signing so that you cannot as the owner of the nft transfer anything out of the wallet associated with that nft it also has a special on ERC 721 and 1155 received functions both of which reject all nfts either 721 or 1155 unless they are the nft that owns that account why is this important because if you send the nft that owns an account to its own account you essentially burn that nft according to the 6551 standard because the owner of the nft is the contract itself and no one can exfiltrate anything from it when that happens my implementation of the 6551 account releases the eth to the person the address the burned the nft in the first place The second contract that I wrote is piggy bank nft so the implementation that I just discussed works with all nfts already so if you have a Milady or a terraforms or a loot you can already using this implementation send each to it and use it as a piggy bank requiring that the owner burn it in order to get the eth back out however that's only so interesting what would be even more interesting is to visualize it in the metadata of the nft itself and so I wrote a custom nft contract to do so and that is the piggy bank nft this contract essentially wraps all the functions to deal with the the wallet nicely and also uh visualizes in the token URI so let's take a look at how it works we can go here to the either etherscan page for it and mint one I set the price at 0.01 if and if Gurley cooperates and it's indexer2 this transaction should process pretty quickly because we're sending massive gas just for you okay I think that's a good sign so if we go back here we should see a new nft added to the collection I think it'll be number 12. uh maybe let me just check that I'm right about that oh no number 11. so this is the new one so you can see it has zero ethernet currently so I can go to the nft contract go to this add eth function and I can add one eighth let's say to token number 11. anyone can do that of course but makes most sense if you own it and wait for that transaction to process and we should see it over here decrement how much eth is in my wallet we can also simultaneously go over and look at the account wallet Itself by using this read function on token number 11 and grab the address associated with that nft so we can see it has one eighth in it so if we go over here and refresh the metadata it updates both the number updates and the color of the background changes dynamically according to that you could also send the eth directly to the address of the wallet and let's just grab that here so these five this is just to prove that these functions are really just wrapping the native 6551 functionality so we can send another eth here and that'll process sooner or later uh while we're waiting for the metadata to refresh in the the block to be included we can also check out the token URI function which returns on-chain SVG base64 encoded string here and we can get ready to burn it so let's just refresh the metadata just to make sure that it worked there we go to eth and it's time to get the eve back we want to bust open our piggy bank so we can go to the burn function punch in the token ID of course we're the owner so we're allowed to do this no one else would be able to we can write send the transaction and as soon as it confirms it's burned so we can see that reflected in the image thank you so we can see the title has changed the image has changed and also the structured data the attributes have changed as well so that's the essence of the project from the user's perspective it's really easy to use and I think it's a good starting point for building similar applications with more sophisticated assets so thank you very much feel free to check out the GitHub and follow me on Twitter thank you that was an awesome demo and man you have a lot of Gorly eats that's all I noticed well next up I want to bring on smiled out please give them a big round of applause [Applause] hey everyone uh so during this hackathon we build smile though uh myself Owen Richard Stephen Bill and Marcus and our goal with this uh was to kind of spread positivity test the limits of what we can do right now with the technology maintain privacy for the users of our application and onboard users in a new fun way that's not necessarily financially based and open to everybody and very inclusive so our methodology is first on our front end you'll take a photo of yourself we'll run that photo through our machine learning model to determine whether you're smiling or not we can generate a proof of that process and verify that on chain which during that event will mint you an nft as voting power in the Dow so for machine learning we used efficient net and we asked everybody's friend Patricio for the perfect smile and we were able to kind of run that through there determine yes uh he's smiling and then for the zero knowledge uh aspect of this it's kind of where we ran into that bleeding edge uh part of it so the model it turns out not quite small enough to fit in there um but we were able to kind of take a look at things and see how it would go easycal is an awesome library that allows you to take the model as an onyx file convert it to a solidity verifier and it also has webassembly bindings to generate proofs on the front end so the steps that you would go through is you would generate your proof take your picture generate your proof post that on chain and we would verify that using the solidity verifier so we can go through that demo quickly so we wanted to kind of take uh take inspiration from Marcus Aurelius and take a look at are you happy right now uh and if not why so so I'll say I'm not quite happy right now uh is it because you're are you unhappy because of something outside of your control I'm gonna say no then don't worry about it and we'll we'll take a picture boom uh and then what we can do then is join the smile now and this would after connecting our wallet meant the nft that allows us to join the join the Dow and we're running this on gnosis chain so it's also super cheap it's very easy to send a friend a dollar and they'll have enough enough gas for many transactions once that's minted we can see still pending done we can refresh and we can check that there's a new nft in the collection once you have your NFD you can link to the tally where you can see the distribution of voting create proposals and interact with the Dow very easily and that's our project [Applause] awesome just more and more practical applications that are also fun for student knowledge producing zkml next up team fukuro please give them a big round of applause uh hey everyone um so for our hack we built on top of erc6551 token bound accounts and what we were trying to do is we were trying to build the first marketplace where users could actually freely trade these token bound accounts um so what that allows is users can actually trade um accounts which contain other assets so you can imagine that you can trade a bundle of nfts or you can trade an nft that contains erc20s and additional nfts um so this kind of opens up a whole new world of what people can build and trade on ching um so to build this we actually built out a custom account implementation for erc6551 in order to make sure that when a user lists a token for sale we generate a Merkel Merkel tree of all the assets inside of the accounts and we verify that every time another user tries to buy uh the bundle of assets um yeah so uh and the an additional thing I want to add to that is that in order to actually fetch all of the uh 6551 tokens that the user owns we created a the graph sub graph which actually indexes all the erc6551 tokens and shows us um what the user owns um so we can see this when we go into the cell and I'll pass pass it to Nick to do to show the demo um yeah hi everyone I'm Nicholas I'm going to walk through a demo now so as Banky was saying uh on the sell page here we can see these are the top level nfts these are the nfts that contain the other assets if we click into one of these we can see excuse me for these ones for this nft there's four containing nfts so since this is a Marketplace we're actually going to want to sell one of these so I'm going to put a minimum bid increment and how long I want the auction to stay open for and then once I start this action it's going to list it on our page and I'll just confirm here and then once that transaction gets approved we'll be able to see it on the marketplace and other users can bid on it uh so all of the auction logic is completely on chain and a smart contract um so all the logic for remembering who has the highest bid paying out the winners and refunding The Losers of the auction as all done on chain so let's bid on this second uh fukuro asset here so you can see there's no highest bid there's no bids yet so we're just going to enter a bid and place it then after we approve this and the transaction completes we'll be able to see the wallet address of the highest bidder and also how much they bid so now you can see the wallet address that is mine on the highest bidder and my high speed is 0.2 and for 20 more days anyone else can bid on this bundle and if they have the highest bid at the end of the time period they'll get paid out the assets there we go um yeah yeah so uh this kind of opens up um new ways that people can trade so you can imagine that this application can be used to trade things like trading cards um music albums or even users could curate accounts where they select certain tokens that they think will go up or down in value and other users can kind of bid on them um yeah so that's that's fukuro thank you awesome well congratulations and especially for that clever icon abstraction rapper sweet all right next up is team zebay please welcome them on stage hi where is eBay I'm Byram this is Sergey and we want to democratize online marketplaces so last year 10 billion dollars were paid in merchant fees to eBay that's like 15 of the sales volume I think it's too high I would think it's time to change that so how do we achieve that three steps really first for the merchants that have an established reputation we want to allow them to import their reputation on chain from eBay to together with the data of all the product listings they have the second step is to basically Implement a smart contract that's basically an escrow mechanism to ensure uh trustless exchange of goods and money and the third well sometimes packages are not delivered or are not received so we want to make sure that there's a way to dispute a certain transaction and we'll Leverage The Uma optimistic Oracle for that so Sergey will show you the demo yes what we have here is on the left is the seller and on the right is the buyer they connect it to different wallets it's all on NASA's mainnet and then to start interacting with that we're going to start with the seller and there you see that my reputation score is zero uh what I can do about that first of all I can import my eBay reputation we figured that you can actually change the profile name of your email profile to like match your ens name and then what we're going to do is we're going to scrape that page and extract this information from here and then generate a ZK proof with our own circuits to submit on chain to verify on chain and then it will eventually affect my score as you can see here and then the next variation of reputation Improvement is sysma connect basically for in here we try to provide stable attacks and also front running with signature and we ask to be the Bitcoin passport holder with over like 15 uh this is a point and score then we generate a ZK proof with C Small uh to once again submit that on chain and verify and chain as soon as it clears will be ready to proceed call the first this is the xmtp connection we'll talk about that later as well this is the sisma proof submission it goes there and then my reputation score will be updated and I'll be ready to create my at least my products on eBay so to list my product I can actually import that if I have an existing product on eBay I have handy links there this is a PS5 uh product that is listed there you can also like input data manually that's fine as well but it's cool if we just import that for you we use uh just uh you know old school apis to scrape that page and extract everything you can see it pops up what we're going to do now is um in the back we actually submit all that to ipfs and store it there so we don't clutter the blockchain with you know all this metadata and then we submit the transaction to post this listing of this product on chain uh it should be happening should happen momentarily it happened and then we use uh the graph to actually power this list of published products uh sometimes it takes a minute a second to actually pop up from from the graph well it picks up the log we use our own subgraph uh let's see yeah it pops up here I don't need that oh wow okay no worries so the buyer should be able to see that as well I see the PlayStation and then we see that this is the price that I have to pay and then this is uh some extra deposit with this multiplier so deposit is needed is I pay this price and this price is the money is actually in escrow now so no one has it neither seller no buyer and then buyer will send me the product and I don't have any incentive to actually confirm that I received it I can just you know cheat the system and be the bad guy that's why we require you to submit a deposit as well and then as you confirm that you actually receive the package then we will give you your deposit back and we will do that as well to see how it works and the multiplayer we calculate based on different air stack requests to see how old is your uh like account how many pops you have and stuff like that and after we see that we purchased uh money transfer to Escrow we're waiting for the seller to dispatch uh seller doesn't really know where to send so we can actually chat with the buyer I use an xmtp and uh like ask where sent and then the buyer can also go to the chat and see this message and like you know this fake address I see the address now so what I can do is I can go ahead and dispatch the item what actually happens is I submit the item to let's say FedEx they give me the checking number and then I can also generate the secret so the secret is something that I put with the with the package like draw on the delivery envelope or something like that but when I click dispatch here we're gonna do the hash of those things and commit the hash on chain and then the buyer will need to provide a ZK proof that they know they have the actual secret um and we can do that momentarily as well let's make sure I copy that because I sell this I'll lose the secret no one knows the secret um I update here and I can also dispute if I want if I didn't receive the package for instance we use Uma for that but I can also confirm the delivery it was ABC one two three and this right now we use our own circuit snark.js with the circum to calculate the proof submit the proof on chain so secret is never you know public anywhere or stuff like that it's verified that I do know the secret because the hash is the same the transaction will clear and you could see that balance updated so I get my deposit back in here the uh you know the status delivered to buyer as well but if dispute Could Happen uh then we actually when you dispatch the item we submit that assertion on Uma there to say like specific product with specific this is apfs identifier so you can go ahead and inspect the metadata who was the buyer who was the seller what was the price what the item was so you can cooperate with them to you know resolve the dispute um and that's that's about it uh if you have questions further down then contact us on uh xmtp amazing another interesting application for zero knowledge proofs all right we got three more demos to go so without further Ado let's welcome tokenbound Titans please give them a big round of applause [Applause] all right hello everyone we are representing the Oxford blockchain society and we've built uh token bound Titans this weekend token Mountain Titans is an on-chain battling system where NPCs fight each other online or offline and enabled by recent advancements in token bound accounts for nfts I'll hand you over to Tom for the presentation then Hamza for the demo let's get started thank you very much hello everybody so when we arrived at the hackathon today we all assume that we'd be doing a D5 project that was until we met the 6551 team token bound similar to a lot about the finalists we realize how amazing the backwards compatibility was and our application is to gaming a few games that we'll all recognize from our youth the game mechanics are actually very accessible through the new standard for example AFK Arena this is a game in which NPCs can reward you whilst you're offline they can accrue funds and Assets in your absence that's exactly what 6551 allows in addition Pokemon we all appreciate nfts for collecting although we need more Dynamic nfts nfts that we can have levels attributes that change with our growth in the game finally eight ball pool where based on your ability you will stake a greater amount of money with the goal of beating your opponent to win theirs too this is simply an escrow contract Titans was our starting point for the items that our Titans would hold it was an amazing way VIA Json to generate lots of items of attributes and then apply to the character within the battle the characters themselves our Titans are generatively AI the prompts allow them to level up and see a character difference in image every single time enhancing the Pokemon style where you evolved at set levels it's not quite continuous however it's discrete with very fine increments the other thing that we were interested in is our battling algorithms given two characters how do we choose who is the victor something that we found interesting was proving this off chain to say the computation and even the zero knowledge manner so that users do not know exactly how the battle functions keeping the game mysterious we have some interesting discussions with risk zero surrounding how we can have Randomness in that game and still have zero knowledge proof who will give you a demonstration all right perfect so we're here at the home page and what you can see here is three of our Titans each of each has got this very pretty uh generative uh image each has got attributes each has got levels so far everything you see is just like a normal nft right we all know metadata is is is is a thing attributes Etc the more interesting thing arises when we scroll down and we see that number one each of the nfts has this inventory with these little icons in and number two we have our own inventory as well so it's very simple each of these mini icons you see is its own nft and these Titans are nfts themselves so we have nfts owning nfts like in piggy bank we had nfts owning eth here we have nfts owning other nfts so the idea is this within your own inventory you can equip these nfts and put them into your own personal characters and the point of this is that they change the attributes of your characters right so for example looking on the left obsidian we we might think that for example if we equip like an ax the attack will go up if we if we equip like a whip speed will go up Etc just to prove that there's no front-end magic here we can go to the tokenbound website itself and they basically provide a GUI explaining to you what is inside the wallet of each of these nfts so this is the decision nft this is the chest plate we just saw here so that's the that's the attributes Etc how does the battling actually work Tom briefly mentioned uh how this battling algorithms work the other thing that we have is an escrow contract and we provide the ability to basically stake right I.E provide money directly into your nft so that they can go out and play when you're offline and hopefully win some money for you we can just start a battle here and what we see is two uh two nfts with a left-hand side and it turns out we're playing vitalik unfortunately our nft is significantly more overpowered than vitalik so we've got amazing inventory we've got amazing levels Etc so what's actually happening here is a non-interactive algorithm why did we build it like this precisely because then this game can be played when you're not there right the idea is that you basically send your nfts out and they will act as autonomous agents basically being matched up with other autonomous agents and the algorithm will determine who wins so we can skip just to uh just to speed this up to the final page where we see unsurprisingly one a few things has happened here number one we've leveled up we've gained stats you'll also notice the image itself is new it's Dynamic Etc the other thing you've noticed is that in fact we have won a bit of money again this is no front front end magic we can see here again in the tokenband UI if we move away from Collectibles instead of assets we have 0.1 each this corresponds to basically 0.05 eighth plus the 0.1 from here you've won so to summarize the project basically a lot of these functions are individually you are individually able to do them with normal nfts what makes this EIP so interesting is the ability to compose all of these into one nft the ability to stake the ability to lend on say like a Marketplace the ability to level up Etc that's what this uh ERC 556 is is so useful for thank you thank you another amazing application of 6551 all right two more damage to go so without further Ado let's welcome our second last finalist demo for today copics [Applause] okay hey guys um my name is Benson this is Eden Eric and Jackson and we'll be presenting you our project copics today um so before we start can I see a show of hands from everyone who have heard about our slash place okay not not bad that's a lot of people right so um for those of you that don't know our slash place is a subreddit where it has a big canvas where everyone can sign in and make their individual contributions to the canvas one pixel at a time and the ending results would look something like this and between every time you make a contribution you have to wait roughly five to fifteen minutes uh and the canvas was only active or the subreddit was only active for about three to four days uh it came around in April fools in 2017 and then it made another appearance a few years later but what happened afterwards well it returned to dust there was a destruction a live stream of that and not a lot of memories or sorry not a lot of storage that you can see the final state in unless you relied on internet uh existing videos on other people's servers but we're all here in the blockchain space because we know that's not decentralized so what if you wanted to look back on it what if you wanted a proof that you participated in the experiment well those were the questions that we were trying to solve with kofix so we built copics uh which is our kind of version of a canvas where a user could place a color on a shared canvas and all of that information is stored on chain um we're sorry we're using a custom ERC 721 contract uh the general gist is that a person can choose a pixel a color and then send a paint transaction on chain once the paint transaction goes through a nft is minted to the painter's wallet so the tokens and metadata is fully generated on chain including a list of modifications and everything is available to be queried in the future well that's a true decentralized collaborative canvas but then how did we prevent a same person trying to hog the entire canvas by themselves like what's to prevent someone to log in with multiple different wallets and try to admit every single Pixel on that canvas that's where worldcoin ID comes in we limit the timeout of a person's contributions not on their wallet address because you can create multiple of those but on the worldcoin ID where if you're around this weekend you saw those orbs that verified your iris and generate an iris code and then you had an official proof of human Hood furthermore that allows us to look at the contract and see how many humans actually participated it and not just limit it to an overblown amount of different wallet addresses so the canvas is live all right it's double time so if you have a world coin ID and um you have the polygon testnet Mumbai on in your wallet then you can follow along you can just go to pixelpusher.live okay oh okay so this is like our canvas um so right now I will verify with World coin first I'm just gonna sign in here then after I'm verified with World ID I gotta connect to wallet I'm just going to connect to metamask all right now I can choose any pixel I want say I want this pixel I choose a color make sure you see a color preview here and then I will create paint transaction so now here I am telling the blockchain to Mint this pixel onto the mobile network we can wait for the transaction to complete it's like it's off screen are you guys all minting right now is that why the network is slow and as you can see it just minted um the color of the canvas changed and we can actually see it on openc as well well you can find the collection on openc if you go to openc a testnet style opensc.com collection copics three so that would show a list of all the augmented tokens all the minted pixels and you can see there's a lot of white pixels left so take your spot there's a total of 600 in this canvas and uh take something home from uh today yeah so hopefully you guys can try it out on canvas okay thank you sir I'm really liking the anchen collaboration here so there's a lot of opportunity for the next few hackathons and just what we're seeing in this space with more l2s all right last finalist demo for the day please welcome AI audit good afternoon my name is Derek Vivian I'm BK and today we're going to show you guys what we built but before we do that we're going to talk about why so last year 3.6 billion dollars was stolen from the web 3 economy and over half of those were actually from audited projects and protocols so for this hackathon we thought to ourselves what could we build to help developers build with a Security First mindset our solution was AI audit it's an open source platform for engineers can use natural language to write audit test and deploy smart contracts to any blockchain air audit shifts left the security best practices by enabling security specific testing and rapid prototyping to take place much earlier in the development life cycle so this is actually aimed for engineers who want to build and incorporate security earlier in their life in their development life cycle and this is an example workflow you would upload a smart contract and use natural language to ask Chachi BT to write and execute unit and fuzz tests you can also ask chatgpt to execute static analysis tests and then all of those results are exported to ipfs where you and your team can fix those vulnerabilities and last but not least when you're ready to go you can deploy it on a live test net or mainnet and obviously we're going to show you guys how this is done [Music] so basically right now I'm talking to the chat GPD and I'm basically saying uh run static analysis on on my contract so I'll just get the path of the contract it's basically like kind of an uploading thing I press enter and my bad I wasn't running the chat give me a second awesome so let me just copy this thing again my prompt and as you can see the chargpt is processing the message and it's thinking what it needs to do it finds a mithril tool which is a static analysis tool that that allows us to run static analysis on this particular file it find some results it saves those results in this file and then once it's done we have another tool which is which is basically view test tools to result essentially what it does is it takes this text file and saves it in filecoin uh and then if you copy this ID and basically go here and go go here and then I just replace this and you should see you should see the error that the petrol was seeing and then let's go back here essentially our goal is to basically reduce the friction for folks to come and work with blockchains because what we want is we want to harness power for a of AI and allow them to use multiple tools and to make contacts more secure and like one more thing we can do is like we can say I'm new to blockchain helped me write a simple yeah there's a typo I'm a new I'm new to blockchain and help me write a contract this is something which I have not tried yet so we'll see how that works and then it says okay I can help you and then say okay can you create random ID in a contract let's try that it's basically as you can see it's converging and then it agent is looking what to do next and lobuild there's an error that we need to figure out but essentially like you can continue talking to like that and and figure out and basically I write contracts for this yeah perfect so what we saw was us using cha gbt to run a static analysis test mithril on a local smart contract so how we made a audit was quite simple chatgpt was the base layer the large language model we use and we use Lang chain agents on top so these agents are actually taking natural language and deciding what to do and what we built for the second one was the AI tools so these are the tools that the agents will execute run certain tests deploy certain contracts compile certain contracts as well and the three auditing tools that we support are Slither mithril and echidna in the future we want to build more AI tools and tests a front end as well and eventually be able to support open source models so not just chat GPT and last but not least we want to build for auditors that's really all we had thank you guys [Applause] that was an amazing demo and of course this would not have been a 2023 hackathon without chat CPT and llms talking to blockchains but this was a really good use case all right with that those were our 11 demos I want to give all of our finalists one massive Round of Applause again

live stream you can just refresh later it'll be on your inbox so let's cover a few other things before we wrap things up price delivery this is the most important thing everything that we've said is tentative and not final which means that over the next three weeks we're going to be looking at everybody's source code we're going to be verifying that nobody cheated we're going to be making sure that everybody is part of the same rules and followed everything as per the event rules and as part of that process after we've confirmed everything you'll be getting an email confirming that this is the actual prize which means in worst case you will be notified if you are disqualified and why and will be doing that review if you are one of the pool prize recipients and somebody else gets disqualified that means the amounts will change or somebody may be changed just the numbers will change if it's a full price category specifically but keep that in mind we'll be doing all of that over the next few weeks and everything will be following uh over email to all of you so keep that in mind the date for delivery is July 21st and that gives us enough time to do everything properly and send all the the prizes to you directly and to all the rest of your team now before we close this off I want to make sure we take two minutes to thank everybody that made all this possible and the way is this going to work is that we're going to make sure everybody feels super thanked and welcomed and appreciated for everything that's been put on and all these people behind the scenes all the people in this audience so for everyone here we're going to do a lot a lot of clapping and up just want to be as excited as we can because this is the the behind the backbone of the backbone of how everything works behind the scenes I'm also tired so there's a lot of people that are behind the scenes making all this possible but I want to start off by thanking all of you hackers congratulations for sticking around making this possible coming from all over the world this would not be possible without any of you all of our judges who took the time to thank and talk to everybody here this would absolutely not be possible for us to talk with the winners are all of our mentors and volunteers who are tirelessly walking around making sure everything is there all of our speakers who did all the amazing talks for you to now look at pause watch and learn from across the world and all these amazing Partners who came in from all parts of the world making sure you have the best absolute time and special people like Nabil Shaka Global theater [Applause] ice cream in the Wolford Delaware University for helping us make this event successful in the city of Waterloo and last but not the least a massive Round of Applause for the rest of the global team Shari Andrew Maggie Nunu Boykin Taylor Fred Polly Rory Chloe Kevin hoochie Minnie and uh Boaz Emily Andrew and Jacob they're the people that made all of this possible for all of you and I want to make sure they all feel equally appreciated so the 11 people came up and they demoed what they built and we called them our finalists for those of you actually I'm just impressed that it was just that silence this is great usually I don't see people listening to me up much anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna close this off all right the 11 teams came up and they demoed what they built they demoed things live nothing went wrong which was amazing it just doesn't happen usually and we call them our finalists because if you've never been to any Global Academy Decor before these are not competitions our goal is to highlight important things that we think are going to be driving this rest this ecosystem forward and the things that you're seeing now are things that are going to be normal in a couple years and that is incredible you get your literally time travel into what the future looks like and we got to see all of that from 11 amazing teams they built some cool things a lot of them are continuing to work on these things some of them are even live you can just go on the Showcase and just play with those applications immediately and we call them our finalists because instead of having a first second and third we call all of them our first place winners so effectively all of these 11 teams are first for this whole hackathon and as part of being a finalist in addition to any other prizes they may have won if Global team will be giving in 500 usdc to every team member on top of any of their prizes for coming in first for each Global Waterloo but that's not all in addition to all those things for every 11 of those teams that came on they'll be all getting 10 sepulia eat per member we know this is rare an ens domain for them to have on behalf of Youth Global free pragma entry for the rest of 2023 youth Global events part member and a hundred dollars off a great lattice wallet in case you want to buy another Hardware wallet part member every if you're not already on lens protocol you get to get early access to the lens and reserve your username and a flight reimbursement to any of the next upcoming Eve Global hackathons guaranteed to come across and hack again for the rest of the world also we're going to make a lot of this available for everybody else too in the future so head over to youth global.com perks to sign up for Early Access to all this we want to make it a lot more cooler for you to be in web3 now this is all I really wanted to say and before we close off this event this would be not a neat Global hackathon if we don't tell you what's next so without further Ado these are the upcoming events we're going to be doing for the rest of the year and we really wish to see a lot of you here in three weeks we'll be back in Paris for 8th Global Paris we're super proud to announce super hack which is our going which is our new event that's going to be in tandem with optimism and op stack and super chain to build on top of op stack chains you get to play with what's happening in this world of super chains and that's coming on August 4th to 16th we're going to do our first ever zero noise proof specific hackathon called circuit breaker at the end of August if you're interested in seeing what's happening with DK proofs you get to try out circuit breaker at the end of August it's online then we're going to be doing Global New York in September as our second last in-person event of the year and then we're going to end the year off with Istanbul right at devconnect on November 17 to 19th so you can see all these events now on ethglobal.com you can sign up for any of these right now and we really hope to see a lot of you and all of our finalists in one of these events this year so with that I want to thank everybody for being here let's have some fun and let's go outside good work everybody congratulations [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]
