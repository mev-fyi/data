welcome everybody uh today is uh day two of market made judging and uh we're excited to kick off with uh the remaining teams from uh from this hackathon and the demos that we're all excited to see so um before we kick it off i want to do a quick intro for how uh this event was set up and uh and what we're gonna expect today for our judging this is our first event for 2021 and we have 190 hackers from 50 different countries and spending across 17 different time zones so there's a whole spectrum of skill sets developers and a diverse audience working on interesting problems uh in this space and problems that they are excited about and i will be seeing a subset of them today on this call throughout this whole project the hackathon we have 120 projects uh that came about at the end of three weeks and we get to see about 15 today and uh what i'll do is i'll quickly cover the format of this call we're gonna give every team eight minutes in total no matter which the first four minutes are going to be dedicated for a video demo and uh and the remaining four minutes will be for q a from our judges and then we'll also do a quick uh three or so minute break after every four teams for the judges to talk amongst themselves and discuss any uh questions or comments around their projects and depending on how things are going to go we're going to have a 10-minute break halfway through uh through disadvantages to give everybody a break to stretch so in terms of how judging is designed each team will be rated on these five categories they'll be looked at from how technical original and practical a a project is along with how they thought about the ui and the user experience and developer experience uh for their for their hack and then we also recognize that uh they may not be the perfect and the best way to look at everything so we also have a catch-all that we like to call the wow factor that lets us account for anything that we have missed and uh and before we kind of kick off with our very first demo i wanted to remind everybody that this is not a competition people are hit or weren't uh we're not telling them and they're not aiming to all become businesses so the the intention and the goal for this is to make this a feedback session and give constructive feedback that can help everybody get better in this space and continue building so without further ado uh the the our judges are going to be doing a hard job of giving feedback to all of our teams i want to welcome lightning from cool together danielle who is an independent uh personality in this space in the d final that because uh d5 landscape and then uh peter from 1kx they'll be here with us for the next couple of hours talking to all of the projects and uh sharing their thoughts so uh without further ado let's move on to our very first demo and that is team whiskey coin so i believe they're here and i'll let them kick off with their screen share so welcome great thanks so much good morning afternoon evening everyone my name is jasper and i'm here with my cousin tillman thanks so much for having us and we are here to demo whiskey market maker hi my name is jasper deegans i'm standing here at stone barn brandyworks craft distillery my family started about 10 years ago in portland oregon we created this platform whiskey market maker to give investors and whiskey enthusiasts the chance to connect with craft distilleries and invest in aging barrels at the bottle level the traditional model for investing in whiskey is focused on large opaque whiskey funds rather than craft distilleries at whiskey market maker the barrels are managed by the distilleries who make it and each distillery retains 30 of each barrel sold this increases transparency between the consumer and the producer and increases trust between the digital and the physical is not only a great way to discover new unique tasty whiskies but it's also a great way to benefit from your investment this is the whiskey market maker platform i'm just going to connect my wallet here and this is our home page and it's a general overview of how the platform works so if you're a distillery you can produce a barrel of whiskey listed with us and we will generate and mint erc 1155 tokens that represent each bottle in the barrel then the whiskey enthusiasts come along look at the barrels where we have offered buy individual bottles from that barrel the fees for storing the barrel in a bonded warehouse go into an interest bearing account through ave and those uh that interest is then returned to all the users once they redeem the tokens for bottles at the end of the maturation process and then the tokens are transferred naturally to the user as the new proud owner of different whiskies so here are some examples of barrels we have listed some different types of rye and if we're interested in let's say the dark roast rye barrel number 55 we can see some general information about this whiskey this one looks like it's going to age around four years maturing in 2025 some flavor notes that it's coffee chocolate stouty so it sounds pretty delicious down here is a price projection so right now the price is 44.67 per bottle looks like the fully matured price will be around 63 and that's set by the distillery and we have five dollars in lifetime fees per bottle uh if i want to purchase bottles you can see i already own 40 but there's 190 left so let's say i really like this whiskey i think it's going to be a great whiskey so i want to buy maybe five more i can head over here click purchase it's about 250 dollars and then we convert that to each using chain links price feed both on the front then and also verify that on our smart contract if i just hit submit here it looks like our transaction is going to be about 0.148 i'm just going to confirm and let that go as we wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the cloven test network we're just going to look at our dashboard and this pulls in kind of our current holdings as we saw before we had 40 bottles of rye and once that confirms that should jump up to 45 and then we can look at some basic stats uh in how we've used the platform so it looks like about three thousand dollars are staked in barrels okay the transaction just confirmed if i refresh this page we can now see hopefully this should update uh now we're at thirty two hundred dollars uh we have point one seven eighth that are gaining interest in that ave account and if we hold our bottles until full maturation we should have just over a thousand dollars worth of gains for just holding that whiskey so that's pretty incredible we can also see the actions we can take on each of our barrels and are the the tokens we own what most people are going to want to do is redeem uh and that means transferring the tokens exchanging the tokens for the actual bottles himself and looks like we have to wait another thousand four hundred and fifty five days for the barrel to reach full maturation but once that happens you can either exchange a token to pick it up at the distillery itself or for distilleries based in the us you can ship to select states and that's whiskey market manager in a nutshell amazing uh well congrats on going first and uh it's also amazing to see just a hack that's uh from a real problem and in your day-to-day life too so um i'll let our judge is going to come in with any comments or questions and we'll go from there perfect thanks um yeah awesome guys what was the start peter i just jumped in um did you you're using erc what was the reason behind the token choice the erc i think it was 11 22. uh uh 1155 and that was because we wanted to make it kind of semi fungible so you can transfer in batch so for instance if you wanted to buy 10 bottles you wouldn't have to transfer once for each individual token gotcha yeah okay so if each one was like a 721 nft you'd have to okay yeah yeah exactly we'd have to do that one at a time but this way you could be like say i want to buy 10 bottles and and do that on one go yeah um go ahead peter yeah just to clarify how do you settle the ownership of the bottles like is it physically sense um so yeah the physical ownership and that's that's we have to bridge the digital and physical and right now like there's a lot of different regulations for different areas but we're based in oregon and what you can do is you can uh go to the distillery itself and actually do the exchange there so you would redeem and then you'd pick it up you can also send to select states and uh depending on your distribution network like for instance right now we have for some reason we can also ship to japan we have a distributor in japan so certain areas are available but those uh depend on the distilleries network and so if we expand to more distilleries it would vary each one would have when you buy it would say okay here is here's where we can ship to or here's where you can pick it up from i was curious about the oh sorry peter if you had any other comments uh so i was curious about the price projection i saw there was like this linear uh linear function uh what's the reasoning behind that and how does it work tomorrow do you wanna do you wanna feel this one yeah so the distillery just lists the price that they're gonna sell the final bottle for and then we actually at our distillery we sell unoaked bottles so we had a pretty good idea of what it's like so for example we sell an oaked rye bottle for about 30 and then we sell that final ride bottle for about 55 dollars so we just figured it was a linear function um from when it's put in at the very beginning up until the date it's taken out yeah we considered some other pricing projection functions but we just wanted to emphasize and incentivize people to invest earlier rather than later so if you come in earlier you get the bottle price at less and then it actually matures so the whiskey i mean you can imagine a barrel is an interest bearing account you put something in and it gains value so we just figured we have that appreciate linearly now but maybe we'd experiment with other uh functions appreciation functions in the future interesting and is there also a concept of like supply and demand where or is each bottle like cost costs the same whether you're like the first or the last minute so from the platform we imagine that it uh every price would be the same per bottle but as with everything there is going to be a pretty rampant secondary market we would hope so there you would have uh hopefully some of those sales would be transferred back to the distillery so depending on on how you'd transact uh maybe like five percent of all profits would go back to the distillery but the secondary market would have this second layer of pricing that would be more variable and flexible have you guys seen the z znft the zora nft standard it's kind of cool because basically you can set for the nft every time it sells a certain amount of the selling price goes back to the creator so you can sell it set it like it goes back to distillery it might be cool thing to look at but very cool i really i really really love the idea i i would definitely want to use it i um i would tokenize the barrels if you're gonna do it so early and then i would tokenize the bottles if it's already at production because i don't think yeah but tokenizing the barrel is also really cool but i would definitely buy a tokenized high-end premium whiskey bottle that i could have shipped to me that'd be sweet yeah yeah the one downside of tokenizing the barrel is it would be kind of a bit more expensive and it's it's a bit opaque on how many bottles are actually going to yield from a barrel because you have uh product loss like the angel share is kind of infinite so some of it right right but then you could try to you don't know how much someone's gonna get at the end because you start off with like uh let's say it's a it's a 50 gallon barrel but at the end it actually goes down to maybe 40 gallons right and then you also have to dilute it with water depending on what strength you want so there's a lot of intricacies but that would be a really interesting product too to do it at the barrel level yeah and the bottle level or have two tiers maybe yeah well nice work guys yeah cheers thanks thank you all so much uh we had a lot of fun we learned a lot uh and and had a great time so thank you so much yeah thank you congrats and yeah hopefully this uh this becomes more uh more mainstream so hopefully yeah just give us a ping uh once you once it's ready for others to check it out too cheers cheers thank you very much we are ready to move on to our second demo and that is investing party so uh it's just been promoted and uh whenever you are ready for the kickoff uh are you uh are you there waiting for you to start the screen share hey sorry gabi is going to share his screams okay hey here it is okay we're not getting audio would you mind uh trying to clicking with the sound button oh yeah sorry for the hackathon we decided to work on a tokenized airdrop with vesting platform um inspired by unisoft's big airdrop um we wanted to kind of grip on that idea and make it possible for lots of people to to do that that sort of thing um while also adding investing components so that people that receive these tokens have a longer term kind of alignment with the token promoter or issuer and uh we've got all of these uh vested token airdrops testing parties so let's take a look at the demo here and this is from the perspective of somebody that's going to host a party so they'd go to the host dashboard and let's see other other parties they could browse through um but also see this create a party and it's pretty simple here um we have a spot to put a token address going to take one that i have handy here and we just pause that then we can figure configure the vesting duration um let's say we want the tokens just to pretend as the glyph duration to be wonders this is uh kind of the first day where tokens start unlocking um and we also configure an amount of tokens to kind of unlock up front for for users um so if we actually made this 100 it would be like a traditional airdrop without vesting um and then we upload a json file i'm just going to upload a standard one or an example one that we have here but essentially the file is just going to contain a mapping between addresses and amounts and these are in hacks are going to make this human readable but right now it's an x for convenience um but we have our accounts and our balances and then we start the party okay for this transaction of mine which i'll cut out of video um and um once this uh once this transaction goes through it'll have created a party page um we won't have funded it with anything so let's just deploy a contract um once it's deployed um we'll have to fund it and deposit tokens and we decided to make this a separate step in case um a community that's running as a dao or something like that wants to set up the distribution and then use like a vote or something to send tokens into the contract we wanted to make sure good awesome well thanks so much for that video uh super interesting concept also super timely pack so uh i'll let our adventures uh take away with any comments or yeah questions i absolutely love this uh like it's it's so simple but like you don't understand like so like in when like a project a token network really um raises funds in the space right this is like pretty standard right like all the fundraising terms are often includes like you know a clip and like vesting terms right either unlocking month by month or both like block right there's a few parameters that are that vary from like different financing deals but usually it's all like you know as far as i'm con i understand most teams deploy these vests in contracts pretty manually uh and for the other the counterparty right it's actually like pretty hard to kind of uh you know like actually verify it and also not verify but like uh see like you know the best thing itself right and the different emissions potentially so i i could actually see this being super super useful for like a lot of projects um yeah like so i really think it's like just something that could be really really useful yeah everything yeah peter says sorry all right yeah so i echo what peter says i think investing will become like the the new standard for for these kinds of token drops um i saw like with the graph they did some investing and i think yeah more people definitely do this in the future one question for you are you planning to open source this since i think it'll be really useful to teams yeah wanting to go on top yeah this is already in our community repository and there are some other configurations like a like which are mentioned to best in batch and we only configure it as a default one day but we can also we also have like the option to configure like investing in weeks periods or months period instead yeah and i i'd encourage you to also consider blockly vesting you know like traditionally we have like monthly vesting but in crypto it's like why not right you might as well do it blockly i think it's pretty cool and people are always kind of amazed by by that like wow you can invest per block it's crazy yeah yeah i don't know um what you guys are playing i really like the idea too and i think um i actually like it for post like like for you like after a token's already done an airdrop i think it would be really interesting to do like additional air drops but on a more like targeted basis um and i think like for go to market for you guys if you wanted to the place you should start is comp i don't know if you guys are familiar but compound has had a lot of discussion because they didn't do a retro airdrop and so there's been a lot of discussion in that community about doing one and they've been talking about like how could we do it in a way where the tokens don't just get dumped and so you could go to them and say like hey here's a tool you guys set whatever parameters you want and like let's um yeah yeah so i really like that idea um yeah that might be a good go to market for you guys what are you guys what are you guys planning to keep working on this or what's your plans yeah we were planning to keep working and we were a bit uh time restricted with the front end and we were able to finish the whole thing but the plan is to also like you say allow for several best in parties to be done in a project with with a different configuration if you want and yeah even allow a strategy kind of strategies to help people to get the json file with all the claims that they need to to submit for example even generate one from twitter or generate one from discord or whatever to make them really easy to to get their user base yeah yeah yeah i think i think broadly speaking every project's trying to figure out how do you get ownership into the right people's hands and i think this is a really good start towards solving that problem and there's probably a lot of interesting design space on top of this too yeah and one last thing that i'm not sure is it mentioned is that this western token are also enacted the so you can transfer them as a the whole best block i mean the whole best i might even try to use it myself my own uh tokens and like you know just like you know invest it myself as it's like it's also a fun tool in that sense too amazing well uh congrats on i'm demoing this and i think uh it seems to be a consensus that this is extremely useful and hopefully this gets in the hands of a lot more existing and new projects so yes thanks guys thank you very much it was really awesome to participate on this that's hey thanks we're ready to move on to our third demo and that is ofss.geep so uh let's see jordy you're here whenever you're ready feel free to pick up your video hi this is jp oled i'm the solo maker of the offset project the main goal of offset is to make the blockchain more sustainable by upsetting the user's co2 emissions with offset the user can calculate in an easy and quick way the ethereum transaction emissions and upset it because let's be clear we all love blockchain but we should take care of our planet too in instance a single transaction costs 26 kilowatt hour and only 5 percent of ethereum energy come from a renewable energy source in brief users can calculate his emissions purchase carbon credits an error of token in reward of tokens is represents a subtraction equivalent to one ton of co2 this project is in beta and only deployed in the kovan test network let's see how it works behind the sense users can interact with offset smart contracts with two different ways by purchasing of token directly and for each token one ton of co2 will be offsetted or by depositing the array in the offset pool this pool works with david to generate interest and once a month all interest is spent purchasing carbon credits and distributes the equivalent to all pool participants now let's see in action first we connect with metamask okay and now we can see some stats like our balance or address the numbers transaction and uh and your impact the number of kilowatt hour or or number of co2 spent in ethereum uh transactions users can also uh at different pack like validator if you are a ethereum validator or even uh offset the warrior of missions then they can offset all this emission by purchasing of tokens let's see here we have all the information and this number the the price is calculated by a chain link oracle that give you the ethereum price if the user has a node and i there's a ethereum enter and there's a message and we can purchase the this amount okay we are go one test network or uh they can deposit their value in the co2 dipole remember that the interest will be used to purchase carbon credit and obtain off tokens okay in the future the plan is to delegate the policing of real carbon tokens to a tao where off holders could vote and select which project purchase the carbon credit or help other projects to fight the climate emergency hope it like it and thanks for everything awesome that's really cool i um i really think you did a really really good job of like packaging it and quantifying it and creating like the different tiers the only thing i was a little confused about is like i understand the diet you deposit the diet of the interest i understand that but but the top thing where you're buying if i'm buying an offset credit it's a token but that token should be burned or something right because like i guess like once i buy that offset credit what's happening yeah and the project is not finished i have a lot of work to do and yeah i'm learning but the main goal is to then purchase the carbon credits and store the invoice in an interpretation file system or similar to link with a token and maybe uh i have to figure out but maybe the token is not transferable because i don't want to make like a speculative in here because i want everybody purchasing as many tokens as they can and maybe uh then burn this token to prove that this this token is not used more times yeah okay yeah gotcha yeah i mean that makes more sense i understand this more still more to do but you did a really good job on the whole on the front end of it and the packaging of it all and and helping quantify it thank you plus one the product design was uh is really great um and i guess you know i'm curious like you know how how are you inspired to you know build this well um like one or two years ago i created like a co-founded a climate change group of developers to fight or to finance projects that fight a climate emergency now it's like a discord with 1 000 people uh designers developers and all kind of technology stuff and i want to because my girlfriends tell me well this blockchain is very good there's a lot of energy involved involved and i don't like it and i think about how to offset this energy and in the future maybe like other protocols or the projects could offset the world emission and we will create a leaderboard to show which projects are more sustainable and i don't know this is my future of all but we should do something for the planet too because yeah there's a lot of energy and well for sure and the ethereum two layer will improve this but um for money for now i really like the name offs offs.eth offseath um i do have a question as well um how do you uh like peg one off set token to one ton of co2 credit uh now uh the the price is like uh 15 for one ton of co2 but a smart contract there's the function to to change this number the price gotcha and it's just an oracle for that um another question so co2 is like one way to combat climate change what about like have you thought about other kinds of uh ways of quantifying maybe like uh surface area of the ocean clean or something yeah the main we delegate the the boating power to to the dao that there's a selection of different projects like ocean or forest forest saving or or animals or something like this that then the of token holders could decide which project will form cool awesome well already thank you so much for this thing and it's so great to hear that the thousand people who are developers tackling climate change so hopefully there's a lot more ways for this to be useful for people that's incredible thank you continue working on this great so we are ready to move on to our next team and that is project better so uh see chris and and the rest of the team is has been promoted so whenever you're ready pretty good projects in the ethereum ecosystem lack a standardized way to collect user feedback often users choose the shortest path requesting features on social media which results in unnecessary admin overhead once we have collected user feedback we want to automatically signal the need for development and donation resources and again current tools don't integrate well into existing developer flows this becomes obvious with issues that are well known and needed by a lot of users like this example of extending metamask hardware wallet feature like community members with wide enough reach can actually coordinate this on twitter imagine if anybody could do this anytime anywhere and ideas come up almost daily on crypto social media from impactful experiments like building a decentralized twitter to crowdsourcing community in education and memes like paying for twitter hashtag emoji to simplify realizing all these ideas we build better an easy to fork platform allowing anybody to express ideas fund and finally build them let's take a look first a debt project forks our repo to set up a better dodge sub page for example better.av.com which mirrors all issues from the project repo and allows users to submit and vote on issues then anyone can select for example a feature request or translation request or security audit and fund it with eth or rv tokens to collect interest on the pool and finally after implementing the feature the developers who solve the issue will be paid out from the contract while any update on the crude funds will be reflected on the project's upside and in the github issues powered by our subgraph so summing up better allows dabs to collect user feedback and prioritize their roadmap to receive funding and to discover new talented contributors and all they have to do is fork our repo to be fair this is still a prototype so we do plan to build this into working product as we see the need for this in ethereum ecosystem amazing well thanks so much for that demo and uh seems like it's a super useful utility for everybody too to get collective feedback so i'll let our judges take off with any uh kick it off with any questions yes please i think it's pretty cool that uh uh you're kind of bringing the uh incentivization to the platform that people are already building on so like rather than building like a complete mirror that needs to get repopulated with all the issues i think it's really cool that you're just like forking the the repo um one question can you like elaborate on how the payout happens yes so basically we're using the baunis network contracts so it would work the same way so you you can press a button on the website the website is generated from the issues right and um pressing that button pays out whatever tokens are in there for example avi tokens is using bounties network i'm not familiar with that i have understand work i think that uh the contracts that are used by bitcoin so would it just be whoever creates the bounty is is the person who decides if that bound has been completed um right now it works that way because it was easy to implement that way but in the end i think you always need like sort of a judge so we're thinking that the admin reports because it's sort of this this ecosystem anyway of that project whoever fox our ripper right so probably the admin of that project would be like the judge and always when there's something happening that either the funder or the developer is unhappy then that guy would decide so we just in the contract he has like an issuer so that would be the admin who could change everything and eventually the idea is that we could even make the owner like a dao or the collective community that's around a certain project would be able to vote um like what are the criteria for paying things out because you could even create issues that aren't necessarily like one-to-one tasks or bounties right hey guys i want to fund a marketing campaign for ave v3 uh everybody's going to contribute like i don't know 500 died to it and then as people create uh assets for this marketing campaign and as different parts of the marketing campaign are rolled out you can choose to pay out different parts of this holistic uh bounty to different parties maybe like the red guild comes and says hey we're gonna do this kind of launch like a video and a twitter campaign and somebody else says i'm gonna design your graphics so you could have different parties being paid from the same pool um yeah something else sorry yeah and something else that we'd love to do um in the next version but we don't have it currently is find a way of pooling all of the different assets that have been contributed for a subproject and then gaining interest on that pool and then that interest can either be reinvested back into the project um so for like a treasury for future issues for example or perhaps some of it can go back in the form of a tip to the developers if they did a really good job and things like that yeah i really like it it's it's definitely cool um and yeah like you said there's definitely an emergent need for it with like what you're seeing on twitter would people be able to like contribute to bounties and vote for bounties without having to create an account of any sort yeah yes uh the idea is that we want to be able to do it either directly uh like via a wallet uh anonymously and then a bot would post on your behalf on github yeah and we're also looking into decentralized ids uh we're thinking of moving like the social aspect of everything onto ceramic um and leveraging three bucks or whatever becomes a three bucks to allow logging in from a variety of different platforms or doing it today awesome i would check out pinball um the interesting model was basically you buy penn valley tokens and that's your way of buying into the grand ecosystem and people receive tokens and they can cash it out i wonder if that that model can actually be used to govern this micro ecosystem of like bounties right and like you know you you talk about this one and then uh for these bounties what if they're basically driven by how like you know token vote of this like micro pandola system right just food report yeah absolutely um that's something we're thinking about and it on the one side you could even have a project using its own government governance token um to do this and also perhaps rewarding uh either funders or people who are executing against bounties with some of that governance token but you can have a meta token like you're saying like panvala or if we eventually create our own token that would have a worth across projects as opposed to just within a specific subproject awesome oh well this is great and uh good to see uh some uh some of you join us again for this event and uh thanks again for uh for presenting and hopefully uh you get to continue working on this nice thanks for the feedback so uh we're gonna take a quick four minute break for uh for our judges and then we're gonna resume with uh the continued stream offering project so what i'll ask is i'm not just turning their videos off and and themselves and joining us on the other chat from everybody right all three of us are here we'll resume with the next demo so uh we'll just quickly get the next team promoted and uh for uh for this team i am going to be playing their video and as soon as they join us on on the webinar i'll kick off with their video and they can be there to answer the questions all right so looks like everybody's here and i will kick off with your video hey we are team porgy and this is what we built for market make our team members are cleep anatoly kirill jeffen and me viet so we built a marketplace where investors as all information startups too save time on researching gain voting power when investing and secure investments alice starts the fundraising process for her new venture celica the startup is stating that the duration of development is one year and divided into three batches of four months each if the investor gives one eath celica will send back one sale token so the investor has the right to vote now the celica startup is in the porgy marketplace and bob sees it and decides to invest later on felix and jenny have also joined the party poggy locks 300 eth and deposits it to have so the startup will gain additional profits in the future let's dive deeper first a hundred eighth unlocked for celica's first batch and the results have been good so everyone voted yes to continue the second batch and another hundred eighth plus ave interest unlocked for silica however the end outcome of the second batch have been mixed so bob and jenny voted no and the project is over the remainder 100 is plus ave interest rate from depositing are exchanged back to investors let's take a closer look at our app it is very simple to start a fundraising campaign with 4g all you need is to set someone change parameters such as project duration and money unlock rules then simply start the pre-sale that's all funds are already being raised are you an investor searching for a valuable project then you're really lucky to bump into the podgy becoming an impactful shareholder have never been that easy just search through the projects outwear waiting for a wise investor chose those that really looks promising and invest now you can be sure that not a single way will be spawned without your permission when the pre-sale is finished and the main cap is reached the first serious amount is sent to the startup team and the rest is deposited to ave now it looks like the series has finished but it also seems like the project hasn't been doing anything for all the time so vote no for the series and contribute to project cancellation after the project is cancelled simply withdraw the rest of your precious funds and receive additional compensation due to a harvard deficit under the hood minime is used for voting mechanism ave for depositing if our funding mechanism is designed from scratch one inch exchange contract is being utilized for trading startups tokens and the graph schema for on-chain indexation so for future work we plan to add support for ethereum based tokens rework ux ui to a more user-friendly state add more flexibility to the investment model finish graph integration to ui and off chain data to ipfs amazing so uh that was a super cool demo and i i like that uh and noticing yeah awesome um that's really cool so it's one question to clarify is it is the actual money is some of the money that i'm sending going to the project or is it just the interest earned on the money that i'm sending if that makes sense yeah thank you for the question um as we stated uh you're sending the money and we are only releasing the chunk of your money to to the series like the series one is unlocked and you get gotcha yep so this is how we we thought about the idea okay okay that makes sense yeah i was just trying to clarify that all right um yeah okay i'm curious uh how do you handle dispute resolution right let's say you know a milestone uh or like you know some sort of like series is like uh you know it's like let's see your product's not like delivering right how do how do you you know like identify you know withdrawals that are fail on fast yeah i hope you can go ahead uh so i can try to explain the question uh when it's like global voting and when most of the investors vote for no the project is cancelled and it's we currently don't have any any recovery mechanism to kind of dispute this uh cancellation so currently if the project is cancelled it's canceled forever but later on they're going to be disputed if it is yeah right i could i could see some like conflicts of interest mostly because it could it could i guess it's like i guess it's all about the social contract between the supporters and the creators yeah and one one other opportunity to really explore is like maybe some sort of written contract and then you know arbitration through a protocol like you know um claros right where it's like basically it's like a paid you know kangaroo court in like internet judge court right well random jurors collected then that you know really like the drop down to little adjudicate on you know soft human like uh governance issues right uh arrogant coral provides us um yeah yes there's a lot of space for dial things and we actually implemented kind of a dial here where everyone votes for project and investor kind of do control uh put some level of control regarding the project they we actually plan to add more things like investing uh propose new things and uh kind of propose new votes for additional features for the projects to implement kind of this stuff like there is a lot of labor place to improve for improvements here but like we just for three weeks we decided to build like just this uh like straightforward model so in the model that you have you raise like a certain amount and then each series will disperse like some some percentage of it is that correct like it and what i'm getting at is like is it possible to do a future raise with this platform like do a second ico sort of like a second offering yes we have a concept of sizzle and seriousness so uh when the project is created you first create a season and you can do any amount of series there and on every series like some portion of our total funds are unlocked to the project and any at any point you can just simply uh create an another season and to raise additional capitalization for your project using uh prices from one inch we actually implemented so we can check this out on our github very cool nice um and i have another quick question um so like icos seem to have like quieted down quite a bit um do you foresee this being like uh maybe causing like a resurgence in icos or like have you been seeing lots of icos lately um at least like in my in my little bubble i haven't really seen or heard of any icos these days it's just like air drops mainly uh not really like we think that defy is still like the future and it's a place for any kind of investments to go on but icos has like bad uh reputation and uh like they started amount of them started to decrease uh later or like in recent time so we we think that this model just needs to be rethinked and introduce a new way to actually get money from uh from a lot of investors on on defined space awesome well thank you awesome representing and uh we uh people start using this model and uh actually introduce uh delivering projects before getting money yeah congrats guys yes thank you for your time guys cheers yeah thank you with that we are ready to move on to our next team and that is team uh project b cred so i say the j is already here so whenever you're ready i'm going to present about weak red project submission for the hackathon the goal is to implement transient short selling problem we are trying to solve what is short selling short selling is essentially trying to sell an asset expecting that the price should decrease and then to buy back the asset at a lower price point the benefits of short selling is that there are potentially bad projects where the price is expected to go down it's also currently missing indeed except for very few projects like open on the other side of the picture it could lead to infinite losses if you're not careful so maybe a short term short selling or a transient short selling where we take advantage of very high token volatility which is currently present in the d5 marketplace so how to shorten a certain d5 now that's where the power of credit delegation by rwa comes into the picture so if you look at this flow in this picture so first some depositors someone deposits a certain amount of tokens into the margin contract so the margin contract will be like a pool of tokens let's say wrapped it for example the trader on the left tries to initiate a short sale so he thinks for example that rapd the price will go down the short seller contract then borrows the wrapped eath tokens on behalf of the margin contract and it immediately sells the token or short set in one inch for example and in this case the one inch api was used and a main network was done the token once it is sold is converted to a stable coin so for example the wrap teeth could be converted to usdc and then as the dotted line shows the usdc that is the stablecoin can be used to buy back the token or the asset which was shorted which was rapdeeth and this asset is then paid back that is a delegated credit is paid back to the margin contract and the position is closed the first step is to deposit the money into the margin contract and for this we can use the deposit collateral method in the credit delegation the rv credit delegation and so essentially we are now depositing 10 wrapped ether from that contract into this after that amount has been deposited then we can approve the borrower this will be the borrower contract so the borrower will be in this case a short seller and the short seller is now allowed to given or is given a line of credit of about 10 wrapped ether seller then withdraws the tokens this about a three wrapped ether and build the call data using the three wrap teeth which you've got and also the token addresses once you've got the call data then to call the actual short sale that is to perform the short sale of the three heath using the call data and the information and this transaction is success back into the wallet and as you can see three wrapped it was converted to about 4992.615 usd and then essentially we just wait for the price to go down so the price which is at this point and just gone down to something like this which is about a three percent drop and essentially we just wait for this three percent drop or a few four percent drop and then sell the usdc that is swap the usdc using the one-inch protocol and uh get the money back has wrapped it i gave like a more developer oriented presentation i hope it does okay yeah super super useful um uh how are you thinking about like how i guess you know how how do you think of like automating all these contract calls uh from your end yeah exactly so it's more uh like uh i was i was using node.js but then i wanted to now use python script so that's the thing i was working on the only problem is you know there is slippage and due to the slippage and also due to the non-deterministic nature you know because when you go to the one inch and then when you're doing it it's non-deterministic and that's where it breaks a bit so that's uh one opportunity for improvement from my set so i'm still working on that part but the whole motivation behind it was the game stop that's why so initially having a different idea to work on this project but just doing the hackathon game shop exploded so that's why i wanted to do this short selling one idea uh so i think you should try check out gelato network what they're trying to do is basically automate d5 contract calls right so it's like you can basically set like uh contract calls uh based on like if this and that logic right and then if they have they're trying to incentivize this network of bots so that might be useful got it i don't need to reinvent the wheel yeah i would do that yeah this is our awesome project um so so i'm not very familiar with short selling i don't i don't really do it at all i mean i know what it is conceptually but compared to the other tools that exist like like opium or sorry opium like open um uh or whatever like why is this better i guess yeah exactly i wanted to say that so as soon as this gamestop thing happened right i went to if i thought like you know dogecoin for example i wanted to start it at that time because i thought yeah there must be some points which are overvalued and it was not easy so just purely from a developer or a user perspective i struggled to shorten because it was more like a connection uh not like a actual short sell yeah so there's no permissionless short selling i got it that makes a lot of sense and i i wanted that too actually there's there's been times when there's been tokens i'm like oh i really want to short this token but it's like no way to do it so it's permission that's short selling i like it that's very really cool so you're using uh ave's credit delegation right so how does the liquidation work so the basically the short sale right you have to close the contract so let's say the price goes down of rap lead for example by three percent or four percent then you buy the basically the usdc to wrap deep and then close right more so like what happens if the price goes up though like it goes up too much and then yeah exactly that's why it's a transient short selling you have to keep it only for one or two hours and if the price goes up too much then from a margin contract you have to close the position just similar to the c5 centralized finance world so like the delegator would uh have to like the user would have to give ad funds to the uh delegator's account and the delegator would potentially have the risk of getting margin called or like getting liquidated yeah that's why it's a line of credit yes it's a line of credit same like yeah i think it's pretty cool um like yeah obviously you can short sell just like manually clicking but this is nice because it like packages all up together and i think it'd be cool if you had like some quirky uh website that's just like kind of put your money where your mouth is dot com or something and uh just incredible really a lot of these like uh dex is like you know go on l2 and just like you can go out right okay great work it's cool congrats on on this vijay and uh hopefully uh you yeah um perfect so we are ready to move on to our next demo thanks guys and uh and that's the tokenized answer donation so looks like the team's here so whenever you're ready prefer to kick off with your video this is tokenized asset donation tad a charitable giving application integrating ave tid enables users to take full advantage of the ra lending pool while providing motivation to donate a share of their accrued interest to a charitable cause of their choice our motivation for this project was to build a new system for charitable donation something that is simply not possible in the current financial ecosystem my interest is not earned continuously while also to encourage savers to get more involved with socially beneficial projects so how does the dap work users interact with the tad smart contract by depositing eth and specifying a percentage of their interest earnings they would like to see donated the smart contract sends this to the rba lending pool and holds the corresponding a token for the user interest is sent recurrently to the give eth io a free and open source platform allowing its users to start and donate to charitable blockchain projects the tad smart contract works by tracking user balances and giving rates with crud-like operations every time a deposit withdrawal or give function is called individual balances are calculated using the overall growth in the contracts a token holdings since one of these operations was last called i will now give a quick demo of the data when users load the dap they are prompted to sign in with their metamask accounts something i've already done in the bottom left they will see information on how to get started with the application but assuming we know this we will navigate to the landing page here the user can specify an asset to deposit to the tad smart contract an amount and a percentage of their interest they would like to see donated to a charitable course we will select ether 0.01 and we will donate 50 of our interest we can confirm this with metamask and we're done once we've deposited we can navigate to the dashboard here the user can keep track of their deposits and account information unfortunately we didn't have time to connect up all the variables here but that is something we'll look to add in the future as well as a list of transactions so how would we improve our dap and what work do we still have left to do currently giving events are triggered manually this is something we would want to do continuously and as often as possible to avoid to avoid high gas fees we would specify a threshold ratio of the total transaction value to total fees paid to ensure that most of what users donate make it to their course currently you can only give to give eth io we would like to expand the project to deploy further smart contracts for other projects and even add a feature where users can choose their own projects to donate to as indicated by our name tokenized asset donation we would like to expand the donatable list of assets while also tokenizing real world assets such as for example gold that can also be used to accrue interest and donate finally given high gas fees we believe using something like the matic network to enable more continuous giving with lower fees would also be incredibly useful very cool uh like i think yeah i think it's a it's definitely a very important like kind of uh idea in terms of like lossless like you know giving i think like what really cool is like figuring out you know how you can kind of take this what you've built and like maybe pair of like existing you know social distribution network where there's like a lot of activity happening right i've seen like a lot of projects in space try to like you know build not only the tech and product but also try to build the community and audience i think you know like you said you know giveth might be like a good place to kind of start and integrate with just food before oh thanks yeah no this is really cool i i i've always really loved this idea of like lossless donations and it's like sort of been done but like it just hasn't for some reason it hasn't really picked up or like fully worked and so i think it still is a problem worth solving for sure um what uh yeah i guess so so this would be just just to be clear on the flow this isn't this is not like redirecting interest from my existing uh deposits this would be like this would require me to deposit into like obvi for the first time is that right or is there a way to build this where you could like say if i already have a deposit sitting in an ave i could like start redirecting my interest i'm not sure if that's technically possible uh yeah currently it's it's separate um you'd have to deposit into into our application rather than using your digestive gotcha okay that makes sense but i mean i guess with trans if you batch those transactions it could be reasonable yeah yeah yeah just the thought um it made me think about uh like tax efficiency so like a lot of rich people like to donate because it they can like offset their taxes and whatnot um have you thought at all about like tax efficiency or like designing the protocol in such a way that allows people to like maybe trigger taxes when they want to or trigger donation credits whatever when they want to no we didn't we didn't actually think about that angle it was more about trying to get kind of um just improve kind of like the contribution to socially beneficial projects from the public so at the moment um if you give to like a charity um charities often kind of ask for kind of bigger kind of lump sum donations and you know which kind of put people puts people off um so just having something that is kind of continuous and uh you know smaller and more manageable for the average person um it's kind of what we're aiming at very cool okay well there are no more questions i'll thank harry and uh and uh max milan and carl for uh demoing this and uh hopefully there's a has a lot more that you can do in this space so yeah yeah thank you guys this is awesome thanks guys um so next up we have uh sublime finance and team is here and i'll be playing their video on my end so i'll kick off the video in one second welcome to sublimate a d5 platform that lets artists open source devs and content creators accept continuous financial support from anyone in the form of streamable tokens for this demo we've set up a mock dataset on the kovan testnet featuring our favorite creators in the crypto space let's jump right in first i'll connect my wallet which already has some streamable easy to give away the defiant has been putting out some awesome video content lately so let's show them some support i'll choose to send them .005 east every day over the next five days supplement will use the average block time of the past 30 days to determine the corresponding stream rate and tokens per block let's approve this and now we are subscribed now whenever a block is added to the ethereum blockchain the streamable east balance will decrease while the creator is earning the increase we've created our own subgraph on the graph to provide analytics for creators in real time so we can see the tokens that they're earning across all their subscribers and in the spirit of paying it forward we can also see who this creator is supporting as well let's find one more creator to support stani here is doing a fantastic job maintaining the ave protocol so let's stream him some tokens note that his wallet address is connected to an ens name so it shows up in the url let's say i want to stream from a total of 100 die over the next month in this case though since i don't already have streamable die i'll have to send 100 regular die to mint it first and from there i'll be able to start my subscription great now you might ask how can i make a creator page for myself just head to the dashboard fill out your profile then sign a message with the address you want to receive your funds now i can share my profile link so my fans and followers can support me anytime they want thank you daryl for the great demo sublimate works with a custom version of the rc20 contract that enables token holders to directly subscribe to another address a wrapping contract lets you convert your native assets to their streamable counterpart we were really lucky to have some great sponsors and partners so we did our best to think of unique ways to integrate as many as we could we have chain link as a price oracle with the graph to compute the value of subscriptions in usd and estimate their duration depending on the block length matic to reduce gas fees for our users and provide a frictionless experience then ave users can manage their capital more efficiently creators can generate interest on their subscriptions and supporters can subscribe with only their yield thanks to the new ava v2 we've also designed a widget that enables integration easily on any web page for newsletters portfolios or communities the website also comes with a fully fledged dashboard that lets you customize your profile page and get insight on your community activity and metrics we have so many ideas that we want to implement and problems that we want to tackle with sublimate we're preparing the second version of supplement set for july 2021 with new functionality and integrations this remote hackathon was a unique experience for all of us our team is global and is comprised of myself and black who worked mainly on the back end and contracts implementation i mean as our designer and product manager and daryl who did amazing work on the front end and ui we would like to thank you so much for listening to this presentation and hope that you will enjoy sublimate as much as we enjoyed building it we're very much looking forward to onboard as many users in the device space as possible and together help make every second count thank you awesome guys um did you guys use uh use sabler for the streaming are you using those contracts like a fork of those or did you just build something of your own right so that was a question that uh we we thought about in the very beginning uh so we know that severely a uh enables the creation of stream uh of streets and then you know you can create a stream it's kind of an escrow contract and then and then the receiver has to withdraw from the contract so right now we've kind of implemented a new erc a new token standard that enables streamings directly on the contract it's got it they're not calling anything yes there is always nice for for subscribe to someone and then this someone can directly use this money without having to call with or anything got it yeah yeah i i that's that's nice that's a nice enhancement i like that um yeah it's really cool i like i mean the ui obviously is really really good and that that's probably one of the strongest things and i think um i i guess my only like feedback comment would sort of be i'm not sure like i think it's a really cool idea and i think that the website's really good i'm not sure if like the streaming part of it is essential like i think it could be just as cool as if it was just sort of like give one-time grants to people um so i i don't know that's just like a that's just a piece of feedback to think on but i think it's really cool right thank you very much for the kind words so that obviously exists you know in the form of git coin donations or that kind of stuff or directly sent to addresses so our idea with sublimate is that you can set a recurring subscription that would never end for example you can send 10 die every month to someone you love or enjoy their work but the subscription will never end so every time you top up your account the subscriptions all the subscriptions that you have they keep going so you never forget to reward your people that's cool yeah the way to augment it is like you know you could actually subscribe a token for example right um so like like general field it's you know you get the interest maybe maybe it's like you you earn on top of it right but it's also a way to connect right to a creator without you know like committing like let's say yeah i want to commit to a year's worth of subscription but maybe mid-year the creator wants to stop uh working on working as like you know newsletter uh you know or like or so on right so that's one use case you can see yeah very cool and that's really smart the the best like the the token design uh like that's really really tall yeah i actually wanted to do stapler for something but i didn't use it because of that reason that the person has to call it but right yeah daniel go ahead uh yeah i just want to say it's an amazing ui it really feels like a complete like product that you could like put out in production it's like you know obviously there's improvements to be made but it yeah it's like really nice and polished so congrats on that um also can you elaborate a bit more on like how the funds get pushed like the token design that you're mentioning right so basically we're overriding the balance of function of the rc20 with you know an incoming rate for for the receiver and an outgoing rate for the sender so we also store the block number at which the last balance was updated and then we can compute the balance of which is just you know the last balance updated plus the sum of the rates times uh the time that was elapsed from the from the last update kind of like an extrapolation okay so that's in the stream contract so the user is receiving streamy or like stream die that's in all of the contracts we have basically an abstract uh streamable token contract and then two wrapping contracts one for the erc20 so wrapped erc20 and another one for wrapped ethereum so does the user receive like the stream token or do they receive like the underlying eoc20 at the end of the day without doing anything right so they receive the streamable tokens that they can directly reuse to to make another subscription or they can use the underlying asset by withdrawing but the idea with sublimate is that this standard becomes you know more and more used so that people can directly pay with streamable tokens because there is still the transfer function just like in the regular erc20 russia very cool amazing published involved hacking congrats i assume backgrounds by the way yeah yeah that size too well that you put into everything that you presented so congrats again and hopefully we get to use this uh really soon we love you too thank you very much thank you perfect so uh next up we have uh safekeep web three bridge and i'll be playing their video as well and then after that we'll be taking another four minute break for our judges to deliberate but uh i see the safekeep uh web3 bridge team is here and i'll kick off with your demo hello guys my name is alibio representing the name of our project is safety and the industry you all are trying to solve now so in the crypto world the issue of people losing their private keys is quite common and then once you lose a product that's the end of your talking and also the case where by someone died and doesn't diverge these are private keys to any of his family as they end up okay so what we're trying to solve now is to make sure that the asset solution is to create a special kind of wallet way more positive and interest is on the front locking code so this is the safekeep landing page and like have been updated now you can manually update it anytime you want so we can deposit from die to the contract so now we have an extra android die in the control normally now so the ping picture this is the magic feature of the uh safety wallet if you don't see yourself using your wallet for the next three or four months but then you want the contract not to know that okay if you have access to your village or you are still alive yeah anytime the contractor not checks if there are old users who have not think the contractor now says that ping tells the contractor now that okay even though you're not depositing any room or thai moment you have to font for your private keys or you can also update your backup address anytime maybe you feel like okay down in the morning once i want to change and release updates voila now we're going to move on to the admin page and then we switch over to the admin to the contract owner so here we switch to the contractor now then all users can see the balance and the contract balance and the contract table also the ai balance but only the contracting account called the deposit into the having lending for functional and withdrawal functions and this is where the contract do not check for users who are not turning transactions opening the contract for a while so since we have quite a five die now i'm going to try and to into uh available but uh not quite wired up now so it's going to fail at this point then we'll get our fixed so yeah that was the basic idea so when you deposit users who haven't paint for six or eight months and can just to send their phones into the phone their phone might have viewed it back to them and that's basically that wallet that gives you second chance and also interest thank you very cool yeah it looks like everybody's here yeah uh maybe i'll just start off with that with a question what made you think about this idea uh to to work on how would you decide to do this um so there's a popular story about the german guy that lost access to his um hard drive that contains i think tonight of crypto and then we thought about okay what if um maybe he saved it in a place where he could get a second chance at at retrieving his fonts not just because you lost your private keys then that's the end of 200 million that's not fair so that's the basic idea behind that definitely very important with with the safekeep contracts would you be able to uh still interact with like other defy applications or just general crypto applications uh from that wallet uh yeah we can interact with we plan to interact with um the avalanche improve for now so so deposit the funding um yes 20 tokens into the lending pool so the users can get gain interest on their um on their phones so it's not just the wallet start you know my wallet you also gain some right but let's say i wanted to like buy some let's say i want to use unit swap to trade some tokens can i do that from the wallet that you provide uh no not yet we could integrate that we and i definitely think this uh problem space needs more work to be done i think there's probably so many tokens that are like death locked um yeah and it's something that i've like started to think about like how do i or you know if i lose something like how do i retrieve it or what not yeah yeah i would i would i would love to have something like this for my wallets i think it would be nice i don't know i don't know if there's a way technically to build it where like i could still use my wallet in the normal way i'm using it but i could also have this feature that would be really awesome but it's definitely a really good problem to solve yeah but i think for for that report i think you have to choose a part of your phones to be locked so you don't just transfer now because of the interest style to lock the money and the game yeah finally after locking the landing page yeah that makes sense um and then one one quick ques so for the pinging does that do you does the ping happen if i do a transaction automatically or do i need to do a transaction specifically just to ping no anytime you deposit um or die got it or we all withdraw yeah you automatically bring the contract yeah so but if you don't want to do anything for yeah that makes sense well awesome work on it i think it's a it's a it's cool school project solves definitely solves a real problem if i could suggest like a potential alternative approach i've like just thought about it a little bit not like fully baked out but um so one of the things about these wallets like you uh you want to be able to to use them for whatever you're you're used to using them for um so maybe one approach would be to set uh allowances for like all the tokens or maybe every single erc20 token in existence just like set an allowance to it an unlimited allowance to some smart contract and then that smart contract like handles the the dead man switch logic i think that would be an interesting uh space to explore yeah yeah we're looking for that thank you amazing well hopefully get to continue working on this and if there's anything uh if global community can do to help you build this or help you uh debug or suggest other things uh don't hesitate to reach out to any of us on discord so yeah yeah thank you and uh with that quick uh four-minute break for uh for our judges so i'll just ask all of you to join me on the other chat for a few minutes and we'll resume in about four minutes so thanks everybody all right everybody we're we're gonna get ready for resuming all the demos so if our judges are ready you can turn videos on and we'll continue to the next team awesome over here okay so it looks like all of our judges are ready so uh next up is tara so uh rob whenever you're ready feel free to share your video all right let me know if this is looking okay uh yes now it is cool here we go hello market make this is future rob presenting dark labs as hack turetara is a market and culture watch streaming bot an audio-visual program of what's currently happening synthesized straight from the chain as the crypto space grows we are building tools that help you keep track of this universe turetara is an attempt to deliver live news and information from the block utilizing the graph reading smart contracts and presenting a mix of what is going on verifiable decentralized entertainment the script written by the smart contracts and the news sourced from blockchain transactions during market make we concentrated on showcasing ave's protocols on the left we have a scroll of lending rates similar to what you would find on obvi's homepage in order to exhibit ave's flash loans and give more information on the lending protocol we have aggregated their data presenting the total amount by currency via circulating bar graphs capturing a high level view of how these services are being utilized in the moment moving forward we intend to include a highlight reel of the largest transactions and explore visualization techniques for viewing these contract interactions there are few tools as synonymous with the traditional financial industries as the talking heads walk into any modern trading firm day trader office franchise bank you name it and there's a good chance you might hear or see them as we move forward with making the market we should consider these opportunities to reinvent these tools and make them better there are countless market streams but they are mostly just streams of existing platform candle charts in the near future please be on the lookout for turtara on your preferred streaming platform this will be a curated showcase of projects such as ave as well as diving into the arts and culture once enough segments are created we intend to expand the stream to a web platform a segment builder viewer possibly even integrating personalized stream from your address thank you for your time and happy hacking i'm curious about the name what's the it how'd you come up with that name um so the tour tara is a is a lizard or a reptile from new zealand that survived and it has a third eye and it's the only type of it so this is a third eye to sense and it's a primordial third eye which was kind of taken away from all the other creatures but kind of like the television and talking heads tura taurus still kind of has that ethos of you know past world yeah um this is really really cool i really like it a lot and it's very creative it's very different than any a lot of the other projects and i just i just think it's it's like i was just kind of laughing watching it because it's like you know obviously you have bloomberg tv or whatever and this is like our version of it and it's like totally wacky and weird and i really love that um how far did you like because it's hard to tell like you could have obviously just sort of like photoshopped everything like how far did you actually get on like building this like so that it actually yeah more is like is that just like a visual prototype or is it actually something behind it yeah so i'm actually streaming like four react apps and a project and some video projects so it's like a really cool collage kind of multimedia thing and i have it on a server instance a gp gpu instance so i can kind of go ham um but yeah i mean it it exists it's close it has it's infested with bugs here and there but it it kind of does its thing and i like i like the idea of like real-time crypto markets tv it's cool and then you know how many people like the data you mentioned the graph but are you uh sorry for interrupting are you uh pulling anywhere other than the graph or where's all the graph right now it's mostly the graph all the numbers are coin get go i know like once i dive into chain link i feel like that's a bottomless opportunity in this space just because then you have weather and then you can get real prices and you can even have you know gold um so yeah i definitely want to go full aggregator as much as i can with it but for now it's only the graph in a couple apis d5 pulses in there um how did you find working with the graph it's great i mean i like you know sometimes when you get into doing like some of the harder math of where you're converting and everything it's already there for you it's like almost when you find yourself going too deep into it someone's already done what you need especially in office case but yeah i like the branding uh it's like you know it reminds you like the crypto lizard brain that we all have right that you're watching should turn off but i guess this is one way to like delegate that you know to external source um so i like the analogy yeah really really fun thanks i really like that you you're having a twitch stream i think that's a really good idea um and also this is just this thing that i've i've been saying about analytics tool i feel like they're kind of lacking in crypto um and my thesis for the reason is that like anyone who has really good analytics will just trade on them and keep it proprietary rather than like putting it out in the open so there's like a huge need for like better open analytics tools so i think it's really cool yeah i agree and i think what's really cool too something i talked to trent about was like make web platform and then like looking at zapper uh the d5 pulse project where like you could literally build this from your own uh address but sometimes move on to our next team and uh that's gearbox and mikhail uh looks like i see you here um this is an interesting project as well and uh you know uh maybe you'll cover this in your video but i encourage you to tell me i tell the judges about the the background and how this came to be so i'll let you kind of take on that and uh before i share your video whenever you're ready yep i'm ready so i start right hey right great so uh there's a lot a lot of closed captioning there on the video that sort of walks us through this thing but uh maybe as far as judges uh maybe uh it'll be useful for you just kind of give a couple lines on and let go on the inspiration behind this thing and we can jump into the questions so yeah um so the idea is very simple because now if i want to trade this margin or something like that i should go to uh lending protocol like compound and halwa and for example use my authorized asset to get another one and then i go to unit swap for trading it's a very simple idea to combine lending protocols and the x protocol in one so if you want to deposit money you could put money on jr box and if you're a trader you can put only 25 percent of your money and give a margin and so you can trade on uni swap on any protocol using this jrbox interface so you have the same uh prices for different indexes but jrbox protocol contracts that all tokens are white listed and in the future it would be solved like a dow so pool owners could decide which tokens could be accessible for traders and which are not so if the protocol computes that your portfolio does not cost more than a special threshold so it automatically be accessible for liquidators and they could liquidate your portfolio for premium so it protects totally the funds of depositors and at the same time you are free to do all operation on first class taxes like unisop and sushi swap until you do not cross this risk management line but as a trader if you do not earn your money when you trade using jr box jar box controls all this stuff so the initial uh collateralization is 25 what is the liquidation professional uh i think it's just an mvp so i consider risk model and borrowing model like enough and probably depends on asset but i think it's around 10 percent so if you cross a line that the your total portfolio are going around and you know 20 or 10 percent of this this your uh assets are accessible by liquidators so they should have profits and probably it requires a more wise and smart thing because this current uh gas cost it depends to be valuable to run the smart contract because it could cost 50 dollars so you it depends not only the person but some fixed value also that's cool so so it seems like so it seems like you're you're counting whatever they're taking out whatever they're taking out the margin for and buying you're sort of counting the assets that they buy as part of their collateral you're sort of treating that as like their collateral so you're using that yeah yeah yeah yes idea very simple you put 25 percent of your money and you have a uh four times more but you should trade using my interface and all currents are stored on my smart contract and it continuously compute that your total balance is more than liquidation price right if it grows the price line liquidators come and sell your portfolio and it's really very gas efficient if you compare to use a few protocols like other plus units etc etc yeah that's really cool it's really cool it's a good idea it's very um yeah i think it's a very original idea this is a really good idea and i'm curious thanks any thoughts on why this hasn't like doesn't exist already i don't know why i checked but i didn't find yet probably it's exist you can go to jailbox finance and it's totally work for testnet probably there is no front-end for liquidators but the contract is written and of course some huge job in the future but it works and you can check yeah so it's cool it's a great job yeah and thanks for kartik for inspiration because i was stuck on saturday but he said yeah do something and i decided yes i am going to do something [Laughter] it was really a nice journey really happy to see you uh here and i'm presenting this and uh obviously it seems like everybody thinks this is a great idea and uh you might just already live so uh we'll be sure to make sure that others know about this too all right um so and uh with that we are ready to uh move on to our next team yeah thanks so much thanks and have a good day yes bye-bye see ya so next up we have uh price oracle connect um and uh i think there are some uh additions to this uh to this video so let's be close caption but uh [Music] that help you to use dot match success challenge in the algorithms to judge from each about price i made two proves funny thing that help you to use shielding in the app in dotnet platform it's the first upload nava now it's possible to reach other data provider complex and price oracle.net it's a demo show to you how to find the list of the targets using the ava data provider and this card shows you how to find price the post and borrow information the next is challenge proof for dot net material thanks to nef it's easy to find shingling or likely contract in the res this card shows how to find the stud price and the discard show how to find specific price using router id last i did a website that was our displays when cooking deludes that the website will find out targets in other end chat price barrel and the auto information this website is made in webassembly and they only use mushroom data thanks to shelling it's possible to find gold prices and it is possible to import standard zone files to create coast list of tokens in the future i want to add support to vaf and chairlink market i want to continue to work on explorers to help note.net developers using other end screens and improve the website better design and cache system to speed up the log time thanks to watch bye hello any certain question any question yeah i i'm this is quite interesting i'm curious you know how much more work do you think you know it's possible i think the other video started playing oh good um yeah i know hey look this i was wondering like you know how much more work did it need to be put into this project before maybe uh this can be kind of leveraged like by the existing developer ecosystem yes it's my idea my disability for match and it's possible tools documents and games mobile but i don't have time to continue this vlog sorry i felt bad speaking publicly very nervous i'm at club concierge no that's fine this is this is great yeah yeah i can totally understand you um and yeah i think it's a great project obviously chain or or on chain prices are super super important oracles are super important i actually have an ignorant question i don't know what um what you what you ported it into you said is it dot net is that you said like i actually don't know what that is yes dot next platform a beauty building microsoft okay windows games and got it got it okay that's helpful for me but this is yeah i think solving the oracle problem is always always a hard problem to solve so anything you can do to help out with that is really awesome thank you i want you to improv i do not have time but i really wanted to work trailing and it's hard for me to do exchanges in sri lanka it's online heavy job scripting by the rivers foreign uh i want to acknowledge for losing games for elaboration touches but i have two weeks to act this um yeah i do not have to say what what to say sorry i'm very nervous it's my fiancee uh what were like uh what's like the main challenge that you uh dealt with building this project mummy such have a good day in just a week congrats on uh on entering this and uh hopefully you got to learn some new things and uh it seems like there's a lot of things on your list too to add in the future to this project so i'm looking forward to on our side to seeing what you built from uh from here thank you huh yeah great work thank you thank you i hope speaking better and what what the absolutely it presentation it was really great and uh thank you for reaching us for more help thanks amazing so um we have two more projects to go and uh next up we have obey who's going to be talking about the aved2 user retention dashboard so maybe whenever you're ready feel free to share your video is uh my video visible yes yep global project user retention dashboard there are three components in it while populating the data so data is pulled from rb to subgraph and transformed into postgresql tables on those tables sql joins and queries has been created which and using those queries the dashboard and the chart is built there are three major features on the dashboard so at the top aggregation metrics are displayed for example total number of unique users who have made transactions total transactions done by users that user retention chart is the second part of dashboard where user retention analysis has been done that this helps us understand which features makes user happy so let's say if a feature is released in a particular week and a lot of new users has joined then that means there is a good impact of that features on the user the third part is final analysis so funnel analysis analysis you can track user break progress through different stages and identify where in which stage user drop of drop rate is high and so marketing team or the team can analyze uh those categories those stages and take actions based on that i'll take directly the dashboard so here is the live rv2 dashboard so at the top we can see a way we do like the aggregation metrics so there is total user transactions unique users so there are around 11 543 uh unique users permit transaction out of that around 10k plus users who have made repeat translations and these are like 1.7 k users who have made 10k uh translations similarly like you 765 users have made 20k translations the second part is user retention cohort analysis so uh the away protocol v2 protocol was launched in number like in week of november 30 and december 6 so that is cohort subsequent weeks are assigned a cohort now here we can see that in the first week 842 users had signed up out of that uh so week one he one here is like december to seven to december 30 so around 30 users have made uh made activity and transactions uh like out of 842 30 percent have made uh activity in week two it is 21 percent in week three there is 18 and subsequently like in week 10 which is the last week there are like 0.02 users have shown activity uh see in week five and week six we can see there is good uh uh there is good number of users who have made activity so in week five around one like 1.6 k users have new users have signed up out of that in subsequent week around 38 percent have made activity which is a good number then in further like weeks it's 23 and 16 percent so so this tells us that in week of december to january 3 there is some there's some like feature releases or there's some uh uh there's some marketing uh action has been taken which has increased uh signups the next part of dashboard is uh fun analysis based on user transaction so uh so there are different categories user with two plus transaction user with four plus transactions user with eight plus transactions so we can see that uh there are like 10.4 k users with two plus transactions uh there are around 62 percent of users who who have done four plus transactions there are around like uh 10 users who have made 16 plus transactions so there are like mini wheels and wheels so many wheels are around four percent who have done 32 plus transactions and around one percent users have made 64 plus transitions switch which is like kind of ways yeah so this is the dashboard and it tells a lot about user retention i've also created github wrapper with updated readme and the importance of cohort and final analysis so yeah here is the data so that's it from my side let me know for any questions thank you yeah after building this dashboard uh i'm curious like what's one thing you kind of like picked up on uh or learned about avi that you that may have surprised you before uh so so like overall i learned a lot about uh the away entities and the thing which surprised me which i also mentioned in my uh presentation is uh i mean so in the week in the cohort five and six you can see there is a huge there is a huge spike in new users so when i uh when i talk to the team and ask like why i mean what is the reason for that so they specified like there were some new features or there are some marketing campaigns from that side that went way that went from their site and that that brought like new users uh uh on their on their platform so basically the cohort analysis it it tells a lot about uh the growth of your product the impact of new features uh on your platform yeah so uh so basically the i mean that week uh i actually discussed with the team and learnt more about their activity very cool yeah great job um so so is this uh i guess some did you did you like the the did you build the tool to create the visualizations or did you use a different tool for that and then import the data yeah so uh i actually i uh wrote typescripts i mean typescript scripts to populate the data from uh sub graph so there are like entities sub graph swaps used to uh like wrote the script to populate that data into three different tables in postgres cohort cohort so table one is code cohort table two is cohort base values which is the new users and cohort three is code metric values values so uh and based on these three tables i created uh like joints in the query and created like a temporary table uh uh in the in the sql query to pop together to populate this chart yeah and the chart like uh the chart is not i mean the uh chart like it that there's some library npm library is used to create the visualization but all the data population and the table population is by this clips got it yeah i think it's pretty cool it's always nice to see visualization like especially like on the blockchain everything's public but like there's too much data right it's like a fire hose um i'm curious are you planning to uh do more like what's your plan with this basically yeah so there are two uh like two next steps for uh which uh after discussing with the team i came to know one is they want a cohort for deposit amount so this is the code for new users but the next is depo uh like deposit so how new how they go yeah how users are performing uh on week by week basis based on like how much their depositing amount so that is uh uh that is a different type of cohort where we will be showing i'll be showing like usd values uh uh on week by week basis and next uh the next part is i think so a lot of d5 projects i mean they have a lot of data but they don't have a way to repro like analyze uh analyze using this kind of cohort so i mean i was surprised to note that away which is a huge project doesn't i mean doesn't have a dashboard with uh with this cohort analysis so what's uh my what my thinking is like make this tool available for generate like general public so any any project who has a big amount of data uh they can like they can uh connect their subgraph and i mean this and this cohort and funnel will be populated automatically so i mean that's the second second step layton do you guys have a something like this for pull together no this would be we definitely would want to use something like this it should be cool very cool nice yeah i'm sure you could like shop this around to all the taos like on their proposal pages be like hey i can do some cohort yes for you get like a crap for each for sure for sure especially for pull together the retention cord analysis actually is good because you want to see a a fun one for you to tackle if you want to work on this more a bit so yeah great yes congrats uh for demoing and uh showing us what you did and it seems like there's a lot of interesting insights that will be useful for not just having but also future d5 protocols here yeah yeah sure with that ready for our last demo for today thank you everyone thank you nice work and that is project refundable estate so i see sagar already here um so whenever you are ready i think we're waiting for one more number yeah i'm just waiting for my friend um he'll be joining soon over there and whenever you're ready we can uh kick off with the video [Music] maybe he has some issues scotty can can you put the video i'll share with the link right now oh oh he is here so uh looks like the audio isn't coming through would you mind ensuring that the audio check boxes yeah just give me a minute yeah we are really extremely sorry to just we have changed the machines okay uh so guys i'm not able to see the check box for enabling the sound of my machine uh that's okay what i'll do is all if it's the same video from a submission i'll just play it on my side and uh we'll just go from there yeah okay cool just give me one second all right so i'm gonna kick this off and uh we're we'll do our last demo for today what project is refungible estate refund giveaway state is a game where a person can sell he sell loan rent his and his virtual land um on blockchain so this project aims to explain how powerful a blockchain can can be in terms of real estate management so we have used react and 3gs as a front-end and solidity ethereum as a black backend so we have tried to give it as a minecraft type of theme or ui right so this is how um voxel printer looks like here you can see a single blocks represent a square fit on the lantern which can be traded between the users and users can so a person can create this land and save it and the fields will be setting it or saving on mongodb atlas and this data is 10 vertical has crucial data come like square feet area bypass profit rent and all this data is used for for the trading of the land so we have created our own external adapter and uh i must say this data is off change which is in mongodb at last we need it in our contact so we have created our own chaining adapter so and this adapter has been hotted by a node operator and and we get a crucial data such as the square feet and all into our contracts uh we can see uh like we have made a request to our our api consumer and got the crucial graphic area from the uh on the basis of token id and we have then minted uh number of tokens among them among these graphic data so we have created a new concept like rft rft like if you see nft nft a person can only trade it only either you buy it vote or you don't so we have created somewhat like rft so rfts are like nft can be sold traded in fraction by an erc225 so a single estimated open uh represents a share share of the of the nft so there we can see it's an ift so we have used some nf3 address token address uh which can be bought partially so how this is done is like um it is backed by an essay 22. so here we can see so i have bought a share in this nft as i have bought some two two plus two check uh we'll see how much the person has so this this rc20 token repair can be termed as an holdable token which represents a person's share on the land so the this this thing like uh each and every scrap it is been marked by a block id like consider this as block one employ id2 so this person has bought some uh two shares of uh from the land and those are block one and two and so he has two tokens which represent that this person has a share on the um on the land so person can build a business upon the land and uh and the business basically represent the project of a user for example and which he can be used to advertise or market his project or whatever so the business holder business owner has to pay a monthly rent and that rent is divided among all the shareholders of the land and the shareholders like in terms of uh i have two shares so i will be getting a two percent from the quarters whatever end the person has been so 10k also so the concept is like that uh avocados are the land uh land keeper land keeper which acts and adds an extra weight to the uh implemented successfully we have just tried to mimic it like with the shop.faster.io and we have created our own customs uh yield farming type of morale where a person takes a uh ghost token and uh i'm supposed to finally want the abigail owner can determine how much of the cut he will take for the report and this reward is being generated uh only be issued from the game admins as well only so the uh the concept is like abegoti maintains a cleanliness core so uh if whenever a person creates an arbitrary on his land and interacts with it so we increase the uh clearing score of the that person's profile and then uh that which is mapped to the address and then the person the next time tries to buy another land email he or she may get some discount or something which is not yet fixed though so um that's what we have channeling um credit delegation where a person can loan his land for colorado uh sorry collateralize his land for loans and etc so we have properly uh uh except extend a fully functional prototype as the video was too big so we have to cut short some parts of it and then these are the links to it where we can show here we show the fully pre uh working prototype of the default stage and here is the fully uh working prototype credit delegation so i will just explain what credit television uh you know concept is like a person can get some loans uh on behalf on the basis of the land or his project of the business holder holder and the borrower can then land him so we are even thinking of implementing an escrow system okay awesome yeah cool good work this is a creative project it's interesting uh it's cool it's cool idea um what actually here's what was your what was your inspiration for it uh to be honest uh i have a friend in what we say rajasthan so here he owns a palace so but the thing is they are not able to maintain it because it's too expensive for them so they are looking for investors for them so that investors they can uh buy some shares of the uh what you say that palace and convert into a five-star hotel so i was thinking like that if i couldn't represent the building in the boxer painter we have made it by the activities and then a person can buy some share and whatever the monthly yield from the hotels and all you can distribute it uh properly among themselves but the thing was it has some lots of legal issues so and like we are especially out of collagen i don't have much of the experience in blockchain but uh so i thought just like let me make a game into it so let's let me and the user themselves understand how the real estate management can be done in the blockchain site and then later we can move it to real world so gotcha very cool yeah basically you're a huge minecraft node so like this is like waiting for the moment while like crypto hits minecraft you know open source entirely multiple worlds you know it's going crazy you know servers and economies right like like if you with this uh live somewhere or like deploying the server like please hit me up right like surely but we are hoping if someone can help us with mentorship and like we are not that experienced but we are ready you got to learn and this is our first half obviously hackathon so you can create a server like currently uh we can create a lan and we can store it on the local today but we have made it uh to show that config in mongodb atlas and we are fetching the data from mongodb atlas into a smart contract to chain link so we can do that free users can come in and share their what we say the designs of the land and they can store the talk and uh the the whole land is an erc 721 and it is and some fractions of space so we have making like some essay 20 token backed by essentially so we have some idea i know let's this see awesome stuff thank you you mentioned the uh you could like collateralize you use your blocks as collateral can you elaborate a bit more on how that would okay yeah is there like the pricing pricing okay okay so when you buy a square feet of lamp you you need some some amount of eater so each and every block of land uh it caused some ether though so what we are thinking like a business owner say like that we saw in youtube some there are some technical indicators uh what we say youtubers they share their technical indicators and then earn uh some part of the profit so we were thinking like if possible a business holder can uh say that uh please guys follow my technical intricate strategies and all and then later uh whatever so i have so much uh estimation that i can earn this much uh some amount of value from a trade or whatever so he can have an escrow system he'll loan his land this land and ask for a loan and with a credit delegation uh will show it in a table like a table format where a person is renting a loaning is not and with some amount of alligator what we say among uh he wants as a loan so person will go okay i am delegating him the loan he will uh take the loan behalf of that user and send that amount to the uh the person that's land owner the block owner and uh then he can uh like we'll keep some 30 days of um what we say if he is not able to repay the loan and of interest in 30 days the land will be open to sale again and when the land gets sold again whatever the money comes to the uh the person who delegated will give it to him so then he can swap it and uh pay his debt and get it to come back from so that was our concept did you learn about all of this just in the last three weeks uh say i'm i'm very honest so our project is not completely ready yet so esco part is left but we have made the almost we can say eighty percent of back end is done and ui part like avigocchi and the front end is done but uh land sailing and all to the ui is not done yeah it's in remix yet so and yeah we have done this all in these last three weeks though amazing well yoshi sagar thanks so much for presenting was a really cool app thank you thank you guys thank you so uh so uh last project for uh for today and uh this is uh kind of us wrapping up uh this judging so before i kind of say goodbye to everybody i want to thank our three judges leighton peter and daniel for giving us the past couples on their side today and uh and i really appreciate all the feedback that you've given to all of our teams and uh i want to make sure that i also have a chance to uh kind of uh really uh help you find this valuable and you'll get a chance to kind of look at some interesting ideas and concepts and before we end this i want to also give a special shout out to andy and jenny who have been making all of this work in the back end of our volunteers and making sure everything is so andy yeah thank you guys for making this uh run super smoothly um really appreciate all that and all the background work to make this great so uh thanks again um we'll be able to announce everything uh tomorrow for our finalists and uh please tune in for the eighth market make uh finale on uh on thursday by 9 a.m pacific so with that i'd like to close this off and uh thanks everybody if you stick around and watch the rest of the demos awesome nice thank you guys see ya
