okay like i said this is uh day three of our judging for ethonline um to sort of give everyone a sense of the scale of this which we were just talking about because over 700 hackers have joined and we had over a thousand applications come in and the current hackers are from 65 countries across 19 time zones um we've had a ton of great projects and we topped out at about 117 project 175 projects submitted so that's what's being judged over these all of these days i'll run quickly through the format for everyone as everyone knows each team will have a four minute no longer than four minutes video demo which will start at the start of each team's judging session after which there's a four minute q a and then about halfway through this set we have about 16 teams we're gonna do today so around team eight or nine we're going to do a 10-minute break and then return um to just discuss for everyone's benefit the broad criteria that we have asked the judges to apply there's a technicality criteria originality the practicality of the hack they give consideration to the ui ux and the dx and then there's that wow factor if it's just a just a cool idea or something else that really catches their eye you know we stress uh if you've gone to an east global event we really stress of course there's a competitive aspect to it but this really isn't at its core a hardcore competition because we really emphasize the experience of everyone here we hope people are here to learn and they've learned a lot even for this particular judging session um the goal here isn't necessarily to to make the hack a business we're not you know focused on cultivating that that's up for the hackers themselves but you should take this opportunity it's not just judging it's to get some good feedback this is a rare opportunity to get a serious amount of attention from different experts in the field so we hope everyone focuses on that i'd like to introduce our esteemed judges for today's session simona pop of status jesse walden from the variant fund and austin griffith from the ethereum foundation welcome we thank you very much for your time um and at which point i will now hand it off to andy or timekeeper and i will go off camera good luck everyone all right so our first team is nfa if you guys can start sharing your screen we can get started okay great i'm going to share my screen ineffective we did lose the video there or the audio yeah the audio cut out so maybe that mute doesn't work okay sorry about that i'll start again nft is an interest-earning amn factory which takes er671 tokens and mints new erc 20 share tokens that can be sold to buyers so for our hack we are making it as easy as possible to turn future creative work into interest-bearing nft markets so creators can gain funding with added interest here is a demo of how creating an nf8 factory amm contract address will work if the creator has not yet made an nft for their future piece they can hear then this gets carried to where the creator can set the initial price and collateral type they wish to accept for their market then they can choose the pricing structure with three different variants in the curve next they can choose their risk strategy for earning interest the collateral collected from selling the shares will be mirrored as deposits into ave lending pools earning interest by leveraging the rv protocol's a token contracts lastly the contract address is created ready to be used for selling the erc 20 share tokens when the creator has their new market contract address they can start accepting collateral from their shareholders in this kind of market a buyer will be able to interact freely buying and withdrawing from the nft market contract anytime the market is open in the end which we have not yet built as part of our hack the creator will be able to close the market with a flick of the switch causing the nft market contract to distribute the erc 20 share tokens to all hundred shareholders trigger redemption of the collateral from the lending pool and allow the creator to withdraw the collateral with interest as funding for their work in this way both creators and buyers benefit from staying in the market while it is open and waiting for the market to come to a natural close once all the share tokens are sold this tool will be suited for any reputable creator who has willing shareholders waiting for their next project piece to drop if the creator has a limited edition work or work that is collectible then offering willing buyers shares to co-own before it is complete will entice both parties to pre-fund the work and follow through with creating it the example shown here in our factory tool is just one application of this idea perhaps it could be used as an integration on audience's platform for recording artists to fund their albums nft could also be adapted to work as a kickstarter even going as far as making intellectual property for the creative work the nft itself effect allowing creators to gain upfront funding for their next creation before they make it okay cool that's the end of our video and yeah just a quick intro um this is a little bit of an incomplete tag we didn't 100 finish everything we wanted to but we would be glad to get your feedback and your constructive criticism and um our teammates can answer in your questions oh yeah can you enable them now again yeah great great job it was a really really well done presentation um very very clear and uh it's a it's a very cool product idea as well one quick question i had is um the the risk settings that you showed you know there was a low risk and medium risk um i guess i'm curious uh how yeah how you how you picked those um and and and if you have any thoughts on how that might work in the future and how important it is for your users to understand the risk that they're being exposed to um yes i can answer that question with a quick answer um we we didn't fully explore all the possibilities of risk that we wanted to and that is one of our future improvements that we want to add um different in like risk risk strategies um of different interests like for instance you know there's some high-risk pools from year and there's some low-risk pool from pull together um but but essentially we we start off with are they just uh lending pools because it's it's it's it's low risk to medium risk um kind of interest and um yeah if anyone else from the team wants to answer that question as well uh yeah uh so future integration we would like to uh ideally there would be some sort of api call to ave and we would choose of three different options like a low risk medium risk and a high risk pool and that would sort of pre-populate the nfd stage with options you know what would be interesting just um of the top of my head to have like a sliding bar where you could essentially increase it and then maybe pull from other protocols as well so you can kind of go from very low and then increase increase increase like a sliding um yeah like a slider i think that would be very good ux wise and very simple and maybe you could have small explanations underneath to kind of give people a sense of what that might mean but yeah great work this is awesome yeah i think it's neat like it's it's so cool that this is what a hackathon project looks like now like all the cool building pieces and all the parts and all the like nomenclature that comes together to make what you guys are calling an incomplete hack this is this is a pretty awesome project i think getting that redemption piece in is pretty important but i i like the trick i'm assuming you use the trick where they're they're buying these nfts in a very discreet one-off manner and that helps a lot with the curve so you don't have to do a bunch of tricky calculus but i would say double props on on you know kind of using that hack for for it's kind of a cheat code in in uh ethereum right now you can do discrete buys of nfts and you can do them on a curve without having to do a bunch of complicated calculus and also just quickly before we run out of time um you guys should um have a chat to the team at loft radio i know they're doing um some work on loft radio where it started off as a passion project and now i think the team wants to to expand it quite a bit so yeah um get in touch with them i think it's loft radio and then underscore on twitter they're a great team um have a little track to them you never know that might be an interesting convergence that's a great point like next steps here like find a couple of these artists and get them out on the platform and you'll just yeah that's a great way to get traction 100 real quick any thoughts on when when the a creator might decide to close the market you know like what at what point what would be the catalyst for that what's an example we did we did write the contract that it only um emits a hundred erc 20s so almost like a hundred percent share so we do kind of treat these buyers as shareholders so that would be one of the places to close it but we also had an idea of a staged closing as well so if they get to twenty percent of their shareholders or forty percent of their shareholders we would think about doing a staged closing cool awesome um that about wraps up q a um thank you for your time great project guys thanks guys all right so the next team will be astral dao um if you guys could start sharing your screen that would be nice the astro protocol the first decentralized protocol to bring trusted geospatial data and analytics to web3 applications the problems that we're trying to solve include the lack of transparency between spatial data providers and end users secondly very few web3 apps truly make an impact in the real world and thirdly various spatial enabled fields like spatial finance cannot move forward unless there's a proven way to ensure the validity of geospatial data in order to solve this we create this astro protocol a web3 spatial data standard we capture data through our data capture layer and stored on the distributed storage layers such as ipfs or filecoin then we perform some type of analytics on this data and feed it into the smart contracts through an oracle this data and insights that we gain can then be used in smart contract logic to create sustainable error any types of dapps that rely on spatial data one of the things we created was a geodate it's a did document that is based off of the space heater temporal acid catalogs these are base a list of web 2 specifications for spatial data by creating the geodata we're creating a new primitive for representing spatial data assets in web3 we also developed the smart contract nft verifiable data registries that utilize the graph basically we can um track and register these geodids through nfts on the blockchain and we can query them through the graph so we're representing the geo did as an nft on the blockchain network essentially we also created an interactive ux focus dap that has a frictionless web 3 experience and wallet integration so i want to show you guys the application that we built here is the geo locker this is the front end application i'm going to connect our wallet with metamask and then i'm going to drop a stack item into this area this is the stack item that we're loading it's basically an extended geo json and then we're going to register the geo nft and confirm the transactions keep in mind that this is happening on the robson network so it might take a while but during in the background basically we drop the stack item in and it's basically converting the stack item into a geodid document it's going to then take this geode document and also mint an nft and while it's minting the nft it's going to bind it to the user's account and or wallet essentially and this way the user can represent the geode document as an nfp on the blockchain network they can sell this nft they can trade the nft they can do multiple things also the nft will hold certain metadata within it that we can use to further the application and leverage other types of possibilities so any second now it should confirm so the transaction is confirmed now and you can see that that geo nft successfully registered so now the user has the nft in their wallet and they also have the geodate regis registered to their name or it's binding to their nft essentially and so um in a summary we created the geodate document we also created this nft that binds to it and we also created a adapt front-end that allows producers of spatial data to register and query their asset catalogs in a seamless web three like manner our team is well suited for this because we have some some of the teammates have geospatial background and some of us have a lot of web3 background and um and um we were asking for a fifteen thousand dollar u.s fifty thousand dollars for our pre-seed round and we want this money to finish the protocol implementation and also on board our first first spatial dapps essentially and we also need the money to further our research and development for the geodes and also i'm converting this web to stack item into more of a web 3 thing that works for distributed file storages and feel free to reach out to us at our website or fund us at our great coin grants thank you all right q a will now begin it's funny with projects like this we always find it when it's such a big project and there's so many pieces that have to come together to make it work you find that as you set off on this ambitious journey there's holes in in infrastructure and standards and tooling and it seems like kind of the the geodid was one of those things where you kind of realized going into it like oh shoot we don't have this this standard here we need to implement that also so it's cool i i'd like to kind of ask a question back to you guys of like other missing holes or things that you guys found that you wish was there before you still like if you could talk to yourself three weeks ago what was what would be the the tool you would give you to to help maybe complete this a little better even yeah that's a great question um at every single kind of layer in that protocol we were talking about we find there's a lot of work to be done so data capture you have satellites orbiting the earth taking pictures of the earth um that's all kind of designed and developed over the last decades not necessarily ready for web3 so we would love to have secure enclaves on the satellite so it would encrypt the data so that that could be sort of owned by the um the people who put the satellite into orbit from end to end um data storage uh we don't see loads of cloud native geospatial processing capabilities in um ipfs yet um things like being able to do spatial queries like i just want to look up this little segment of satellite imagery and you know all the way into the smart contracts where you have some really early stage location-based decentralized applications that are starting to come out um the phone token curated registry you see some like decentraland you see some pretty rudimentary ways of representing spatial data um but it's pretty computationally intensive and the it's just these kind of two worlds that don't necessarily fit well together on the surface so um yeah at every layer we saw some things that we wish we'd see i think probably the biggest one is the cloud native geospatial on ipfs because we're trying to apply analytics on the fly to satellite images so we can assess whether an area was flooded or if there's more forest grown there or if us a solar array has been installed it's all really useful to use in a smart contract but it's tough to get that insights reliably into the contract that's interesting that it's that stuff and not it's interesting i i call them web two problems i guess because i'm so ingrained in one three but it's interesting that it's kind of a non-web3 problem or i guess storage in ipf is kind of a web three problem but it wasn't that wasn't what i was expecting to hear and you kind of glazed over the oracle too which to me is the scariest part which is yeah no to be fair i mean yeah and i i guess like a lot of those capabilities i was just talking about they exist in web 2 but if we have a 100 million dollar insurance contract riding on satellite images we need to have like and and the whole process is automated we're not really willing to like accept an insurance you know you got to have those integrity and and quality guarantees um so yeah we're definitely thinking distant future in a lot of ways on this but also thinking really hard about how it can be useful today and that's really kind of what we're focusing our energy on at this point that's tough yeah yeah so a quick quick question i had is you know i i'm at least vaguely aware of like a number of projects working on geospatial data in the space i'm cur it seems my understanding from from the presentation is you're building a lot of the stack out yourself and i guess to austin's point you know they're he's sort of asking about what unknown or known unknowns are they're there i'm curious like have you looked um at others in the space is there is there stuff you considered building on top of and decided against so we have looked around the space um we haven't found too many who are really doing what we're trying to do uh things that come to mind the ibisa uh network which is uh inclusive blockchain insurance using space assets they they provide insurance for um kind of sort of bottom billion farmers um and they have not really they've got a dashboard where users can go on and analyze satellite energy to see if crops are growing and if they're not they pay off the farmers but they haven't quite figured out how to automate that process of getting satellite imagery into smart contracts um it's been a goal since the white paper right right exactly and i completely understand they're they're just like this is so hard let's just get to actually providing services for these people i'm actually a watcher with the visa so i've been following their journey for a while and the watcher is the kind of analyst who goes on their dashboard and then submits a vote essentially attesting whether or not we want to get to the point where you can reliably consume satellite imagery analytics in smart contracts um likewise phone protocol they're doing the token carrier registry but they're also doing dynamic proof of location which is uh to replace gps right to give localization services to phones that connect to their network we would take those coordinates and use them in our geodids so as we see it we actually are complementing most of the um the the projects we see in the space um we were talking to one the other day called geoweb that was also kind of building this like a our overlay over the real world uh that will be up for the q a right okay great thanks guys thanks everyone thank you thank you john i'm gonna drop a quick link um in the chat for you there's a really cool project that unicef and itu are working on i don't know if um christina yesterday from unicef mentioned it but i'm gonna link it which might be interesting for you guys to to look at thanks simona thanks everyone thank you thanks thank you guys great work all right so for our next team um i'll be introducing euro hero if you guys can start sharing your stream okay i'm gonna share a screen um there isn't any audio at the moment you could uh try sharing with the like after clicking the bottom left button okay hi we are team euro this is built for east online 2020. the project in this hackathon was implemented by two people my name is toshiyaki takase and i worked on frontend and other is tukasanaguchi he worked on smart contract and backend so we built as platform to support the fair launch of tokens these tokens serve as a connection between creators and fans for creators they can easy to issue and distribute tokens and for fans they can get tokens directly from the creators it uses solidity the graph chain link and audios first the creators can set up the details and issue tokens the token data is synced with the graph and used on the front end creators who are using audios to distribute music can get a list of their followers and distribute tokens when fn want to withdraw tokens the acceptance or rejection is accomplished by checking the list of followers stored on ipfs via chain link so let's jump into the demo hi i'm tsukasan richie let's start an application demo this is a top page of applications for both creators and funds first we are going to create a token as a creator in this page we came to own token with basic and additional information and click on create token we can see news 8th online token on creator dashboard token's information is fetched using subgraph for this page and other pages we can withdraw our best in token as time goes on change taking status and distribute token with audios okay let's go to audio setting page in this page we can decide how many tokens should be distributed for audios users who is a followers of creator now let's distribute 10 percent of token clicking on transfer tokens sends a token to contract which actually distributes and click on start to enable user to withdraw tokens now let's turn into fun operations and this is the audios page this page shows audio's user information and withdrawal form please note that a transactions in this page is processed with audience wallet instead of meta mask first input a contract address which user wants to withdraw a token and click on request after requesting token click the check button to check that the user can withdraw or not and if user can do it with the robot is appeared click withdrawal button and then token is transferred to user's audience wallet this is a short demonstration of application thank you all right yeah cuny we'll start awesome thanks guys quick question um can i import an existing token so let's say only only creator can create a new own token and they cannot import existing token okay so i'd have to create it within your platform i can't just bring my existing one if i'm an artist and okay yeah i love how how all the integrations you guys use to to put this together i think that's super cool um and i think it's all it's also interesting you're using audio's followers um as sort of a distribution mechanism um and um yeah i guess i'm i'm curious you know if you if you thought at all about beyond beyond followers like where could you what else could you do from there in terms of um you know offering creators more options to reward their fans uh other than ods yeah what else did you consider yeah now uh we are we can introduce uh like twitter or patreon and yeah uh anything it's which which provides our api we can use check uh feature follow us using jlink uh yeah if if it has so just uh just to make sure i have the the right mental model of what what happens here is basically a creator can come here and mint an erc20 and kind of customize the distribution and with those customization settings then other people can log in with audios and prove that they're followers or is the other way around the creator logs in with their audience and proves how does the audio integration work just to clear it up in my head um creator can log in with audios then they can set the audience followers list to the ipfs then after that the follower of the followers can withdraw the token from that list cool got it okay i like the accessibility here this is a really neat thing to be able to take a web3 tool and make it something that someone can just jump in and use i think we're going to see an explosion of tools like that and then you know the the second order effects of those things uh on on our ecosystem and a lot of other ecosystems so good good job on this one this is a fun fun project hopefully you get people in there clicking and deploying tokens right that's what we want to see yeah thank you thank you great work guys yeah it's great i i think it's super cool and we've just started to scratch the surface of what these tokens would look like or what the interactions between creators and their audience will look like once the tokens are distributed so that you know the tool is step one and then the next step is figuring out what the interactions that people want actually are and how to you know extend the tool to accommodate that um which i guess since we have 30 you know 30 seconds i'm curious to hear your thoughts do you do you have guys have any um any idea as to what kind of behavior you expect from uh creators and their audience once the token is distributed uh sorry again like what what what do you what do you think these um creators and their fans will do once they have tokens from using your tool uh um i want to communicate the creators and find each other that so if the creator send to their fans their token it is not sending money it's just it's a communication tool so i want to be creators and fan they uh transfer their own token to each other cool that's everything uh for q a thank you for your great thanks guys guys thank you thank you bye bye bye all right so the next team is tonic if you guys can start sharing your screen we can get started despite extreme success mass adoption is yet to come our main issues are on intuitive ux and high transactional costs we need a killer app for this here enters tonic tonic is a decentralized bank account it offers fast payments savings and investments the account is denominated in dollars and completely hides a 3m to the user the ux designed to be like that of a web 2 challenger bank to be clear there is not a single interaction of the user with the blockchain as a matter of fact the user does not own any ether everything is paid in dollars to achieve a seamless experience we have used all tools at our disposal thanks to porties users can revert to a well-known credentials flow using email and password we use usdc as base currency thanks to its support for native meta transactions and ease of on and off ramp each layer one interaction is intermediated by the bicone relayer network for cheap and fast transfers we opted for zk sync as it seems the best suited for this task unfortunately zk sync does not support metadata for transactions or recipients so here it comes textile with threaddb where we store metadata on behalf of the user we also implemented the centralized notifications for incoming transactions using the mailbox api for the saving accounts we use a centralized vault which lends funds onto the hava money market for the investment part the first product is a bitcoin dollar cost averaging where the user can choose how much to invest every month or week these funds come out of the collective vault and purchase tokenized bitcoin using one inch for best execution so let's see tonic in action now we first log in parties using a previously created account we recommend setting tonic as a trusted app by doing so requests are automated the first screen is the balance screen we top up the current account in mainnet we would top up using a card or a bank transfer now we can deposit into the savings account this is also a l1 meta transaction now we can also deposit onto the fast pay account this is another l1 meta transaction let's move into the investment screen our first product is a simple dca for bitcoin i select amount and purchase period and off we go this is our last l1 meta transaction let's do something a little different now by opening the profile screen we can see our address below it we can claim a unique tonic tag which allows an easier payment experience i guess we gotta choose alice we can now see the fast pay experience here we show both sender and recipient screens firstly we select the amount then the recipient in this case we know the tonic tag you would have guessed right it's bob finally we send this is a layer 2 transaction once the transaction is accepted by zk sync bob receives a notification for his payment let's look at the transactions list to ascertain we got our cash sweet the transaction is there metadata included it seems alice forgot something with tonic you can also send requests for payments for the time being is just a notification but we will make it more user friendly this ends our demo i hope you all enjoyed it there is a demo version deployed in robson the app is still very rough but this could be a game changer it kind of goes on to the same thing i was saying earlier about how good these hackathon projects are getting because the underlying technology and the building blocks are getting so much easier this is this is not something that's new right like we've always wanted a great ux wallet we've always wanted something that has instant onboarding and feels like a normal thing and people get the mental model but as new building blocks come in and as new l2 solutions come out this build this idea gets a little bit more advanced and a little bit more closer to reality each time so just good job on thinking about the user first and and focusing on making basically ave as a back end into a wallet for a user with with uh you know instant onboarding so just props on this good job thanks a lot tillerson yes uh the the plan was to do something for my mom something my mom can use uh without much knowledge of uh our dream works um and i was surprised that there isn't anything like that that are out yet i mean there are some great wallets uh but still you need fairly comprehensive understanding of what what's out there and and what's gas and you know uh even even like swapping tokens and stuff like that this is like a way to offer curated uh window into defy into all the ecosystem that can then be easily understood by uh people at the moment that are not in the ecosystem um yeah so and probably the first thing i know of is argent i think the argent wallet is probably the closest to this experience but there's still a lot of maintenance like l1 stuff and you kind of gladed over those two right here's an l1 here's an l1 here's now we're in l2 but it's like we had to skip some stuff there yeah yeah yeah and with meta transactions now you know you can you can obstruct the l1 um and the other hope is that um you know with the red business model you can subsidize also the gas uh and with the ap 1559 things probably going to also get better there um but yeah you can subsidize gas and make thing work for free basically um yeah so are you guys going to continue expanding on this and well i'm i'm the only one at the moment yes with all of these things awesome it was a bit of a challenge that i gave myself i say like 10 days let's see what you know if i can do something usable i mean obviously there are massive security holes that still need to be ordered and and and and and fixed but um yeah the idea is like can we build um with the current uh state of of idiom a a monzo or you know like a uh revolut uh in 10 days one person and then can we keep it running and you know what's the opex uh saving a little bit because like monzola sam ejectors 15 1500 people so yeah that's the idea is like we can now build these things with etherium and i think that was somehow you know also part of the promise i mean yeah defy lays the the the foundation of all this what you can do with money markets with even with derivatives and stuff like that but at the end of the day we need to we need to bubble this up to to to to the final user um yeah and uh yeah yeah great great job identifying all the all the existing pieces in the stack and and sort of putting them together um in in a useful way i'm curious um given given more time is there anything else you would have done to make the product more complete or desirable um yeah i mean definitely there is things around um i mean parties is great um and i'm also talking to them i mean there are things around like you know mfa and you know stuff to increase security and also the ux of saving the you know private keys and stuff like that that also argent has done quite good good like a good job there with social recovery um but definitely yes and then um expanding the the offering you know things like uh like pull together with the nice with a nice ui on top could be quite quite quite a good uh you know like uh you know drive for acquisition and then the other big thing is like customer acquisition for me and um we've seen interesting business the interesting way of distributing and you know just i probably shouldn't be telling you this but we've seen interesting ways of distributing apps and and to to acquire customer and although liquidity mining has gone a bit um you know you know it's ending badly some somehow but i think that there is some you know some sort of some some initial uh very very nice dynamic there and my dream is to have users that become owners that's that's that's the dream so like someone like a bit like a uni-swap like someone use the platform and or is also an owner of the platform in a tokenized way so those are yeah those are the areas um yeah that's awesome all the time we have q and for q a thank you for your time thank you very well done yeah great job congratulations thank you thanks thanks thank you all right uh introducing the next team is vega markets explorer if you guys can start sharing so what i'm going to present to you now is my vega markets explorer which is pulling information from the vega decentralized derivatives network and presenting in a way that's useful to traders so we present the information in four different categories the 25 largest open positions the 25 most profitable traders the 25 worst traders and clusters of liquidations so on this page you can see the positions of all of the 25 largest traders you can see the way that they're trading long or short the amount that they're trading the entry price and how much money they've made you can click into a trader when you click into the party view you will be able to see detail about all of the positions and orders that they are executing in the market you can also see the open volume as it changes with time the realized profit and loss and the unrealized problems if we jump back to the home page we can drill into the same view for the 25 most profitable traders and the 25 west traders on the network we can also flick between different markets so here we can look at gbp usd and we can see how this sentiment graph at the top changes and what this graph is showing us is the sentiment in the market for the specific category that you've selected so on this page we can see that the losing traders on gbp usd are massively net short by 40 million contracts to what looks like about 1 million contracts here and if we flick to look at the winning traders on gbp gbpusd what's interesting is we'll see they're doing almost exactly the opposite so you can see that this is giving a really interesting insight into markets that is currently not available when the markets are made up of centralized exchanges and the centralized exchanges keep this information private and essentially keep it to themselves and lastly the final view shows the liquidation prices or the liquidation clusters in the market and this looks a lot like a limit order book uh but it's actually not this is uh showing exactly the opposite of a limit order book we'll look at fusd because it's interesting um as this is a more active market on the network and what this is showing uh is all of the prices at which uh essentially stop losses or liquidations for traders are clustering and this gives us a view of the market that we currently can't see anywhere right now and only centralized exchanges know about and that is a view of where the market is likely to move a lot if it trades at those prices because the participants on the network become under collateralized and so that's everything that i had to show today i hope that you enjoyed it and you can see how this explorer gives some really interesting insights into markets that we currently don't get to see whilst the market is made up of lots of centralized operators awesome that liquidation graph as a just as a primitive is neat right just coming up with that is a cool thing that you you wouldn't have even discovered and now you see that like as the price moves this is what's going to happen and like you said it's like the parting of the say it's just like literally a boom love it yeah i kind of need to overlay it with a liver order book so you can see um how the two interact with each other but i ran out of time so it's so funny just when you have that data you know now that now that it's on a decentralized network in public what and it's exposed to us what can we learn from it and this is neat how you've parsed through it and kind of just tried to learn what you could learn i like it i'm curious actually what what what did you learn by sort of implementing this like what what insights do you do you think are most interesting from looking at the data through your own visualizations yeah so this was like running on a test net right where the against the test network the bots themselves are kind of stupid but what i was really surprised by was the view that i showed in the video where the gbp usd longs and shorts sorry winners and losers were almost exactly oppositely positioned and so you could see that the money that's changing hands or virtual money that's changing hands between the parties they're trading on the network is literally going from the biggest winners to the biggest lose or sorry from the biggest losers to the biggest winners and that quite interesting i was also surprised when i drew the liquidation graph um by like how many uh how much volume was clustering near the mark price um i found that quite interesting that um although it's a test net you know uh the the parties trading on the network were therefore quite under collateralized that was quite interesting as well um so is is vega only on a test now or like why why test now why not yeah yeah this is just they're running on the test that right now okay so i think the maintenance is like probably six six soon but it was interesting nonetheless to explore um you know ways of like getting this data from the process where where did you find yourself spinning your wheels the most here was it getting the data was it just interfacing with the graphs like what was your what i used this question earlier but if you had to go back in time and kind of like give yourself some information or some extra tooling what what would help you to do this again yeah i think like pre-processing the data into a format that was useful to generate like interesting visualizations like it's quite data intensive um yeah it's like a one second block time on the network so there's a lot of information to pass through to generate graphs that are actually useful um there's a whole bunch of network stuff in there that's not really useful for traders and so that's why i kind of pitched it as like an alternative block explorer where it's just pulling out the useful pieces of information to people who are actually trading on the network that you wouldn't normally see on the user interface to an exchange but that actually is there like deep in the network because usually this is kind of it still exists on a centralized exchange but they don't make it public for some of the reasons that i mentioned um whereas on a pseudonymous decentralized network it's unavoidable um but that levels the playing field as well so you're pulling that stuff out was kind of a really interesting thing and finding useful pieces to show where do you see it evolving where do you want to take it do you see things like oh following the top ones like functionality or anything like that yeah i thought a bit about it's like um like it could yeah you could build like customizable views that are interesting for you like maybe you have a way for people to sign up um yeah make it a bit more like social uh but then there's also the other side of things where like just to get the plugging in place to build the visualizations you have to be connected to the nodes and as the network grows um you know that ends up becoming like an engineering challenge in it in of itself um and you look at like the bitcoin block explorers and the ethereum uh projects like infurer and stuff that have had to do that and then they turn this into like a sas product as well so like there's possibly an angle there um so a few different things so that that's the side quest i'd like to see is tape yeah basically go on a tangent and take that liquidation histogram and apply it to uniswap and apply it to some other not not uniform but apply it to some other primitives on mainnet ethereum right now and see if you see what you see right you don't know what you don't know until you get there exactly yeah it's like some of these posts that we've seen online about like the ethereum dark forest and it's like right someone's looked at the real low level stuff but nobody's pulled out and made it visually like available to everybody all right um i'm gonna interrupt that's all the time we have for q a thanks guys thank you awesome work thank you all right so the next team is crypto pair start sharing your screen actually there's a change crypto pair will be scheduled the next team will be blockchain arpg hello uh whoops hello oh there we are oh there we go um cool i'm gonna go ahead and share a window um really quick uh when we were rendering this we had some issues uh would it be okay if i show my slides separately from the video so i have my slides kind of separately from the video um the because i just like one minute just fly through this and then just goes to the video if that's all right um sure thing yeah okay thank you so much we just had some issues all right so blockchain arpg is an interest-bearing esports video game um basically the game i'll explain it in the video too works in a like kind of like a zombie survival game where you're by yourself in this arena with a bunch of waves coming at you and the way the blockchain integrates into this is that we have a liquidity pool uh so we have uh we are using avi to deposit staked entries to a liquidity pool which uh gains interest um and we're using the chain link vrf for random number generation which dictates whether or not the player gets the special item at the end of the level um yeah um so we use a bi-economy usd coin chain link mavic unity for creating the game and audience for royalty-free music future plans uh we just have some future plans to develop more levels make it more of a procedure generated have multiplayer in there improve some key features of course polish it up implement new classes customization and work on the blockchain integration part to make it less expensive for us and make it less expensive for the user and just make things a lot smoother in general so i'm just gonna go ahead and show the video can't hear anything you can't hear it no it's wondering when that royalty free music is from audios yes um let me one second oh just remember to hit that box yeah yeah yeah i forgot i'm sorry there you go everybody this is alfred checker the lead programmer on the blockchain action role playing game project this project is made in unity and is basically a survival game where you are dropped into this area here and you have to survive an onslaught of enemies that show up in waves so right now we're at wave one and um you know there aren't a lot of enemies but they will start walking towards the player and we have to kill them so we have a metal attack we have some we have some range attacks we can use we just use them close range and we killed an enemy here and he drops an item so we pick up the item here we got a long staff that's going to increase our magic damage and that green object there was a health upgrade too so we're going to pick that up here get some health and mana upgrades so the point is to survive as long as you can in these in these waves and kill the enemies to get the items that they drop and the longer you survive you'll get to certain milestones and at five at wave five uh the uh the chain link api is used to generate a verifiable token a verifiable random token that is an nft token and that is possible possible to be acquired by a player when we get to wave 5. wave three we actually have uh power up the spawns here so we're gonna go ahead and pick that up we're gonna try and go around these enemies try and survive kill wave five so we can see if we get the legendary drop for the nmt or if we don't that's completely based on chance so we're gonna go ahead and go into the portal that was up here that will take us to the room uh that will spawn the object and it's wave fives we're gonna go ahead and pick up these power ups we just get some health and mana we're gonna go into this room here unfortunately looks like we just got a random um green item and not a um which was just chainmail and not the legendary nft but yeah that's the game um and if i was lucky i would have gotten that legendary in the nft drop uh through the chain like randomization all right uh yeah that last part is uh just a little extra i i also just quickly just want to show a couple of screenshots for some updated ui that we had so this is the menu that we updated i i like updated like a day after i did the video so my apologies for not being in the video and this is that uh how the character sheet and the inventory ui and this is like a leaderboard at the end uh just uh show like uh people's high scores and just like you know when you die it shows up and then you can restart the game so i just want to quickly show that too uh so yeah yeah it's just a fun place to be experimenting like just being able to play around with but let's let's take unity and bring it in an interest-bearing game and it's storing in ave like i don't completely understand all of it uh again though i mean i remember this was my first blockchain hackathon yeah sorry for introduction right right you're you're a game builder coming in and playing blockchain it's cool that we're finally getting to the point where we have these primitives available for you to plug into or it was like a year and a half ago about we started noticing like hackathon projects started being more about composing tools and and now it's just like i am so blown away with how great all these tools are like even the the chain link vrf came out like a week ago didn't it or something like that yes and you're using it here that's cool uh something else too yeah we didn't know we could update the video when we uploaded it on thursday that's why there's a bit of stuff incomplete and like the slides and the uui we're actually going to update uh upload a new one to the discord later with the metamask integration also shown in the video if that's okay with you guys we just didn't know we could re-upload the video so my apologies for that cool it's a good project yeah thank you so much it's i mean obviously it would take a long time you to to get to that like triple a level game right it's really hard to get there especially with two people yeah exactly yes but it's a this is a fun experiment i'm curious how did you guys um how did you guys just as given this your first hackathon like how did you stumble on on avi and decide to like work that into the gameplay what was this we have a colleague in our lab who's uh who's very much into like blockchain and has entered these hackathons before so we kind of took some advice from him like kind of as an unofficial third member for most of this uh time you know since me and my partner zach are new so we kind of just um uh you know we kind of just like talk to him for like some advice like hey what should we use what kind of links can you share with us that could help us out and he was just kind of pointing us to the right direction we kind of figured things out from there you know giving us some advice um uh but yeah uh so yeah he's just been helping us out on the blockchain part me and zach worked on the game part mostly and integrated all that stuff into it but yeah we'll definitely show the video later with all the stuff in it um yeah and i appreciate all the feedback we were super excited to enter this as our first like big blockchain hackathon and we're very excited to have this opportunity to present to all of you great yeah can you tell us any more about tools other than utility or other than uh the unity unity i know of but what other tools did you use like within the web three likes how do you compile your smart contracts how do you deploy them that kind of stuff uh we use uh uh remix um uh open zeppelin so yeah those are some of the tools that we used um and uh yeah we had them integrated through like webgl and uh that's all we kind of like know about right now we don't really know any other tools to use those are just the ones that we were told to use like hey these will work fine for you and we're like all right excellent just use those uh we are trying to get to know some other tools like truffle but yeah these are the ones that we kind of had time to work on um yeah awesome good good first project guys yeah i want to see you at the next hackathon and then the hackathon after that hopefully you're participating in the ethereum definitely awesome thank you so much guys we appreciate all the feedback thank you austin so yeah i'll be introducing the next thing um next team is optimistic role if you guys can start sharing this thing cool yeah it's optimistic roll in but okay sure don't worry about it i won't take it personally share computer sound here we go hi my name is mike and this is optimistic roland's gaming nfts and randomness on the cheap so the model here is on chain computation and storage is too expensive then just don't do it and what this means for us that we we trust users to be honest about their own state transitions and only use on-chain logic to prove their light and this is effective for single-player game components expensive logical proofs or even making some interesting trade-offs between call data compute and storage costs so the difference between role and roll-ups that we're familiar with in the roll-ins is that rollins are layer agnostic so there's no up just into the same chain users are their own aggregators the only caveat here is that you can only optimistically transition with pure functions so you can't touch world state while you're doing optimistic transactions one interesting thing though is that you can do a whole bunch of offline um state transitions like for example playing a single player game and propose all of your state transitions in one function onto the main net so rollins and roll ups are not mutually exclusive so you can actually have a roll in on a roll up which we'll see later and the basis behind this is dependable merkle trees so you can append to a merkle tree so long as you have the proof of the very last element and this makes it effective to push elements onto an array that really only takes up one storage slot so how this works for optimistic roll and account state is that the account state is made up of the hash of three things the last time you've transitioned optimistically which helps us lock someone in for a certain amount of time before they can exit the current state for that user for their underlying thing for example a game or what not and the call data route and the call data route is a merkle tree of all of the call datas that they would have sent to the pure transition functions so those call datas contain only the starting state but as well as the proposed final state for that transition so everybody's just proposing the states they want to go to with the call data but not actually computing it so what if someone lies what if someone proposes a state that is not possible with that call data well it's very simple then you just have to use that call data to call the underlying function uh and show that it results in a different state transition than what was proposed and there's enough information in every single transaction in optimistic rollins to not only detect fraud but also build the fraud proof so anybody can be a watchtower and hold somebody accountable and there's no need to do expensive indexing of historical transactions and also rolling back is relatively easy so let's get an example what this looks like here so we're running this on matic so this is the example of a rolling on a on a layer two um so we have one transaction that we've made it's a pure state transition which is effectively just hashing the the state hundreds of times and this normally costs 200 000 gas but alex is able to perform this optimistically for way cheaper uh and bob is able to just verify off chain that that is valid and she can do this over and over again she can even create a transaction for 300 000 gas but that is a hundred state transitions and bob's able to verify that immediately as well um eventually she can even try to lie about a state transition and then bob can not only detect that it's fraudulent but eventually even after she builds on her fraudulent state several times bob can lock her account update his fraud proof locally propose a fraud proof collect his reward and force alice to roll back to before she committed that fraud so i had also mentioned before about gaming and nfts so we can actually use optimistic rollins with ver verifiable delay functions in order to um get some randomness that we otherwise couldn't get rather cheap so in this case here alice is going to purchase five packs of cards and when she does this she's going to get a seed which is the block hash but in order to compute what the actual values for those packs are going to be she has to do to verify with lay function and compute a bunch of beacons that she'll eventually propose to the chain and normally these are relatively expensive but still feasible to compute on chain but because we're doing this optimistically she's able to just do this for relatively cheap so in one transaction she's able to not only unpack her card and update her array with 10 new cards but for relatively cheap and she can even unpack four packs of cards in 28 seconds that it takes to compute it off chain uh and then go ahead and optimistically propose that update update her hand with 40 cards and everybody everybody's able to know that you did that verifiably but for incredibly cheap without touching storage um so yeah that's that's optimistic rollins and uh thanks for listening this is such a cool project that being able to build an mvp that uses that kind of stands on the the um the shoulders of hey call data is cheap and we can have fraud proofs let's let's do single player sort of and let's just have you put your own information into the call data and then have other individuals basically activate that fraud proof just like i love building mvps of these kind of things and getting them out there and see how they work uh my i've already given you this feedback millions of times but you need you obviously need to be more active with the really heady dudes like i don't understand the game theory here there there's probably like some great attacks that i don't even know like you need you need vitalik's advice on on where to go with this so my one piece of advice is go to smarter people than me and get more advice well this builds on the idea of optimism which is the same thing as optimistic roll-ups so kind of the same attack vectors exist so i have a lot of existing uh knowledge to work with but not only for single-player games right so even for example applied zero knowledge proofs for um uh for the minimal anti-corruption infrastructure so at one point there's a zero knowledge proof that has happened in batch where the the approver has to accumulate in zero knowledge all of the votes and that's relatively expensive because zkp's are expensive on chain for computation and they can just do that optimistically and save a bunch of gas this way cool i think i need to hook you up with the the dark forest team too didn't we talk at one point yeah i have you on telegram i'll make that connection i'm sorry for being all over the place don't worry i was kind of busy for the last month i bet you were good job this is great that's gonna work thank you go ahead savannah you go um i was just gonna say is it just you or who else is on your team oh we're a team of four uh so it's myself richard sammy and steph um all working different components here but yeah and all was this your first hackathon third fourth time i mean we've been doing blockchain for a while now but uh this is our second on the previous one was hack fs uh but we we really like ethereum and and and building something that was was obviously upper alley you've got the bug now good yeah good go ahead so a lot a lot of this is above my my pre pay grade but i'm curious from your perspective what's what's the biggest open challenge in in this project right now and i may not understand the answer but i'm curious to hear your view on it the open challenge is that you people who want to make games they have to find a way to reduce the user state to both one 132 byte object which is not hard if you're using miracle proofs merkle trees but also um they have to have to manage their game in a way where user transitions don't touch world state so let's say i'm playing pokemon i have to be able to um find a pokemon catch it uh and update my my state without having to look at any of the values on the blockchain like what the current number of pokemon are and all that kind of stuff um so it's and it's possible definitely like single-player games do this so it's not that hard um but that's one challenge that has to be done is you have to change the mindset of game developers there's also another way of using uh sub vector commitments um which allow you to touch world state but they're way more complicated um so that's another opportunity here as well yeah i i i just to add to that i love how as these new mechanisms and technologies come out it's funny how the builder has to change their mindset and learn these new things and and almost like something new is discovered here and like this becomes like a new kind of info like a new like way of doing things like oh what if we dark forest is a good example of that like how how can we craft a game around these constraints and and you know the neat things that come out of this so it's good work good keep it good um it's a good practice software development to build on pure functions since it makes a lot easier to test things so even if this is a change in mindset for current people who are building things um it's still a good thing to do in general um so yeah just any any pure state transition is a lot easier to manage and if this and if this creates that good behavior or that then it's then it's obviously positive good work i'll reach out on telegram too awesome all right thanks for your time thank you guys bye guys thanks all right so the next team is darth vega if you guys can start sharing [Music] hi andre hello charlie uh do you want to tell me a bit about who you are my name is andre i do a bunch of open source things i do work a few on a few uh ethereum projects like like vip node uh and i participated in the east global hackathon to mess around with some ethereum adjacent infrastructure with my friend charlie here laundry hi charlie what about you charlie do you want to tell me a little about yourself yeah my name is charlie morris i run a company called cmcc global and i love dabbling in bits of bits and pieces and ethereum and then other blockchain projects um and when i knew that youth global was happening i just couldn't help myself but to team up with andre and have a bit of fun so andre what is darth vega so basically we wanted to play around with the vega api and we're looking for excuses to use a few other interesting javascript libraries like uh tone js and svelte and this is kind of a mashup of all those things so essentially we built a block mining visualizer uh each of these little car things represents a new block that's being mined and the width of the block represents the number of transactions happening in there and then we also have a little tree uh do you want to tell us about that yeah so um you know andre and i well we enjoy visuals we're mainly audio people um and we wanted to be able to literally groove to the sound of trades being made but not we didn't want to groove just any tunes in particular we're big fans of star wars and so we wanted to groove to the sound of the imperial march so here is the sound of vega to the notes of the imperial march [Music] so each lane represents a note and because we're visualizing the blocks coming in uh they don't always hit the notes in the right sequence but every once in a while they do and it really nails it every time we get the three notes in a row i get really excited excellent so yeah this is kind of a beginning of a project we have a bunch of ideas for what more we could add to it uh make it kind of more of an interactive block explorer uh especially once the vague ipa launches add more metadata about the the real transactions happening but you have any other ideas charlie i mean i'd love to i'd love to just expand this uh both across multiple chains um obviously there's all sorts of things we could do with visualizations with different sounds i mean we could we could set this to all sorts of tracks um you know this this would be basically a blockchain generated symphony that's true and all this is up on github uh it's mit license people are welcome to look at the code and mess with it are we also going to have a live version at a url that's right so we'll we'll send that through um cool it's been a pleasure that's it thank you vega cheers [Music] that was awesome i i actually i actually have a playlist um that i've i've created manually it's called um sounds sounds of the blockchain which is a bunch of songs that you know are what i imagine consensus would sound like um but now i don't have to imagine it anymore which is great nice um yeah guys yeah as we said it's kind of kind of a um a bit of kind of a a silly thing but also kind of unique i think it's quite difficult to understand or to visualize how blockchains are working and so something just a little bit different about audio we thought would be a bit of fun right yeah somebody needs to set up the rug yeah like something something happening on chain that would just like for empire the rug poll would be a good time to play the empire yeah just just have it on the background and then every now and then just something dramatic happens and you get really deeply alerted so i think fun space to explore andre's supposed to be on here as well but he's not so i don't know yeah hi oh there you are so what are the other ideas because i know that you mentioned there are other ideas that you guys have in terms of where this could go obviously different tunes different kind of genres i could maybe do meditation to blockchain activity meditate to the blockchain interesting ian that would be very you know meta to be fair i would enjoy that but yeah what what else of you guys andre doing again yeah i mean so originally our plan was to directly link the transactions happening on chain to notes and we did that but because it's still not real transactions right now it kind of created a lot of repeating chaos that wasn't very enjoyable which is actually kind of an interesting way to visualize because it was noticeable that the data wasn't real uh in many ways so uh we're kind of want to see what is what it'll be like on a main net uh and it would be ideal to really to really so what we did we ended up doing we limited the notes to a few different lanes so it would always hit some kind of melody but it'd be nice to expand it further back to really relating the notes to what the underlying data means uh and not using real data uh so that's one idea we would really like to explore yeah and also also if we if we linked in multiple chains it would really show the difference between how different chains operate so you know obviously ethereum right now you'd have one note every 14 seconds which wouldn't be very interesting um but you know then that's obviously going to change you know when we go to e2 and i just think yeah you do all sorts of things um just in terms of kind of already order audibly visualizing yeah like for example every block could be like a little melody that'll play during the duration of the mining interval as an example interesting you know what this also reminds me of um i don't know if you guys have ever seen they used to do it at events a lot alessio used to have their little block explorer thing and it was all lights combine the two and like do a vegas fountain show situation how about nft ownership i like if we could how about there's like a certain time period where the chain created some kind of really neat sequence and like you own the sequence from the dow hack right or something like that where you you can have that nft now kind of like doubling down on the on the metaness and the the artisticness here that would be fun the block is mined and nobody hears it did it even exist how long have you been saving that the format the format of this whole presentation was wonderful good job guys i think that that's definitely a hat tip to the format where you guys interviewed each other on the zoom that was neat yeah very well done very well done super fun i also love the what the hell is going on button i feel not enough projects have that on so yeah great work look forward to to more yeah next hack about you guys better be there yeah yeah so that about wraps up this q a um so now we will be entering a 10 minute break uh judges feel free to turn off your camera um go on mute and get a quick snack um we'll be recompening at 208 and yeah the next team will be clash of years all right see you guys there thanks guys thanks guys you all right we're just waiting on a few more people so stand all right andy if you're uh if you're good to go let's restart um shouldn't we wait for um simona yeah she's here oh okay i'm hearing me camera okay um so yeah the next team uh is clash of gears if you guys could start sharing the screen don't you ask no no audio sorry um we can't hear any audio could you reshare with the audio clipped or toggled yep just want to have any research we are all awake hi my name is sean hello everyone my name is irvin we are building the crush of ears so clasher here is literally just taking nfts from the virtual world and put them in the physical world where the nfts of a robot can be represented as an actual real life robot and so similar to pull together where you essentially stake and enter into some into a tournament so we're gonna go ahead and authenticate with audios because music really plays a key role the user experience of a game or any kind of event and it'd be really cool to kind of share these tracks or play some of your favorite tracks while you're playing a game so as soon as this loads up we can go ahead and connect to metamask servers already already connected so let me disconnect really quick then try to connect again okay [Music] and so just for the the purpose of this demo we're going to go ahead and start and stay 10 cents so we're going to go ahead and and do an eap 712 so we're going to sign sign that message and then we're going to use viconomy or to perform a meta transaction so we go ahead and sign it again so i have to click approve so once we signed that message uh the economy is just going to go ahead and send send that transaction transaction out if you go ahead and check it out actually and matic maddox explorer actually let me just go ahead and stake and i can take a look at that transaction okay so this is a dichotomy message signature so go ahead and check out the transaction hash i can go ahead and take that and look it up on automatic just to make sure the transaction went through to verify for you guys and yep there you go it was successful a few seconds ago so i can go ahead and uh and join so it seems like the page has already loaded and so the one of the key things here is that you could actually play this game virtually so where you're fighting these robots and our virtual arena or you can even go and play them in a physical tournament so this is what sort of the test arena would look like so being able to control these sort of robots and so now these robots have different strengths different different capabilities and even different different physical forms and we developed this little robot to be modular so essentially we could fit different kinds of weapons so let's go ahead and enter the online match and we already defined an actual match id we're going to call it a ethon line so as soon as i join that's that's me right there so i have to wait for sean to join in and the match will begin it'll start streaming all right so this is um one of the matches that we actually were we're taking place so just let me i'm fast forwarding the video right now uh yeah a lot of things went wrong honestly with these robots especially when when the robots flipped over um there's there's an imu sensor that's supposed to go off and trigger our smart contracts but sometimes the actual sensors move around moved around and that actually attacked when the robot had flipped so so really behind the scenes is just like any other kind of nft uh game where you have your avatar in this case it's a robot and you get to fight these robots and power them up you know their face face each other in a one-on-one arena now the difference is that we really want to be able to represent these robots in the physical world so those little robots are running raspberry pis and they were to pull the properties from the nfts that the the actual user holds and so if the the user has a an empty robot that has a strength of 100 right it's more powerful than the one that that has a strength of 50 overall so the robots themselves can communicate with the smart contracts and we're using chain link to match our starting of the tournaments and also random factors within the online arena so we think it's really cool because essentially we're transferring the the virtual world onto the physical world and also allowing people from across the world to kind of join and be able to fight and interact with these robots so which i think is pretty fun and it's also a no-loss game so essentially the price is just the interest earned on on the pool itself for future work we really want to release the first generation of these robot fighter nfts and we're designing the models of the robots to kind of match those also in the virtual game and we really want to open source our actual robots so we made these robots modular and also some of the the software that returned the nfts and additionally i think when we implement this game we would like to add a tipping functionality after tournament so we get to tip artists from audience whose songs were playing during the tournament and also another interesting thing that we were thinking was gas tipping so essentially part of the price itself could go towards um towards gas for future games so thank you awesome i feel like there should always be a prize for whoever incorporates the most amount of sponsorship prizes like there should be like around the house prize where you you picked up you tip you checked all the bosses with with that in mind this might be a little bit too complicated and you might be trying to do like way too many things at once it's really i mean it you really did take a lot of boxes though uh one would be like meta transactions worse having to be on boarded but there's there's kind of a the reason why you would use a meta transaction is because they don't even know about ethereum yet and they're just getting in but in this case they're also happy they have to deposit into ave right so maybe the meta transaction isn't that important but you're you're ticking off some of the boxes again i'd probably carve out some of the complexities there and just go with one or the other and then i mean i love that it's like it's geomorphic like the way you put the breadboards into the 3d but then it's actually in the real world like i it's it's again it's confusing because there's a lot of things going on but like you could pick any one of those things and they would make a great hackathon project so i guess in total it makes a great hackathon project and it goes around the world for sponsorship prizes but good work and again i said this a lot this is a great place to be experimenting playing around with how the physical world meets and how gaming works and the the no loss kind of staking and and uh the game mechanics behind that so great job great hackathon project guys i hope to see you continue this and other projects on ethereum see one of the interesting things that i was thinking about with all of these very different things plugged in is you can potentially have like baby robot things that just do like very basic things and then you graduate into like bigger more complex robot making things like i would see the little robots once you get to a certain level sold at christmas as like a learning tool for kids or whomever to kind of start learning about these things and then you progress and you do the audio thing and you do the staking and you do all sorts of crazy no definitely i think we're thinking initially is because a lot of the games that are nft based are sort of not interactive so i think it's quite just you won't think about the metaverse and how the physical and virtual world could meet definitely um but yeah i'm more i'm aware of what you guys are saying definitely yeah i i love the creativity here and i think like as it it it points to a future that i think we're definitely gonna live in and it actually reminds me a little bit of of like the theory the original ethereum white paper where like it's you know a car is described driving itself autonomously and like paying the repair man to fix it so like the interaction of the physical world as controlled by smart contracts i think is a super interesting direction to to play with and and yeah you know what better place to start than robot wars so um yeah i think it's yeah it's a super creative idea um and fun hack that's a fun theme that we're seeing here too is kind of some of the the high ambitions of the white paper and the yellow paper in terms of use cases actually starting to get applied closer and closer to the real world uh with each new hackathon that happens so i i hope to see you guys here and i want to see you guys do next also yeah um that's all the time we have for q a thank you guys thanks guys great work guys thank you okay so the next team is flashbang if you guys could start sharing your screen um there currently isn't any audio if you could re-share with audio enabled hey everyone we are team xyz and today we are here to present flashbang which is basically a set of smart contracts that are built on top of compound protocol that allow people to supply assets uh for other people to take flash loans from so compound is one of the biggest d5 protocols it has almost a billion dollar worth of assets logged but all of these assets are not available for flash loans like uh other protocols provide like away and unison so using compounds dedicated borrowing feature we have built flashbang on top of compound that allows you to deposit c tokens over here and then any anyone can come in and take out the die as a flashlight from your c tokens and you can get a sweet 0.03 piece from that so let's start with a quick demo so i have some dye in my wallet and some youth in my wallet uh and i'm going to supply five die to compound protocol it's offering me a nice 19.42 percent apy i'm going to be h uh sending a transaction to supply we are on proven so it takes four seconds for a block hopefully we'll get in the next one it seems like we did yeah so we have 212 c die tokens and let's deposit just one c die token let's do a quick approve so so we have like a big apy number but it's just because the logged assets are very small this whole contacts are deployed on govern the these these earnings from our from when we were testing these contracts uh this is the pool fee that we have decided for now but this might change later uh the tokens have been approved let's do a quick deposit as soon as the tokens are deposited you'll you'll have some lp shares and you can easily withdraw those lp shares at any point of time let's try taking a flash loan and see this whole protocol on fees for people who supply c tokens let's take a quick flash loan so what it does internally is it just uh takes a flash loan and gives some fees but people could plug in any arbitrary contact logic as as it works with unisoft flash swaps and rvs flash names let's wait for this transaction to go through the current earnings were 0.0808 and they have been up updated let's see the fees on ether scan yeah so this is the fees received on the protocol yeah so this is just like a light wrapper on top of compound that allows people to use their c c tokens and on uh without any security implications we also intend on sending the form a formal governance uh proposal to compound to integrate flash loans natively we have used compound obviously chain link and pocket network to build this whole app quickly thank you guys for hearing us i think this is like uh this is a blueprint for how simple your hackathon project should be you guys are perfectly focused on one little piece here you're saying what we want to do is give a third party the ability to lock up their tokens to lend those out to other people you provide a nice clean interface this is like this is exactly the kind of thing that comes out of a hackathon that becomes very useful and other people use because you focus perfectly on just the product and what it needs to do and and it looks like it does that thing very well it was it's kind of like the back in the day of the moloch where amin was talking about i want this thing to be very forkable i want someone to be able to take this and just apply it to any token or whatever and i would love to see three other groups take what you guys have done here and apply it to different uh tokens and different settings but fantastic work this is a great hackathon project thank you great super simple super effective um and yeah i would love to see it apply to to other tokens as well for the protocols but yeah great work yeah i agree i also i love the attention to detail on the user interface is just super you know super clean and intuitive and and i feel like that doesn't often doesn't get enough love that's a an afterthought for a lot of hackathon projects but it makes it very clear you know what the value proposition is so i i like the you know the emphasis there thank you so much just to double down on that i would love to see like the developer experience here right you're talking about once they have the flash loan there's gonna there's basically like a little basically a little chunk of solidity where they're allowed to do anything with that flash loan set that up for a developer let them npm install this thing and set what their token is and set what they want to do there's you know for for the developer who wants to take the flash loan for the developer that wants to set up the platform make this like npm install and you'll see a lot of other people use it in the next hackathon definitely thank you so much ev everyone for your sessions where where do you guys think where do you think you take it from here so the next step for us is creating a compound proposal uh sending a power for native integration because the flash down layer should be as close to the assets as possible we also were thinking about adding adding this uh to here but yeah that that will be later down the lane and it it was just very evident to us that something like flashlight and flash mints should be a part of the d5 stack and they would ideally harden up all the other protocols to like boost up on their secure papers like we have seen today with harvest so yeah that's the next thing very cool thanks guys thank you yep good work i hope to see this as a primitive get get this out and get clean up the github get it very affordable like like think about the developers thanks guys thanks all right so the next team is you may begin sharing your screen [Music] okay before i begin i just wanted to say so since this is a hackathon it played around with a ton of different sponsored technologies that were all awesome oh no don't play yet um some were familiar somewhere um but i made sure to use them strategically and you know to basically do it for both application and user experience the core of this project is basically to use erc721 tokens to sell and create physical items a trend that i hope will continue in the future hello everyone i'm derek and this is crypto care a decentralized online marketplace the current model that digital marketplace is used doesn't provide enough liquidity or security for users there are many scams and many items go buried underneath different posts in the classified section both of these are iphone xs but they become but they can be sold or bid at different prices the price that you bid at will basically determine how quickly your item can be sold much like a regular ethereum token on any exchange furthermore i came up with the idea based off of the success of 2017's crypto kitties to represent these online items as non-fungible tokens given that in many of the same cases they can be exactly the same but represented at different prices because you know there are unique things about them maybe they're you know in poor condition you know maybe it was signed by someone's famous so during online i used many sponsored technologies to put together a system that would help me make an efficient online trading platform as you can see here there's a deeply projector for sale for 71 dollars if user would like you they could buy it and they would own that token sorry about that [Music] all right so this is the uh the live demo so let's jump into a live demo so the idea is to be able to you know have categories to buy and sell things on the side but the functionality that i implemented this weekend is the ability to upload and sell nfts as you can see here there's a deeply projector for sell for 71 dollars if user would like to they could buy it and they would own that token here a user can [Music] login a user could buy this dp projector for 71 dollars which is represented as an nft token or upload an item of their choosing i would like to sell an iphone x i'm going to sell this iphone x 256 gig phone for 900 and idiot dollars exposed to the marketplace and now i have to wait for someone to buy it additionally you can make direct trades with people who you've added to your address book using their ems address so if i want to trade with alice i can initiate the reach contract and basically that's where my code blew up all right so um any questions this is a pretty hard problem to tackle sort of the physical world and the digital world and how those collide and how you can do that in a decentralized way i it's a theme of mine saying this but i i think it's a cool place to be exploring and i think one thing that you could do is just try to get it into other humans hands and see how they use it you know bootstrap some very like local setup and see how you know a few people trade back and forth and see how it works out and see what you learn and then kind of build on that knowledge as you go yeah i definitely think the local like testing it out and and seeing and getting that user feedback and potentially seeing where you find real bottlenecks or real just no-go areas will help you tremendously to not go too far into the build without um you know getting that real world feedback i think this is a particularly important one for that real world feedback yeah i i really like the the idea i agree i agree with um with others are saying here about sort of like you know it being a hard thing to tackle the real world being messy and but um but you know one one thought that came to mind a project that's been around you know since before ethereum even existed is open bizarre and you know they they're trying to tackle this problem of you know physical goods and and market markets for those goods in a decentralized context and it's interesting because they have their own standard for um you know for creating listings which is basically like a canonical id with some metadata hooked to it and that's you know that's kind of what an nft is so i think that that instinct is right which is you know let's take this you know the standard way of um of of you know associating a canonical id with metadata and broaden the scope from you know like cryptokitties to like physical things i think that's likely the form it will take um but and and then yeah the question is you know what to whom is that an advantage and i would say maybe it's an advantage to developers um because you know developers can can use um that standard to build their own marketplace so that might just be a slight shift in thinking about um about the project but i really like that kernel of an idea that you have here that's a good point as you take on an ambitious project you do find these little missing points that and then maybe just that standard could be something how a physical good is tracked as an nft if that standard is is needed in ethereum maybe that's another good place to explore yeah there's definitely a lot of marketplaces emerging and i think i think the nft space needs a standard anyway so i think the the whole dynamic of coming up with something with a functionality or a piece that is modular that can be plugged into other marketplaces would be an interesting would be an interesting piece that maybe wouldn't be as complex as the full user-facing piece which is the trickiest bit of it all right now really okay and maybe have a little chat to um existing marketplaces um who can we think of in the in the ethereum space um well i would start by talking to the existing nft marketplaces and then and then you know open bazaar and and the others that are trying to tackle physical goods uh foundation and zora have done physical goods as well all right that's it yes um dora meta factory have also done it have a look at those guys and maybe just ping them and have a chat to them and see hey is there are there pain points what are you doing right now with regards to to this representation okay all right yeah that's everything for q a thank you for your time thank you thank you derek okay so the next team uh is called hsm swap if you guys could share your screen we get to start hmm swap are you guys there i think we may have lost them i just promoted them stand by everyone well this is a little tragic okay we did lose them from the call but um we're gonna reschedule i'm gonna do a verbal for the next team the next team is going to be plantary you guys could raise your hands you'll be promoted right okay plantar you can start your screen share um whenever you're ready thanks now my other team members about to join here please hello there she is plan 3 is a smart contract to mint nfts it's built with rust for the near blockchain and it's a mix of a game and an art collecting platform the first type of nft you can bind with the game are the plants and each plant is an artwork we offer several types of plants one of them is for example the portrait plant we also offer an oracle plant a money plant a insole plant complement plants and we will release several new types of plants as the game develops so let's mean to plant i'm gonna connect here to my near wallet plant lover i just created this for the demo and now i can go and choose a portrait plant right now you can only mint a random plan so you don't know which art war you're going to get but in the future i think we'll be able to pay more maybe and choose a specific artist so right now we'll get a random plant i pay a fee of 20 near and here is my plant each plant has a dna and that will have an influence on the harvest you can get from the plant the portrait plant will let you harvest portraits and they could be just ai generated portraits but can also be a special one created by the same artist who created the plant or the oracle plan can give you some random fortune but can also use it to harvest a special personalized reading done by the same artist who created the plant let's mint a harvest from this plant i pay now a small fee to harvest an nft from my portoid plant and here it is so here i clicked and harvest a bit more portraits and finally i got the portrait created by the artist and it's called dennis so this will be more valuable each hard space will have like a different rarity and other characteristics that you will be able to then sell or trade them and collect them just like trading cards we started working on this project last month so it's built on previous work we started with a bare bone rust contract that you could interact using just the command line so for eth online these past weeks we developed this contract a lot more we basically refactored the nft implementation the fetch methods we scratched several bugs we added a lot of artwork to the pool thanks a lot to the crypto artists who submitted we also created this react front end that i'm using now in this demo and now you can mint both plants and harvest plus display the nfts in your wallet we still have a lot of go but it's taking shape and it's been a great way to learn rust and get familiar with near in the future we hope to be able to program also the ability to breed plants and of course to be able to trade and sell them in the market so that was our demo thanks a lot great job super cool um it reminds me of uh there was a project in like 2017 i think that um tied actual physical plants um that were growing in in in some lab with a webcam on them uh to nfts this is obviously a very very different idea but um there's some some perils and it's it's very cool um you know to have these sort of dynamic art art pieces that are collectible um so i i really like the the direction you're exploring yeah um are the things that you harvest then are they pretty random is that the idea well you can choose basically right now you can only choose a random harvest but you might be able also to pay some extra for a specific harvest we we don't know exactly yet for sure the plants you will be able to pay more to get the specific artists who created the plant and you might be able also to select a specific harvest but i actually really like the random part because it's you know it's kind of more fun it's like a surprise you don't know we're gonna get so we might leave it just a random we don't know yet yeah i like the randomness element and maybe you could even gift it to somebody and then just you know the gift that keeps on giving where they could just continuously interact with it and produce other random and potentially really really valuable pieces out of it very interesting the the breeding is really and i know that's not completely implemented now but it looks like the gan you know like began ai images where they're like mixing things it looks just like a gan like you could do that breeding that wouldn't be on chain but that's it's a fun thing to see and this is this is kind of a weird thing but a lot of the art projects on ethereum are kind of like nerd first art second and i love like the the art first aspect of this and and true like artistic-ness that that goes into this so uh what whatever it is wherever you go from here stick with ethereum and stay around and keep keep building on blockchain maybe the maybe the ethereum question is there i noticed this is on near does it does it bridge to ethereum or how does that work do the nfts breach once they're hopefully they they will eventually because basically the near nfts are super brand new so it's really one of the first uh projects that you know quite challenging to be working with but um the bridge they're already working on the bridge for nft is not there yet but i i think pretty soon it will be totally possible to to bridge and and switch them between chains yeah because right now can only do erc20s and then i think is moving over to well not moving over but also doing um near as well so yeah that'll be an interesting one yeah i think i there is someone already like starting to build a bridge but it is really really in the beginning it's not like fully usable yet but hopefully soon and also for the the breeding uh you know there are also possibilities for example if you breed plants from different artists and they are up for it you know it could be a collaboration between two artists that can result from such breeding things like that we really want to work a lot with artists and and give them a lot of like space to really propose things and and new crazy ideas for plants and harvests and mixes they're off you know it's fun just the exploration there's so much emergence that can come out of that sorry simona go ahead i was just gonna say um a project that would i think um like have a chat to min base they were definitely working on that um bridge for nfts but also the data project i feel it's something that they would be really really up for uh potentially because they're really into like i can just see these collaborations between artists and then you maybe have an auction that basically merges the different work actually from from the plants that we show like two of the artists that the contributors are data artists it's their job for sure so yeah um have a chat to them um let me know if you want me to to introduce you to the data team or anything like that to continue the conversation but very interesting and yeah great work okay and what about just like you're you cool that's folks yeah thank you for your time please stick around keep getting building please keep building thanks all right thanks guys thank you so the next team is hsm swap hopefully this time around they'll be able to share screen so is little concept is to work a new security for the user so problem with blockchain is how you handle your private key so you can handle them yourself in your browser wallets like metamask or hsm key like ledger they are not quite easy to use and still complicate for the user to keep safe with this kind of tool and all the exact level security issues using you can keep the private key on the cloud but if you use any cloud company you don't really trust them and if you use big exchange after you go under regulation and they still scan and exchange the developed actually so one of the solution is to use the same as bank using i mean hsm hardware security module that is kind of really secure server and to use certified codes linked to the blockchain that is injected to the hsm so we make sure that what's happening inside the hsm is safe your private key it's keep secure and everything you do on it it's private and only you can decide what you are doing so technical problem with hsn it's hsn there are only a low level c codes that need to be optimized for the hsm so when i start working it finds poor documentation on ethereum for level cryptographic functions that i use eventually yellow paper is missing some parts there is not much heat room celebrity that you can use and they use non-standard crypto encoding uh like for example using a fix k parameter for pcbsr using kitkat hash instead of the standard it's just free and using rpl seriation it's quite unique i think foreign er so what i have working on uh trying to handle transaction in c directly uh so i have implemented a kitkat hash in c i have implemented the rpm coding i fight a lot with the ecd assassin yet with this kind of strange k and v parameter and i connect it to the blockchain uh using interapi to send the transaction that i've created i want it to work more uh and call and default control call to work with the sponsor of the caton that didn't get the time so the scenario is quite simple it generates locally okay i get a wallet from it i send is from my metabase wallet to this wallet i display the balance create the transaction and process the transaction so i did not have time to really finish what i wanted to do but okay and say uh i mean one transaction have passed first year so that was this transaction that i sent before but most of the transactions get failed for now i will probably as a time this weekend to fix this problem enough a more stable app thank you wow that's a lot like having to oh i gotcha can you hear me we good it seems like very complicated one of those like again this is probably over my head it seems like you we need to connect you with some of the lower level guys that understand this stuff a little bit better but if you're you're rewriting the ketchup library and see and that doesn't exist yet it's like oh man like we we as an ecosystem should do a better job or have something more better available or something but uh very it seems like this was a very highly technical thing to to tackle not just the lower level libraries but bringing them all together and being able to send transactions and and do wallet-like things so uh first of all i don't i don't know exactly who to connect you to with yet let's hear what these other folks say but we should we need to connect connect you with other uh technical people within the ecosystem to make sure you're not operating kind of in the dark make sure we we get some you know your work can get some light on your work yeah a hundred percent so my um straight off the bat suggestion would be corey from status on our side um he heads up security and privacy so he will be the person to chat to and i'm more than happy to to um get you guys in touch so that you can have those conversations around i mean we're our primary focus is privacy so i will definitely put you in touch with corey so you guys can can have a chat jesse you're muted sorry i'm glad you noted a lot of the challenges you were having you know and and and you know the blockers obviously it's a it's a really tough problem to tackle in the span of a hackathon but i'm curious besides the the challenges that you have like what what was what were the fun parts for you working on this and and you know for others that might be interested in this problem like you know how would you get them excited about it what was fun about working on this actually working on low levels the thing with ethereum i was i think first it was more simple but when i started implementing it i'd figure out that there was some little parameters that i need to change that was not standard in cryptographic function so mostly in c iterable stuff use the bitcoins leap crypto that work quite well but it cannot be translated directly to a system you have to work fine work around and find how can i uh get information how people have implemented in the past and and stuff like this so it's kind of i don't know it's kind of a game when you are looking for for something to work and when it actually work at the end it's kind of like big sex because you put a lot of effort on it so uh and so i've i've been able to to make it working a bit better this weekend so now i only have one transaction out of two that is not passing it was a bit better but it's still not stable so i need i need to fight out more on this low cryptographic for it another good step forward might be uh finding something within this setup that could use a second hackathon and and maybe even writing a grant proposal for that thing document the problem and let's get it in front of some other people and see if we can pull you into the space a little bit tighter yeah yeah i i have a lot of projects to build on top of it because when you be able to lock asset into an hsm you can decide we own it you can make exchange within the hsm it can be that like a lot of things going on inside of it but first i need to be able to validate transaction as basic signature and stuff like this so that's the first step this academy and i hope for the next category when this one will be working i will be able to build more interesting user-friendly application and just leaning into this don't stay in the dark get up talk to other people make sure you're communicating with other people in the space there's a lot of smart folks around a hundred percent yeah yeah so that's all the time for q a good hackathon project okay great job thanks all right so the last team that we have is called co-op game if you guys could start sharing your screen hi everyone i'm here to present co-op blockchain economy based 3d world games and this is a submission for eat online october hackathon 2020 and the team for same is myself sir and with me nick loki some of the fundamentals you want to keep is d5 like ease decentralized economy and no financial entry barrier but if you do answering transaction you'll get an edge or ability current prototype what we have is a level we call happy make phase deathmatch inside co-op it's a simple mechanic where players can send funds to a pool for a round which gives them ability in this case its armor and your deathmatch peep you and then it takes all so let's jump to the demo so we have a server here running on the cloud and i've opened up a instance as a player we connect to the server and we connect our ethereum account so this registered our public address as our player id and i've done the same for two more players over here now any player can start the queue and between this queue players can send funds to the server pool to obtain an ability using els to make things easier and we are going to send 0.55 ether so one ether is hundred ability 0.55 ether is 55 ability it's also weight proof in sense if you send more than one ether you'll only get 100 ability transaction has been included in the block 216 nrq inside clock and seven as we can see the player who made the transaction has 55 percent of ability which is our and now we did match also notice the price pool on the top is 0.55 meter and our player id with zero three one one has one a price pool of 0.55 ether and on the server we can see a transaction has been initiated of 0.55 meter which has been sent to the winner and we can confirm it on ether scan so what's happening there is we have d5 wallet which sends the public address playwright in the game engine and they initiate transaction on the blockchain the game engineers the data from the blockchain and it assigns player properties accordingly which everything happens on a multiplayer cloud server so how the current pool fund management happening is there is a server wallet which is the price pool first to the server wallet in future i would like to explore it more towards making it into a smart contract there are some technical infant departmental problems which needs to be explored there you can check it out and it's ready to play at coop.embracing.space just a fun hackathon project and in future maybe this can be expanded towards having different stages where players are competing to solve a puzzle or when and maybe they get an nft on winning so gameplay itself becomes like a farm of your distribution of this coin that ability gives you an edge of getting this this can be used to burn and create in-game items which are different nfts itself like vehicles armor stuff like that creating a secondary strategic marketplace there was also this idea of if you are using certain protocols according to it and levels in it you can have different player skills which think a diverse range of strategies to choose from this also enables clients and teams so that was it it was a very fun project a very fun hackathon and thanks for listening check it out have fun tip match your meme game is strong i feel like you you led with a good meme game and that's important i feel like that's an important part of any hackathon project this uh this idea of like interest bearing games and even this whole we have this really cool game built in unity but what what's important about it is is how the the interaction happens on the blockchain leads me to this this could maybe be a good product in itself no no game aside but creating the the package for unity that then all these other aaa developers could just plug this in and have okay now it's an interest death match right like that that and then you know a million other primitives that could they could have ave as the back back end also but the the idea here of we've seen some some okay games like that game would be fun to play it would be fun don't get me wrong but there there's also like these aaa developers out here that are building these games that have no way of connecting to blockchain you happen to have the knowledge of both sides if you could build that plug-in in the middle that that could be a product in itself yeah so that was my question initial question how you can have big open world games exist on the blockchain and what i found was maybe putting like all the logic on the blockchain of games like gta skyrim it's not something feasible or we don't even want to do that so maybe intertwine the game so much with the blockchain that it ceases to exist with the blockchain and you can have different apis reading every checkpoints and stuff like that yeah exactly you're not gonna have movement and everything on chain right but if you could set up a service itself that lets some some on-chain element check in with your server to see if they're at a certain location or check in to see who won and maybe there could be multiple servers that are signing things like you could add some decentralization to it but i i really like the the primitive here of let's let's make uh interest bearing games a plug-in for unity and all of these developers can just grab that and throw that in as part of their their setup that that sounds fun to me too but great great hackathon project and a fun place to explore it was it was very cool was this your first one or yes this was my first chapter oh my god awesome yeah it i i i also really like this space because yeah it pulls together a lot of different disciplines um and yeah it's austin's point i think really zeroing in on on what's new and different here um would be you know it's too much and in the scope of a hackathon to invent an entirely new game and make it like completely awesome but you could potentially in a follow-up make the the primitive of interest-bearing games like extremely simple for developers to integrate um so now that you sort of scoped out the territory yourself like that may be an area to to push forward um i guess i'm curious um you know what what was the biggest learning for you given this your first ethereum hackathon so i think what i wanted to have was a meta mask kind of login and the d5 kind of experience so just getting that player id through html and then putting it on the server and reading the data from the blockchain comparing it with that player id and assigning the properties and just automating the whole process together there was one cool neat yeah what what kind of tools do you use did you have to deploy any of your own smart contracts no currently no it's just using ether scan api it's using any ethereum inside unity and do interior see yourself participating in the next hackathon are you gonna stick around awesome i can't wait to see hit me up if we can help with anything too that's kind of why we're here too as mentors i'm i'm austin griffith on twitter so ping me if i can connect you with anyone or if there's something that's interesting yep yes i'm here all right yeah so that's uh that's everything for a q a thank you thanks one that is the last theme um just a quick note to the judges you may see that there are two other teams maybe in your list not your keys not your crypto and while it was miscellaneous change so those are all the teams we've just completed okay hopefully i have not frozen i think i kind of messed up some of that but we're good we completed them is that what you said i'm sorry we're good yes we're good awesome great thank you all to the judges jessie simona and austin thank you andy for keeping time great set of hacks that's a wrap for this session goodbye everyone i'd love to see how these projects are getting better and better yeah the summit's this friday october 30th summit and finale october everyone see you guys i'll have my bow tie
