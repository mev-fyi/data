all right everyone i'm gonna wait a minute or two as more people join welcome welcome welcome you are at the right place if you were trying to get to the hack feedback session three demo feedback i'm about to post in the chat here in zoom the um ad hoc sign up sheet so if you want to um get some feedback just go into that with the name of your project um and you might hear this message repeated because people are joining as we go um thank you all all right we have more people joining this is our hack feedback session you're here joined by uh several people who are going to offer some feedback um we have marius vanderwijon who's one of our he's volunteered to be one of our tech mentors you may have seen him in the chats um we have luke bateman on the east global team and we have nicolas santoni everyone say hello hey hello hello guys hey guys hello um we're going to keep this pretty informal my job is to sort of keep things on time roughly but we do want you guys to get some some good feedback you have the option of you know sharing screen and trying to walk through your demo if it's ready or if it's partially ready or if you just want to talk about your ideas and your direction whatever seems appropriate whatever you want feedback on we're looking pretty good on just a few teams at the moment so sometimes teams join later so we'll just get right into it um we have flaunt is project flaunt here this is me yeah can you guys hear me yes cool all right um yeah i'll go ahead and turn my screen yeah okay okay can you guys see that looks good i'm just cranking down my resolution a bit cool yeah so um yeah this has just been a a solo hack um really just for me personally to go a bit deeper on l2s and it's definitely helped in that um the premise of it and by the way should i just jump in there's no yeah yeah yeah yeah cool yeah um let me just move a couple of things around here so i can see things zoom windows yeah so the premise is um and again still wrapping things up with it um but allow you to remix kind of remix existing nfts that you have um and flaunt them more and that might be like downstream you know monetization of them you know if it's an uh an nft you already own um or uh licensing or whatever right now basically anyone can remix an nft it's not checking that you actually are the owner of it but that wouldn't be too hard to add and the emphasis is on like mimifying the the nfts as well so there's a little bit of a workflow baked in and i can show you guys so again hopefully you can see this but you load an existing nft so there's like four uh five samples there you can also look this this contract address here is um foundation's uh contractor address so it's kind of neat so you can just kind of randomly select one and it will import that and you'll see that you know what that means in a moment um or you can just select an existing you know sample nft asset um uh i'll let's just try loading the only camera i've got to check that yeah so if the actual underlying nft is a video like an mp4 um then it doesn't work because it can't embed that in the canvas so there we go just random one and then what you can do is just go ahead and um meme the fire so let me just start with the troll this is kind of secondary this isn't scaling stuff yet but that's just kind of fun and it's actually become kind of addictive for me to play around with with it add a bit of doge you can also add text so there we go we've pretty quickly rapidly mimified that and we can go ahead and save it and then this saves it to ipfs and what it actually does is saves the image um this actually took a little bit of hacking because it saves it as an svg with the image actually embedded just because i'm using a library called ipfs mini i couldn't get it to save the image just natively but it still works so it's kind of kind of cool little hack and the true hack of the sense but then you can also see the metadata as well with the ipfs cid pointing to the original image the image we just saw uh added just for kind of fun the ability to preserve it with far coin in the past outside of the hack i do a lot of work with various things um and then worked on some falcoin um flavored ganache um so that's that if you've got that running you can actually simulate a preservation like the creation of a deal and stuff but i won't show that just now or you can just kind of pin it and preserve it with you know pinning service such as pinata either way all good so we've got regenerated the asset and now getting to i guess the scaling point um go ahead and mint so you can either mint directly to l1 so if you've got like metamask installed or a wallet you can just go ahead and mint it directly at l1 uh and then the scaling piece and again this is i haven't had i've by the way been dipping in and out of this hack so i haven't had a ton of time um what you can do so i've got support for scale right now oh i didn't show oh actually i haven't actually set this bit up it does work but i haven't sort of tested it in advance so you can switch and that's master scale yeah i wouldn't do this just because the account i've got currently loaded here doesn't have any sk in it but you get the idea that would just you know mint it to scale uh you can also mint it arbitrarily via taurus as well so if you don't have like metamask installed and you you don't have a wallet um i'm already logged in here i didn't show that workflow but you know this just allows you to log in with uh taurus um and you can see here this is a separate address it's my first time using taurus it's really cool um and then you know associated balance there l1 balance and then the arbiter imbalance or each balance because you need that and then a little bit of this is just some of that boilerplate code that they provided and then you can actually go ahead and mint it together and this may just work let's just try it out ah cool so that's done so i've minted uh and then you can we have a gallery as well now this is still kind of i think that might be it but that said i haven't actually got a distinction right now of what this gallery is pretty naive it's pretty basic it doesn't actually fully work but you get the idea you can see where it's been minted too i don't know why oh let me switch back to cobin here because yeah some of this is still a bit kind of work in progress but if i switch back to coven and refresh it has been i mean you saw the assets but it has been mint and you can see just the example ones here uh um so these are prime entered the id the ultimate the bit that's kind of still outstanding is then bridging it back so the minted nft to the l2 bridging that back to to the l1 as well so it would be a separate the little bit of additional workflow um which hopefully i get a chance to finish is again this link won't actually go to the correct asset because the id is putting at one that's already on coven on the l1 but it will be a separate route where it's like hey looking at the asset on arbitram and then just a little bit of workflow to submit that back to send it back to the l1 again some of this it's not too much it's not hard per se it's just i haven't got around to it yet um cool yeah so that's it and then the idea final point i guess point um being about flaunting is you could then like and it's actually all live as well here as in just pushing up as it goes so you can actually go into the gallery and see essentially the same assets kind of um yeah so it's actually been fun now i've got it kind of mostly working it's kind of fun to hack around and memorize things and it's all like so cool yeah that was that's where it's at that's cool from my from my standpoint like i like this i really like the simplicity of the of the interface i really think nfts is just that space that a lot of newbies just want that simplicity to be drawn in so i really like that but please open up to um feedback sure can start if you like uh quick one well it's a it's a good one i mean uh definitely interesting i i agree on the simplicity and nfts you know they have been proved to be an entry point for so many newbies right so it's good to keep it simple so i agree there uh one quick thing um is your idea to build it like you see more like a standalone product or a future and you will see this is gonna sound like a broken record but it's quite important even if it's like a project or an akaton to have a sort of like clarity if if it's a product that could be you know a standalone and what's the value proposition or at least on a v1 right so that you can have also a feedback on something that it's it's it's envisioned to to to provide a certain service a certain value to the community in a sense or you can also think it like a feature that you know you mentioned foundation and stuff so apply to to an another protocol so what's your idea on this like what's your direction good good great question yeah like again i've embraced it in the spirit of just a pure hack in a sense um but no i mean as i've kind of hacked on it you know where i see it potentially going is you know people are paying a lot for these nfts obviously and being able to monetize them in a kind of a derivative type way so if you've you know own an asset and then you can let's say you own like a people or something and then you would remix a little bit basically and or like or like sign it maybe because let's say you know this is like very valuable and then one you know you just kind of auth you know just a little bit expect to load that's in black that yeah i just if i did put my signature there all like that snowden piece which sold for a lot um and then maybe the owner of that could do something with it and then maybe you know min x you know derivations of that and then sell those so it's kind of like opening up again yeah there's more potential you know to like kind of you know kind of build upon the art right which is something you know build upon these assets look i get it uh i get it so much that we we laid around of a nft platform called uh async art where i know that yeah you know yeah right so yeah yeah no that's super cool man yeah you really open you really open it to you know the masters and the layers and you you can really own it a layer to to modify it so yeah there is definitely a scope there out there and and i could see somebody signing so good job cool yeah no thanks yeah cool uh anyone else i think it's just a a really interesting commentary on the sort of crowd crowdsourced nature of internet humor as well as the iterative value of contemporary like modern art so i think this is a really cool step in that direction just to you know assess what is happening with nfts make a something that furthers what is what is occurring but also like a very apt commentary on the nature of like what is it to be new as an as a piece of art what what qualifies there so um i know that might not have been the original intent but i think this opens up a lot of interesting questions you know about what we were going to consider uh quality base yeah great hack i think yeah yeah thanks luke awesome awesome well thanks thanks for sharing man i really appreciate it likewise yeah thanks guys thanks for thanks for listening please stick around and continue working and hang out um next our next um project is invest in pro investing.pro are we here uh hi everyone uh this is from msn pro all right um my team hasn't joined yet so uh we couldn't be uh you know showcasing our project yet but i can just walk you through the idea and we have built a long way uh so we have chosen uh to scale up we on arbitrary building on ethereum so our central idea is a decentralized fund management protocol uh something similar to enzyme finance if people are aware and uh we've been working on it and the whole idea uh works around bringing nfts to use so nfts are mostly right now concentrated upon art but we thought of using it for a specific use case so we've built a platform which actually uh incentivizes nft owners in terms of investments so you come to a protocol you find a bunch of funds listed out there and just like a traditional finance uh no fund market where you go and you find fund managers managing your portfolio of funds and you choose your manager accordingly and you start investing in it and in the same way we list out a bunch of fund managers and this is open to all you can come up and create a fund of your own and it's all tracked lives so blockchain brings up a question of you know uh truthfulness you can't fake stuff so you are showing your fun performance live for everyone to see and people can just come up with a wallet and invest in your fund so the moment they make an investment we track the metadata using an nfd so that that's ibny so that's the whole idea of our project we track investments using nfts and that's that's basically putting them to use and then they start auto compounding your investments whenever a new user comes into the same account so basically uh right now all fund management protocols including even pairs on uni swap they utilize the erc20 uh token standard to track your share of portfolio unless v3 comes in and and now like it's already been live so now you have even uni swap tracking your pool ratio your uh your liquidity position using an nft so the same idea uh we have been utilizing it and uh you know scaling it in a way where people come in and uh you know in ethereum if you wanted to achieve the many too many mapping of a normal data structure uh it was a difficult task because uh you know a lot of data had to be updated so nfts make up make up a good use here and that's what we have been doing we have utilized nfts to track positions and then uh the real problem with having and tracking a portfolio on chain is uh getting the asset price so we have chain link and uh other providers which provide us the on-chain uh you know price articles but they do not track all the assets that are listed on uni swap so if a manager tries to interact with a token which is not currently listed on a decentralized price articles then we had to rely upon our own calculation mechanisms and that's what we have done we have created engine articles for our own protocol and we've been tracking all of that the problem we faced right now is that exchanges on l2s are not that liquid i mean you have uni swap sushi swap and other exchanges on on the base layer that that provide us all the opportunity to to trade in you know comparable to what centralized i think we might have lost your audio there yeah for some reason we we you've cut out there right and you're back and uh that's been a challenge for us because uh first of all like uh we need our investors to come on to the layer 2 using their own uh bridges so if you want to uh like if you want to move your assets to arbitrarium you've got to utilize their own bridge which takes a lot of time which right now takes amount around two days of time to you know move your assets from your base layer of ethereum to your maybe arbitrary or optimism all of these layer twos they require a bit of time because of the consensus mechanism utilized there so we have been trying to smooth that out i mean trying to build a a system which actually pushes through that and once you're on to layer 2 again you find the lack of liquidity on those exchanges to be a hurdle so we have been trying to find solutions for that and uh uh hope like uh if we stick around for a while i'll get my team and uh we can also demonstrate a lifelong step so that's it from uh investing.pro uh i guess given some more time i mean once we have uh like other projects finish up i could come back to the loop and uh give a live demonstration of that yeah well great thank thanks for that explanation we lost a little bit of your audio in there um but i don't know if anyone from what we heard anyone have any thoughts or feedback uh you know could start very quickly yeah i mean would be curious to look at it so but it seems there is quite a little bit cooking right like uh different challenges the product seems also you know well thought but to be developed are you are you planning to do something like d-hedge or like priest or like okay okay okay uh it's it's limited to synthetic acid so it's not open to every acid on ethereum out there so we are trying to build something that's generic and which is more closely tied to enzyme or a melon protocol if you've heard of it of course of course yeah we invested on the edge and and other stuff on device so i i'm familiar but the edge of course is on top of synthetic oxide so that's the idea and and you also like um sort of like incentivizing those managers to attract investors and they get like a sort of sure yeah performance fee for their profits everything that's exactly similar to bh and the only place where we uh put out our unique selling position is that uh we track every investment using an nft so they don't have to mint erc 20 tokens for every fund independently we have a centralized i mean a single contract which manages all investments across all funds and there's just a single metadata that is required to be captured on every transaction so we have reduced the investment costs i mean the gas costs to around a third of what it actually costs you on dh and we are opening a gateway to all assets on ethereum you're not just limited to synthetics or any other central authority so we are open to all assets okay good stuff i love to see it when when it comes to fruition sure great great thanks for thanks for sharing uh really appreciate that just a quick reminder there's a sign up sheet that i posted in the um in the chat um i will repost right now if you just joined and you want some feedback um and also just for for a little bit of framing if you want feedback to be a little specific about judging for for this particular hackathon just remember you have four minute for your video in the video demo um no no less than two minutes for that and a four minute maximum for your for your video demo and then um and then there's three minutes of discussion for seven minute total that's for your judging session just so you know we don't have to address that specifically in this feedback session but if you want some feedback on how you present or how you go through it we can do that too all right um thanks to invest in pro maybe we'll see you guys later um now we'll move on to my yield get more manic with your matic my yields hey are you guys doing all right i'm here to get you normatic with dramatic so uh when the acatons started uh basically avi released their liquidity mining incentives and so i basically built a product around that and i'm gonna start sharing my screen let me know if you see it and uh with this act i'm uh aiming to win uh uh rewards for ave uh the graph and polygon so this is deployed on polygons lashmatic uh since we have to ship by uh sunday uh and it's a sort of uh use we interchangeably but it's a solo project so since i have to ship by uh sunday uh i decided to just focus on one vault and try to do the best i can and then focus on presentation and polish rather than adding more vaults uh what what this does is basically allows a simple way to deposit and you guys see my my screen you can see that uh some wmatic so i can just deposit uh deposit it and uh for security reasons i uh always ask for allowance i did submit this for a peer review on dow.reviews however i think a thousand dollar bounty is not enough but uh if any of you guys watching this video would like to do a peer review uh you can go on down dog reviews and just uh you know there's a thousand dollar bounty on this so uh uh once the uh you know once you deposit you get they should share that are based on the value of your deposit and uh i basically uh launched a version through uh in order i basically launched the second version that uses the graph to track uh deposits it tracks the value that was earned the value that was deposited and the shares that are minted and it also allows you to track your own stats as for how the strategy works uh it's basically based on getting as many um liquidity rewards as possible from ave which means that we take the tvl and then based on the tdl we just uh deposit them with uh we borrow and land and borrow and land and borrow land as much as we can so that we properly uh leveraged and uh i would say the biggest challenge that i had um was that uh there was no documentation so uh i basically had to reverse engineer the um the staking uh uh github library as they developed it and i believe the documentation came out maybe five days ago so uh we basically i basically shipped then and um yeah so basically it's currently earning 21 although there's actually a bot called my yield bot that is uh checking if the um and it's uh uh there's like a security check for it being a white listed because uh you know rebalancing can potentially cause losses so uh this this account is white listed and it's uh uh it basically is allowed to uh deposit and borrow so uh i could spin up a new vault for usdc in probably half an hour because i can just change the addresses and basically i can have a second vault although i was focused mostly on you know polishing this experience and making it as simple as possible and so uh i believe that uh what is missing here is um that you're not gonna see uh your uh expected gains and i was thinking about adding some sort of chart so that you will see either a projected uh apr projected gains or uh you could see your uh unclaimed rewards because the the contract is continuously compounding so uh you know to just look at the number here may not be uh enough of feedback but i'm very open to uh advice cool yeah anyone okay ciao alex your your github name it's it's a way forward to me yes definitely uh look good stuff uh one one simple point maybe start with you know the central idea which i mean are you uh allowing matic like to to to to borrow and then directly to jave that's that's what you're trying to do basically yeah that's what i did i could show you the smart contract as well but i don't know italy yeah yeah it's like it's a leveraged farm it's a leveraged farm for uh malik rewards okay perfect yeah yeah yeah so in in general like you know good the presentation good uh also the ui seems pretty straight forward but you know start with the central idea of your project and then expand on on all the different things that you could do with it basically yeah so you would you say it's best to uh perhaps have a chart show the uh the rewards earned rather than uh for example having a second vault for usdc well for maybe yes i think i think you uh look since you you have to start with something start with like one volt and and have like all the full suites around that i would say but also as a presentation i would say right instead of like guessing what could be doing or what what is what is actually doing maybe start with the you know one 10 seconds sentence of this project that's these and this leverage these connections these protocols and that's the goal of the project in a sense like it's always better to start like this so that the viewers don't have to guess on on what might be doing that's all yeah yeah you're right yeah i will uh yeah i will uh stay by my goals first and then go into more details uh uh i would say there's a lot of tech that i can talk about but would you say i should just focus on uh more of the uh benefits and just uh or keeping it simple yeah sure i mean my perspective this different people that might be intrigued interested on different stuff obviously the tech is cool but it's it's more like uh from a usability user perspective right like what allows you to do maybe you can talk about also the challenges maybe you could talk about what needs to be done maybe but it's also nice i mean i i speak with like maybe two three four five ten projects per day it's it's nice to see division so it's nice to present like okay in that week i can do this in a month i could do these but in a year this could become these so that's also important now is an acaton of course you just started and there is a very constrained time and and tools but if you have an idea you should also you know show what you have but also present the long-term vision mid-term vision and so on that's up to you to know where you know the platform could do and what the product will do but it's nice also to see from your own perspective what can be done with this deck right yeah i i would say that i basically built a vault where the strategies are hard coded in the smart contract while my goal is to uh separate the vault code from the strategies code which is you know literally the the urine the urine way and uh but my my uh next goal and i'm actually going to participate on git coin uh with the badger uh grants and i'm uh i'm gonna be building a uh usdc to bitcoin uh vault basically the goal is take your dollars and earn more bitcoin uh but i know that uh with the three weeks i had and all of the stuff that i had to learn uh i wouldn't be able to do that so that's my next goal would you say i should mention that in the uh presentation to show them up if you like it yes why not i would suggest so yeah it's nice to see that you have a vision that you want like it's much more than just what you see and it could be much bigger that's always a good sign absolutely awesome yeah i agree with that definitely good to just mention that you have this bigger view of what's going on too i think that helps thank you alex thank you guys for your time thank you thanks all right um again if you just joined there's a sign up sheet i posted in the chat our next project is vid hasher gabriel can bidhasher hear me yes so uh they used to make a distributed database where i can perceptually hash a video and see what files have that same idea the same information because sometimes you have a video but it's encoded in various formats various resolutions or sometimes it's scrapped so i want a way to locate them and to help media preservation so let me see if i can stream here is it working yes so i made a python program that can have open a video and use an algorithm called p hash and split it up to create a list of short identifiers you can put into a distributed database on your feed room the oh god this is simple i have a smart contract that holds a database where people can vote if the information provided is correct or not so here i have the identifiers for a workplace scene of this video that i used and the idea is that i can then publish it on the smart contract for example this will be automated unfortunately i had to make part of the coding python part in go and i'm still merging the information so once the people voted him then search by the perceptual hash to identify to list which files contain uh that scene i'm looking for now the idea is to make a bit of a better interface including publishing it direct the file directly to ipfs but i still haven't managed to integrate at all very interesting really cool i i love it it's it's i think it's a great thing um so the the uh you said p hash this is some kind of uh like robust hash function right yeah it's actually a specific one let me see if i can find it to show you it's base yeah never mind i can i can look it up myself but can you see uh the algorithm i'm using is called p hash and it takes the image reduces it removes the color and use discrete cosine transformations to take the most important info now the algorithm was made for images so i take my whole video do it frame by frame and time try to identify scenes by seeing segments in which the hash value doesn't change much and you then you always take the first uh hash of the scene or as an identifier for this no i take kind of an average ah okay okay yeah cool um i'm i'm yeah i think i think it's a great idea it's a great great uh thing one problem i'm i don't know about the voting part so uh i i understand yeah it's devoting i understand what you're trying to go for right like you have you have uh different people proposing different scenes and you have to vote on them to see if they are really the scene or if someone just tries to tries to cheat something in there yeah there was the problem of spam but that's the best i could manage for a hack at home in theory could you do the video process in a distributed fashion i think there is a coin called video coin that does this kind of thing but it seemed way too much of a hassle for a simple demo yeah i think we should keep as much data off chain as possible so yeah no i i really like the project i think you probably have to work a bit on your presentation i'm not i'm not a big presentation guy myself so i would just present it as you would probably so maybe the other the other mentors have some some better suggestions for that um well i i think maybe you know look uh seems also interested so it can hurt definitely on the technical side more than myself that's for sure yeah on the maybe product side and on the presentation that's okay maybe you can also think and discuss with the audience about you know the use cases so who could use it where do you see in in use uh okay on a platform or a product standalone so maybe try to feed it in an ecosystem that is already existing right like on products that we we all might be familiar with or i don't know because i'm not 100 sure yet where and how you would use it and what are the use cases maybe you can expand a little bit like a web archive okay like the internet archive they usually don't have whole videos because that's way too much info but if you really could do something like this where they start the hash the perceptual hash of the video so if later on someone still has a copy of it you can see recover part of the information i see i see okay so it's more like a retrieving uh sort of function in a sense uh on on an archive correct yes more like media preservation i think maybe maybe you could start like by telling a story of like um have you ever used yeah have you ever had a video um out of some movie and you didn't know which movie it was or something like this or have you ever had like some some corrupted snippet from from like a youtube video and you wanted to find this youtube video and you didn't know how to search for it um now you can do this by just using my thing and and publishing uh maybe also like publishing requests online and other people can can try to try to share their files to to to to yeah to find it for you and set up some bounty or something like this i think you could like think a bit about the story um and because people really like to connect with uh with the stories and and then it's probably easier for like the average uh um average judge to uh to to connect to to the project and to think about it yeah yeah it's a great great feedback yeah i agree i mean and just along those lines if there you know in the in your um in your debt hacker dashboard there's a hack submission and judging guide but at the bottom there's a bunch of of um demo videos that have worked well in the past to just look at you know unrelated but you know sort of presenting the use case or the what problem does this solve right at the start and because it's video like throw in some juicy video or interesting video you know like capture the video part which is super cool everybody gets that and then you you got the technical walkthrough like definitely do that and then it starts to gel i think as a as a four minute four minute demo okay cool cool work man um thanks for presenting appreciate it um next up is project ticket share an affiliate marketing system with enhanced financial incentives ticket share oh ticket share is not here i see there is a gap of like six projects yeah i don't think they're putting in here he hopes like okay let's let's let's gain some time and then he didn't know that we're actually jumping on him right now yeah i'll see if nft puzzle thing is here nft puzzle yeah yeah we're here hi hi guys hey so hello we've okay awesome so we've attended the last two feedback sessions as well so i think andrew you you've probably seen our thing but for people who haven't yet we'd love to gain some feedback right now so i'm just going to do a quick demo here right so you can you guys can see my screen right yes awesome awesome so what we're building here is um we're basically trying to gamify nfts we're building a puzzle out of it so how it works is um we have things called as loot boxes right so people purchase loot boxes which give them a few pieces now what those pieces are we have a couple of puzzles uh on the platform i just had it have you know tabs open so that we don't have to wait for requests to go to go through but basically we have a few ongoing puzzles right now these puzzles are um generated and at any point of time there will be let's say four ongoing puzzles now when somebody purchases a loot box he gets pieces for um you know random pieces for any of the ongoing puzzles so let's say there's this puzzle three right so this puzzle these are my pieces right so these are random pieces that i got from loot boxes now let's say this is a 5x5 puzzle here so now i need 25 pieces in order to complete this puzzle and once i get enough pieces i can you know verify the puzzle and this is basically a race to to be the first one to finish a puzzle and once somebody is able to finish a puzzle um he can claim it and it will basically be an nft that will get you know minted and transferred to his address so just to give you a quick demo um our loot boxes so people can buy little boxes they can do a batch purchase or buy single loot boxes so one load box gives a user 10 random pieces of the ongoing puzzles so let's just do a quick buy here this will take a second so like we have to wait for chain link vrs to return a value so that takes like a couple of seconds and we have graph so that also okay that that was quick awesome so we purchased the loot box now it'll take a couple of seconds to reflect here but in the meanwhile we have we already have a couple of loot boxes so let's just do a quick uh you know unbox and give this a second awesome so these are the random pieces that we got and these random pieces were generated through chain link so uh we can see you know every every piece has a unique token id as well right so these can be repeated pieces as well because um um you know we we have to keep it as random as possible now let's just say let's just say we have um we have let's just assume we have enough pieces here we just recently deployed a new contract so we don't have enough enough pieces for any puzzle right now but what basically happens is when once somebody is able to get all the pieces he needs to arrange those in this grid here right just basic drag drag and drop and hit the verify puzzle button and after that he can see that in his winnings tab right once it goes through right so i don't have any claimed any uh unclaimed or claimed puzzles right now but it'll basically show up here and once it gets claimed we also have integrated openc so once it gets claimed uh we will show an option to you know for the user can see it on openc as well okay i can show the openc part i i guess i have the example for that awesome awesome you want to take it over sure yeah awesome uh just to mean by parallely so these are the my pieces page which will list all the pieces active pieces actually and so expired pieces will basically show pieces that are no longer useful right for the puzzles that are either already completed or yeah basically the puzzles that i've already completed and we have marketplace which is uh which will allow users to trade like they do a one-to-one nft swap so let's say i have pieces a and b and i want to be said so i can put up a listing saying okay um we have i have pieces a and b and i'm willing to trade them in order to get that piece x and somebody shows up he's like okay bro i go i got x and y and i want the state so you know we have a marketplace set up for that as well so yeah that's pretty much it for the demo i'll hand it over to slay to show you with the openc integration thanks um [Music] yeah you wanna you wanna show the openc integration today uh yeah sure uh it's just zoom was giving me some issues sorry all right all right no worries i think i think we do have it in designs if you if you uh if you want to show uh i think i cannot share my screen after give some no worries can you can you send me the open c link or could you send it on zoom for for people to view i think that would be helpful yeah for sure cool cool project um well like my first feedback is i really hate the term loot box i would change it definitely change it to something else call it i don't know puzzle box like i don't know puzzle pieces or whatever but i think loot box this is a really really bad name other than that the concept is pretty cool um one question i have is uh how's the how's the randomness generated for the loot boxes or puzzles right so right so we use vr apps chain links vrf so it basically returns us a random number and we slice it uh for for just one for one number so we basically use it to index over the pieces so yeah like to to keep it short we basically use chain link prfs ah okay and yeah and it's polygon supported so where we we've uh integrated polygon right now and we've also been able to make it make uh deploy it on scale and arbitrarily but primarily we we've integrated with polygon cool so there's there's a 25 pieces per puzzle and that's that's a standard do you know how many um average trades it takes for one user to complete a puzzle given the pieces that they're given per box um so right now we have hard-coded it to 25 but when we actually finally launch it um they're gonna be puzzles of different um different sizes so like there would be easy puzzles and then then they're gonna be like difficult puzzles which are gonna be of more value because they would be harder to solve um like 10 by 10 uh 4x4 and multiple like that um just to give you an average like yesterday i was trying to solve a 5x5 with four ongoing 5x5 and it took me a very like four or five batch purchases to actually get all the pieces but i still couldn't do it and because there was just one last piece i was not able to get it so it's really hard to play so that is actually how we plan to you know uh leverage the marketplace because there are people who are gonna run into this problem where they're gonna be super frustrated they're like i just need this one piece so they'll be like okay bro i'm just gonna put up a listing on the marketplace for this that's cool yeah sorry go ahead go ahead andrew go ahead uh i was gonna say it seems like there's variations on what i would typically think of as puzzle solving that sort of go into this now you know you typically get a puzzle where you know all the pieces are in the puzzle but now there's a quote there's sort of a question in this model of like so you have a puzzle to solve but you don't even know if you have to acquire the pieces that you think are going to be in the help you solve the puzzle so that's interesting yes in fact my my question and more direction i wanted to you know brainstorm with you guys was the economics so uh who you think that you know your users are and do you want to keep it just for gamer like on a gamifying approach or there's some economics behind it and maybe i don't know very hard to think that boats could do it but anyway so who would be your audience and and is it just the game or it could be something more got it got it so we haven't put too much thought into it yet but we've been in talks with so karthik the other day connected us to coin artist and uh we were discussing it with her and she actually you know suggested that we we collab with some digital some nft artists you know so so that we can bring real value into those puzzle uh pieces so we might go that route but yeah so like we are passively thinking about that stuff but uh for now we just wanted to you know uh deliver on the hackathon right and she said like she has some collaborations that she can put us into so we're excited about that but i guess for the hackathon launch we're looking at memes or something funny which people find interesting to own and yeah that's going to be the short term goal so like we'd actually appreciate ideas there like for the hackathon what sort of uh you know puzzles we can go for so we we're thinking of going with um you know like some some uh artistic you know modified version of the sponsored logos and you know and maybe like some funny funny uh memes maybe like vitalik's head or like something something you know entertaining in that aspect so we love ideas there as well i'm interested in this because i think that it gives you the opportunity to like not only set up like your revenue streams but you get to sort of control for the difficulty like the number of times somebody's gonna have to trade based on the pieces that they're given you can you can sort of control that in a lot of ways i would say over the course if if you decide to spin this up after after the hackathon do a lot of averaging of you know like what each player has to go through like the number of transactions they have to deal with in order to finish the puzzle the number of boxes they have to purchase themselves in order to gain the pieces who they need to trade with um and then like sort of ratchet up the difficulty for those expert level puzzles because i think you have the chance to really get people to go crazy about that but it's going to be an important balance between having that one last piece that's an incentive and then having that one last piece that gets people to walk away so there's a little bit of like game design included here that's going to be necessary to make sure that the difficulty level keeps people interested and doesn't turn them away that makes a lot of sense yeah yeah definitely helpful thank you so much for that super fun though yeah i i really like where you're at yeah this is this is cool i like this when you show thank you so much guys thank you so much cool so if i'm not taking too much time i just had like one last question any any insights any any ideas as to how we can make this more like appealing to the users so we recently we had a call with uh somebody from polygon and they they suggested us to look into ideas or you know figure things out to make it more attractive or more entertaining for the user because maybe people aren't interested in playing the game so they're like maybe you know think of something to attract or you know bring in more users let me ask a question just out of curiosity are you guys puzzle enthusiasts yourselves before this product really yeah not really maybe you just want to look into that like what a puzzle enthusiast currently like where do they gather what interests them and now you're you're sort of getting into that psychology a little bit some people just love doing puzzles it's been huge during the pandemic here in the us like tons of people are doing puzzles it's not a direct line but to get to understand that psychology a little bit could probably be useful to be honest i was not a puzzle person but yesterday when i was trying to swallow it was really fun because and i was very fun yeah yeah i was just i was just adding that uh we're just trying to address the the average joe user as well like somebody who would want to invest into an nft or maybe like for trading purposes like we also want to address that audience and not just puzzle enthusiasts so we want to make we want we want to keep it as generic and as wide as possible yeah it's a good good uh it's a good choice otherwise you really channel and and and funnel too much the the audience maybe you could i don't know i'm thinking about like recurring as you mentioned like collaborations with artists so that you know that on a zillion of bases whatever there is something valuable like there is something that you can actually there is a market and you can build a little bit of buzz around it and say once a week once a month you have one piece around the boxes that if you really get it and you have maybe you know an history so that people can say okay something very valuable it was one of the puzzle that this person actually solved and he suddenly has a bunch of money right because that's uh that's the value behind it and you you're able to sell it so it doesn't have to be always the case but maybe yes i'm requiring um collaborations or or you know like that piece that it's a little bit more recognizable from from a larger audience that keeps the engagement right it's never dormant in a sense awesome awesome thank you so much in the interest of time i'll i'll you know uh wrap it up thank you so much guys all right thank you thanks guys good good luck with that um okay so ticket share as our last project ticket share thank you guys last but not least [Music] let me share my screen can you guys all see it yes oh great so let me start off by asking you a question what do facebook linkedin ebay axi i have in common they are they have a strong network effect so each additional user to the platform would bring additional marginal value to the platform but we all know that it's extremely difficult to build the initial user base and what we are trying to do here is trying to help platforms or and any companies to build up their initial user base by deploying a network effect driven affiliate marketing program so what do what do i mean by uh a network effect different program so in let me just give you an over uh overview of the current system that companies use to attract promote products so in the current system so let's say they would give incentive to users like you and me if we are already using the products or services they would give you they would let's say hey here's your uh we will give you ten dollars if you refer someone to our platform or use a product so it's kind of a one-time one-off one-time deal and that's it once you get the ten dollars by sending a referral link to your friend that's it it's done this incentive system is not strong enough in the current system so what we are proposing is a strong adequate economic economics incentive powered by blockchain so you would not let's say andrew you send a referral link to nicola right and then nikola buys the product and you would get let's say you get one token for for inviting andrew for in for inviting nikola to use the to use the the servers and then nikola say hey that's a great product let me invite my other friends and nicola in my let's say gabrielle and then gabrielle also die in this case not only nicola gets a one token for the reward and andrew you will also get 0.5 token for reward because you bring in nicola and they call up brilliant and gabrielle so it keeps going it keeps extending out to higher levels as seo referrals bring other friends and the other friends bring more referrals and you can see we have the table here depending on how far you are away from your your referral if you're one one level away from your your referral you get 0.5 token two levels so where you get half of the 0.25 point have the 0.5 token you get 0.25 tokens and so on so that's the incentive system we are trying to build in our affiliate marketing program and it has a very strong economic incentive so for our user k for our use case we are building a ticketing platform employing what we just described so in the traditional ticketing on a traditional ticketing platform event hosts with career events and then the high promoters to promote the events and the promoter would get commission back if they their their audience attend buy the tickets and attend events so using our new affiliate program the event host can easily can provide adequate economic incentive to turn any ticket buyers into promoters so basically they would just if you buy a ticket go go into the event that you like you would because of the uh the on the infinite reward that you would get you just you would like to invite your friends and hoping your friends will in my other friends so you wanna you have incentive you want to get as many people possible to attend the meeting attend the event and here's the high over high level overview of the architecture what we're trying to do on the ticketing on the ticketing platform so we're going to use erc1155 token contract for the platform to to distribute the promotion reward i'm sorry my mistake here uh it should be erc20 tokens to to distribute the reward and then erc1155 to represent the ticket itself for each event each ticket um and then we also have the event registration contract that uh manage all the events being that is active that are not active uh last but not least we have the promoter report checking contract that basically would check the reward distribution we just described and so we will use scale as the l2 scaling solution plus a user-friendly interface made possible by taurus so usong would you like to do the demo um yes yes okay great oh yeah i cannot share my screen oh okay [Music] so yeah so here's the page when the user goes to the ticket share page they will need to connect to a wallet you know i'll be connecting to the mirror mask and then let's say if you are an event host that wants to create a event you can reach your event and enter the name and then select the date of the event that starts and then the time and then the location and then the price of the ticket and how much and then the number ticket style variable for this event and then you can register is there quickly um maybe the price is negative oh oh thanks i should have a validation for that one and confirm and here's the event and then you can like create all the referring links and this will generate a referral link so you can share with your friends and then you can earn some tokens and then you can click on this to copy the link and then i will switch to a non-war address and then and then paste and then connect more again and now this will be the friends and then when they purchase a ticket the referral will get the tokens so if i switch it back and then refresh and this person has 10 10 tokens for now and yeah that's it yeah we're still building out the band to keep track of the the degree of like for distributing the token based on how far you are away from the referrals yeah well i'm impressed in a sense uh very neat good presentation i would say uh clear ideas clear use cases i'm a huge fan of network effects i i think it's i mean with crypto economics probably the strongest uh success factor of of blockchain now but especially in the future when it will enable really like people from all over the world to be part of the ecosystems that would they would have never thought about it so the ticketing makes sense i'm also trying to think on you know different use cases beside obviously the gaming like you can't gamify uh the the system as you you you can't i think also civil attacks would be a problem but so you need to have the economics right right you need to pay to have the tickets yes so the ticket is definitely um suitable as an example have you thought about any other use case that could be fitting the reward system and uh yes so we we have a discussion with the mentors from scale and one the mentor suggested uh we can look into the coupon distributing uh system like if you you help distribute coupon or you you invite people to buy a product from a pipe buy a product or uh or using a services you will also get reward and then the person that you introduce to the system introduce another person and you would the in the person one would keep getting the reward as the connection keep expanding yeah i'm thinking i like any platform right like also defy defy platform say i don't know if if any liquidity provider you know you find a way to track that and and you introduce uh to you know you can split a part of the rewards that he gets in a sense like exactly fork it that way all the way back yes i see a lot of integration uh or a lot of use cases that could be applicable and how do you see it like you see like a layer on top of like it needs to be on scale at this point right it needs to be everything needs to be on scale or would work also back and forth from the base chain and and and the solution in l2 usong would you like to take a step at this question um it's going to be on scale they have like gas this transaction for the gas fee there's no gas fee on scale yeah yeah yeah okay so i nicola i think like if this idea works out we can build a layer two solution a protocol for everyone to use and i have done the market research there's actually a blockchain company out there called uh key two or two key that's already doing similar uh services out there they have their protocol they they offer layer two solution cool yeah yeah i i agree it's like uh um if the if the economics are sort of sorted which i don't have the ability to think through but it sounds like you're you're thinking through there's some good examples out there already it's interesting to do it in the ticketing space is key to that other company doing it in the ticketing space or is it just um it's for general for everyone almost for everyone who's trying to promote uh their products and and services let me see if p2 or 2k yeah bookie network i think i think we saw it actually it took him to working yet any any suggestion for anyone we we really welcome any ideas and feedback i really appreciate nicola your ideas andrews too thank you well all i all i would say outside of a material idea of use is to think a little bit about how you present you know uh on for the judging session yeah you know um um it looks like you have a crisp sort of presentation almost there and you have you have good stuff to walk through remember it's like a two to four minute video so you want to sort of hit it well and um the thing i would say is like again this is not a technical thing it's just for the presentation for the demo yeah whatever you know if it's ticketing then present the problem and like you know make something as i don't want to you know something about the ticket itself like you're the average user like the use case like going to a concert show something like that or just to sort of hook people in a little bit at the start and then go through the technical and the um and sort of the economics as you've thought it through got it i think thank you yes i was i was thinking through because you know there are all a universe not even a planet like a universe of uh defy applications that you could bring on but it depends if you do like on application specific so i'm thinking about like for example insurance right like if you could track um you know recurring insurance and and you could see like you can have a like a recurring like reward darling out to you because you introduced somebody that got one month of insurance then i got two months of insurance that three months of insurance so you can also think about the like a ticket it's like one event right so you you can it's multi-dimensional in my mind maybe it's a bit late so that my mind is is messed up but like you can have one dimension which is one event multiple people but you can also have multiple events and also the same people or you don't have to you know it's multi-dimensional so let's say a product like an insurance that it it it doesn't really matter if um i mean it matters if you get more people but maybe they want to ensure like you know a limited number of protocols right but you you could change the dimension and get it like a system that rewards you every time that they uh reinsure in a sense right so something recurring so every time the the the user that you introduce is using the product you get something right so that could be also a sort of dimension i don't know if it works as well because it's different from the tickets ticket is one event multiple people but my point is that you might you maybe want to think about you don't want to lose the referral link once you have it right so it goes from people to people and it's like a tree right like you you get always from the region you get whoever goes you get a little piece of the token but you can also maybe think to apply to services and that would be extremely valuable thanks i see a point you you i think you're touching upon on the rewarding the pokemon for the recurring purchases that their their referral made so yeah yeah yeah and and since liquidity in in defy especially in defy is well that this is on a scale so that's also another thing to think about it but uh you know since liquidity is a product believe it or not right now in defy it's it's a really big addressable market for you right now yeah it could be so i wouldn't discriminate in a sense like keep your options open yeah for sure thank you but good job so far absolutely thanks and i see um azzy has has uh has an idea feel free to unmute pazzy as inc see raised hand yes okay so the idea with that one would be well i have an idea if it goes along uh to the server and get points there or whatever every time they're using it for a certain amount of time and that's locked in so then the user uh doesn't have to pay anything for a vpn and i connected so that's how it spreads uh i think there was something very good yeah on it for sure i think we got maybe 35 40 percent of it yeah i mean at least on my hand it was yeah no the audio was uh got it was a little problematic but we feel everybody feels like there's something there so yeah yeah something on storage right yeah storage yeah it was he was mentioning vpn or storage as well i heard that ryan can you can you uh reach out to azzy inc and uh yes i just did uh essie can you share your discord so i can i think he's still here and he was there a second ago yep no he's still here uh okay all right um well thanks for um thanks for presenting and sharing that uh sounds sounds interesting thank you so much for your time yeah and thanks everybody for for joining thanks nicola and thanks um marius uh for offering your time and expertise um submissions are this sunday um good luck everyone stay in discord if any problems pop up just jump in and ask questions um i think that's it good luck everyone good luck thank you guys for presenting it's been a pleasure thank you guys
