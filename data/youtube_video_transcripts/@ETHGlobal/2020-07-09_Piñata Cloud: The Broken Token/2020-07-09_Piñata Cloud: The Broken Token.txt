we're good on the stream awesome welcome everybody hacker fest hackers and we got a couple sponsors in here as well so everybody who's in hack efest welcome to this pinata workshop we've got a couple people from the pinata team here they're gonna be going over how to use hack efest in your project some of the prizes and just generally what pinata is so welcome Kyle and Matt we really appreciate you guys spending some time with us helping hackers out gonna be a great session before we start we've as always and I'm sure the people on this call if you were here for any other sessions I'm gonna be repeating information but for anybody that was not here earlier today is the last day to stake this is our final requirement for anybody who is packing for the next 30 days we want to make sure people get that done before the cutoff because we will start pruning the slack and removing people from the event we just want to make sure people are going to be active and engaged throughout the next few weeks today we have two more events after this office hours these are going to be a little bit more intimate and slow-moving sessions where you can just chat with the team bring if you've art if you've already started working on things you can bring technical issues or any blockers that you ran into or just ask them specifically which ideas they think might be good I just get general feedback on on what you're working on so that would be at 2 p.m. Eastern there's the textile office hours and then later a few hours after at 5:00 p.m. Eastern unstoppable domain says their office hours so definitely if you're looking to integrate those sponsors you want to show up to those ask your questions and get home I think that's all the logistics out of the way before I turn it over to Kyle and Matt let's think all right if you want to play this game hackers and anybody here let's if you have a drink on your desk how about this you have a drink on your desk only what you got I'm taking regular old water it looks like coffee and tea are gonna take this water water enters it is that coffee all right water water loses this round waters good you got to stay hydrated I'm gonna I'm gonna recruit some more water folks for the next round all right enough for the games Kyle Matt I'll let you guys start off what you're gonna present awesome thanks thanks for having us in here let me share my screen here everybody got that yes good to go cool all right so thanks for thanks for joining us everybody we are pinata at pinata cloud and today we're going to talk about the broken in token it's a it's a topic we've talked about previously but this time we're going to do in a little bit different way and going through it structure of the talk just going to intro ourselves let you know who Matt and I are the team behind pinata and then we're going to actually do a walkthrough of how you can use us use our API and and integrate us into your application that you're doing for hack FS and then we're actually going to jump into jump into things and talk about the problem that is the D broken token itself so to start I'm Kyle tut this is usually my pinata that you'll see around online if you ever see that that's me a little bit about me I've been in the blockchain space for about three years doing blockchain applications spent a lot of time actually at hackathons so hackathons are near and dear to my heart we'll have Matt intro himself as well everybody Matt here Mike Kyle also been around the block chain space for about three years now and also got my start in the hackathon space I think eath Waterloo is the first one that we participated at pinata was born out of hackathons and uh we like to think of ourselves as a tool Gold for hackers at these types of hackathons so excited to be ala to her yeah in fact we even have an original photo of the original eath Waterloo in the right hand corner there you can see Matt on stage he was one of the winning teams yes so we've spent a bunch of time at these hackathons and actually pinata was was actually formed at these hackathons so spend time at eath Denver eath Waterloo and then the original East Berlin when it was I believe under the youth global banner is actually where we ended up winning with the original idea of pinata back in all the way back in 2018 now so to us hackathons are extremely important and you can actually end up being building a you know a company or an application out of these hackathons and and take them and move them forward at our core pinata is a pinning service for the ipfs network we're just a pure pure pinning service you you know you take content you take data and then you will end up pinning that on to our nodes for a fee pretty simple not too complex to understand the things that set us apart or why you would use pinata is that we're extremely easy so we've done a lot of work to make sure it is as easy as possible to ping content on ipfs including our easy-to-use API and simple UI that we have to upload and manage your pins we also focus a lot on making sure that pinata is fast this was a bigger thing back in the day but with updates constantly coming to the ipfs network things are always improving and getting faster but we we try to make sure that our nodes are highly connected to other nodes and prioritizing infrastructure decisions that increased speed and then finally we are always online so if you're running your own IP FS nodes maybe on your desktop or something like that it's not always online you can rely on us and make sure that your content is actually reachable on the IP FS network cool so who uses us anybody and everybody essentially from the decentralized web we because we came out of the etherium space originally and and spent a lot of time at eath global hackathons and things like that we do have a lot of blockchains blockchain applications that are using us to handle and manage their off chain data and with a subset inside of that is things like an FPS or non fundable tokens they typically whether it's being used for digital creators or gamers or whatever they're creating that is represented by that NFT they typically end up storing that data on pinata and then just like regular websites decentralized applications things that aren't actually attached to a blockchain necessarily we have a bunch of of users or developers that build build those on top of us as well so cool now I will let Matt kind of take us through and give us a run through of pinata and and the things you can do with it already I will start the screen share in seconds perfect all right so if you go to pinata cloud this'll take you to our homepage and as it says here we like to think of ourselves is the easiest way to use ipfs so for those of you that are new to pinata you can come here and sign up now I already have an account so I'm just going to log in with that but if you do if you do sign up you'll get an email in your inbox to verify the email click that and then once you do you'll be able to start put into pinata essentially right away so when you first log in you'll get taken to our documentation page and everything I'm going to show here today is it has an API endpoint that you can hit but a lot of what I'll be showing you will be demoed through our front-end GUI for kind of ease of use of demo and purposes but the main things to keep in mind are you'll get a pinata API key and then you'll get a secret API key and when you pin a pinata you'll just include both of those along with your API requests and that's how you oughta Kate with your system and then also for those of you that use JavaScript we do have an SDK that you can utilize in your projects and that's that's up on github so a lot of different options for you there we do include a lot of JavaScript examples all throughout the documentation scroll a little fast here but we like to think they're pretty well-documented but if you do have any improvements or suggestions for them feel free to hit us up and we're always happy to improve them with that I will start off with the pinata upload page which you can reach here in our navigation bar so to start off with we will come in here and we will go to our documents and find this pinata image and we will upload it to pinata pretty quick upload process and then once that uploads you can come in here and view it in the Penn Explorer so this is kind of our easy way to find basically you know anything anything you want to have pinned on the pinata service these are previous items that we've pinned you'll see the sizes of those objects you'll see the date they've been pinned and their status and then if you click on the object itself you will be taken to our gateway which will display the image if it is possible to display it there now you can also upload directories if you want to as well or you can do what's called a preserved filename option here so let's say that you have a file that you don't it's not like an image it's not typically displayed in the in the gateway you can come in here and click this rap with directory option and you can upload it and again it'll preserve this file name on the IP FS gateway a little kind of easier way to work with custom file names if you're doing something like say working with crypto voxels or any of the other unique file names in the decentralized space ok and then lastly also you can upload directories say if you want to upload a website that is something that you get a lot of people are doing with IP FS right now and then fake this is actually the last one you can use to upload your content you can also do what's called pinning by hash so let's say that you're running your own IP FS nodes and for whatever reason whether it's redundancy or you want to use pinata as a speed layer to make sure that your customers can get your content faster you can actually grab your contents hash or see ideas it's also referred to as and you can put it into our pin by hash tool and we can say this is gonna be a picture of a parrot and you'll see here it'll show you the status it quickly found that item is already on the network on a different note on the ipfs network and we can come in here and again we can view it on our gateway and there's our image that we we grabbed from the ipfs Network it was already existing out there and then what we did is pinatas nodes they took that hash they went and searched for this file and then they retrieved it and stored it on our own servers for kind of faster retrieval is what a lot of people are using that that capability for as well okay so let's say that you have an image that you want to you want to remove let's say we no longer want this parrot to be stored on pinata you don't want to be charged for it anymore we can come in here and simply remove the pin and that's now removed from your account and you're no longer being charged for that you get charged per gigabyte per month on pinata so I mean that's we're prorating it down to the millisecond so as soon as you want pin it charging stops okay we also have this other cool feature in pinata which is called our metadata functionality so the file we have here is this testing voxel file you can come in here and you can include a custom key so we'll say like file type or we can say application and we can add the value here and we can say this is a crypto voxels file we can add that in here and save that so now this voxel file here if you ever want to go at a later point in time and say come to this pin list functionality here the state of endpoint you can come in here and you can query on metadata and that will allow you to basically kind of sort and index your files on the pinata system so you can easily find your ipfs files based on those custom key values that you provide to us you can upload those via the API or manage them via the pin explorer like I did show here so let's say we can add up to ten of them here and if you want to you can always delete metadata or alter any of the the metadata tags as you see fit okay and then the last thing I wanted to go over is what we call our region's and replications functionality so we talked a little bit a little bit about this in our documentation but as we always like to say more is always better so pinata lets you replicate your content on multiple nodes and multiple regions by default you're gonna have one one node that's pinning your your content and that'll be the node that's closest to where you originally signed up for your pinata account we have nodes that are based in New York City and in Frankfort but let's say that you're in Frankfort and but you're your customer base is randomly mostly in the United States you may want to change your your storage location to to a different city so I guess let's come in here and let's change where our files being pinned at and you'll see it's in the process of replicating to New York City and if we give it a little bit of time here give it about ten seconds there's normally kind of what it takes to replicate across the world and you should see it update and now it is in New York City so what we do is we we allow our customers to kind of locate their contents closest to where there's their cus ad where their customers are located at and the main reasons for this are speed and kind of reliability as well so speed works in two areas there's speed of retrieval and then there's speed of discovery so the more nodes that are hosting your content on the ipfs network the faster the content is going to be found and then the location of where those nodes are at is going to be how fast that content is delivered once it's actually found so you get a little bit of a custom kind of build your own CD and type ability with pinata but a lot of our customers are utilizing to best suit their needs on the account level side you can manage this when you upload your content you can choose a default pinning policy this is what's going to take place for all of your pins by default you can custom include a pinion policy on a per content basis or you can have it fall back to the default account level policy that takes kind of as a default setting for all of your pins that don't include that in your request and that is pretty much pinata for you you can go to your account page and view your usage change your payment method your password your API secret but yeah that's that's pretty much pinata as a whole and I will let Kyle take it from here again hey Matt and in the chat you can see karate-do yes if you're in I will start reading these questions from the top okay Simon ass or Alex Simon ask is it possible to share data from my ipfs cluster - pinata so you'll have to use the the pin by hash functionality that I talked about here earlier so you'll basically just take the the hashes or the C IDs as they're also known as and you will I guess I'm not sharing my screen anymore but yes it is the pin by house functionality you'll give those to us and then we'll go grab those from your ipfs cluster so karate asks are there any free hack FS pinata credits for new signups yep like Kyle said we do have one gigabyte free for anybody that wants to utilize pinata and is just trying them out above that you can just add in a credit card and it's 15 cents per gigabyte too much and then alex says one gigabyte per email to anyone yes yes that is correct and then how do you protect against a civil attack so we have a few kind of proprietary things behind the scenes I'm not going to discuss those publicly so we don't want them to be kind of gamified but we do have a lot of protections behind the scenes to kind of prevent against this and then how to make my ipfs cluster an official IPS gateway so the files from my cluster are available at ipfs IO so the ipfs IO site is like it's just a gateway run by protocol labs there's a lot of gateways that are run by community members pinatas one of those as well CloudFlare is one most most kind of prominent ipfs community members are going to be running their own gateway if they have a product in the ipfs space and the cool thing about IP FS is I long as your files are on a node that's accessible to the rest of the network it's well connected those files are going to be accessible on any IP FS gateway and they're gonna be you just put that that hash there behind the the Gateway URL and you can access it anywhere it's kind of like one of the decentralized cool features about IP FS in terms of getting your content to be accessible quickly that's actually kind of what pinata is used a lot for pinata will run or you will run your own say like ipfs cluster or your own IP FS nodes and you'll have your content pinned on your own servers for you know backups sake or for redundancy sake and then you can send your files to pinata and we're pretty well connected with the rest of the network like Kyle said we really prioritize that so if your your files are pinned on pinata chances are it's gonna get found very very quickly on any of the rest of the ipfs networking gateways and then the last question is karate asks did you say we can choose the nodes based upon metadata so for example I could name slash tag my files per region I think I understand your question we do have a metadata functionality and that's basically just kind of an internal indexing service that pinata provides for our users that metadata is stored on our own internal servers it's not actually stored on ipfs anywhere it's purely used so that you can kind of sort and classify your files on the pinata system it doesn't actually affect anything on the ipfs network or how your content is stored so your hash will stay the same but in terms of regions and replications you can go into your account or you can provide a what's called a pin policy for your your specific pieces of content and you can choose where your content is penned at either in New York City or in Frankfort are two public regions that we have available if you are a more enterprise user and you want a custom region set up for you or you want like a private ipfs network that's managed through pinatas kind of whole service that is something that we can set up for you but yeah New York City and Frankfort are the two ones we have publicly available and you can choose either per project or an account level where your content resides and then yep Simon Kyle answered your question there in the chat and then pay with crypto option right now we are a credit card based company we found that's easier for most of our users right now we are always exploring pay by crypto but so far a lot of people have been requesting them in credit cards that's kind of what we focused on that's not to say that it won't arrive in the future though so yeah keep your ears open and I'm gonna take a drink of water now because I've been talking about I'll take all that Kyle took your premier oh yeah any any other questions anybody wants answered before jumping back into it cool my screen line all right screen is shared so let's let's jump into what the the broken token is so I'm actually I did a talk recently that was kind of similar to this where I was talking about actually the Mona Lisa and I think it's somewhere out on on YouTube and you can check it out but with this talk generally going to talk about similar things but with just a little bit different context as we've learned from our from our users and just had more experience with it so this talk basically relates to NF T's but is a general problem in the blockchain space the reason that we like to focus on NF T's is because they are so good at managing kind of the rights or the ownership to digital assets files or data specifically when it's actually stored on something like pinata so here's the problem let's say you're a developer trying to build something for the hack FS hackathon like many of you sitting here listening to this talk right now most likely you might be using a blockchain maybe something like aetherium that has a bunch of cool tools already built to make a DAP relatively easy to spin up however you probably already know that block chains are really quite bad at storing you know more than a couple of kilobytes of data on chain there they're actually quite bad at storing data on them and really block chains are there to answer kind of this simple question of do I own or have the right to something yes or no and the standard at this point is to store as much data what's considered off chain as possible to save on those gasp fees and you know just make it so your application can actually run without being extremely expensive so what we have is kind of this concept of off chain storage the problem is is that off trained storage kind of brings with it a bunch of other problems so first and foremost the security of the blockchain pretty much goes out the window obviously if you're if you're not putting the data on the chin on the blockchain you're basically losing all the benefits of it and currently most apps are actually using you know resorting to storing their data on traditional web to kind of infrastructure such as s3 or the like but this opens up new problems about you know the openness of the data and then actually the security of your apps data underneath and so we like to talk about this major concept within ipfs all the time about storing data on something like s3 just gives you a URL and URLs are actually quite bad at actually securing the data behind them and so what I mean by that is that URLs allow you to change the data the URL is is referencing well main painting the same link and this becomes a massive liability as it relates to blockchain applications so you can see here using an NF T if you were to mint an NF t on on aetherium or another blockchain and actually put a link within that NF t that represents an asset let's say it's this grayscale pinata image what you can see is that you can actually change out the image in in the grayscale pinata image can actually turn into you know the missing pinata image and so this this becomes a massive kind of liability or security risk for the data that's that's supposed to be represented by that NF T and so enters ipfs in my humble opinion ipfs is like the peanut butter to blockchains jelly this is because ipfs can also kind of be considered a global computer it's just that it's focused on the storage part and the key difference between ipfs and other storage methods is that ipfs stores data based on the content itself also known as content addressable data and this is versus a URL where it's based on where it's actually stored and so ipfs stores data based on the file and then you get something called the cid of their content identifier and this means that if the data behind the NFT ever changes the cid actually won't match and you can prove it so when Matt was going through and kind of giving us a you know a rundown of pinata and you're in the the pin Explorer you saw all of those hashes and all of those hashes represent a file and those hashes are unique or those c ids are unique to the file themselves and so what that does is as you can see on the slide here when the NFT actually has the link there that's referencing the grayscale pinata and then you tried to change the image behind it you actually end up getting a different CID and so what this does is protect you against data changing behind behind the scenes on you and so looking at it again pretty simple with a URL that references a file you can run into this problem where the data underneath can be swapped out but most of our users today are using NF T's and us in general for things like gaming assets or fairly low risk data so you know in this instance you know what's the harm of of just swapping out an image it's not you know a total end of the world kind of thing but what if the data was actually more expensive what if that NFT represented a file or data set that is extremely valuable and isn't just you know an image of something these could be things like records or representations of physical assets that you know could be worth quite a bit of money and the data behind it could be corrupted or you had no way to actually access it so like things like this are the things that we talk about a lot and and we have this conversation with the blockchain community and the ipfs community a lot stressing the importance of actually securing that data behind the blockchain or or the NFT itself and so the kind of example I want to use here is actually kind of about data transfer and so if you could imagine you created you know you're creating a aircraft engine let's say and while you're doing that in these new factories where you're creating these aircraft engines you're generating a lot of data about that engine as you're manufacturing it right so you might have I Oh T data with sensors that are pulling in data that precisely measures fit and finish on the engine or maybe you have temperature controls you know any kind of data you can kind of think of you know this is important data to keep precise just to make sure that the engine is actually being made correctly now that engine needs to actually transferred to another factory to be finished right it might be even a totally different company that's receiving this engine going through a different supply chain or something like that and complete the bill they they need that IOT data that the first Factory was creating but there's this problem where you don't actually know if the data is correct if that data were to be corrupted in any way it could create millions of dollars in damages to this aircraft engine right with traditional infrastructure and data handoffs this data could you know be corrupted by the engineer that is trying to manage it or it could be you know maliciously corrupted or you know there's kind of a bunch of scenarios you can envision where all of this important IOT data was was corrupted and then transferred you know to the to the next factory with all these problems in it and so it kind of becomes like a high-stakes version of the telephone game but with NF keys and ipfs links this scenario could actually be prevented so the original factory could simply just transfer the IOT data to a second factory with the relevant C IDs and guarantee or the you know the hashes of the data and guarantee that nothing has been lost or corrupted in the process so we really kind of think this is the future of data transfer is making sure that when you are transferring data it's based on those C IDs themselves and so you know to us creating C IDs is the most important thing that you could possibly do to secure and ensure that your data is what it's supposed to be so what's the plan to make this work you as a developer will you know use pinata in place of something like s3 to pin and create that CID hash on the ipfs network now there's a whole bunch of different ways you can do this but this is the easiest way and if you play with our API after this you'll understand how easy it can be to actually create that CID on pinata then you simply take that cid and associate it with an NF T or maybe even more simple you time stamp it on chain or you could even just track these C IDs in a simple database but at this point you've created a great way to manage data rights with the NFT on chain and then you have that secure data off chain using pinata and the ipfs Network and if your hack you know becomes something more like crypto kitties did back in the day or with the first eath waterloo or you know the way matt and ours did with pinata at eath berlin you'll be able to scale up with those with that data sitting on pinata so next steps obviously sign up for pinata if you haven't already I promise it'll make your your application easier to build and then second I'd check out some of our blogs and videos so we have a we have a ton of blogs and content out there about NF T's crypto voxels you know had large pieces of data so it's a relevant kind of thing but if you abstract some of these concepts to whatever you want to build it'll make a lot of sense for you who is responsible for NFT data we have discussions around dedicated IP FS networks how to handle scalability within ipfs matt has a bunch of great talks out there on YouTube and on the ipfs channel that you can watch as well that will just give you a great perspective we've spent a lot of time obviously working in ipfs and have ran into a lot of problems so we'd love to be able to kind of help you out there and you know we have spent a lot of time building in the decentralized web space outside of just creating creating pinata we built blockchain applications back in the day so to make it easy on yourself and avoid all the mistakes that Matt and I have made building gaps at you know eath global and beyond you know just check out pinata and to make that easier we have some API prizes we have four of them 250 bucks each we'd love to help make it easy to manage your your pins on ipfs and these will go to the best implementation of our API to ping their app data on ipfs and as old hackers that Matt and I were we would recommend doing this it's pretty easy too if you're using IP FS you may as well use us and get that easy 250 bucks as you're hacking so happy pinning and if there are any questions or anything like that would love to go from there you you you any questions let me double check the YouTube chat see if there's anything there it looks pretty clear oh one just popped up Matt do you want to cover this I'll cover the how long is pinata been running so we've been operating since late 2018 we've been running pinata so almost I guess over two years or almost two years now yeah so oh yeah Joshua that seems like you answered your own question yeah in for clarification there you can have a lot of pins it's just one one like replication per free account so there's a lot more you know a lot of pins on a free account as long as it's under a gigabyte small comparison with other paid services really I mean it just kind of comes down to what you're looking for some services are focused more around like like a bucket style kind of s3 style of implementation some are focused more around kind of like those deep nitty gritty things you want to do with ipfs we're really focused on just making things easy and fast and stable that's kind of those three things that we've talked about early on the talk that's those are our priorities we've they're kind of intentionally chosen to do less but do what we do do we wanted to be really good at it so I would say that's kind of a big comparison yeah when we when we're looking at adding features and things like that we take a lot of time to make sure we have a lot of users who agree that it actually needs that feature built out and we want to make sure that it's actually valuable to you and not end up cluttering cluttering the experience of actually using pinata so we try to keep it as simple as possible to use and then yeah does it cost more to pay locations yeah Matt already about already kind of touched on that any other questions you you awesome yeah you guys can obviously reach out to us in slack and talk with us and we'd be happy to help you with any questions you have we we have our own slack obviously you can join that one as well and have have a ton of conversations in there with our users and working through any problems that they might have awesome great thank you everybody for showing up like you said meet them in the slack just after that and I'm sure if if you couldn't think of a question now you'll encounter one later when you try to build on all right last minute question sneaking in just under the wire nice all right we're gonna wrap here we have two more sessions today one for textile and a little bit later for unsub's own domains yeah maybe I'll see you there if not see you in slack we just announced a new thing check out the showcase channel we are featuring hackers in a file point blog post if you want to write a little bit about what what inspires you to join PACA Fest the event and just generally why you care about building with web 3 decentralized technologies so be sure to check in there and drop a message and then the other thing we're doing is if you're out and about in your city snap a quick video with the hacker fast word somewhere in the video and then we're gonna compile all these hacker videos because we've got people from all around the world so the ideas that we want to celebrate that so just step a quick video if you feel inclined again these are not required but you're gonna be a fun thing to have at the end of the event people working in all different spaces different cities all around the world can be just you it could be your team yeah those are the two things we just announced so check out the hecka fest showcase channel for those I think that's it thanks again everybody so see you you
