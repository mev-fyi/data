[Music] [Music] welcome everybody my name is kartik i'm one of the co-founders of youth global and i want to welcome all of you to the hack money finale uh you're all watching this thing on youthglobal.tv and in case you haven't been on this website before i want to encourage all of you to quickly log in and say hi uh if you have any questions for the global team or anything about the event you can ask those questions here and we'll relay those directly onto the live stream and also for anybody who's joining in and participating you'll also get a co-app nft token for being a participant at the at the event so for those of you who don't know each global is an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard and bring on thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do this thing primarily by running hackathons and summits uh for hack money 2021 we did three summits where we did a kick-off summit where we talked about what is happening at a broad level on in in the world of d5 then on july 1st we hosted a summit all about mev and how that affects that defy and overall um eth2 and just ethereum in general and then on friday july 2nd we hosted the uniswap grants summit where we showcase everything that's happening in the incredible ecosystem of unit swap and how you can get involved in the ecosystem through grants and while all that was happening we also had a three week long hackathon where an amazing amount of people built so many incredible projects all touching various aspects of d5 am super happy to say that this has been youth global's biggest event in our four year history we had over 1100 developers participate from 75 different countries and they spent 19 different time zones on top of that for the three summits we had over a thousand people who are not the same hackers attending and uh watching everything from uh from afar trying to get more and more involved into this ecosystem and on top of that we also had over 170 sponsors and mentors come in to help out those thousand plus attendees uh representing from 50 different companies to help everybody build their projects we kind of put everybody on a map to see where everybody was participating from and it blew our minds on how diverse and spread out this uh attendee uh list and just everybody is from this event uh and in total we are also giving about three hundred thousand dollars in prizes uh from the hackathons from e global and various sponsors combined and we'll be going through who won what prizes uh later today in this meeting um i want to quickly thank so many amazing companies that were part of this event i want to specifically call out uni swap grants program compound grants program circle one inch ave state dao badger dow ethereum foundation superfluid findings and balancer also protocol labs kyber vega nexus mutual variable the graph liquidity uma 88 mph enzyme harmony paraswap element finance pillar polygon and flashpots oasis acropolis economy consensus umbrella gsn network streamer upshot starkware connects covalent idle finance pods finance instadap bitco chain link color finance and ens and matcha quan stamp lemniscap hermes protocol coinspect and saddle uh they've been incredible uh supporters for this event for the past few weeks and they've been super helpful to not only the attendees but also in helping out with so many amazing workshops and tech talks and getting more and more uh people involved into the web free ecosystem so overall this event has been absolutely incredible uh we could not be more happy on how things turned out and on on monday when submissions uh ended we had over 231 projects all touching defy come out of this hackathon we spent the last few days going through judging for all these projects um and after everything i'm super happy to announce that we have 16 finalists that we are going to be showcasing uh today in this call and uh they'll be coming on and demoing what they built over the course of the hackathon and uh and from there we'll go on and talk about the prices that you've won um from other sponsors so in no particular order i want to congratulate tesser medicis nostra swap variable finance polynomial protocol compound swaps stable finance lee finance irrevocable increment treasure biddle titan white oh claimable blockhead and splits these are 16 amazing teams that are going to come on and demo what they've done now as we were looking at all these teams uh we saw they all fit nicely into some of these really obvious categories so what we've done is we've divided them in guess protocols devtools and analytics thousand nfts and applications and they're gonna come on as a group uh and they'll co-present back-to-back if you've participated at uh any of our previous events uh you know that we usually bring on some special guests to kind of do a q a with our finalists but because of the incredible number of projects we saw uh we decided to bring on more teams here to demo uh so there won't be any q a this time around but we'll see an amazing set of back-to-back demos and we'll move on to the prizes and before we jump on to our our very first demo i want to really take a second and highlight that for all the 200 plus teams that were not on on the list before it doesn't mean you are not good enough it doesn't mean that you did something wrong or different uh we just wanted to highlight some projects that everybody found super creative and interesting that we wanted to broadcast to everybody out there but to all of you who spent the last month working on some interesting and amazing things and learned so many different things i want to encourage all of you to keep building i want to encourage all of you to continue asking for help on the global discord whether that's technical or anything else that we can do to help you take your project to the next step we'd be more than happy to continue building this alongside and make sure that you get all the help you need so congratulations to all 231 projects and i want to make sure that we recognize all the time and effort and hard work you put it into learning something new and for those of you who are watching this on the live stream if you are interested in getting a list of all the projects you can head over to showcase.ethglobal.com and see all 230 plus projects on on the website and check out all the demos and the videos and all the ones that you want to play with directly on on on their websites so uh with that we are ready for our first category of demos we're gonna bring on five incredible protocols uh and we're gonna start this off with lead finance so we have the lee finance team here i mean whenever philip and team are ready i'll ask them to turn their cameras on and showcase their demo so welcome all right hey so shaking my screen can you see me yep all right perfect hey guys so i'm philip from lee finance uh the finance is a cross-chain liquidity network aggregation protocol so what does it mean let's start with the problem users want to use steps these days and it's quite a cumbersome experience right because all their funds are spread across multiple chains and they have to turn to the community manager and ask them hey how can i bridge my my funds and all of that is quite complicated these days all of this takes too much friction and you want to simplify it luckily there are plenty of protocols that aim to bridge these funds much more efficiently than native bridges are doing first and foremost there is connects but there's also hop much any swap for chain all of them have different mechanisms on how to do the switching much some are very custodial some are very much non-custodial and we aim to aggregate all of them because they all have to fill up huge liquidity pools they're going to focus first and foremost on stable coins and native currencies so on top of aggregating all of them we will also connect to powers for one inch like dex aggregators and access from all chains in order to facilitate true any to any swaps across chains and we make that any to any swap available as a web front and as an interface but it will also be embeddable as a widget and of course be available or accessible via apis and contracts for the second thing um oh also of course for the arbitragers we also have landing protocols on board so it will be possible to do cross chain flash loans and cross chain borrowing especially for the arbitragers this is quite interesting for this hackathon we focus on connects power swap in one inch and made all of that available as a web front end to have a first prototype we of course support ens and we use covenant and the graph to gather all the necessary data to do so now i'm going to show you of the prototype in a small sped up video because a cross-chain swap still takes one and a half to four minutes and i want to make sure that you can see the whole user experience it's quite simple you select your chain and the target chain here you can see four different rules we we get that already right now in that prototype you can select your route manually in the future all of that is automated and happens be behind the surveys for more advanced users it will still be possible to select your own route let's say you want to pick a more secure one or a faster one or a cheaper one we will give you all the options but in the end all of that should be really simple and abstracted away so speeding things up here and the swap is almost done it only takes signing a few transactions and then you're done we really believe that in the future that developers shouldn't care about which chain to build on and it shouldn't bother them which liquidity network is being used on the on the back end side if we use payment solution providers today we also don't care which payment solutions are used in the back end or um and and furthermore um it should be just as simple as in the real world as it is today our next step is going to build that is going to be to build that widget the widget is going to be implemented as simple as google analytics just a small snippet and that developers can configure whitelist and blacklist their widget and the used liquidity networks as needed based on your own security level standards the team consists of three people right now it's adrian max and me we are all full stack developers while i take care of business development of course right now we are fundraising so please contact us on telegram and twitter there's a bitcoin grant follow us on twitter bookmark leader finance and i'm happy to chat thanks a lot thank you so much phillip and that was an incredible first demo for today uh we're going to move on to the next one and i want to welcome nostra swap to share their demo right hi everyone uh so my name is anna wood and along with my friends from sato and conor pat sakshai and we are from bangkok thailand and we are part of nasa swap team so nasa swap is a next generation amm that hopes to tackle uh by lowering the impermanent loss and also providing ethereum with a more robust price oracle the problems that we want to tackle are three parts so first we see that liquidity providers are taking the full burden on impermanent loss we see the on-chain price oracles are prone to price spikes and manipulations and we also see that on-chain price oracles often lag behind their off-chain counterparts so how do we do that it's actually pretty simple we break down our solutions into two parts the first part is to do with reducing the impermanent loss by introducing what we call a post-swap arbitarty so at the end of every transaction before the transaction end uh the trader who wants to swap and make the transaction not only that they will stop with nasa swap but nozzle swap will also perform an arbitrage with another third-party dex and if there is an arbitrage profit there uh the profit would be split between liquidity providers and traders in order to compensate for their impermanent loss and price slippage uh accordingly the second part of our solution is to do with price article where we want to introduce something we call limited price oracle price impact so what we would like to do is separate the trading price away from the oracle price and we impose a limit on the archive price so that its movement is always limited to a specific small number of percentage per second so as a result we are able to get a price oracle that's more accurate than a 30 minute dewob article while still being robust and being protected against uh against price bikes and manipulations so now on to performance test and demo so i'd like to show you here this is the spot price of uni swap usd c pool in may 2021 and i would like to focus you on two parts where on the left here we see a steep and sustained price drop and our second second scenario on the right side here where there is a flash drop of price on the using swap pool so if we compare it uh to to t-wap a 30-minute t-wap and i guess our announcer swap you can see that the 30-minute minute t-warp in dark green here lags behind while our nozzle swap oracle here follows pretty much the same as the the spot price and now if we look into the second scenario where there's a flashlight and comparing it to a two-minute t-walk you can see that uh the two-minute t-walk in dark green here suffers quite a bit of a price change while the nasa swap actually follows uh absorbed the the flash drop pretty smoothly and if you compare it to an off chain price oracle right you can see that uh with an off chain price article in blue and nozzle swap in purple here you can see that the price pretty much correct and follows along pretty well comparing to off-chain arc so now on to the demo of the interface right so i'm showing you here a liquidity a wallet that has liquidity here of one eve and one thousand ish worth of usdt what i'm going to show you next is i'm switching now to a trader wallet which is a different wallet and i'm going to swap one ease into a certain specific usdt here so you can do a swap here uh when metamask say i confirm what would happen is that for example we deployed onto rinkeby and here you can see that there is a swap transaction happens and d1 either got swapped but what you also see is that there is a 0.0001 either being transferred from the pool itself back into 0.x150 which is the trader wallet and this is the compensation that the trader gets for uh performing the extra gas for the arbitrage all right so now that i've shown you the the post swap arbitrage now i'm going to swap the the amount from usdt back into eve so that i can show you the liquidity that i provided and see how it's compared to the original liquidity right so now i'm back to the liquidity provider wallet and now i'm going to show you my refresh my liquidity and you can and you can see that from here uh what we are getting is 1.37 east and also 4 000 is usdt which is uh the the profit that we get from the post-war arbitrage and if we compare it back and compare it to and generate the api from here you can see that we get about 8.54 percentage of apy from the profit of this arbitrage if you think this is a cool idea we are about to deploy this to to mainnet as our beta so please follow us on twitter at twitter.com and would also be love to we'll also love to get in touch with any partnership and collaboration thank you amazing well thank you so much for that really awesome demo and also walking us through those simulations on managing prices so uh with that we're ready to move on to our next demo and that is polynomial protocol and i'll have katherine team share their demo hi everyone we are presenting polynomial protocol polynomial provides deep liquidity for d5 options uh i'm gautam with salman and mubarak we are from india we have we made polynomial protocol so what's the problem so currently there are a lot of option protocols in d5 but the liquidity is fragmented so this results in a steep price for the option premium so we we we managed to solve solve this problem by creating a managed liquidity position which we rebalance frequently using black shells pricing mechanism so uh so the managed liquidity position is in unisa b3 in a close price range and the liquid is liquidity is rebalanced frequently to reflect the fair option premium now the call options that we have currently are created using uma's protocol for long short library and the rebalancing is done using black shells pricing mechanism and we use chain link price feeds for that so let's dive right into the demo it's uh presently available on hackathon.polynomial.fi uh for a normal user uh they can just come to our ui and uh you just select an expiry let's say for uh 2500 on july 30 you can just buy and we'll redirect you directly to unicef for for a normal user it's as simple as that you buy an option directly from unicef and that's it and you just swap it right over here uh for an option winder uh so what he has a lot of options here to do choices to do so here you can click and up and create a new option if he doesn't find an option uh which he wants to win you just select the strike price and you just create an option that's it it's as simple as that and uh other otherwise they can mint an option let's say uh over here uh for july 30 for 2500 the same one i want to mention option so i enter an amount it's a 0.5 i minted it was approved earlier so the transaction gets processed i have an example of a transaction here so what happened over there is that the 0.5 dropped it it got converted into two tokens a long token and a short token this long token represents the option uh which upon selling uh via like an exchange like unicef uh the user can't collect the mender can collect the premium and the the short token will represent a tokenized covered call at that moment uh otherwise uh let's say oh that transaction so if the user doesn't decide to sell it he can also deposit in a pool so you just enter the amount and then you add liquidity it's also pretty straightforward so i also have an example for something like that sorry yeah so uh what happened over here is that uh the the long token which is the option and the rav t which is our collateral at that at this time both got deposited and the user will get a polynomial uh liquidity token which represents his position in the in the option and the price is rebalanced uh frequently uh using black shells pricing mechanism to ensure that the price is always in the right position so this is what happened over here and so this is a current transaction gonna close it so suppose if a uh position is not uh or if a liquidity pool is not already there a user can add a liquidity pool by creating a liquidity pool so for the strike price 5000 that was not security full existing so at the initial time uh the price is determined by black shells pricing mechanism as well uh so you can see that those are the main functionalities other than that over if i go to my portfolio i can see all the options which i have uh and these are the cool questions which i have and if i go to the options which i have uh this option got expired and here i can press settle and i can settle my option or else i can redeem an option if the expiry is like in the future so i just enter an amount and i get to redeem the option you can also withdraw from your pool let's say like 5000 the expiry is already passed i can withdraw directly and it's pretty straightforward and simple and uh that's it uh let's go back so currently like we provide deep liquidity for options so this we may we want to make sure that the options have better prices at the moment in the future we want to add option aggregation so we have only um at the moment so we want to add other option protocols such as sports finance open etc and bring all of the options of the same strikes price and expiry into a single pool and we also plan to launch in a couple of months so reach out to us thank you thank you so much gotham and that was a really awesome demo um we're already getting a bunch of questions from from the audience so what i would say is that even though we can ask a lot of those questions because of time here on this call if all of the finalists want to just log into his global.tv and just answer those directly we can totally have that um going on in parallel so next up we have variable finance and uh we'll have sujit come and present the demo hey guys so we are team variable finance and here is what we did we did an approval manager and an on-chain trooper cell network here is our team myself sujit and saran and ed we are from different time zones it is from uk and we both are from india and here is what we used for building this we use chain link for price oracles and infuria ipfs and the graph protocol and we also use finish web token compo and token circle dollar and trapped btc for payment options inside our application so why do we did this so the main question is people are uh accepting payments more in smart contracts and that should be an easy mechanism for everyone to process any kind of payments inside their application and also erc20 approval is been in discussion for a while it is it is a fact that uh it it creates a security vulnerability for users because we are approving many applications without any uh track of it so here is some uh statistics for uh what we did in our project before uh do before starting it so one in every three transaction in the three tokens that we explored was the approval transaction so if this much amount of cash fees are wasted and the network is inflated by approval transaction then we have to do something about it so here is our architecture we have an approval manager that controls the entire blue for cell network so approve it once here spend it anywhere where you go so i'm going to uh explain about the first part so it could be it should be the merchant solution so anyone who has um who wants to be become a merchant in our application can do this so you just put in your normal information and this image is uploaded to ipfs and you don't need to do anything more than just filling out this form this is completely decentralized we don't have any update mechanism inside it so when you just click on register uh you would be prompt to metamask and i'm just in increasing the gas fee so that you can get it quickly okay so that's it uh to become a merchant you just need to fill up this form this form is uploaded to ipfs so now the registration is successful so you will have your pointer registered to the network and you will have a ipfs hash for yourself and if you just come into your merchant list you could see that i just got registered so that's it this is fetched from the graph protocol so now i'm going to uh pay uh to the merchant that i have created recently so i'm just switching the wallet so i'm just connecting to metamask everything is completely decentralized and powered by changeling i'm just putting in uh the oracle of the new merchant that i have created and i'm just putting in the amount as uh 10 so that could give me an estimation of this much wrapped btc this is calculated from ipfs sorry this is calculated from chain link and then i'm just confirming the payment and that's it so you can just virtually pay any merchant anywhere uh any erc20 token so that's what we are focusing on currently uh everyone is able to process only the popular tokens but we want to open up a new space for every token to be accepted as payment so i think okay so uh this is how the payment should work so i have paid the equivalent amount to the merchant and if i just log into the merchant dashboard again by switching to the merchant account so i could see like uh i should uh get something into my wallet that was paid so you can uh the merchants can scan this uh print out the this qr code and just paste it to anywhere any brick and mortar store can be able to browse any erc20 tokens payments now the second part of our application would be the approvals manager and this is an ethereum magnet so i'm just switching to ethereum mainnet uh this is basically a simple thing you can everyone can manage all the tokens that all the projects that they have approved uh in their lifetime so you can see that i have approved uh to a metamask router a while ago but i don't know what i did and how it got approved here so by just clicking uh this thing i was able to i'll be able to change this approval to some some amount and again it's an ethereum magnet so it would take a while so i'll just show exactly how it works so uh previously i was the one who changed this approval to one so this is pretty much it and uh we are in future we are trying to implement uh in smart contract payments email notifications and stuff email invoicing payment solutions like traditional payment systems if you want to try it try us out just uh head to variable.finance and we are looking forward to hear from you thanks amazing thank you so much and with that we are ready for our last demo in the protocol category and that is increment so i'll have michael present increment thanks kartik hey everyone my name is michael uh i'm here to i'm excited to here to present increments a 4x derivatives protocol that we have built at hackmoney 2021. here is our amazing team with marcus owen joe chinmay and myself and what is the problem that we're trying to solve from this chart you can see that u.s dollar peg stable coins dominate the market however d5 is global individuals and businesses move in and out of crypto through their local currencies hence they are exposed to 4x risks our solution is to build an on-chain 4x derivative instrument on polygon that empowers anyone including suppliers and borrowers and ave to hedge against forex price movements from the chart below you can see that we've built a mvp here at pac money for forex perpetuals and we do have a vision for future work so how do our forex perpetuals work first you deposit funds on increments which will be built on polygon then utilize these funds as collateral to open long or short positions we want to support multi-collateral assets such as a tokens usdc et cetera then the system will mint the corresponding amount of virtual assets into a virtual automated market maker for price discovery so then the contract contract price would change accordingly some use cases would include hedging arbitrage on exchanges like fcx as well as lowering forex costs etc next i will show you a demo of our product so as you can see here um you visit increment.finance here and you click on the top right button and you start on our dashboard so first i want to deposit some funds i will deposit 30 usdc as you can see here this is on the coven network i will approve the deposit here common test network and as this approves you should be able to see our 30 dollars here are holdings in just a second here there you see it and then we go to our market we have a chain link price as well as a contract price and now we will submit a long position with our collateral at a 5x leverage confirm now as that's happening let's go back to our dashboard and that's pending the transaction meter is pending and should complete in a second here and you should be able to see our open positions show up right below here with our market size entry price market price let me just refresh the page there you can see that here and now if you go back to the market the contract price has actually moved up because we've opened a long position and we can also close our position confirm now waiting for that transaction to go through and once that happens we are allowed to withdraw our funds back into our meta mask so that's complete as you can see that position has been closed and now we can withdraw that fund those funds back into our metamask confirm and you can see it's 470 usdc here right now and a second boom 500 usdc so that's our demo and this is a market of um this is a 700 billion dollar market and we believe that our competitive competitive advantage lies in our uvps such as supporting multi-collateral mm based liquidity layer 2 scalability and our focus on 4x derivatives using chain link 4x oracles as well as other integration for the path forward in the short term we want to focus on our perpetuals platform implementing more features adding additional support for collateral as well as ui ux optimization documentation and tutorials now long term we hope to integrate with ave which means that we want to empower ave users to supply or borrow on ave and hedge against forex risks in one single transaction you also want to build more derivative instruments such as options and forward agreements that brings us to the end of our presentation thank you eth global and hack money for such an amazing experience check us out at increment.finance and here's our twitter handle feel free to connect with us our dms are open for any collaboration and opportunities thank you so much thank you so much michael it was an awesome demo and uh this concludes our five protocols uh i just want to make a quick observation here that so many of these are are ready to be on mainnet and we have such a wide spectrum of interesting ways to think about amms to new primitives like managing forex directly to options uh protocol that handle liquidity from unispot v3 and just so many incredible ways to bring more and more user adoption to d5 so congratulations to all five of these teams if i'm already seeing a lot of activity on the chat there on the global.tv so if you have more questions for any of these teams feel free to ask those questions there directly and the members here will be happy to answer those questions for you so uh that concludes the protocols category uh next up we have the nfts and dows and we have three projects we want to highlight now we have splits irrevocable and treasure biddle so uh with that we'll kick us off with our first demo and abram will present splits great thanks kartik we are team splits i'm abram i worked on the front end and my partner will built the back end we're both in the us i'm on the east coast bulls on the west coast splits the protocol to trustlessly route funds to participants based on ownership percentages the first step is to create a split each split must have at least two recipients and the ownership across recipients must add to be 100 as the split earns funds the balance increases and at any point in time the recipients of the split are able to claim their funds we made this for a few reasons we wanted a lightweight lightweight and trustless profit sharing tool for groups of people we're interested in the squad wealth building space and feel that this is more lightweight than setting up a dow we also wanted to expand on prior art from platforms like mir and foundation who have built similar functionality focused mostly around nfcs and auctions we focus on two areas specifically improving gas to fit gas efficiency by bulking actions together and making splits recursive so that recipients of splits can actually be splits so let's jump into the product once you've connected your wallet you're able to see your dashboard on your dashboard you can see lifetime earnings how much you've claimed and what funds are claimable by you um you're also able to see the splits that you're earning from and the splits that you've created so let's go through and create a new split this split is going to be something that will and i use for consulting work so when we build a client the client will be able to just pay this one split and it'll be split evenly between the two of us so first i'm going to enter in my address and then i'm going to enter in wills we're going to split this evenly okay great the split was created you can now see that we haven't earned anything from it but that i own fifty percent of it so now as a client let's go through and deposit some funds so there are two eth for the work that we did we're gonna send it to the split okay that was confirmed and so now there's two each that's sitting in the split waiting to be distributed so when i go through and split these funds this is going to make the funds claimable for all the recipients in the split okay great that worked so now if we go back to the dashboard we can see that my claimable funds have increased so i was added one more eth because there have been two easts added to this split and i own 50 of it so before i claim my funds i'm also going to split the fund sitting in this because uh i have ownership here as well so let's split these funds great okay so now in one action i can claim these funds across all of the splits that i'm receiving from and once i claim these you should see the balance increase to 15. okay so that's the process of how you create fund split and claim your splits how we made this the balances for splits and recipients are stored on chain in one large monolithic traffic contract and the split details are stored in event logs passes call data and verified by hashing the stack that we built this includes solidity hard hat type chain ethers used app next react tailwind and typescript some of the things we want to explore in the future include incentivizing the distribution of funds across split recipients uh adding proxy contracts for simple transfers into the splits adding stable coins and other erc20 tokens and farming yield with escrow funds so thanks for listening you can follow us on twitter at with splits thank you so much abram that was an awesome demo and uh with that we are ready to move on to our second demo for this category and that is very revocable so we're promoting the team shortly and whenever the team is ready they can start their demo hi my name is david choi and we are irrevocable a liquidity protocol for nft options our team is conrad b and msl based in chicago puerto rico and puerto rico individually we have worked in art finance i bought nfts bought crypto funds using a sniper bot and create a lot of apps so a bit of context here nearly nearly all high-end auction art sales by sotheby's or christie's are offered a certain price for better known as a guarantee or an irrevocable bid about 47 of these option sales are guaranteed by third party or the auction place itself whereas in the nft world new and shiny as it is there aren't many price supporting tools like an ipo market maker unless you sell your nft through christmas and this is what we wanted to bridge and to give a recent example the guarantor of the salvador mundi by davinci made 135 million without even owning the artwork because he guaranteed a certain price so let's do all this on chain irrevocable provides a trustless smart contract for entity sellers to guarantee a certain price floor with a pre-option agreement with a third-party guarantor there's a lot of uncertainty and security before an auction and so before an auction starts the seller can come in knowing that the nft will always sell at a certain price even if the hammer price is lower should it be higher the irrevocable protocol kicks in and the seller has to be willing to share a bit of the surplus gains with a guarantor this is similar to a put option but designed to hedges for the uncertainties and volatility of not a spot price on exchange but the english auction hammer price which is the highest and final bit of an escalating auction let's give it a try so when you jump on our on our website um you can actually choose an ft uh from your wallet by connecting to it um and then provide all the basic information and just to give an example just choose an nft and you can just you can do the initial price which isn't the guaranteed price um it's just the starting price and auction and the percentage split which is the most important um we already did that just to go through a few steps and we deposited the nft into an escrow contract um from there you can get a guarantor link which is the link you send to your your guarantor um and i will also role play that role um and then the guarantor provides the price back and deposits that commitment um and then commits that commitment and then gets a bid key which is encrypted to be sent back to the consignor so once the consignor gets the bid key he gets all the information of the guarantee the guarantee guarantor says it's worth at least three yes but he's protecting that floor so i i am very happy with that price and i will approve and this is also structured as a key in-hole structure because you can actually send it to multiple guarantors and you can receive back multiple offers and reject one on index of the other this is also structured using time expiry vaults so if anything happens you can just wait until a few days later and you get everything back including the nft as well as your cash now that every now that the guarantor is approved we can actually start the auction and we send it out to opencv directly from the home so we can now visualize putting on a top hat and a monocle and uh anime profile tag and become really expensive do that right here the switch has a bitter and we can look at the auction life that's happening which is the initial price and the guaranteed price is actually hidden so i'm going to say that this is worth 10 which is significantly higher than the guaranteed price so now that it's submitted the designer can go back and actually see all the bits that are happening through mobile this is uh i mean i'm guessing you want to want to choose the highest price unless he's your enemy so you accept the price and you confirm you also have the gantorbid if there are no prices above that price so it's always the floor they can accept and afterwards you can review the price and see how everything has split between the different players so our goal is to essentially overcome the limitations of reserve bid auction systems and we want to create a guaranteed liquidity and sale of entities at all times especially because these are beveled goods their word to not sell is a big damage to the underlying value of these expensive assets we will wait momentarily before it's completed we also decided that the seller controls the percentage and the guarantor decides the price this way you can get the fastest way to nash and half the fastest agreement and here we go we have the split and the divide between the two different contracts and the split to the to the variable parties in any case in our future designs that we want to do this guarantee is actually an essential component to something that already happens and it's actually the number one use case for collateralizing art so people actually collateralize their art and don't actually put up cash to guarantee it's a very common structure are for art sake almost um so you can use a kryptolisa to guarantee a salvador axe essentially and it's a very common structure it's capital efficiencies cash secondly uh we also want to introduce liquidity mining for anything above that the guarantee because anybody that's bidding above the guarantee can get a percentage of upside so you can have multi-party peer-to-peer peer to pool instead of just peer-to-peer what we have now in any case we want to thank hackmoney for letting us present and be part of this projects um and having everything coordinated and this is irrevocable thank you for listening follow us on twitter and message me on telegram and this is a visualizer that we'll have attached later in the future amazing thank you so much david that was a really awesome way to bring what happens in real world to to define smart contracts so with that we are ready to move on to our last time we're in this category and i'll let veronica talk about treasure battle thanks kartik so hi we are treasure biddle um built by the most decentralized team you can imagine we have thornton all the way from australia and myself from south africa on the smart contracts and on the front end we have alfredo from costa rica staff from israel and jason from the usa it all started with a problem dows have been moving towards centralized voting tools like snapshot as well as centralized execution powers through multi-sigs to reduce costs but this has fundamentally compromised the decentralized nature of dows this trend started as a response to higher gas costs as it was an easy fix and the best solution out there until now with treasure biddle you can create complex multi-step transactions as nfts on chain and execute them through our treasure planets so what does that mean when you create a transaction through the front end all the information that you need to make that transaction like a target address function signature get passed to the treasure map contract where they are processed and encoded to create an executable treasure map our product can be split into three main sections the treasure maps are modified elc 721 tokens that store the required encoded transaction calls maps are generated from the raw function signatures allowing for easy decoding and verification treasure planets are simple treasury contracts able to execute treasure maps treasure planets are owned by nfts allowing for daos and multisigs to use the admin functionality without needing to customize any code implementations our beautiful front end allows you to build treasure maps with some popular d5 protocols such as ave compound stakedown balancer and uni swap this enables a wide range of use cases from verified dow star coordination through guaranteed execution parameters decentralizing off chain voting by restricting execution to pre-approve tokens to pre-build emergency functionality instead of blind trust voters can have verified certainty in the ramifications of their vote so on to the demo so first things first of course we need to connect our wallet now we can actually generate a treasure planet give it a second lovely um i think we just need to reload great we'll give that a second to figure itself out in the meantime though we can create a treasure map so treasure maps are just a simple transaction builder nothing nothing nothing too new here um and as you can see as we enter the inputs the values change from the treasure planet as a whole so here i'm just going to swap across uh we're deployed on rink b and coven so i'm just going to swap across to rink b for this test uh and back to my other wallet okay cool so here we can see a treasure map that's already been deployed you can see here the already encoded transaction values that will actually be run when we execute this map so here we're going to execute it from a treasure planet lovely so we'll give it a hot second to execute uh and here you can see the execute logic so it um takes in it gets the targets values and call data from the treasure map and then just iteratively loops through them to actually execute them um okay we'll give that a second so the smart contract architecture is relatively simple treasure planets are deployed by a factory which handles the linking of the planet to the token's ownership treasure maps are self-standing meaning you don't have to use a treasure planet to actually take advantage of treasure maps anyone can mint and map but once they're minted they're immutable the smart contract architecture from treasure battle will be integrated into the atlanta style framework which is a new unopinionated novel collection of essential dial components built for l2 so thank you for your time and attention thank you so much that was an awesome demo and uh congrats to all three teams so when i just say thank you again to splits they're revocable and treasure biddle um just as a theme all these are making working with nfcs and dials a lot easier uh and they are also ready to be protocols at the end of the day so um that was our first eight demos and uh i want to thank all those eight teams and everybody who's uh chatting and asking all these amazing questions on on the chat there um we have eight more projects to go that i really want to highlight and then show case everybody before we do that i want to take a quick five minute pause here and announce some prizes uh before we go on to the rest of the demos and we have more prizes to announce at the end of those eight demos but uh we'll start off with uh some of the presenter sponsor prizes so we asked some of them to make videos for who won their prizes so we have some videos playing from our sponsors so first we'll have badger and alex talk about who won the badger prizes so we'll play that video soon these are the badger dao hack money 2021 winners first of all we have the pool price which is two thousand dollars split amongst the following projects hippodrome enzyme vaults wbtc curve strat shuffang dao moon and defo and now for the winners of the top three strategies the number one strategy goes to the wbtc curve yield strategy for five thousand dollars the second strategy is the shuffang strategy for three thousand dollars and then the third strategy is dao moon for two thousand dollars thank you very much for your submissions and awesome those were some of the bad surprises and i'll just announce it for everybody as well and and if you uh missed it don't worry i will be oh this video actually will be available on youtube and we'll be posting all of this thing on discord with the full list and also on email so uh just to summarize we have a wbtc perfect strategy for badger dow as the first five thousand dollar first prize winner uh we have uh shufeng zoo who won the three thousand dollar second prize from badger and we have down moon we won two thousand dollars for the third prize uh and then for the pool prizes we have six projects that will be splitting two thousand dollars evenly uh and that compromises of uh comprises of uh 16 individuals so all 16 individuals from these six projects will now get a equal split of two thousand dollars at least sharing all those details with you shortly next up we have superfluid and we'll have francesco talk about the one superfluid prizes hello everyone i'm francesco from superfluid and here are our hack money prizes now if your name is not in the list don't worry we had some really amazing projects this time around and you've all won part of our three thousand dollar prize pool so here go our prizes simple check out super cyan two thousand five hundred dollars congratulations on the ux guys for stream two from d5 volta finance great implementation and sick design and now for a truly incredible implementation uh on the streaming exchange stream swap everybody should check this one out and for our last prize erc 777 token distributor very useful product for everyone building open source now i'm super excited to keep building real-time finance with you and i'll see you all in our discord cheers awesome and uh just to summarize uh super saiyan won 2 500 in die for the simple checkout prize category volta finance is getting 1500 and die for their stream saving category uh stream swap is getting 1500 and die for stream exchange category and erc 777 token distributor is getting 1500 and die for the best use of 777 tokens and 37 projects are going to be winning the pool prize splitting 3 000 evenly and that is 101 individuals that will be getting that equal split next up we have a balancer and fernando will be talking about who won to balance our prizes from bouncer i'm pleased to announce our winners today the first place big winner getting eight thousand dollars is stream swap stream swap is an amm for super fluid tokens super tokens so the super fluid protocol can stream tokens between accounts and this project uses a modified balancer pool to enable users to exchange the super token flows so one user getting a one uscc per month flow can exchange it for a one a one dollar equivalent of btc stream so that's pretty cool our second place is standardized tenderize is a liquid staking hued aggregator you can tenderize your stake and it has native elastic supply tender tokens that are packed one to one to the state test assets and they can be traded freely which is pretty cool the supply adjusts to the we dude and the balancer pull weights are atomically adjusted to prevent impermanent loss so those are our big winners thank you all like all teams that worked on balancer it's been really cool and see you next year bye amazing um that was fernando with the two prizes and just to summarize dream swap is going to be winning eight thousand dollars for the first price of the best use of bouncer and tenderize is going to be winning four thousand dollars and uh our next video is from concourse grants program so we'll have adam talk about who won the compound prizes hey everyone i'm adam from compound labs and we're excited to award twenty five hundred dollars to team decentralized remittance for the compound supply bounty twenty five hundred dollars to team default swap protocol for the borrow bounty and twenty five hundred dollars to team tiramisu for the best open source interface for compound congratulations to all of the winners we had a hard time selecting winners because there were so many original and well-rounded projects in this hackathon the work that everyone put in is inspiring to me and my fellow compound community members to all the hackers that use compound please join the grants channel in the compound discord and we can discuss furthering your projects there i'll see you then awesome and just to summarize we have decentralized remittance winning 2500 usdc default swap protocol winning twenty five hundred dollars in usdc and tiramisu also winning twenty five hundred dollars in usdc and then also uh 19 projects qualified for the compound grants pool prize and 46 individuals will be splitting 2500 um equally for this category then we have ave uh treasure biddle is going to be winning seven thousand dollars in usdc for the best use of ave protocol we have deep fin who's going to be winning 3 000 in usdc as the second price and envelopes is going to be winning two thousand dollars in usdc for the third price for the besties ave then we have circle we have yield swap that's going to be winning seven thousand dollars in usdc right or die winning three thousand dollars in uscc for the most practical solution and widow winning two thousand dollars in usdc for also the most practical use of circle uh api then we have one inch and we have solaris winning two thousand dollars in one inch tokens for the best use of margin trading application uh then we have staked out uh we have a lot of prizes for steak towel we have tesser winning thirty six hundred dollars as a top prize split and then tenderize splitting the other half of the top prize we have symphony finance winning eighteen hundred dollars treasure biddle again winning fifteen hundred ride or die winning seven fifty dollars for fourth prize and g yield winning seven fifty and then we have the union swap grants program and we have uniswap v3 liquidity balancer as the first place winner with four thousand dollars in usd uh we have treasure bridle winning four thousand dollars in usd d5 toolbox winning two thousand dollars in usd and polynomial protocol winning two thousand dollars in usd and with that we are ready to resume to the next eight demos for our final list and the next category is dev tools and analytics so we're gonna kick us off with blockhead and uh we'll be sharing the demo again we'll be showing the demo of how it's going to work um and what the blockhead is and now we're going to just balance out the live demo versus recorded video so as we promote daryl we'll get that started and then we'll have claimable and white oh come and present so without further ado let's welcome daryl hello eat global i'm daryl our friend and developer and designer and i'm on a mission to build the single best user interface for tracking your crypto assets throughout the ethereum multiverse and beyond i'm excited to share with you the third iteration of blockhead a web app featuring a crypto and nft portfolio tracker a block explorer for multiple avm compatible blockchains and a brand new feature for hackmoney 2021 a dynamically generated dashboard interface for all of your favorite device apps let's get right into it on the portfolio view you can enter wallet addresses from any evm compatible chain or connect your wallet providers directly and you'll quickly get an overview of all your tokens d5 balances and nfts in one place you can customize this interface almost any way you like by reordering items showing extra metadata or hiding sections you don't need if you want more details about a particular account click on its address and you'll be taken to your transaction history in the explorer view here you can filter transactions by a particular token and even drill all the way down to the individual smart contract event logs this explorer view works with multiple evm compatible blockchains including ethereum polygon binance smart chain avalanche c chain and phantom opera i intend to keep building this and get into a state where you won't need to switch to either scan or polygon quite as often as most c5 users are doing right now as you might have noticed from the loading animations and annotations throughout the ui blockhead is pulling information from a wide variety of data sources including covalent zapper chainlink the graph and the ethereum json rpc api one of my design goals is to make blockhead a data agnostic interface that embraces all of these different approaches to querying blockchain data while being as transparent and educational as possible going along those lines i'm starting to expose some options to help you the user stay in control this menu at the bottom lets you choose to show default balances from either zapper or zarion zapper has a centralized api with lots of rich metadata while xerion has deployed a smart contract aggregating data from multiple d5 protocols since xerion's data is on chain you can choose to route requests to infiora or any of these other json rpc providers as you'll see there are many approaches to querying blockchain data each with different trade-offs in terms of privacy accuracy speed and decentralization so i made sure blockhead is flexible and transparent in letting you choose where your data comes from and how it gets to you all right now let's click on one of these protocols to visit the brand new defy ops view here we have an interface generated for defy dad's ethereum address based on his past activity with the compound protocol it looks like he's got a negligible amount of cop token and also deposited some dye to earn some interest if we switch over to curve zaryan says he's invested in a stable coin liquidity pool and also has some vested governance tokens and we can switch over to zapper for a more detailed view of that liquidity pool and if you get rid of his address you'll now get a dashboard with an overview of all the tokens contracts and metadata associated with each of these default apps as a whole basically a single device dashboard contains one or more views and a view is defined as an avm compatible chain associated with metadata for tokens nfts smart contracts and so forth along with mappings to zerion or zapper or the graph so blockhead is actually pulling all this data from a big configuration file i put together this past month in order to generate these interfaces on the fly finally i'll go over some extra features that i've added for a few of these apps for ave i've embedded avote which is a custom governance dashboard i created a while ago and it features interactive tree map visualizations for the voting power for the liquidity protocol i've created a widget that lets you select from multiple front-end operators since liquidy doesn't have one of his own and eventually i'm considering porting the reference react front end to felt so that blockhead can become a liquidy front-end operator too and finally for connext and etherspot i've started implementing a ui for opening state channels so that users can easily transfer their assets across different evm compatible chains you can choose from any of the accounts you've added from the portfolio view to start the transfer process i hope you'll find blockhand to be an indispensable tool for bringing visibility into all your crutch of activity please try it out at blockhead.info and if you have feedback or want to support future updates please visit my new page on getcoingrants or contact me on discord or twitter thanks again youth global for hosting me and thank you for all your support amazing thank you so much darrell it was a really awesome demo and uh uh just as a reminder to everybody who's already asking you can go to blockade.info and check out the page live um next up we have claimable and we'll have calvin demo what he built thank you katy so hi um this is calvin pack i'm the creator of claimable so what is claimable um playmobil is a smart contract that allows you to schedule a token transfer it works similar to stock option grant you can specify a cliff and a vesting period it can be used for trustless investor token release or incentive token grants for employees so what is a typical start option grant looks like usually spreads out over four years and there's going to be a one year cliff so every month you will be unlocking 1 48th of the token worth but during the first year there's going to be nothing available because there's going to be a cliff on day one of year two 25 of the tokens will immediately be available because it's over the cliff and then subsequently every month you will receive 1 48 of the total token grant so what happens in um what what if the recipient for example an employee leaves the company let's say in year three so what's going to happen is anything that's not vested will be returned to the rental so um essentially this contract is being revoked that's another very useful use case is for um especially for crypto projects so investors typically will sign sap and transfer usdt and um instead of doing a menu transfer from the project owner we can set up a claimable token contract from the project so the project can transfer whatever total amount the investor are entitled to into this claimable smart contract and that's going to be a long period lot period could vary from months to years during lock period if the investor want to come in and see how much they unlocked and during the investor period they can view the numbers but they cannot receive any tokens until the cliff happens meaning the law period is over then the tokens will be unlocked and make it available in the claimable smart contract now during any time after the cliff the investor can come in and claim the tokens and receive the vested token until it's 100 invested then the plain token can be um received in in total and also you can set it up so um this contract cannot be revoked um in that case um that there's not going to be any chance that um the critical project can back out so how do you actually create um a claimable ticket so i'm going to do a demo on remix so step number one is always make approve your smart contract and then once it's approved you can create um by entering the token address meaning the token you're gonna be granting and then there's gonna be beneficiary it's gonna be the recipient and amount and cliff and investing for demo purpose i set a clip to zero and the investing period to four days so um let's transcend and take a look so while we are waiting for um transaction to go through um i wanna show you actually in claimable you can assign to multiple beneficiaries so you can do a batch creation with the same amount or with different amounts so now we just created a ticket let's see the latest ticket number is number 14 and we can check um how how many tokens are unlocked right now so it's still showing zero because we just create created this ticket and after one block time um it's on ranking right now you see um there's some token available right now um okay i need to check ticket 14 and probably we're gonna see more as more blocks being mined so let me switch account to the recipient account so i can make a claim so when you want to clean um it's very simple if your wallet has a clean ticket then you can just click the clean button and then you will be receiving it um let me take a look at a transaction um so let's see so this is a transaction um before it shows all the details i will go back to my slides and show you um the uh chat ticket status is something that i've just shown you so the difference between unlock and available is because um unlock shows you all the token that's unlocked but it's not always available because there's gonna be a cliff um before the cliff nothing is available it always shows zero so after the cliff the unlock number and available number will be the same so afterwards um for any unlocked token you can see um actually receive 1.736 token that's the portion that's being unlocked so there's also i want to show you a a cliff period um sorry um probably i need to um do um okay i'll skip that demo i so you can actually revoke oh you know why because i was using the recipient account so i have nothing to revoke um so number one i can show you um actually i can revoke the ticket and ticket 14 and what's gonna happen is like all the un unclaimed token will be returned to me so here's the transaction um and before we can show it um i'm gonna move on so there are other queries you can see and the most frequent question i receive is like can you actually deposit unused with the token that's locked so the way to do it is just to um put your token into a u-vault and then um deposit the u-token into the claimable this one this way it's very composable and then it's not really um uh it will lower the gas cost and everything so the next step is to complete a ui submit for a security audit and actually launching it um for the mainnet so before i finish you'll see um the unclaimed token now is returned to the bronzer so that's it thank you so much thank you calvin that was a super interesting primitive that i that i hope becomes more common in everything in d5 uh and next up we have our last project for this category and that is widow so i'll have roman present whiter hey everyone i'm super excited to show you what we've been up to at widow by the way everything that i'll show today is live we've launched it like one hour ago so go ahead and check join widow to see it yourself just a bit about the team my name is roman engineering and product experience i worked at microsoft and various startups then we have canal amazing engineer from facebook and google and now we are building widow and why do we want to make defy accessible by everyone we're really strong believers that defy is gonna transform the traditional finance and it's gonna unlock opportunities to everyone is going to make things more efficient yet accessing default today is really complex we need to learn a lot the ui or user experience is tricky so we want to fix that and we've decided we want to start with yearn dot finance because we really like the product we really like the team and we like the community let me show you what i mean by that so i am inside why earn sorry i i'm worried that i'm not screen sharing uh so i'll show you what i mean i'm inside wire now uh here are all the vaults uh inside here let me let me open the crv usdp vote and the details here i can see it's been growing by 9.6 percent yearly this is pretty cool i mean uh it's a very good number but the problem here is that it changes with every block so in a few seconds this number can actually be different uh what if we can see you know how has it been performing over the last weeks or months so let me open up why though this is the very same uh you know set of volts that you can see inside yearn it's just much better ui so you can see all of the volts here and this is the crv usdp voltage we talked about that here but instead of just showing you the growth number today we show you how has it been performing over the last you know month so it used to be a 25 on june the 10th it's been grown it's been you know declining very steadily over the last month the same for total deposits it's 24 million today but it used to be at 66. so the message here is very clear people are really clearly abandoning this ball they are moving away to something some better place uh what if we can show you what what is the better place what if we can show you much more information about how does this whole thing work let me open up this um crv btc vault to show you what i'm talking about so this is just a full detail it contains more information about the vault but i'll double down on this activity section now because i'm really really excited about this you can see the deposit and this is by this is live data this is coming from blockchain this is stuff that has happened over the last week i can switch this to withdrawals so those are the top withdrawals over the last week uh i can see the people here this this bear here with this address i can see that they have withdrawn almost 4 500 bitcoin last week which is like this is clearly a whale can we learn more about this person i can see that they they have invested in four volts in total so i opened the detail of this person i can see they have over 160 million dollars inside why earn there it's it's growing by 12 which is really really good so i can see the allocation i can see how much money do they have in which vault and this crv btc vault uh the bitcoin vault i was talking about earlier i can see that they have just started with it less than one month ago june 11 they have already made 4.5 bitcoin and profits you can see how has it been evolving so this is what i mean by you know leveraging the data available today and showing it to you in a way that you can learn from others just imagine there was a follow button now that you could click and you could get notified when this person moves their money somewhere else so you can make a decision from that we're working on that by the way so uh we're just scratching the surface here there is so much more we can do i will just wrap up now so what we've done so far is we've built a historical apy and total value lot for why earn.finance we've leveraged social to improve trust and discovery for users and we've built tools to enable you to track votes performance for both your votes and other people's faults next we want to carry on on year there are a few more things we want to build for you and to make the yearn experience really amazing where you can learn from others see what are they doing and make your decisions and make the most out of your money after year we want to integrate other d5 products like compound ave idol badger element maker many many more and we want to keep exploring and pushing social because we believe that finance and social they are very they are working very well together uh so yeah that's it from me today thank you very much for listening by the way we will be fundraising in case you are interested thank you for listening and join wideout.com amazing thank you so much roman and that was a great demo and that also concludes our three projects from devtool analytics we saw an amazing set of tools to understand what's happening in d5 for your portfolio and just overall blockchain and with claimable we saw a whole new way to think about aligning incentives for all the developers and engineers and designers and any employees working in d5 uh next up we have our last category we have our final five projects before we go into all the prizes and that category is applications and these are all projects that are making it easy for everybody to get more familiar with d5 so we'll have medicines compound swaps titan stay call and tester come in and demo and uh without further ado i'd like to welcome our first demo which is so whenever you're ready feel free to present yeah hi everyone perfect thank you thomas hi everyone very proud today to present our project medicines so just to give you a quick introduction about our team we are a group of three frenchmen passionate of crypto and blockchain technologies and basically we have wasim who worked on front end on front-end development thomas worked on the smart contract and blockchain development and myself on project management a quick word about our company blockchain partner which is a company specialized in consulting and development of crypto projects so to deep dive in medicines what is medicines in few words medicis is a solution that enables donators to deposit capital generate lead and allocate this yield to chosen grantees the objective of the solution is to ensure capital is risk-free for donators and can be reading at any time and independently from the yield that can also be claimed at any time by grantees so here are a few use cases we already identified um just to deep dive in one of them and give you a precise example let's say i just had a doctor and i wish maybe to fund her studies instead of opening a bank account and paying fees and get low interest rates basically with medicis in few click in few clicks i can deposit my capital start compounding interest and this interest will be automatically allocated to her and now i will leave the floor to thomas for a more meaningful demo yes thank you char so this is me this is this is my dashboard that's a donator so as you can see i have some deposits it's usdc and i currently have some yield you can see we have some featured grantees the idea is to work with the dao to select these special guarantees and we have here some custom countries which could be for example charles daughter so in order to build a system and to allow multiple multiple addresses to get part of the euro we yield we worked with nft system such as the one on the unisoft vitroid lp position so basically you have an nft with all the data all the information in unft and this nft is available so once once you deposit some more funds your your nft will change basically so let's deposit some funds and i will talk about the architecture i will stack and confirm the location so basically the we decided to take the almost the same architecture and system as yeon the idea was to have something very versatile very easy to use and yes just very versatile if you're a strategist there's virtually no change between a medicis and a urine vault and as a user you will not be lost because it's basically the same share systems the same share values okay so as you can see my value my my value increased and that's nice because that's what i wanted let's quickly check the uh the beneficiary side so here is it so on the dashboard oh i didn't change okay as you can see uh it's basically the same uh the same dashboard but the small defense is here is the total amount allocated for me and here is my current healed so i can claim this yield of this yield on my wallet but even if i claim right now this yield as i still have some donators and so some allocations i will be able to claim again once the sure value increase so basically this was medicis and i will let wasim proceed with our next steps thank you tamar so for the as under the hood we've used wbdc and usdc as underlying tokens we've used yearn yarn smart contracts and av smart contracts for risk-free strategies as for our next steps we're thinking about some features like custom strategies we're having having endow to select the features branches and strategies for the platform having some dca features like withdrawals over the time we thought about having an order to go mainnet and why not integrate a worldwide entrance on the protocol so thank you for your attention and thanks for the hackathon organization same thank you so much for that amazing demo and the rest of the team um hopefully you continue building this thing and we get to use all this uh in production soon um next up we have compound swaps and we have got them ready to demo compound swaps hi so i'm the creator of compoundsbox and compound swaps is is a this is a tool for swapping your quadrant compound so for example let's say we have uh we have we have so in this example we have 100 usdc and let's say i wanted to swap it to die so there's several reasons why you'd want to do this so maybe currently usdc has a 1.6 percent apy maybe you want to switch to dies 2 apy so that's one reason you want you'd want to swap your quadro so this tool allows you to i'll allows you to do that in a simple way currently you also notice that i also have 20 die of debt so so normally if you wanted to swap your collateral what you'd have to do is you'd have to withdraw that usdc and then you have to go go on to an exchange swap it to die and and then deposit back in but the issue with that is that um is that you put your position at liquidation risk when you withdraw your collateral while you have debt so compound swaps allows you to swap atomically and it also doesn't swap optimistically so what it does it takes a flash load of dye so at first so let's say you want to solve from your cc die so i'm going to do the swap right now so what when you when you swap from use cc to die for example it first does a flash zone of dye and then and then deposits the dye into your compound and it deposits that into entered into compound and then it pulls usdc from your account and then swaps it to die so basically the swap is done optimistically to prevent any liquidation risk so now i'm just gonna now i'm just gonna deposit i'm just gonna confirm my usdc spending to my contract to do the swap and now i'm just confirming my transaction yep so now my spending is approved to the contract and now i can actually do the swap now so now i just need to confirm transaction so yeah so so this is the swap is done on the one inch protocol so it uses the one-inch api to fetch the swap core data and then that and then the swap is this swap is done using the one-inch x aggregator so it gets the best prices for you or for a new swap or collateral and now you can see i just swapped from from the usbc to die and this this also this this tool also allows you to do the collateral swaps without having to connect to a smart wallet so with with smart wallets like insta dab and device saver you can already do stuff like collateral swaps however the issue is that you need to migrate your position from your existing from your normal ex normal wallet into their smart wallet so this may take this take this takes time and also takes up you also need to spend a lot of gas to create a new smart wallet so whereas compound swaps it allows you to immediately use use features like collateral swaps without having to migrate your position into and into a separate smart wallet so this this makes it this makes it a lot easier to do to do do to do clutter swaps and also a lot faster as well you just have to improve your spending and then do the swap as you can see here i've finished swapping ustc dies now i have my i i have now i have die earning interest on compound oh and i still have my 20 die diet currently this is this is already deployed on mainnet so you can already use this and and you can use it at compound.gq.io next currently i'm working on features to add swap swapping and repaying cloud dear debt so you can basically pay back your debt using your collateral that's the feature i'm working on right now and and i'll show it and i'll show an example of a swap down on comp as well so this is a swap down mainnet for basically the same thing i just demoed here excited so here you can see 112 dies swapped you guys cc on on vl via one inch so this is basically an example of a compound of a collateral swap on compound thank you awesome thank you so much gotham and uh so excited to see this is already on mainnet so if anybody's looking to swap and change uh positions without getting liquidated this is awesome um great and next up we have titan and we have julia we'll be presenting their demo thank you card tech going to share my screen all right so titan is a solution that allows any business to accept payments as interest earnings stablecoin from anywhere in the world my name is julia and i worked on titan with emma we're both experienced engineers with a strong background in fintech brought together by our shared passion for building financial services and infrastructure so we envision a world where anyone can accept payments from anywhere in a currency that's as strong and valuable as the us dollar and on top of that we want to empower more merchants and creators to be able to earn yield on top of their balances and one tool that we found very promising to build tied in with was circle so during this hackathon we built an end-to-end integration with the circle api to prototype the ultimate checkout component to receive payments in fiat that settle in stablecoin so let's check out the demo again titan has seamless and easy ways to for merchants to accept payments from fiat that settle in stablecoin and then merchants will also be able to manage their income all on the titan platform so an example use case for titan is a crypto version of buy me a coffee.com so say that shiva inu is a creator of doge memes and has a profile and so we can buy shiba inu some virtual coffee or just send them some gift money um in order to reward them for their work and this checkout component looks like anything around the internet we can use our fiat payment methods like visa or mastercard credit cards so say i want to send 35 dollars to sheba with a special message congrats on finishing hack money all right so what happens here is that this information gets sent to circle and circle gets back to us with a transaction confirmation id and by the way all the card credentials are encrypted according to the pci data security standard and under the hood circle processes this transaction and allows tied in to fund the merchant's account with usdc so if i am shiva you know the creator of doge memes and i want to check out how much virtual coffee i've received i can go to the dashboard i can see uh the volume in the past 30 days and how much i have in usdc as well as the interest that i'm earning on top of that and also the total amount that has been paid out to other accounts so now i have a couple options i can transfer to another crypto wallet to another circle wallet or payout to my bank so say that i want to transfer to a crypto wallet all i have to do is take um a wallet address account and say i want to transfer out 20 of those usdc so what's happening is that this transaction again goes to circle which will create an ethereum transaction and get back to us with a transaction hash that we can then look up and follow on ether scan and this is going to be in that specific network of choice so in this case it's going to be the robson network so i can view on etherscan and this should show up with i think this transaction is still being indexed but it should show up with um the amount that i have transferred over cool so in the interest of time i'll continue on with the slides and we know that payment systems are the lifeblood of businesses and are expected to be robust and with high uptime and this is why we chose industry-grade technologies and frameworks to build deploy and host our services so this is not your typical hackathon project our tech is built in a robust and productionized way so that all interactions with titan can be fast secure and reliable as payment systems should be so this basic buy me a coffee app is just the beginning and eventually our systems will be able to power payments from anywhere in the world we also want to allow embeddable ui components for third-party developers as well as the accompanying api documentation also link enabled payments where you can send a link and the person who wants to make a payment can just click on it and have the checkout flow and so much more so with that you can try us out at trytitan.com or sign up for updates and i want to say a huge huge thank you to the hack money organizers and the circle sponsors thank you thank you so much julia for that amazing demo and congrats on building titan uh we have two more demos to go and so next up we have stake all finance and we'll let the team demo what they built so whenever you're ready for your demo hi everyone i am gulshan and team name is take all dot finance it is a defy application which helps users to stake and delegate to various pos protocols like graph matic new cipher life pair we are team of three service gulshan anthony whenever new user comes to the platform a new smart contract wallet is created which manages the user's assets so let us create an on-chain wallet an engine wallet is created for the user for the purpose of demo there are three scenarios and each scenario has a persona scenario one where bob wants to delegate to graph indexer and has grt token we can see this user has e matic grt and there are no graph and matic actively delegation what would go to staking tab graph protocol this is the list of the indexers in the graph ecosystem bob would delegate to one of the indexer as bob has grt so can directly stake from the wallet bob would like to delegate 10 grt to indexer approval transaction is being triggered to spend grt token after this delegation transaction will be triggered let us go to overview page we can see 10 grt was successfully delegated to the index of bible scenario 2 where alice wants to stick to matrix validator and has ethe inner wallet unless it would go to speaking tab matic protocol this is a list of the validator in the matic ecosystem alice would stake to one of the validator we have integrated one inch exchange protocol so alice can swap and stake to the validator alice would like to stake one each worth of matic this is estimated amount and this amount is retrieved using one inch exchange api would click on delegate a transaction would be triggered so this single transaction a swap and stake would take place to the validator martin has successfully delegated let us go to overview page on the under matic delegation table we can see alice has successfully delegated to the validator 130. scenario 3 where martin wants to stake and has eth we have integrated away exchange protocol so martin can leverage his eat to collateralize it so martin would borrow from away swap using one inch and stick to the validator martin would go to staking tag matic protocol this is a list of the validator delegate so martin would select borrow swap and stake option martin would like to deposit one each and estimation would be done once martin clicks on estimate this is a table which lists all the tokens which can be borrowed by martin with variable borrow rate stable borrow rate max borrow amount that can be that would be given and swap amount that would be received martin would like to borrow t usd martin would borrow maybe 100 t usd 95 matic is the estimation and would select rate mode as stable borrow and state transaction so in a single transaction borrow swap and stake would take place to the validator put click on confirm transaction let us go to overview page martin deposited one each borrowed 100 tusd and delegated 95 matic to validator id 130. in the future work we would like to integrate more lending protocols like compound therma dividex and also the swapping protocols like uni swap sushi swap and would build a routing algorithm which will identify the best part for staking with maximum economic incentives that will help the user thank you awesome thank you so much for that amazing demo and that's definitely going to make staking for all of your existing d5 assets a lot easier so um with that we are ready for our last demo of today and our final final list and that is project tester and now we'll have raphael demo what they've built take it away hi everyone i'm rafael and i represent project project tessa so let me just share my screen all right so we tester is a magic d5 portfolio manager uh and the problem that we're solving is that everybody knows how difficult it is to move uh to migrate funds from one d5 investment to another d5 investment you know you probably have to go through five different interfaces you have to first go to the farm interface and then state from there then the liquidity pool withdrawal go to the dex ui swap it and then do everything the other way around um but the way that um we're doing this also is that it's completely decentralized and highly extensible because you already have it hello you already have technology today that allows you to zap investments from one place to another but the dirty little secret is that it's centralized it goes through a centralized back end um and even if you use something like a smart account actually what ends up happening is that you get locked into that smart account into that interface so you won't be able to go to any ui for any protocol and just manage it from there so the solution that we've built is tessa it allows you to instantly migrate your funds from any d5 protocol from any d5 investment to any other defer investment in one transaction but it's completely decentralized it's highly extensible and then you have the freedom of being able to uh go and use another interface if you want to afterwards let me show you how it works so when you go to the tessa to the tessa site uh what you need to do is just select which protocols you want to go into so for the first example let's say that i just want to turn my matic a simple base asset into an investment into an ave pool so let's say i want to turn that into a deposit into um into ave so i'm just going to put a 100 matic here test of that and what happens here is it basically takes my matic swaps it into dye and then deposits it into into the arva pool so you go that's done um let's try to do something a little bit more complicated now what we're going to do is we're going to turn the other investment into an investment into curve which is a liquidity tool so i'm going to choose my die here and then the using this this i'm going to put it into the curve of a pool i'm going to put 50 of what i put in before and tester it so what happens here and why it's a little bit more complicated is it it first withdraws the dye from from ave and then deposits it as liquidity into curve right and for the final trick what we'll do is we'll do something that's even a level above that so we're going to turn matic into an investment into the stake dao passive of a strategy on polygon so again i'm just going to put in 100 here tesser it and then what that's doing is that it's turning my matic into die and then putting the die into curve taking the lp token from that and there you go you now have um uh your investment in state park so really quickly this is how it works um it you basically have a controller smart contract which finds the path between all the different investments and what it does is it connects to a bunch of protocol adapters that connect to the end protocols and what's what's really exciting about this is that anybody basically can create their own adapter for their protocol so if you want to see how that works the controller essentially is expecting a bunch of different functions invest redeem and if you are borrowing money if it's a protocol that allows you to borrow then borrow and repay and that tells it how to interact with the end protocol so here's the stakedown adapter for example you can see that essentially it's just telling the controller contract how to uh to invest in it and then finally to deploy it it's really simple all you do is run this script you first deploy the stakedown adapter smart contract and then you call ad market on the controller specifying what the input token is what the output token is and if it's a farming contract then what the reward token is so to finish off um i just wanted to say thank you four out of the five people on the test team actually work for simplify we're working on a next-gen d5 protocol and tesla is going to be a key part of that alongside our automated roi calculation tool uh for all your d5 investments you can check us out and simplify dot finance thank you very much everyone thank you so much rafael congrats on demoing this amazing project and with that we are done with all of our 16 demos so so i want to thank again menaces compound swaps titan stay call finance and tester for being in the last application category and again to all of our 16 amazing teams i demoed here like the the themes here are incredible there are so many good developer tools that are making your lives easier to interact with what's happening in d5 there are so many new protocols and primitives that are now going to be available for us to integrate and make things more composable uh we're seeing so much focus on making it easy for everyday people to interact and use and manage what's happening in d5 and on top of all that majority of what we saw today is already available on mainnet and the rest of them are going to be on mainnet very soon uh this gives me a lot of excitement and i can't wait to see what all these projects not only these 16's but all the ones that were submitted for this hockey hackathon over 230 of these um end up doing and how they end up continuing to build what they're doing uh for this event and take them to the next level so we all make these more common um into our daily day-to-day lives for interacting with crypto so with that

only can you rewatch this thing and pause the video after this ends but we'll be posting all of this thing in the discord and all of you will be notified over email in the next couple of days with each of your prizes and we'll be connecting you with the sponsors or distributing the prizes per sponsor given how it's set up and before we wrap everything up i want to say a few quick thank yous before everything ends i want to especially call out to all these amazing members of this ecosystem and and all the groups that make all this event possible someone especially thank all of our judges and our mentors who were crucial into going through and helping judge over 230 projects and without the help of all these amazing judges we would not be um where we are today and we would not have uh these amazing 16 projects to demo to all of you here that uh what what came out of this event so thank you so much to our judges and also our mentors who helped answer questions and really give feedback to all of these amazing teams then i want to thank all of our speakers we hosted three summits so many talks and so many workshops and all these speakers were super kind and giving their time and answering questions and really making all these amazing talks and presentations that will now live forever and be a good resource for anybody to catch up in the future on what is happening now and what's to come in this ecosystem so all these speakers are you were super amazing in making really good toxic workshops and and panels i want to thank all of you here and next up i want to thank all of our sponsors who hung out with a thousand of our participants answered so many questions about their protocol other people's protocols anything about solidity to design to product to just how do you think about best practice in this space and there's so many amazing people to thank that make this ecosystem and these events possible and without all of you here with us for the entire month the experience would not have been the same so i really thank everybody here who made this event amazing and gave all their time and hung out and discord and answered every question and also lastly it takes so many people to help run everything in the background running a thousand person event from 75 countries and 19 time zones is not easy and we have so many amazing members who are our judging
