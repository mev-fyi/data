foreign [Applause] [Music] ERS in this virtual Workshop we're going to take a dive deep and how bonds can simplify dark developments and safety development time to launch and deploy smart contracts in five minutes bonds is a smart contract ecosystem a smart contract Hobbit over 40 models combinations across different use cases supporting 100 evm based chains so far we've had 8 000 level five eight thousand five hundred employee smart contracts as a developer who wanted to build blockchain applications Bond ecosystem gives you access the over 100 reviewed contracts simplified development via a GUI on any evm based chain I love this I need your dial interact with your deploy smart contract easily via our easy to use UI bonds supports popular contracts the boss models marketer models have been combined with different use cases for nfcs for D5 ELC traded tokens across icos sticking and even dials the bonds ecosystem supports evm compatible chains ethereum itself polygon Avalanche and so minimal giving you a wide overview of choice to deploy contracts and dabs are your preferred blockchain will be featured on different media supports in the partner with communities support developers to drive and let's get started and take it directly on different path on a dashboard to see how bonds can help you as a developer simplifying if you build better jobs the first let's look at the Explorer this mirror gives us access to a number of available expansive model templates we can search the templates we can see the name every time place the data was launched and overview retained from this and who created let's take a look at the payment splinter if you click on the payment splitter it takes you to a document the documentation page for the payment splitter contracts allowing you to see how to use it the more the parameters are available the functions events and the code as a change log it produces them to see previous changes and then edit update made on the smart contracts how to use digital overview and how this smart contract can be used a guy by Guy step they have developedically used smart contracts and interact with these in their preferred webpage Library the functions gives us the function available in the smart contracts across read and write function as you can see click the initial function gives you access the city name the type and description of the function code clicking on code takes us to overview of the code years in the smart contracts now payment splinter click on the payments already see your soul gives us asset the code to see the code written the mix of the smart contract that's the function so I can help you review and check the code very soon we're going to be launching the customized feature to allow you to customize the score the ID and add other features and increase the capacities as the same fits you can share the contracts and share on Twitter but of course deploy let's take a look at the documentation of bonds the documentation of bonds gives you a more clear overview on how this can help you to build your doubts better the image description of the bonus platform so what bonds get started the fundamentals smart confront help how to interact smart contract deployed and bonds can be interacted using either those yes and any other preferred library that you would like to use we can see documentation guide how to call a direct to the Smart Control connects to wallet and sinus boilerplates are very crucial to bonds we want to keep developers a head start for that to use both typically build dabs as the same fit we're going to be taking a look at how to launch a token errors a base token with the boilerplates on launch EPN and the BSC blockchain right up using a box so let's go back to the Barnes landing page you can log in they can sign up as the same fit directly logged in so I'll just log out for health assistant so yeah so radio can logged in here okay for the password so we are logged in to the bonds dashboard because I'm not a FaceTime user there are different apps already in on my dashboard but if you're a first-time user you definitely going to see it create that card so let's create it dark so if you're creating a doubt takes you to the setup page since your launching a crypto token my name is trust and so lights are large the trust token and I'll simply say trust so good I already have it there but the signal that's subjection so try stupid the next is to select the network name there are different options for main knitted testing it across different evm based chain well let's use BFC click nest clicking next and we just select the smart contract model you would like to use the Saints already know we want to use the erc3 into token smart contracts we can use this or before we get that these are bonds models developed by the boss team these are also by the board's team now all tab shows model small contracts developed by the bonds team alongside external developers of course contracts have been reviewed but exports but they're all in the old tab before smart contracts are built by the Box team them found on The Voice models are prepared templates liquidly use the sample token to create a simple ERC 3D Circle as the use case was the name as token or the symbol I'll call it CE okay that City caseworker trust token okay from the token there right to lizard Floyd deployment is a lot a lot of source to connect our meter marks okay so I have not logged in so I'll do the quickly connected so let's look forward sorry okay transaction code from erc20 token to the BSC test Nets what's the next thing to do now we have been provided with the Avi in and the content address they're very critical to interacting the smart contract on your front end using any of your preferred Library there is a manage contract button which gives you additional capacities to work and manage smart contracts you can see the right and the read function of these smart contracts and you can play limited the functions interacts with the smart contract using DUI similarly what you have a remits but of course has a much broader explanation of each of the functions descriptions and you can walk around it and the rights are read with the GUI provided there already we have the verification tab which allows you to copy and useful information to verify the smart contracts in the blocked Explorer of your choice let's interact using the ball update provided I discussed earlier the boilerplates allows you to give zip a quick start to building dabs across different use cases we have the roller Blitz for erc20 nfts meeting siphon others that were provided accordingly let's click on the token erc20 it takes the GitHub Ripple for this I will have to Simply clone this report to our local directory either using the git Commander link or downloading the zip file and recipient let's download the zip file from zip so we have to search opens forward up and hits the erc20 military plate we open it a lot let me make this bigger close or this step fantastic this how is going to be when you clone the ER accessory it's amazing world of play to your IDE we just decode any of the preferred ID that UI that you use the first thing would be to install the NPR packages yeah I'm installed okay already done but if you the first time for you to clone the repo you have to deduct it to download all of mystery packages needed from this now because I didn't provide the photos we have to do two things to test the develop it and you can now it it's a customize at the same feed their own use case the first would be to take a look at the avi.json file remember that we have been provided with the ebi of the smart contracts we have to copy the API return back to the vs code delete the previous one and paste the one just copied because it is difficult to read so we have to formatted yeah much better easier to reset up the sealants second file we need to take a look at is.emb file so we have to create a DOT EMV file if it is already done that's EnV which is already here and these are the two things you need to input the react app chain ID and the react apps Contour wrapper so the app is a reacts when important is a control objects and the ID and the ID chain ID remember that we deployed this on the BSC test Nets and the BS test Net 10 IDs 97 hence we have 97 and we have to copy the smart contract address and replace already out here and C once you've done that it's now time to run of course you can take a look at the other codes the file is handles the maintain button function involved in that and the progress message and this success message that pops up the after Json uses access to chain ID the wireless connection functions and the others so you can take time to go to the code and it's an input into your own use case to build more usable routes so let's run this and check how this looks left that'll be here under on stocks okay let's take a look at three thousand fine so this is how it looks yeah to connect our contracts so we have connected the contract brilliant so we asked to Mint the contract now let's go and found let's take a look at what we have is copycon address and head over to the BSC blockchain Explorer let's take a look at the beard chain okay sorry the SSL pass meant to be the testing is actually the mean uh BSC that would be test Nets yep dot BS system so let's input the condo address we just copy and check it out so balance is zero or it has been confirmed created to the Coffer created and a few events okay right some let's head back to or plug if you take a look at the contract eruption which we got from clicking on the managed contracts to test if this will work the less means using the GUI so type your receiver here so let me just put in 15 this is 500 000. the tokens receiver the our smarts sorry our address here so put this here and mix so what V caps fees he has to be that and it's going on corrects mean that so you click on this Bora success so it's a trust test okay and we have zero point zero five okay let's probably date that by clicking here click one address and this mean to itself means a goal for TDC we chose the our token we deployed area is 100 so this is how you can play around this and you can do the same using the code or you deploy it from your IDE USD code I can also do the same using the UI here as well across passing Contracting balance self allowance secondary block and transfer ownership and post maintain fresh hands as you seem fits so this is you can look at the documentation for more use case that gives you more care opportunity how you can simplify how you can do better how you can interact in different models and of course take a look at the mini models available across different use cases they can launch on the market tree you have the reflections of escrow in case you want to build a free license service on the blockchain with an edge code payment feature I just like how I freelancer that's called mod Fiverr on upwork as investment one that's contract and it's maintained as a real options for NFC Supermarket place and so on and so forth so you can take a look and explore and deploy the smart contracts copy the API and the address and put into your front-end interact with it as you seem fitting any of the libraries available we keep updating we are continuously updating the smart contract Hub with new to my contracts for more new use cases across different applications to have developers viewed more gaps at the same fits any questions you have you can drop these in the comment section I'll be very happy to connects or you can join on Discord and other creature of the committee I've lived in the button discard as well we can be happy to help you build and help you ask your questions as you can as well thank you very much and we can't wait to see what it will be using the plants platform
