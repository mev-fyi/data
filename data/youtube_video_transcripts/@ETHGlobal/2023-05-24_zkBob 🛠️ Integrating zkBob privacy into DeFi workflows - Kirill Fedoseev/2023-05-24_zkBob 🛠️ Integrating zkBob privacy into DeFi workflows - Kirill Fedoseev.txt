foreign [Music] I'm one of the core developers at the zikibo protocol and so yeah let's talk about how you can integrate the K-pop privacy into your Devi brok follows and everyday life so the challenge we are standing against at ziki Bob is the challenge of on chain privacy Financial privacy so the financial privacy is something that we all expect from the traditional finance and banking solution but when it comes to unchain use cases that's typically like in a bit of behind because the current blockchain architectures do not support the native privacy and well using the financial infrastructure on the blockchain without any Financial privacy May pose a lot of risks to like to all the users basically and we believe also that the this lack of privacy on the blockchain is one of the key reasons why we are like liking this Mass adoption and it prevents the future Mass adoption of the blockchain and how it can replace the financial infrastructure we have today in traditional Finance we are building three main products basically right now it's the Bob which is a multi-chain multicolateral stable token we have a bob CDP which is one of the ways how you can obtain Bob by using the over collateralization mechanism and the Ziggy Bob is this privacy application that you can use Bob and in future other tokens as well to use this cool and nice privacy features so yeah Bob is a decentralized multi-chain in capital efficient stable coin and it's very optimized for usage within a ziki ball application for achieving this level of privacy for begin Bob we are using this concept of concentrate stability for now and Bob CDP in the future and so the way it works currently is we are using highly concentrated uni Swope V3 and other concentrated liquidity positions to achieve this hard one to one pack with usdc and other stable coins and this way it allows you to make this swaps fourth and back between several coins and Bob with the minimal fee swaps and minimal slippage so yeah now let's talk about the Ziggy pop and cool privacy features it offers to you so the ziki pop application is an application which preserves privacy for your use cases and allows you to make fast and easy payments in stable coins using sticky Pros basically users can perform different types of actions within their privacy pool they can make a completely Costless account obstructed deposits transfers within the Privacy pool and withdrawals back to their Public Accounts and all of this happens in a completely private Manner and so this way only the actual sender and the receiver of each particular operation is physically able to access and decrypt the data and metadata of each transaction so the cable product is currently available only for Bob tokens in polygon and optimism where tools but with more chains and more tokens coming very soon to the to the product so that's how the UI looks from the brief so as I said you can make the deposits transfers within the pool and then back withdrawals to your public account yeah we'll see more about the UI applications in the demo time yeah so we are looking forward to multiple use cases with the sikibok application with main being related to all sorts of peer-to-peer transfers between users anything related to payroll services and salary payments to employees regular employees and independent contractors we are looking how the cable can help you to achieve this privacy within the Nations and different grants how it can help you to achieve private fundraising crowdfunding helping organizing different dial payments how it can be integrated with trade file and all sorts of other useful possible use cases basically so one of the probably the largest use case for now related with ckbop and the use case people are actually using it it is for the sexual salary payments so the way it works is that instead of paying salaries completely publicly from the konosity safe multi-sik or something like that where everyone can see your transaction history how much each employee receives and what do they do with this money after they receive their salary you can ask your employer or if you are an employer itself to use the sikki Bob instead and basically the how it can work is that our employer Carl which has usdc budget for some monthly salary payments can swap it one to one with minimal fees using one of the taxes we support into Bob then gaslessly deposit Bob into the Privacy pool and then on the salary they easily make this multi-transfer completely private to all of his employees to transfer the salary on their private accounts and then once you as an employee receive your salary you can withdraw it back to your public wallet swap it to any other asset you want or continue using it within D5 off-ramp to the Fiat or do whatever you want the cool thing about this is that everything that happens within the pool remains completely private so that no one has access to accept except of to you nobody knows really how much money you have how much you receive how much you spend and what do you do with your own money and salary there are certain other features that the ziki bug we are focusing our attention a lot one of them is the support for the mobile devices so we believe that the one of the crucial things about the Privacy for everyday transactions for people to actually start using it is also the mobile support so we are making sure that the start Pros generation and the UI Works responsive enough fast enough and easy enough on the mobile devices in your web browser so that the ux can also be used on on the go from your mobile phone yeah we are looking how we can achieve the different cross chain integration and for that in the Ziggy Bob even though that the Privacy pool itself is only available on polygon and optimism layer tools you can also easily swap back and forth tokens from multi between multiple chains and multiple tokens throughout our application uses in the school integration with the li-fi widget yeah and the third important point we're going to talk about is the compliance so basically compliance friendly privacy is what we call it a ziki bob we believe that the only possible way for future and existing privacy solutions to evolve into current and the crypto space and the compliance regulation is to find this balance the right balance and the compromise between the level of privacy you get by using Ziggy pop a similar privacy application and the level of compliance and regulatory requirements you might you might want to fulfill and so at ziki Bob we are trying to build this and find the right balance between the compliance and the level of privacy and yeah so that's users can still achieve the level of privacy they require without actually triggering any red flags from The Regulators or other authorities so we are using the complex approach to compliance in the keyboard right one of the building blocks for the compliance we're using is the screening for ML checks of each deposit and withdrawal addresses so that no like obviously malicious and blacklisted sanctioned entities and accounts can access and make deposits of withdrawals from inside the pool and so that's something that already exists for a long time in the traditional finance and works well and we believe that a poor on-chain Solutions and especially on chain privacy Solutions this also must be the case and so the Ziggy Bob should not be an exception and we should also follow this sanctions list and any red AML flags that our solution might raised so right now we are using the integration with the ethereum labs for for this ml screening and ml checks so the way it works is then when Alice wants to transfer some funds privately to Bob so to make a deposit and then use it within the pool well all of your transactions with the pool and your interactions with the pool go through the centralized sequencer which are going to be decentralized in the future and so once the sequencer receives this operation it performs a fast and efficient check with the pros first significant cost validation with the trm provider to make sure that your deposit address or withdrawal address does not violate any ml regulations forays any red flux and so if you are good to go then the sequencer proceeds and includes your transaction then submits it submits it to the pool contract and the third approach we are using to the compliance is called the optional kyc as we use so basically currently we are integrated with this opium kyc know your cat solution provider so the way it works is that you can get verified on the Opium website and mean the solvent nft on your wallet which has some specific trades for the CK Pub application and then you're able to use this verified address from the Opium kyc to actually access this keyboard and use the extended deposit and withdrawal limits to your account and So currently the underlying kyc solution the Opium kyc is using for us is the binance Bob tokens which is also this separately issued solvent nfts by Bunnings basically if you have a kyc python binance chain binance exchange you can mint this binance pop token on your wallet and then proceed to the Opium kyc registration so now let's talk about the bounties we have for the hackathon so yeah one of the features we're asking you to integrate during the hackathon is another way of simpler making the deposits to the pool so basically it's a solution for achieving fast and easy private payment integration within partner products and other Solutions and the school feature is that it minimizes the required effort quoting skills and the time for the integration to between the K-pop in any other third-party or open source wallet the app different based protocol and anything else and The crucial point in the direct deposit feature is that no CK snark proof generation is actually required from the user submitting this deposit which is different from all other operations which require the active participation from the user in this slight proof generation so the way the way it works is that any protocol smart contract open source wallet or any other tooling May connect to our simple direct deposit smart contract interface and call a few solidity functions to submit this deposit basically we just need to specify a especially in credit CK address of the receiver or your own if you're depositing funds to your own account and then after some time you also need to specify the deposit amount of course and then after some time the necessary CK proofs and all other metadata will be generated for a bunch of such deposits by the sequencer in a completed trustless Manner and submitted again to the pool contract for further purchasing and once the transaction from the sequencer is bind the receiver which is yourself your employee or somebody else you send your money to can easily access these funds from the ziki Bob pool and to see them in their UI so for this best use and the best integration of the ziki Bob direct deposits feature we have a pool of prices totaling of 6 000 USD paid in pop tokens so the first place receive 3K 2K for the second price and 1K for the third place and so if you have any place in your protocol for payments in stable coins especially and you might you might want to make them a bit more private you can try to replace your payments infrastructure with the ziki Bob direct deposits feature and be eligible for best use of the Ziggy pop direct deposits Bounty and for everyone else we have this open track price pool basically for all hackathon projects that you're willing to spend five to ten minutes to get familiar with the sikki Bob application sign up and onboard on our website create SDK account generate your ZK address and then either you just can include your SDK address somewhere on your application for accepting donations so something like that near to ethereum or PTC addresses or you can just show us and share some feedback with the you got of using the ziki Bob application during the live sponsor judging session on the last day so just a few ideas yeah once time one more time I want to mention how you can integrate direct deposits and what you may build using that infrastructure that can be an integration with any open source wallets or other similar software and can be integrated with the TV protocols like taxes breaches or their meta aggregators can be integrated with anything related to fundraising or donations payrolls or any other awesome ideas you might come up on yourself so it's now time for a short demo of the of the UI we have so yeah that's the screen we are seeing right after we plug in into the this K-pop UI now we want to log into our account so I will just start from scratch I will click that I already have a CK account I use the the free wallet to sign up into this ZK account choose the metamask uh those are things I'm gonna sign a message to generate the entropy for my for my account wait some time until the account is loading all the history synchronized and after a few seconds I will see all the history of operation I performed on this account so yeah you'll see that my ziki balance is now 10 bulb which is 10 USD I have some balance on my public wallet yeah I performed a bunch of deposits transfers within the pool and withdrawals I also did a couple of direct deposits to this account and yeah probably can just right now submit one more deposit from this address so we're gonna just go to the deposit tab select the amount we want to deposit let's say three Bob tokens click deposit so as I had before all the deposits are completely Costless so the only thing I need to sign is the token approval which is a pyramid format basically I signed this message then wait a few seconds on the desktop it takes like seven to eight seconds to generate a site proof then this proof has been submitted to the sequencer it will gonna wait a few more seconds until the sequencer generates the start proofs on his side and submits this transaction actually on chain then we'll see how this transaction is being processed by the polygon Network so as I said the pool itself is deployed on multiple chains so for now it's polygon and optimism you can easily switch between the networks in the UI to do it so yeah we already see that free bulb already subtracted from our account now we'll have to wait a few more seconds until this pop are actually accurate in our SDK account balance yeah it's completed now if we go on the history and we'll see that 30 seconds ago we made this completely private deposit and now as for the direct deposits integration so the simplest way you can try to make a direct deposit is from the polygon scan UI what etherscan UI so we're gonna just go to the specials direct deposit contract select the direct deposit function and yeah basically as I said it just accepts a few arguments from your site you're gonna pass our public address here we're gonna pick an amount we want to deposit let's say we want to deposit five Bob tokens so we're gonna type in that and for the CK address we just need to specify the especially for my SDK address so in the UI we can generate this receiving address random resume address by clicking the button in our account tab we're gonna copy that past it here remove this prefix and that's it we're gonna have to um okay something is not working with the polygon Skype was polygons can for some reason but yeah that's basically all is required from your side to submit the direct deposit from either scan UI and so it's even simpler than that to integrate it on the smart contract level within your protocol or any other user interface you're using so I guess that's it for the demo for most part okay yeah so a few helpful links to our website subscribe our Twitter yeah we have a quite cool documentation page just real regarding this hackathon and direct deposit functionality and if you have any questions please come by our sponsor Booth grab some mirror just comes questions or contact us at the Discord Channel if you are not on site yeah thank you very much about it I'm not sure if we have time for a short q a but uh yeah guys if you have yeah one or two questions yeah we can try to yeah so the question was what are deposit limits in the numbers so we have a deal system two limits so basically like the default tier limits to like a single deposit cannot exceed 10K Bob tokens Bob 10K USD basically then we have a same 10K limit for the daily operations you may deposit from a single wallet and like also the deposits and withdrawals are limited globally to the pool from all accounts all together also on a daily basis let's right now extending somewhere around 300K per day so of course this limits can be adjusted over time depending on how active the pool users are probably these limits would be increased and then so if you pass this opium kyc which is optional using the binance pop tokens the limits are doubled for you and even if this is not sufficient and for example you are a large employer and you want to pay salaries to your employees with large amounts you want to make large deposits then there is also a like a specialty rule for such people so basically you just can contact us pass some internal kyc procedures with us and we'll waitress to your address so that you can make deposits on the large amounts and to use them on salary payments for whatever amounts you want to have any other questions okay then I guess that's it thank you very much for attending this Workshop good luck with your bills
