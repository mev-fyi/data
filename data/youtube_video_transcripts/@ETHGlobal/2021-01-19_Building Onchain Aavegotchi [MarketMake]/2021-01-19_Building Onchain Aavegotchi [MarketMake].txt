yeah great so yeah let me get started uh hello and welcome everyone to the avogadro intro workshop titled building on chain avagachi joining us today is nick and koda dan who will be taking us through the session uh one quick reminder to ensure you've all joined or created a project we have already prompted check-in one in your cohorts if you're having any trouble with that please reach out to me or anyone else on the youth global team and with that i'll pass it over to nick and kodadan to introduce themselves and get the session started alrighty hello everyone i'm coder dan daniel and the founder ceo of pixelcraft which is the lead developer of avagachi and uh with us today we also have nick mudge who is the lead solidity dev and uh the mastermind behind many of the contracts that avagashi is using so um i guess uh we'll this will be pretty uh we'll do a probably about 30 minutes of kind of going through top high level of what avagachi is and actually be taking you guys through some of the code giving you some pointers on how you can use the avagashi contracts in your hack and then we have plenty of time for any questions i'd love to hear what you guys are interested in hacking on with avagachi if anyone has some ideas would definitely i'll be checking the chat here and uh excited to see what you guys are planning to build on avigachi and nick would you like to add anything before we get started you're muted by the way that sounds good to me yeah cool all right i'm looking here trying to find the chat here there it is all right so yeah hello everyone and uh let us get started i'll start by sharing my screen here so exploring the gotchy verse playing and exploring with on on-chain avocaches you see here on the right side already we have this crazy looking piece of pixel art and that is an avagachi you see you have the body underneath and then you have a wearable a dow egg a little wizard hat comes some cool sunglasses and a beard and as we'll be talking about in this in this talk these are all part of the avagachi they're all totally on chain all this art is stored in the blockchain and is part of the avagachi and actually gives the avagachi different traits so let us kind of start exploring that now what are avagachis they are kind of uh if you tried to summarize them and uh in a kind of a tagline for what avagachi's are they're really uh at their core they are these defy staked avatars that are playable and that kind of live on the the blockchain originally we were going to be launching on the ethereum blockchain but uh we had to really kind of change our plans because fees were getting so so high on ethereum and we've actually decided to launch first on matic matic is a layer two solution uh it has a proof of bridge directly linked over to ethereum so really easy to move all of your assets to to matic to play the game and we're actually doing a community migration right now it's literally happening and as we speak really exciting time to be in the nft space there's so much innovation happening just last year was was a huge explosion for nfts and it's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger this year and a lot of that value really can't sustainably live on ethereum main net because the fact the fees are just too high so especially for our idea which is kind of taking this idea of a tamagotchi which uh a lot of if there's like gin uh if there's millennials or maybe some older like gen z's or some uh some gen x's in the room you guys would know what a tamagotchi is tamagotchi was like a it's a it was like a like one of the first digital pets that were ever created huge in the 90s and uh probably i know people still kind of have them today but uh it was kind of the first introduction to this idea of like playing with a little digital pet so we've taken that that idea of a tamagotchi of this like inner interactive playable digital pet and we have taken ava which is like the leading d5 protocol and we've taken their a tokens which are interest bearing we've stuck them inside the the gachi and thus we have created the avagachi which is basically uh it's a 100 on chain d5 staked playable nft avatar and as you can see on the side here they're extremely customizable there's so much you can do with them and yeah we're really excited to continue uh our journey and kind of help you guys understand what you can do with this new technology so what are the traits of an avagachi uh the most important ones are here we have energy aggression spookiness and brain size those are the the four core traits of an avogady there's actually two more i did not mention here which is the eyes you can't actually see them behind these sunglasses but avagachi's also have unique eye shapes as well so when an avigachi is born or when it is summoned from a portal and i real quick i'll explain what a portal is a portal is kind of like a pack of cards when you bought when you purchase an avagachi you don't just purchase it directly like a typical nft you get a portal and when you open that portal we're actually using a very innovative technology that's been pioneered by chain link called chain link verifiable random function the vrf function and uh basically it's a fancy way of saying it's a provably random random number generator on the blockchain and as if you guys are familiar with like the the issues with uh randomization on the blockchain you'll know that vrf is a cool solution to that and uh it's kind of one of the the building blocks that we're using in avogady so when you open a portal you've you've bought your portal uh each portal costs currently 100 ghosts which is like the the eco governance token of avigachi this little thing right here so you buy a portal you open it and there's 10 avagachi's inside and what you do is you look through them and figure out which one you want they each of them have different attributes that have been generated by this chain link vrf so they have the different energy levels aggression levels spookiness and brain size as well as eye color and eye size and based on the values from 0 to 100 of each of those traits though you that will determine your avigachi's rarity score so really you see it ranges from zero to one hundred actually zero and and one hundred are the rarest that's actually it's good to be in the extremes that actually determines your rarity score um so the max rarity that you could get from an avogady coming out of a portal would be about 600 and the the minimum would be 300 that would be basically if you had 50 for each trait which would be a totally average avogadro it would be so average that it might actually be rare so those are those are the six main traits of an avogady and then those kind of define its rarity within our ecosystem then you have something called kinship which it's basically if you it harkens back to this idea of the avagachi being a playable interactive nft avatar for you so you actually need to take care of your avagachi you can't just buy it like you would a typical nft and it just sits in your wallet all day you actually need to interact with it you need to pet it or you need to equip wearables onto it or you need to feed it little potions and consumables so every time you have an interaction with your avogati kinship is going to go up by one and you can do two interactions every 24 hours so basically one interaction per 12 hours but if you don't interact with it for 24 hours kinship will actually start going down so you can imagine if you neglect it for like a month your kinship is going to be pretty low and the minimum that it can go is zero but there's actually no maximum you can know you could have a huge streak every day where you're playing with your avagachi and you know if you play with it for a whole year you'd be in the solid 400s at that point and maybe higher depending on uh some other things that ways that you can interact with it so that's kinship and it's very important for kind of defining the owner's relationship with their avagachi and then the third and main kind of trait is experience which also leads into levels and experience starts at zero and as you interact with your avagachi as you play with it as you interact with our ecosystem your avagachi's experience level will actually go up so great example of this we just had a big dow vote for our community and everyone who voted in the dow for each vote there were two votes each vote they were they're all of their future avagachi's are going to be rewarded with 250 experience per vote so a total of 500 votes for all of their avocaches that they that they basically buy and then claim from the from these portals so very big actually a very significant airdrop of xp and we're really doing that we want to kind of kick start the ecosystem and have people's avagachis leveling up immediately when they when they come out so experience is really cool because what it does is that as your avagachi levels up every three levels you will be able to earn a skill point which the then you can use to increase the trait of your avagachi the energy aggression spookiness or brain size so even if you don't have the rarest tavagachi when you first open the portal and and summon it you can increase the rarity by uh by actually leveling your avogati up and there you have 33 skill points that you can use to increase the rarity of your apagachi uh we didn't really put it in this slide because it's not really developer related but uh the reason you want to increase the rarity of your abugachi is because we have this thing called rarity farming which is kind of like yield farming except uh you're you're basically trying to compete against other players to have the rarest avagachis so we have actually some very significant rewards that we're going to be giving out uh starting when avoganti launches on matic it's going to be about 400 000 ghosts plus some additional rewards so about uh it's going to be definitely in the in the 250 to 300 000 dollar range for the rare estava gotchas it's actually very significant so if even if you don't build on avagashi maybe you can get it get some portals and play our metagame as well we'll also have leaderboards for kinship and experience they'll be lower but also we'll have some rewards for those as well so that's that's kind of why you would want to level your avogachi up and have a rare affigachi and there's some other ways as well that we'll talk about to increase the rarity of your avagachi and uh the main way is actually looking at this avagachi here it's got a bunch of cool wearables uh equipped on it which actually also increase its uh its rarity score so kind of a summary uh this is like how i like to explain it avagaches are tamagotchis for the crypto native generation you know it's our hope that 30 years from now people will look back and be like you guys remember i uh or i still have this like cool avagachi that i had from like 20 20 20 21 and it's like still in my wallet you know i gotta find my private key if i didn't lose it i'm gonna open this thing up and and they'll still have this like memorabilia piece this nft collectible that they played with when they were younger and they can like give it to their you know their kids in the future so it's going to be a really cool a digital uh kind of digital artifact of our time that's where i think it'll be really neat anyway let's get into how to hack on avogachi which is why you guys are here and we're gonna get into some code here and show you kind of how our smart contracts work so i'll give it over to mr nick mudge here uh the solidity lead of avagashi and uh yeah and i'll jump in if if there's anything we need to go in in more depth okay good so um and dan are you gonna control the slides here yeah yeah sure okay good so all right so there's there's the uh the contracts url uh one of the things is that the avagachi is implemented using a a diamond and a diamond is really a pattern of uh of organizing a number of contracts to implement a system and uh so here it is there's a standard you know so there's a pattern and there's a standard that standardizes how you do it uh it's useful for like integrating tools and things with the pattern and just having a standard way to do it and so basically a diamond if you're familiar with solidity when you guys are developers so you are so you have a one contract that has a fallback function and essentially this one contract which is the diamond will will execute its fallback function to you and utilize functions from other contracts it uses delegate call to use functions from other contracts that are we call faucets and so the avogadro contract is we have a diamond and then we have a bunch of faucets and those different faucets uh do implement different functionality that way we have related functionality that's uh that's that's together that's how we organize a bunch of code uh by separating it into separate uh into separate faucets and so here we go uh dan has the list here of the different faucets so functions for claiming viewing interacting functions for increasing decreasing uh the stake inside a navigation and um yeah so these different ones yeah so the um i'll go back real quick here so yeah kind of uh we can we can get started by kind of just looking at here i'm over a front-end developer you know nick and i have developed these together but uh i do most of the front end currently so very familiar with like implementing uh these contracts and in a front-end environment so really if you look at the contract here you see uh we i'm using web3 you could also use ethers if you want but we have our abi here the avagachi facet.abi and then we have the avagachi diamond address and we'll look at we can look at those real quick so the avagachi facet abi like we like nick said uh one diamond actually manages different facets and it's actually a really cool pattern because there's typically in ethereum if when you deploy a contract there's like a max contract size and a lot of people hit that limit when they're doing more complicated contracts and there's ways to get around it but the diamond standard is actually a really nice and elegant way to get around that because if you run out of space in a in a facet you just make another facet so it's uh this this is actually i think uh nick pioneered this because he was working on the erc 998 composable standard which is a very long contract and we actually also implement that in navigation as well that was i think that was like the reason that you that you came up with that right yeah that's right uh another aspect is is you can have multiple contracts i just call each other um but like one of the problems you have that with that is is permissions authentication uh where it can get uh tedious and complicated where okay there's one contract and can be only called by this other contract and then this and then you know this other contract can only be called this other kind you have to implement all this different authentication and so it can get complicated but with the diamond you just have one contract and all the faucets are connected to that one contract and you have one authentication basically the owner it could be the owner of the of the diamond and so you just have to authenticate one address or you can implement any kind of authentication system on top maybe the the address is from a dao or or from or or some other thing but the point is is that you have one governing system that applies to the diamond and all the faucets and so you don't have to you know implement authentication for each separate contract um so there's so that so it helps it with that as well but yeah originally i implemented i worked on this diamond because i was running into the max contract size and i needed the same functionality to come from the same address and so like yep yeah yes and that's exactly what you see here in this in this front end code you get the abi of your facet in this case it's the avagachi facet and then the avagachi diamond address is the same address for all the facets so no matter we have a list of all the facets here the fa avagachi facet is in our contract it's for claiming avagachi's viewing them uh interacting with them collateral facet the dow fat the dow fast it's pretty cool because it contains all the functionality that is actually going to be like used with our avagachi dao which is going to be actually managing and governing the contracts items items facet is for the items that we have in our game the wearables consumables badges badges are pretty neat they're actually going to be the idea behind badges is they're going to be non-transferable nfts that kind of live with your avocachi so as for another to go back to the vote that we just had uh all the avogadro's who participated in that vote are actually going to have badges as well so when you trade your avagachi in the future you know avogadros are nfts they're tradable when you trade it the future buyer of your avagachi will be able to see the history they'll be able to see that your avagachi participated in this particular event so it could give them a much higher value in the future to know that this was like the genesis avagachi it was there at the beginning in the first vote uh the shop facets for purchasing items from the shop and the svg facet is for adding viewing and updating all the on-chain svgs that we have so just to go back to this code real quick we have the api and you can get all the apis uh i believe i think they're in our github if not it's really easy to just compile our our contracts locally you can just use hard hat part it's like it's a library for uh streamlining the whole solidity development process and you'll get the api from that you can just chuck it right in so yeah that's uh kind of the the front end and how to use the the diamond in the front end and uh i guess real quick do you guys have any have any questions related to that part before we get into uh the dig in the deep dive about the different functionality see if there's any questions on the diamond or or any other thing anything else about avagachi looks like we're good right now so we'll keep going so digging in how do we actually use these contracts you know you're looking on github and you see it and you're not really sure what you can do well here are some common use cases that are going to be useful for a front-end developer or someone trying to create a a little product around avogadge first of all you're going to probably want to see how many avocaches you have or or a particular person has so we do have a function for that all avagaches of owner and this can be called directly from the smart contract you don't need a sub graph or anything like that all those subgraphs are super cool but we have we've actually designed our system in a way that uh you don't need to create a sub graph if you don't really if you don't want to and we are actually going to be working on one uh the the graph has not launched on matic yet so we don't really have a sub graph for it yet uh but they are launching pretty soon so we will be creating a subgraph it's the contracts are ready to create a subgraph we just haven't created one because matic doesn't support uh well they they haven't lost launched their hosted service on matic yet so anyway if you want to return all the owners avogadchis you would call all avogadches of owner and this is going to give you all the info about the avagachi it's going to give you all the traits it's going to give you the level uh it's going to give you all the wearables that are equipped on the avagachi all the information you could need it's going to be returned there and the same goes for this method down here get avogady it's gonna you can just feed it a token id and it will uh give you one specific avogady so this is good good for like a drill down page where you're kind of showing more detailed information about one specific avagachi and then you can this is this is a very very important function here this is actually what you can use to fetch the visual image of your avogachi at any specific moment like once you equip a new wearable you can hit this uh hit this method again and it will show you an updated svg of the avagachi and the svgs are very light they're about i think when i looked at it it was probably about 8 to 10 kilobytes depending on how many wearables you have equipped so it's very very light and as we'll talk about in a second there's a lot of interesting things that you can do as well with the svgs nick do you want to go over the like the interacting part sure so we have uh this interact function and this as you can see above here says it increases kinship one uh every every 12 hours so interact is like uh this gets called by um the avagachi in the avogadro diamond when you do when you interact with your abugachi so like if you put on a wearable uh or if you we have like a pet function um and this is this would be a good thing uh if people want to hack on avogady is um is is doing uh is calling is calling this interact uh as well so that this is this would be a reason for people to use your functionality because it interacts with your with abagashi which increases the kinship and uh so i think dan will talk about more of the benefits of kinship but kinship kind of kind of shows how like happy ravigachi is and and so um so that interact is a good function to use um and then below that we've got okay consumables so consumables are these erc 1155 items that your average consumes and they get burned uh when they when they use them so they're like one-time use but then they but then they they help uh temporarily increase uh traits um or possibly do other things that help your abigacy and then we have equip wearables so this is so you know as as you might if you play with avogadro's abugatchis have all these different wearables like different hats and different shirts and uh different different things that they can hold in their their hand wands guns and things like that and so this function here allows you to you know put them up you know put what wearables you want to to have on but wearables also affect your your rarity score your your traits so you know you know if you have like a navigation with some rare trait that's like 99 or 98 or or very low like five or or two or some or something and you can find a wearable that you know that adds more to that trait or subtract that subtracts that from that trait to make your average even more rare and boost your rarity score so those those those are what those do i don't know if you want to add anything else to that dan yeah yeah exactly it's a good time to to kind of go over the wearables so the uh there's six types of wearables there's uh there's commons uncommon rare legendary mythical and godlike and each type adds a little bit of uh rarity score on to your avogati i think common ads like plus one and then god like adds plus 50. and godlikes are very very rare i think in in existence there's probably only like probably 30 or 40 of them right now i don't have the exact number but very very few of them uh given the ratio so godlikes are extremely powerful and we've been doing some raffles in the last couple months to kind of distribute them in a fair way to our uh to our players our early adopters actually um we've had some very interesting cases where people uh very small players were able to get these very very powerful weapons and these uh powerful wearables so it's a great case of fair distribution and actually i did want to go over real quick uh if you're looking at the uh use consumables function you'll see there's an only unlocked modifier and uh you'll you'd probably be wondering like what is what does it mean to be locked well because avagachi's inherit from the 998 composable standard and they also manage their own a token collateral those are two kind of two areas where there could be potential front-running risks so because if you go on to like a marketplace and you list your avogati and then you set up a bot to basically uh front run and withdraw all the equipment from your avagachi at the moment that someone else purchases it that would be very bad so we have this unlocked feature or locking feature that is optional but uh we really highly recommend people to use it when when they're putting their avocaches up on the marketplace because it kind of shows the potential buyers uh that this avagachi cannot be modified its state is kind of locked so when a navigation is locked you can't you can't use consumables on it you can't you can't take wearables from its inventory and you can't level it up there's a couple things you can't do basically anything that would modify the state of the avagachi uh in a negative way you can't do so like the you can't change its name i forgot to mention that each avagashi has a its own unique name so whoever if someone gets the name vitalik for their avogati that's actually going to be very rare because you only one avagachi can have that name it's unique so you would not want someone to list a navigation named vitalik and then change the name right before they right before you buy it from them so that's what the unlocked modifier does it just it just shows that this method can only be called on an unlocked avagachi and then there's also also the only avagachi owner pretty straightforward just that you have to be the owner to be to call that method on it uh same with uh uh yeah we have as well only avagachi owner on equip wearables and you can actually equip the wearable because equipping the wearable does not change it changes the state of the avagachi but it doesn't remove it from the inventory so even if an avagachi is locked you can still change its clothes but you can actually remove those nfts from its inventory because that would lower the value of of the avogady so that's the kind of the explanation but behind uh the only unlocked and and that uh okay so that's uh any any questions real quick on that section we've covered a couple little use cases uh basically that's that's the bare bones uh like the methods that you would want to use as a as a developer you'll want to get the avogati you will want to kind of interact with it a little bit equip some wearables and then we kind of get into a more this is actually a very interesting part of the development process which is actually manipulating the svg so when you get a navigation it looks uh it looks basically like this it's uh it doesn't have an animation it doesn't really have anything going on it's just kind of static and we may add some methods later in the contract that actually built in add some built-in animations but currently we don't have any of those it's just it's kind of static like that so as a front-end developer you would probably want to add some cool animations and the way that you would do that is by targeting the different classes within the svg that we return so we've we've basically each section of the avagachi has a class that you can uh override or you can like set with a css style that allows it to do something so um i'm not sharing my screen right now but uh there on the home on the pa homepage of avagachi when you look into a portal the avagachi is kind of hovering up and down so the body is moving down and the shadow is moving up so we're basically targeting the body and the the body svg and the shadow svg and we're setting an animation to make it do that little movement and another another example of a movement that we do is the wearables hands uh when like when you pet your avogachi it makes it happy right so it kind of does a little uh hands up animation and we're also actually switching out the eyes we're getting rid of the eyes and replacing them with some other custom eyes that we have on the on the front end so the avagachi smiles at you basically and all that is possible by targeting each different class of the of the svg that is returned and even the wearables also have these classes and the body and the sleeves are are separate wearables so the body is it's a wearable and then the sleeves are also targeted separately and that's because when the hands move up the sleeves also need to move up with it otherwise it would look really weird so you if you're modifying the body you should also try to do an anime like include the the sleeves in your animation as well and if if you guys are interested in that we can publish some animations that we are using in our front end and if that would make things help more uh smoother for for developers uh that's something i've been thinking of doing just haven't done yet but uh feel free to like reach out to me and i can help you with those animations so really that's that's kind of the the end of uh the overview there's a there's a lot more and our contracts are uh pretty well documented and there there's docs.avagachi.com has a lot of good resources as well but i real quick just wanted to go over some hack ideas uh for things that you know we would like we would be interested to see uh pretty soon we're i think it's going to be probably the end of this quarter next quarter we're going to be launching the avagachi realm which is a metaverse where you can walk around with your avagachi and we're going to have like side views of the avogadches they're going to be able to interact with each other in real time and we currently we're working on that so as you can see here the side views of avagashi's are coming and we've we've planned our whole [Music] library our whole like contracts around this idea that avagaches are going to be 360 viewable so currently we can only view the front but we are also working on the side views and the back views so we would love to see some avagachi skinned games um anything that require like currently only requires a front view would be totally cool to see so you know get creative uh think of reskin some classic games that only have like front views and and do something cool with the avagachi svg it'd be really really fun to see that uh another thing is like social with avagaches is going to be very prominent i i have a feeling in our community we're going to be on matic and we're going to be using you know discord telegram a lot so any kind of bot that relates to the avagachi and relates back to discord or telegram you know we're super active in discord so we would love to see some bots that can interact with the avagachi maybe they can give it experience maybe they maybe you can like push a a reaction and discord to equip the wearable on your avagachi maybe it's just something like trading avagaches back and forth any of that would be would be very interesting to see for us and then finally just another idea the metaverse is big you know we know that uh avagachi is just one part of it so we would love to see avagachi's somehow rendered into other metaverses like you could take the traits of the avagachi and the kind of the visual aspect of it and render it on onto a an avatar in decentraland or some other one of the other metaverses so uh there's a couple more ideas as well on our on our medium but uh here the main kind of three that i i figured i would highlight so that's kind of that's kind of the overview and happy to take any questions you guys can see uh we have an amazing wiki i can actually i'll give you a little preview of the wiki real quick while we're here uh the wiki is totally community built uh i helped set i i kind of made the front end design for it but basically i would say 95 of our content is uh from our community they have done an amazing job setting this thing up and uh if you go to like the portals page you get a great overview of what a portal is and how to how to get one how to claim your avogachi and uh we also have like some information about the different rarities of the of the different traits and here's how we are calculating how much of the ave a token collateral is required because if you have a lower rarity score avagachi it actually requires less collateral but as your rarity score increases the amount of collateral required also increases with it so that's one page we we have great memes we have the best memes and uh talked earlier about oh let's go to the wearables page and show off the wearables wearables are a super important part of avagachi and as you can see here we have different types we have these they have the quantities here and then we kind of get into all the different wearables that have been created already and over here is where you can see the traits of the of the wearables these are the modifiers so when you equip this wearable it's going to give you a modifier so like if you equip a link cube onto your avogady it gives you plus six to your brain size but if you let's go scroll down here we also we have an ava boat very nice boat daniel sorry i i don't think you are on the right cheek i'm still looking at the questions pdf are you oh you can't see uh you can't see the i can't see the page now okay that's unfortunate um all right well i will see if i can fix that i don't really know maybe i'll share another page yeah sometimes like when you share a static page it's difficult to switch screens right how about there we go perfect okay yeah perfect uh so yeah we have the link cube here i was saying if you equip the link cube you'll get plus six to your brain size and uh if you have like a already have a high brain avogadche equipping that would make your avogati more rare and likewise if you have go down here to the boat if you equip the boat it will lower your aggressiveness by six because the out the ava you know the ava fam is so friendly so when you equip the ava boat your aggressiveness goes down by six and again having lower traits is not a bad thing it's actually a good thing to be low like zero is the lowest you can have when you first uh get navigate so here's a bunch of other wearables we have we have uh these are our summoner set that we have of my coderdan shades we have the majin diamond golden cross robe and the zubat mohawk then we have a vitalik theme we have a llama corn shirt we have a galaxy brain gives you brain plus six of course then we have just a bunch of other cool wearables so uh fashion is super important in avogady and uh we're really excited to see what kind of apps people can build around this type of like virtual fashion and and you know just excited to see what what the potential will be so i don't think we have any questions but uh nick would you like to add anything i guess before we we wrap this up uh no i think that's good well um i guess i'll we do have a dowel and real quick though just uh if if anyone is interested in making tools for avagachi there is a lot of stuff that can be done as well for that we have a we have a dow and we have lots of votes on that we're going to be doing more more and more voting as we launch on matic because voting won't cost anything so there's uh some also some cool tooling that we could do with analytics and also like helping out with uh making the dowel smoother for everyone to use so i guess uh finally uh where to where to hang out uh let me let me switch back to the powerpoint here real quick yeah here it is no no anyway uh what do you got are you guys viewing the how about that there we go so our official github is here avagachi uh contracts the wiki that we were just looking at wiki dot avagachi.com twitter twitter.com avogacy and our our website is live on avogacy.com and also the didn't include it but we have a docs.navagachi.com that has quite a bit of developer documentation as well so cool thanks nick thanks daniel that was really great um yeah it would be cool if you could show these slides in the sponsor avagachi channel so everybody um has access to that and i see you've got a couple questions in the chat here i'm not sure if you want to read them or i could read them to you um either way yeah sure okay oh yeah we do have yeah is avagachi on getcoin um i don't think we are no we have we didn't really participate in the uh if you mean for like the get coin round or do you mean just more for developer like bounties and things like that how do you stop playing the system um so actually we we uh okay dev bounties uh currently no but it's it is something we are interested in doing um having more developer bounties currently if you're if you're interested in you know working on avagachi definitely let us know and we can maybe work something out or definitely make a cool hack and you know and get our attention that way uh as far as automatic automated integra interactions it's really something you can't uh fight against and we've kind of just embraced it one of the uh hacks that we think would kind of be cool is instead of actually having people manually interact with their avigachis every day there could be automated interactors that kind of interact in a way with a lot of avigachis at a time and people could actually uh there's a way that you can delegate your avogachi to be included in that in that interaction pool uh basically every 12 hours so because we are on matic there's basically no expense for doing that and i think it would be uh it could could be a a cool dap that someone could create around it and just because uh there is that mechanism does not mean that kinship is uh is like mood because there's other ways as well that you can increase your kinship yeah we need some like some good names for that like a playpen or something you know like we have a group of things that are all kind of handled together yeah well i like the uh the analogy of the uh the dog walker sounds like someone managing a bunch of avocaches and like petting them and just uh yeah having a good time also our i didn't mention our discord our discord is um i don't know if i have a link for it here but if you just go on the twitter you'll see our link to our discord and there are some channels for the developers as well in the in the discord so definitely go over there and say hi and we you can start asking us any questions we're also in the uh avagachi sponsor in the ethereum hackers group as well so come on come on over and say hello and we can start helping you get set up to hack on avogady okay and if anybody wants to unmute themselves and ask any questions you're also more than welcome to go wayne um i think you raised your hand there so feel free to unmute and ask your questions hey guys um i actually um am very interested in the albugachi ecosystem um i'm working from my from the music angle and brands so um i i know the potential in in in what you guys are just speaking of especially with the kind of abagache pools and whatnot so um definitely kind of trying to figure out how to integrate uh you know from my side to you guys into you guys ecosystem um i got a picture but i don't have a full picture of it so okay so like um music are you talking like from an nft perspective like you you have like an nft so if each independent creative uh had an abigacy of their own but they can only contain they can only get in avogady based on their um level of uh metrics within my platform so once they reach that level to be able to obtain their own personal abigacy um you know the fans can then purchase can then purchase that apagachi and use that apoga or whatnot or um brands can partner up with um with the independent artist and do collaborative rare abagaches and so forth so um kind of just trying to see how i can make that come to like yeah i think uh for currently like avagaches have been kind of their own uh brand or they we haven't really done any big partnerships with brands for the avagachi itself because we kind of we kind of view the avagashi as a vessel and uh it can hold a lot of different nfts inside it so our main partnership right now has been with the wearables like i was showing off the like the link cube the ava boat we're gonna be doing uh some more wearables uh pretty soon like on matic with them as well so i can see uh we also have like a an artist program where the community can actually create their own wearables and like submit them and uh they can be added to the avigati's shop as well so i there's definitely some areas where you could get involved with like giving rare wearables aware away to your community that could be definitely something that works sounds good yeah because i was thinking like i mean if pepsi was one of the brands you know and pepsi is like hey um you know we got this new consumable or whatnot you know yeah then um you know or like the travis scott mcdonald's collaboration you know i'm saying things like that that you could that could be created with these these type of um nfts yeah exactly that would be super cool like i think we even already have like a pepsi i think maybe it's either pepsi or coke like a can yeah yeah i was just thinking that would be cool and then and then from a perspective from all the brands and and music side would be um we could create our own festivals so brands would sponsor those festivals uh creators independent creators would have their uh avogadis maybe performing and obviously you have your fans and whatnot and then there's ticket staking involved and things like that as well so uh things like that ever what i'm kind of thinking on yeah that sounds like i mean we're going to be making a whole world around these avocaches that's kind of like phase two once uh we've we've launched on matic and uh we're gonna be building the next phases is making a whole metaverse around them and uh there's gonna be a lot of a lot of cool things that we'll be able to do once we have like side views of the applications they can walk around they can like emote and do and do cool things like that so totally um i i avagachi concerts would be super neat yeah definitely look for definitely we can chat more about that definitely hit us up um someone was asking about the a tokens uh we're actually nick can talk real quick about that we are we're making great headway on moving a tokens from uh mainnet over to matic yeah that's right uh we we have built an a token bridge from ethereum to matic and matic back to ethereum and now and we're we're currently testing it uh the a tokens on matic uh are going to be called m a tokens and formatting so like ma ma tokens or my tokens um and uh so yeah so we have that and we're gonna hook that up to uh user interface so people can send the a tokens over and there's gonna be more details about that which we'll we'll write about and we'll publish how it's gonna work yeah yeah it's it's gonna i think it's the first time anyone's moved a tokens on to layer two very exciting yeah where are the resources saved the everything is on chain everything with avogadro is saved on chain um so all the svgs are are saved in the in the blockchain and to get it all you need to do is just uh there's a function that we are showing up here which is to get the get the out get avogadro svg that'll fetch all the svg with all the different wearables equipped and it'll give you that that output that you can then do whatever you want with sorry can i ask a bit follow-up question that math token you just mentioned sure yes so if i understand correctly you cross the a token through bridge right and uh ave is smart enough to so like if you that interest part does it goes to the bridge or does it goes to the eoa or whatever that user's account yeah so that's a great question so what's going to happen is when you move the a tokens over with it's going to lock your the a tokens on the in the contract on the ethereum side and it's going to mint new tokens on the mavic side and the new tokens on matic are are going to um they're they're not going to be instead of increasing in quantity like going from 10 to 11 to 12 they're just going to say there's there's a fixed number so it's that so it'll be like 10 on on automatic but that token value will increase like it's become more valuable over time because what happens is that when you take that fixed number back over to uh ethereum you'll get your interest you'll get your original a tokens plus interest so that's how we're doing it and so like there's there's a a decentralized exchange on matic called quick quick swap which will show the increasing price of your of your m a tokens on matic because they'll increase in price over time because they're they're they're generating they're they're increasing in interest on the ethereum side because when you transfer them back to ethereum you get your original a tokens plus interest does that kind of answer your question a bit how how it'll work how did you drive the information do you just conquer it by yourself because that information is in the chain on the mainland like you read the uh layer one state on real time on layer 2 yeah it really has to do with the ava's protocol because when when we send the tote when we when we get the a tokens on main net we do a calculation that gives us a number and this is just using ava's protocol we do this calculation it gives us a number we send it over and then we when we when we um when we send it back ava gives us this number this is called liquidity index it gives us number that we multiply to our number and it gives us the current a token i you know that's uh it works out but uh yeah thank you yeah so i guess it's very new because this uh this wasn't really possible in ava v1 and we're using the new v2 methods that they kind of they've simplified the developer experience a lot in v2 uh specifically for this issue because dealing with the interest can be kind of a pain so we we kind of opted for the the compound method where the balance of the token won't change but the value will increase over time but on our actual ui on the avagachi uis you will be able to see both we're gonna be able to query the the balance uh the current balance on mainnet as well so we will display your m a token balance which is your speared force balance on me on matic but will also display the value of it the real underlying value of it on the ui for mainnet as well sorry final follow-up so you're doing that all based on the on-chain information automatic or do you substitute with some other information like graph or anything yeah so we're not we're not we're not using we're only using the the data on on chain we're using uh the on chain data from ava on their contracts and yeah so we're just reading off the chain we're not using like oracles or like reading something from the graph or anything like that i see that's very cool thank you yeah um someone asked what is our core team size well currently the there are four summoners so that's uh myself we have nick mudge we have zebot is our core artist and then jesse golden cross is kind of our product lead so those are the there are four core team summoners but we also have lots and lots of uh very like very engaged community members who are really they've helped out so much we have our apprentices we have our artists we have our assistants we have our these these are all double a so there's like the apprentice the artists and for you guys uh we have a new role that we've created which is the architects that's basically a navigation developer is going to be an architect so if you join the discord and you say hi in the dev chat then you'll get that architect role as well kind of be invited into into that circle cool i think that's pretty much wraps it up it's been about an hour um and i will be i'm in asia time so i will be going to bed pretty much right after this but uh nick will be around he's the u.s time so feel free to go and hit him up chat and chat avogadro with him yep i'm legit i mudge in on like telegram and discord great thanks so much nick and daniel really appreciate you taking this session it was great and thanks so much to the hackers for joining and some great questions coming in uh if you have any more questions or you want to follow up with avogadri team the sponsor avagachi channel in discord is available and yeah thanks everyone have a great day
