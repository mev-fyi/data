Campbell I am a legal engineer with Oakland law which is a company headed trying to build a template library that plugs into a theory there's been a lot of questions you know I'm often asked what is the one earring so I thought this talk was as good as any opportunity to start discussing what I've built building on Oakland law and how it was there so you know what's the good engineering anyways it's basically transactional attorneys ie corporate lawyers delivering transactional scripts that effectively new yield terms now transactional scripts is have a new clinic way to talk about smart contracts and I saw a very interesting discussion last week between two law professors that are active in the space talking about you know what it's actually Arsenal in contracts are they legal agreements to get a smart contractor do you have some scribe privity know they're just business optimization course they're a way to take the governance and reflect them in ways that are automated one particularly so transactional script I think is a better way to talk about smart contracts but I digress so really you know as a corporate attorney that's flinging that code and specifically learning how to code assets I see a falling transaction would cost constantly come up with diggle deals payments you know paying not only the attorneys and footers with a deal itself but also counterparties can yourselves Alice pay involved on the tenth day of week all those fun things is moving pieces that lawyers and other agents have to keep track of in order for contracts not to code the people reporting intentions of parties in a very obvious and durable format this is important before to speak resolution and it's something that I think is imperfect for how a lot of law firms organize your documents on centralized servers you've seen hacks of law firms we see in confidential information regional markets so we're trying to think of like how can we you know make things more cost-effective quicker but also secure and this kind of leads me to keep watching and some of the advantages I see for corporate lawyers who want to code make things cheaper and better for the last now a blockchain has you know a few enticing properties I seek report reveals it's a neutral database so that means it's free to read and write from you don't need a gatekeeper permission in order to build on it or on other public budgets timestamp tamper resistant records that kind of goes into the neutrality of luck chain and that we have a very clear technology of transactions and we also have a clear sense of how transactions might be reversed what kind of economic force would take you know 51% attack we can logically know clearly about how information can erase some of the maybes of centralized servers away because I see lots of clusters that's just ticking time bombs to hackers digital scarcity so when you have an open free database that's tamper system and I'm standing very predictable you can also think of online assets as scarce we're able to solve for a double spending problem we have a greater I guess guarantee that a massive that's represented online will stay up there won't be a million copies of it so all this goes to having blue internet data or blockchain native assets so Alice paying Bob on the tenth day of the week is not just an instruction code bank it's literally the payment itself and that's what we do with smart contracts Wyatt here Ian I think basically the is that there's been so much development in the area of business transactions and what is being fondly called money Legos the sense of the term has all these different ways to move value online whether it's stale coins whether it's something that we might be more speculative like ether or you know security tokens it's all there it's being built in real time and for lawyers like myself we're trying to get a sense of like I only have so much time to learn code you know my clients might have confusion dollies different watch kids out there it seems useful to just go with the momentum and go where a lot of developers are coming and I see we go through because of things like meta mass which is minimus which is kind of like a universal passport to here and blockchain that anyone who can get on Google or Firefox if you know how to use the Internet we get meta Matz die is a stable point that helps people pay each other using watching without exposing than the to call it so laters so it's kind of like losing for bedrock finance and my employer is a way to wrap all these different web free money language tools and clears legal terms that can be understanding humans I guess more importantly by judges if things go wrong like I'm saying it's just smarter agreements that are enabled to put and now I just like to quickly get through some demos because it's one thing to kind of lay out this in theory but I think it's way more useful than just see in practice well okay is there any work being done either through this startup called the twin-track regular I'm in the staff around creating like a spec for but just so that like aside from putting things on machine you could say well that this projects supposed to do X Y and C independent of whatever language is written in like the contract should work this way so that way you know testing suite yes so I think there's a lot of overlap with like open source development and where I see like legal templates going they're converging on market standards so that open love work very keen on saying like we don't want to have a hundred different ways to do it this is the market the one form to net them all and with that we want a template smart contract that is also covering most of things people won't do it that's our deal so what I'm going to show next is my sense of what that standardization might look like before you know sales of all not good is an arbitration but I hope that was responsive to your question so first demo it is just basically knocking out a bill sale on my phone with minibasket wallet and also Oklahoma oh and also for any as much again this is on phone this is accessible to anybody these are free templates this is just actually well I said that this is important you can see me reviewing the bill of sale that I dropped on an open loan then also deploying in escrow contract that matches that goal sale now what do I mean when I say matches what is the point of all all this when I say magic I mean that the parties specified in this bill of sale buyer and seller are reporting to a smart contract batteries that I deployed so that there is a unique clone escrow smart contract that comes out that only these parties can access and it also reflects a certain amount that's being paid in this instance tend to die for my sneakers and that's what will actually divvied up if this transaction goes through and people do what they're supposed to do I could probably talk more broadly about you know why escrow is going to be space material but I this is also an example of just using legal forms on your phone you can also pop up an escrow smart contract by sending it down there's other buttons you might have noticed there that are options for the seller and buyer to initiate it's cute and that is but let's say that the buyer is taking way too long to pay for the shoes or they hated the quality they smell too bad they might want to dispute that and we can actually make this to stay online they don't need to go to a separate value here now our would be of arbitrator should they be call to action [Music] on the other study what this is for and our trainer does not need to know more about smart context or 3m other than this is what the fire should get this is what Sashi de Nesle you sign it it reports this transaction to the smart contract and then what we can actually also see in real time are those and I'm those digital dollars that are escrow to induce completion of this legal transaction is then split up automatically after the arbitrator reports the result and I think this is pretty cool and that's a stable value I think that's very familiar people familiar to arbiters sense of digital dollars and how to split them up so I think it's all kind of coming together in a way that doesn't either take a lot of technical knowledge as an imperfect any ideological you know sense it's more just efficiency one thing I'm really excited about is the organization and I would like to show an example of how I am tokenizing something called an income charity so there is an alternative to financing higher education that's getting a lot of popularity where students say you know instead of taking out a loan or you know painting today I will give you a share of my income should it be above a certain count and we see this as you know advantageous to students but it's also a very interesting way to show how that material can Babylon's legal agreements and make markets more efficient and what I mean by that okay so we just had something quickly income share driven based on the land school one and then this payment after it's executed will report information about that contract about the parties to a smart contract factory that then gives something called visa tokens that also bear a hash that's generated by oh c'mon this is kind of complexity I think it's more relevant to attorneys but there's this sense of like what does it mean token his house what doesn't need to organize a real-world asset for me it means creating a clear legal thing between development parties who might have control over that asset and delegate Toby so somebody creates a hundred tokens that represents their income share those 100 tokens represent a hundred percent claim on that students future income now as an education provider I don't necessarily want to wait you know a couple years to get paid and have that uncertainty I might want money today and I can say I can tell you these tokens and you can get a portion of that income sure right automatically it'll be settled very quickly on a career and now more for the lawyers in the room this is kind of a language from the random income share agreement that makes itself possible and programs people to do what they're supposed to do this is what I added to basically say that this income share will be represented by digital assets and we're also saying the kind of bare and ie that's created by Oklahoma for the specific contract so I see that as unique and contemporary between creating a real legal obligation something that somebody's gonna have to do in the future or else they get haul in the court and I'm holding a digital asset that's very easy to access very transparent and it's on so I guess my takeaway and is knowing a little time is that I really put the world's gratefulness there's fatigue with lawyers with their presence on deals the transaction costs the back and forth that is often unnecessary I'm comparing forms that should be market anyway so we see value record services migrating online or see more technical people becoming lawyers or just doing a floor is you already buy definite agreements so I think lawyers can steam ahead here and say we recognize this threat but instead of you know vanishing into the foreground or you know we're treating we're going to embrace it and deliver new types of value and I think that new type of value is we can replace a lot of the transaction costs a lot of the money that goes lawyers was just more cutters so escrow agents banks all these other parties that take value out of bargains they can be eliminated and that's my pieces amis but I am optimistic and optimistic if this is built on aetherium to the appearance here to stay there's a good energy there's a community and I think it's you guys have any as a sprint but I hope it gave me kind of just thought of what I'm working on where I think the space is headed for lawyers I get there first okay and this might be too broad of a question is that how I plan to Gus variations in international law oh yeah that's great I mean I believe the price of souls that you sister come on I figure that open law myself we don't think that this is creatively legal standards we think lawyers should still be helpful there and team up coders better yet lawyers at our coders can quarterback that but like international waters favorite complex and that is also really the testing point just like the Tower of Babel problems really Commerce it's just like we have different languages and different ways to talk about liabilities holding about small contractors then I see all losses alchemical process natural language agreements are can be boiled down to the spare parts that are most necessary then the really important things are going to be reflected the code that anyone understand like how do you mitigate proper understanding so yeah that's cool um one of the things that I want on a project for people from other jurisdictions to be other languages put it all there then at the market kind of refine what one should be used in what range constitute Baidu contract law is pretty big and it's a new plate most of our sense of like deals and like how do you control things judges even a southern US regionally differential between what private parties find themselves to do so you know if this technology ways into more regulated areas you know experience transactions then yes there's variation and there's a delivery process that's probably go with like issuing significance as I should but for like invoice payments online like I don't see a lot of bakeries or need further you a lot of like hospital for communication like trying to get out what it means to pay for services I think a lot of these things are very basic economic tools that is convenient to have paper records just so if things really go south and reconstruct what people wanted and judges could make the result that speak but so you're not saying that the same primitive connected to different languages and translation oh I do from the candy yeah yeah so like the permanent of escrow like why shouldn't that be universal everything just all your buns on time variation yeah yeah I think I think that's quite open to see is any kind of like my thesis here forms and deals are gonna converge like Lakeland forms are very popular for fundraising we have seriously we have a National Venture Association also has the market forms I don't know how those work outside of the US but that's mostly just my perspective as a US Attorney and a lot of people there since that expired yeah I didn't mean to make nominee - I know I'm what what is the adoption of these kinds of technologies look like two law firms start offering digital services and disrupting themselves yeah and so my sense there is and just like focusing already is in House Counsel paint companies themselves investing its technology to help them run back office processes and that being the inducement for walkers a joint party I think law firms are part of is this this technology if you know they might have whole you know more two roles that study it but I don't think they're gonna clean very simple it's more less essential but their bottom line and I see more the adoption curve being with law firm compliance themselves although lawyers sole practitioners small law firms it helps council see a lot of use here if you're not you know under this pressure that haven't waters you know so I think there is that tension we're trying to look how lawyers account for the time and account for the value and like what the work actually takes now with what the Internet has brought you know unlike just information being everywhere and you know as a lawyer a big law firm you know I would often be given tasks and I was gonna find out good SEC filings I would go to on Saturday because all these online tools and then we just take that information you just like put it into our law firm database and then have that cook for a while then we took into the law firm the compare forms but it's all kind of internet it's kind of a secretary so I think that they'll be exposed if there's real competition and I think what payments you know startups using these long term invoice payments like we've seen subtraction there but the little complicated stuff like I think that very still out you know like M&A deals I think it's still probably too early because those do take a lot of article so this is always a very interesting motion because it's like some founders I've met have a better legal understanding of and a lot workers but I would say that developers are complex problem solvers and that's very similar about lawyer you and if the developer understands the economics of the deal you can help with the lawyer probably I don't want to say that you can replace lawyer quite yet because like I'm saying I really like this contingency of the smart contract fails or we still have an imperfect Oracle's where people have to report world events as our contracts I like having an evil lair today and that requires I think some legal training but I think it's probably appreciated so and I don't think it was going to be for years you guys no one condemned their law school there's a threat Blackstone needs so that company have not go to law school or just move along haters do a second I've seen you tweet about touch on Oprah's oh yeah so yeah like some of the work I'm doing at Oakland long and be on with the caravan and other teams is like studying like how can we make organizations more efficient with smart contracts and the most immediate obvious use case is for like grant making organizations like if you're pulling funds together and this funds are already the nominated digital assets it makes a lot of sense to do something like it down or putting like this thing but it's like a go people to do that or if you're splitting money if you're giving funds to impending contractors you're creating liabilities so a lot of my thought process has been the kind of this like after the fact sense of like there's a lot of guys out there that might be creating legal liabilities from souls are having default assumptions about how they're structured that would surprise them so why not clarify that with an LLC I don't think it's like that to say like let's let's settle who owns what and how relationship between doubt members that that's pretty I think common sense but I think there's more lawyers are going spaces just like you guys are already acting as partners why not make it so that it gets sued holding the court with the judge understands exactly so it's not very complex of one of the things I have been a fan of them had fun but you have to open long and Aragon is just like an operating agreement in large part can be represented unchain awkward agreements are just saying like who owns what what their weight might be and blood those already represent that information you know and they may get programmatic so one thing that I'm working on is you know beyond just referencing a small contract and not braiding permit and saying this is where the situation goes it's really cool to have a moment not for anything that is executed and employment happen a boat multi-sig wallet that everyone down with doused decked out or a mole lockdown and I think that is kind of getting to the next thing it's just like trying to make that mark in life because I think a lot people we did really feeling was introduced to them so I guess that's kind of
