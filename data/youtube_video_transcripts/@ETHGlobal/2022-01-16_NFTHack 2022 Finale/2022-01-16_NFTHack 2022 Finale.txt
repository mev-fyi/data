all right good morning good afternoon and good evening everybody i'm kartik one of the co-founders of the global and welcome all of you to the nft hack finale we're about to wrap up the weekend and a lot has happened in the last 48 hours and i'll summarize some of it and i'll apologize for the rest of it we are running 30 minutes behind and it's because there were so many projects that came out of it so i'll go into all of that soon and we'll also talk about all the amazing projects that came out so uh just as a reminder anybody who's kind of watching this thing for the first time this is the place we're using to go through all the live streams and um and everything we're going to talk about today so be sure to sign in and uh say hi anybody who signs in will also get a nft proact token and if you have any questions that you want us to answer we can read off the questions from the chat and answer them on the live stream so um this event is organized by heath global and for those of you who don't know what each global is we're an organization with a very simple mission our goal is to onboard thousand developers into the web3 ecosystem and we do that primarily by running hackathons and summits and this one is no different so nft hack is our first hackathon of this year uh one of over 15 that we're going to be running and uh just two weeks into this this 2022 year we are already blown away um we had over 800 people participate for this hackathon and these people came in from 60 different countries spanning 17 different time zones so the last two days were kind of crazy and we kind of mapped out where everybody was coming in from and it's just incredible to see so much representation from all continents across the world and uh we have a lot of them here live and i want to say hi to all of you and i want to thank so many of you for uh staying up super late to uh to watch some of our amazing teams uh not only just uh the the hackers who are participating also there were 56 ecosystem mentors seven technical mentors and twelve partners they worked with uh to run this over the last two days and in uh together we'll be giving away over 125 000 in prizes so the thing that blew us away was that out of the 800 people that were participating 46 percent of them were new to ethereum um how do we classify new news they were developers in web 2 and they were leaving or interested in learning what's happening in web 3 whether that's on the solarity side or just nfts or anything in between almost half of them were trying to understand what they can do here and that to us is incredible and we're going to see a good representation of that in the demos we're about to show as well um all in all we had over 255 projects that were submitted and this is exactly why everything has been a little bit later than expected in terms of uh surrounding up all of the projects uh us going through all the submissions and judging them live in a period of three hours and this officially marks us as this as the biggest event we've ever done in terms of outcomes 255 projects especially over the span of a weekend is absolutely insane and we're extremely happy to not only see that and we're extremely happy to have so many amazing people that want to just build cool stuff i want to particularly thank 25 judges that spent all of their morning in the afternoon going through and hearing all these 255 projects live giving their feedback seeing these demos and honestly just walking everybody through what they're what they're doing and giving them advice on how they can improve so thank you to all of you here for making this possible and we are ready to uh get started so after we went through judging we picked 15 finalist teams these are the 15 teams that all of our judges were excited about and we're gonna bring them on now and have them present and demo what they built so all of you can also equally see and share the excitement of their projects the way we're going to structure this is that we're going to invite all these teams and we're going to present back to back and then we'll just kind of finish off with talking about who won all the prizes and there won't be any q a specifically for the teams from judges so in no particular order i'd like to congratulate multi-contract battle royale xerox photos do nft creativeers ewing club metaverse advertisement dao graffiti mint charisma animtopia duo mint instant blockchain domain search nft pay spyglass crops in and zoo style these are our 15 finalists and we'll bring them on to demo in a minute and before we sort of jump into our first demo i want to quickly thank the 200 projects that still made an amazing kind of demo and still presented and finished and really worked on over the weekend and spent countless hours getting something done just because you were not one of these 15 teams does not mean you were not good enough or we didn't like something in particular we just wanted to highlight 15 really cool projects that our judges were also excited about and we're bringing them on um here today but we really encourage all of you to continue working asking for more help whether it's through our mentors or if you need more resources whether it's technical or any other advice or you need to connect with somebody that you interacted with over the course of the weekend please continue building and on top of that i just want to really point out that you did incredible work in just two days and uh i really hope that uh you put more than two days on it from here on you you should really improve everything and continue adding more features to what you did and really see what you can accomplish as you continue building even more so congratulations to all of you and for those of you who are interested in finding out about all the projects you can head over to showcase.google.com and see all 255 of these projects and see everything that came out of this so let's go jump into all of our demos so i'm going to call these projects and they'll come on and demo so first up we have multi-contract battle royale and without further ado let's welcome mike hi how's it going um so i'm going to present my multi-contract battle royale let me launch this up okay so the way this works is it's um it's a 100 on chain um battle royale queuing system uh analytics and um entry um and really like the main focus here was to pull in multiple projects so whether you have a um any project on polygon with your own est721 compliant token you can be pulled into this it's just you put it into the back end of the contract um and you can see i have so i have these these are actually my um nfts matic mic and the evo club lords they're both on chain projects but what i did to demo this is um in a great poly farm um which is also another con chain project on uh polygon um and that it actually is live now i launched it today so um it's uh i'm having an issue here um it is uh it's been going off a lot today so i'm just gonna go into it looks like i'm having an issue with actually submitting but um we'll just go and watch the actual an old royale that happened like 30 minutes ago um it takes a minute to queue but when anybody enters the queue they get their own seed via chain link and then the last entry actually modifies that seed and there's music with this but i'm not it's too loud so um it actually modifies the seed and then their roles um are all done in the last call so everybody's completely secure and random in their role and the entry fee is custom erc20s you can have up to two of them so we have um eggs which is the erc20 token associated with polyfarm and hgh which is the erc20 token associated with matic mic and the winner is paid out in eggs um and the hgh erc20 token is actually burned off and that's to like kind of increase your chances a little bit to win so seventy percent of the pack goes to first place um twenty percent goes to second and ten percent goes to third and it automatically pays them out um to their addresses uh this guy has been entering a lot of them so he keeps winning um and then uh this person won third place and you can see like their stats so they've entered three already with this um and they've placed once so they have like a 33 chance this guy is placed first place twice which is crazy um and then um this person has placed third place once and that's kind of the way it goes once the cube fills up it resets um back to zero and the next q just begins and if an hour passes without it filling up it'll lower down to 15 or however many people are in there if it's over 15. and that's that's basically basically it any contract that wants to get pulled in can be pulled in um because it it's if it doesn't have like a power level trait um it will just assign a random power level between like 400 to 453. so that's all thanks for watching so thank you so much that's a really cool uh yeah i just like the graphics of the whole royale so this is awesome um next up we have xerox photos so i'll have giant team dig right in welcome awesome thanks for having us uh ian is going to share his screen out and we can get started hey great xerox photos we're a stock photography marketplace that puts creators first and pays royalties every second so the team was made up of four four of us a half canadian half of american ian on front end pass and score on the contracts myself on product and some marketing strategy and jonathan on design so the problem we're trying to solve is that there's a three and a half billion us dollar stock photography market dominated by large incumbents who keep 85 percent of the earned royalties on images so that means that anyone who's licensing out their current photography to um these stock photo marketplaces they're only getting paid 15 to 20 of what the sale price is so we think creators deserve to keep much more of the value that they create and this sounds like a perfect challenge for web 3. so what we built is a two-sided marketplace where the photographer mints they're let's say it's a photography asset that becomes an nft that opens up a stream to accept payments media buyers are able to browse photos they are able to purchase a license that also gets minted as an nft that then can direct funds back to the original uh asset nft that the photographer had set up and then some some work has been put in around the dashboard of pulling in the statistics and licensing information so that people can see where that where the money is flowing what we're really excited about is that we see xerox photo nfts as not just a photo or not just a token but it's actually a quantifiable revenue stream so the ability to have an inbound stream of funds to be able to go back on an nftp asset and say this has generated x amount of dollars in the last 12 months and has a future cash flow projection of x dollars going into the future we think that the nft is the is the right technology to use in order to maximize the value of that to creators whether they want to put that into future d5 protocols trade the master asset for immediate value today it just opens up the opportunity for creatives to be compensated over a longer period of time at a higher rate than what they are today with that i'll pass it over to ian for the demo so it looks like the audio's not coming through let me want to just share one more time thank you um so hi i'm ian i'm going to run you through what we built this weekend so a photographer would come to our website and connect using their wallet and once they're logged in they can upload an nft as an asset so they'd select the image that looks good that one looks great type in some standard marketplace 721 metadata so that it can be published in a marketplace put on a photo credit which is one of our own metadata fields and then select rights managed or royalty free and then they mint their asset and at this point what we're doing is uploading json to ipfs we're minting the asset to our contract we're opening up a superfluid in uh income stream so that they can receive funds for this and we're publishing it to our marketplace so this takes a few moments but let me show you what the marketplace looks like so a media buyer would come to our marketplace and find the right image that works for them this one looks good they have the option to either stream or pay at one time so streaming is basically broken down it's going to be a a little bit more but spent over time they can basically essentially rent the nfp so they purchase the license which at this point it's gonna uh mint the license nft and open up a revenue stream directly back to the nft owner so whoever owns the nft is actually the owner of the inbound stream so as that nfp moves around so do those income streams now at this point uh as you can see i was the buyer so uh my my balance is basically decreasing we're hoping to move that functionality into our dashboard but you can see that the license entity was published to uh to polygon so that's uh that's our that's our product so um moving forward here's some of the technology that we use this weekend we use morales ipfs polygon uh underneath we were really happy working with superfluid it opened up the again the uh income stream capability that we had and we used covalent for all our nfp indexing and how we're looking at the future basically after this weekend um we'd really like to kind of uh tie down a bunch of loose ends on some bugs and get it ready for production we like to consider what it would look like to open it up to both video and font assets basically anything that's currently licensed online um and we'd like to start onboarding uh a contributor talent and phase three later this year uh we're thinking about building live live event support so someone on the ground can record and publish a stream that can be picked up by local media news outlets creator profiles collections advanced royalties and licensing and community engagement on phase four along with uh improved on and off ramps for fiat and finally we we definitely see this product as a as a dow structure because we want the community to to let us know what we should be working on so it's currently live on the polygon mumbai testnet and you can go to xeroxphotos.com or uh see the source code at ian's xerox photos thanks amazing thank you so much i i think i'm just i'll relay the same comments from the chat which is how is this a 48 hour project this is impressive so so congrats and uh yeah i hope that you finish all four of those stages and get this out in the hands of everybody else sweet alright so next up we have do nft we'll move into our third demo so welcome and uh feel free to present whenever you're ready yeah thank you for uh my name is arseniy i'm from doing ft project i also have two more team members is daria and natalya and uh let's start from the demo uh we built protocol for bonding and unbundling few nfts in one pack and it allows us to transfer a full pack of nft like and one nft and reduce cost of one transaction and also we create some infrastructure for data scientists which allows create ml model which allows to generate new content based on your nfts for example we make a copy of one's monkey and we can apply effects for example we prepared two neutral networks and few effects on these networks let's uh add some style of one of the artists a famous artist let's check what will we'll have so you see the results of uh work of neutral net uh machine learning engine and we packed it so don't worry you are not uh lose your original nft is just rapid insights uh pack uh visa modification ft and you can freely unbound it if you want to take a original one also we can show you how we how you can add a motion on your static picture for example we take one famous guy and add some emotion from jim carrey for example and let's see what we will have as a result uh the ml log is a ml module at um results every time not the same so it allows to create uh infinity um uh nfts from the to original nfts and also our protocols uh allow allows you to create some kind of combination of inside calling of the methods and can be interesting for uh for example game davinci from ft we build uh we built uh we we deployed our contracts uh on polygon test net harmony test net and ethereum test net we take information about nfts from wearable protocol and open openc and we have a few steps and my colleagues uh daria who is data scientist in our team can introduce could you please centurion yeah hello thank you for having us well actually we got our idea because we were thinking about nfcs and the problem that the collections and collectibles that already exist they have this problem of life cycle because when one collection is introduced um its attention and uh kind of like uh interest for that collection is reducing during the time and we would have been thinking what can we do to increase this kind of attention and interest uh to these collections that already exist and we also been thinking about data science as well because i'm a data scientist yeah and we combine these two ideas so we created a kind of a marketplace where data cnc is for any other kind of programmers who can work with different type of data and bring their own um uh can bring their own models their own uh algorithm uh and earn some money from that and we can bring new life to the collectibles that already exists so that's pretty pretty much the idea and also our protocol allows to bundle several nfts without applying any kind of effects to them and this can be economically sufficient because you can sell and transfer a set of enfts for example a collection of nfts from one user to another and pay only uh for one transaction like you're selling just one nft no 100 for example right um and that's can be also useful for some people yeah and that's pretty much our idea we have been working on this project not not for very long just for a couple of months and these two models they've been created for two days during the hackathon and i'm not a computer vision data scientist i usually work with text data so yeah the models aren't perfect but people who actually work with the images they can create really cool effects for the nfts thank you very much your attention thank you for your attention for our project follow us on the twitter do nifty thank you awesome well thank you so much and uh yeah this was a really fun demo um cool next up we have creativeverse so uh whenever you're ready feel free to uh to present [Music] so this is the creativeverse it is minecraft built on top of ethereum all right there's been a few different iterations of it that i've seen that other people have shown me but this one i think is pretty unique and i'm going to show you why so this is a what's called a plot world you can own different plots of lands and each plot of land the way you own it is through an nft the way you first acquire some land is that you have to claim it using save it will give you a link go ahead and open the link it will open metamask and you can click confirm once that processes i will skip ahead there we go it's processed and now i own the plot now i already own another plot in here as well so i'm gonna go ahead and now link my account this is linking my minecraft account with my ethereum this is going to open metamask again to sign a message and i'm going to copy and paste this there we go and just like that i now own this plot and this plot which i claimed earlier when i was testing it earlier so i now own those both these plots now what makes this really unique is that it not only just saves what plots you own but also saves the data all the block data and all the edits you make so if i build something cool let's say i build a smiley face cool we have a smiley face let's say i've made my magnificent building i want to save it now completely to the blockchain all i have to do is type save again go to the link confirm there we go it's done all right so from there if for whatever reason this gets i make changes or maybe the server gets reset whatever doesn't matter if something happens to it i can always sync it back up to the version that's stored on the chain by typing sync and it will reset to the version of whatever stored whatever you last saved on the blockchain all right so that was just a quick video demo hopefully you guys could hear the audio i'm pretty sure you guys could um so that's a quick video demo of my creativeverse project so everything is saved on ipfs and it's uh and that hash is saved inside of an nft so you can actually own the plots and because of that it's essentially a decentralized minecraft server because anyone can run the server on their own i don't have to be the one that runs the server if i all the sudden disappear off the earth someone else can spin up a server and you can keep working on your plot and just to prove that this plot is something i worked on a little bit ago i'm going to go ahead and sync up this plot to what i worked on a little bit ago and there we go it's synced up this is what was stored on chain and this is something that i did about a day ago or so and then i reset the world and it's still there i don't have to worry about it so yeah that's it thanks for watching uh last thing is that i did oops i did just make a twitter account for this so if you do want to keep up with this project i do want to continue this project go ahead and follow it and yeah that is all awesome uh thank you so much for that uh i'll uh i'll do one quick question that we got from the audience was like a repeating thing how do you how do you verify or how do you differentiate which plot you want i'll just see if you can do that one quick question there how do you differentiate which plot you you can own multiple plots cool hopefully that answer is uh your question there so each plot has its own separate nft with its own token id so that answers the question you hope i hope so reach out to me on twitter if you still have questions hopefully i answer it though sounds great thank you so much next up we have tom and tom's going to present yoink club whenever you're ready cool thank you um because my presentation takes a little bit of setup time um i'm just gonna play the prepared video just to make sure it runs slightly smoothly um no worries hi there i'm tom wade from the uk and for nft hack 2022 i created yoink club one of my favorite nft projects recently is the rare bunny club and like a number of recent pfp projects they've introduced a utility token to engage with their community that is generated from their existing nfts with a daily yield unfortunately a lot of these tokens get locked up in secondary markets and liquidity pools until the nfts are taken out of them yoink club acts as a gated dap that allows for these tokens to be extracted or joint at a minimal cost so how does this work well we buy a set of the nfts from a secondary market we then yoink the utility tokens from them the purchased nfts are then swapped in the nftx liquidity pool these new nfts are then joint and we then instantly sell the nft tokens back onto the nftx so the pros of this is that without factoring gas we can actually make a profit in the purchase and sale we sweep the floor of the nft project increasing the community price we generate revenue for people selling on secondary markets we unlock utility to be using the nft ecosystem that would otherwise be lost and through nftx we get an instant sale price that is known and we also generate fee revenue for those that are supplying um the nft on nftx cons of this though is that high gas fees can greatly impact margins and the risk of a failed transaction either at the start or halfway through the process can really cause a loss so if the user doesn't hold a yoink club token they won't be able to access the dap this nft token holds all the information that will vary one integration with the next we get simple display text like bunnies and carrots but we also get vital contract addresses that power the whole flow such as the open c contract the nft staking contracts and the nftx contracts that we need to use when we connect with the nft in our wallet we get the 10 cheapest tokens live from openc that are available to buy now as well as their corresponding utility tokens we can generate a snapshot of process costs as well as the current nftx resale value and potential utility yield that's right if it wasn't for gas we'd be making a profit so this next flow should hopefully be quite explanatory from the display and i've sped up a lot of the waiting time between triggering and confirming transactions so we can see here that i'm yanking the first batch of carrots and that's been successful with just over 4 000 carats acquired the tokens are then swapped on nftx now that the nftx swap has been successful i can then take the second batch of carrots from these recently swapped tokens and that's got us an additional set of carrots that have been acquired and the bunnies are then instantly sold on nftx you can see now going back to the nftx vault that the token 730 to 739 are now present as we've swapped them out and on ether scan we can see a list of all the transactions that went through to make this a reality thank you very much for listening to my presentation and i look forward to any questions anyone may have thanks tom there's a lot that happened in there but uh thanks for uh walking us through the the whole thing in that concise video and so we can just bypass all the transaction times too um it was a bit of a confirming simulator on metamask that um no hopefully it got the point across it definitely did uh this is awesome congrats thank you very much thanks and uh we are going to start with the next demo so next up we have metaverse advertisement dao and uh whenever you're ready feel free to get started hello this is mata versus advertisement dell i just played the metaphors advertisement dial the rapid rise in both the quantity and price of metaverse digital nft land has taken a cryptocurrency space by storm have been a big part of the total nft sales investors trade and rent out their land to get profit real active users in the metaverse are building experiences such as nfd galleries gaming experiences and digital events as means of socializing matt considers it as an opportunity to facilitate business and monetization method inside matters by maximizing utilization of community-owned virtual estates advertising and sharing profit with landowners and builders land owners can come and delegate their unused land to us by still retaining their ownership to the land parcels builders in mad and builders in the community are all welcome to go and build gallery spaces on this land with advertising image placeholders as borders as we gather more land outside businesses can bid the advertisement right of all the land parcels as a bundle and display the content on all the land parcels to gain traction matt shares the profit with the landowners and the builders to incentivize and encourage more users to participate for the hackathon our team created this delegation platform for led owners of both decentralized crypt voxels to come and delegate their land to us with no manual effort the centerline and cryptovoxels have this feature called set operators or collaborators to allow landowners to have builders on the land while retaining their ownership to the land that is why users can delegate lent to us while still having the ownership of the land but we can build advertisement on it and thus fully utilize the space now you can see when i click sign in and connect to my metamask account it displays all my parcels in descent land what we did is that we called a smart contract function to see all the parcels owned by the user's address and then we run the graph queries to get all the parcel information in decentraland and when i click links it will trigger a smart contract function called set update operator and i click confirm and refresh the page now you can see this parcel is already delegated to us and you can cancel any time if you don't want to delegate anymore however the longer period of time you delegate your land to us more profit will be available for you to proclaim for cryptovoxels they don't have a smart contract method that we can use so what we did is that we provide a mac contributor address there and the user can click and copy to the clipboard and go to the parcel page to set the contributor these are the implementations we finished for this hackathon but we are definitely not going to stop here as we gain more lands from our landowners our builders are actively building on those land for both advertisement and community engagement and in the future we're going to have our advertisement auction page ready for the community if you're interested in our project you can follow us on twitter and join the discord you know thank you for yeah this is our twitter if you're interested to follow up amazing that's a that's a lot of interesting stuff this is really cool um thank you it's a unique way of kind of doing this thing too of course we're seeing a lot of these uh get bigger and bigger on the land space and uh this is super cool thank you thanks thanks all right so uh our next demo is graffiti mint so uh whenever you're ready feel free to get started sorry i was muted hi we are gravity mint we built a tab for help graffiti artists to publicize and monetize their works on us nfts so in this hackathon we built an nfc marketplace for graffiti events at city parks the marketplace grants season pass for extensive content so we're gonna go straight to the demo this was an actual event here in keritoro city for a graffiti event so we use the all the artwork for the from this event to or a prototype so here is our our app and well here it displays the the graffiti that i already have but if you have want to to buy a graffiti you need first to access the system pass so we use unlock to to set a a paywall for the for the season pass and in this case i already have the the season pass and i'm able to mint and nfc so the the this is this build is set on drinking by so once the mint is setting uh the [Music] the sec the third top is ready here's the the the new nft so in this way we help to monetize two digitize and mint our artwork for street artists and we are planning we sorry we built it here with scaffold an nft marketplace and the polygon academy uh guidance to but to build this this that uh also with the rivers deployed on polygon chain but we use pinata to be in the ipfs to bring the images to the ipfs and we use unlock protocol for the system bus for the future work we're going to integrate this to the city spot called that it check out our twitter for the season pass announcement this in a specific these activities for artwork for sleep artwork will be related to the artist now role and we are going to use graphic demean on four in real life events here here in kentucky during 2022 so that's all and thank you great thank you so much next up we have charisma feel free to uh demo whenever you're ready hey everyone yeah we'll be showing our demo video for our presentation thank you i will be presenting um so everyone this is charisma uh grateful to be here i'll be showing you your our presentation analyzes your personality through nf2 holdings and on chain activity now you can also mint your nft um as a personality and then you can use the nft to find your friends what does your wallet say about you but before that let us introduce ourselves my name is joyce why and along with my teammates tooing lynn alexis wood david brandt and alex stupos we've created something that i think you really love you may be familiar with the myers-briggs 16 personality types which is derived from eight different personality traits now we have done the same tutorial wallet introducing the wallet personality indicator are you diamond hands do you only support blue chip projects have you actually outperformed e by flipping your jpegs well we have determined eight different traits that will create 16 different personality types for your wallet combining these traits with the algorithms that we have created as a community will let you know where your wallet personality is now our algorithms are community created we sat down together as a team discuss what is relevant and where the lines should be drawn in order to increase determinations example if you have more in transactions than out transactions then we know that you're probably holding your nfts and so you will get the d that enhanced attributes we use data that was pulled from opencl and also analyze activity within the wallet charisma is simple you enter your wallet information you receive your personality result you mint your personality nft and then later you can use this nft to access this per channel to find people that are similar to you and here is a demo of the technology the front end of our application sends a valid ethereum address to our api and that displays the result of the analysis for you to mint as an nft if you happen to be the owner for example should we analyze kupatrupa's wallet without logging into metamask the application works just fine so here we see koopa troopa's results which you can decipher here and go more in depth into how we calculate in this menu now should we log into metamask and supposing we actually analyzed our own address we'll be able to admit this as an nft where the verification still isn't in place but that's to do and have a record of this of what our wallet was at this moment in time charisma is just the first use case at a score we have a transparent adaptable and community governed reputation and identity system that is in fact the verifiable identity data from the blockchain so your media consumption will be a part of your identity and your reputation what we're creating is transformable identity where you can separate the identity and reputation pieces from the media object so that the users can take their identity with them wherever they go fulfilling the promise of decentralization so what does your wallet say about you come find out with charisma thanks so much for the opportunity to participate uh thank you so much for listening awesome that was a really cool idea i we're just i'm just looking at all the chat comments and now people are excited to see what their profile says about them so this is really cool um i hope this gets even better over time and uh can't wait to see all the people i know and what their personalities are uh amazing congrats and now we with that we are ready to move on to our next demo so uh next up we have nftopia hello hello um let me start shouting my screen okay so good morning good afternoon community thanks for the wait and we are team on ftopia we are a team of five um and we are proudly representing the ift marketplace that all of you have waited for so long and sorry openc so the idea of this marketplace uh reason we're doing it in this hackathon is because uh we are seeing uh the nft marketplace has a relatively high bar for people to join especially people outside from web 3 they don't have knowledge of um webster they don't have knowledge of nft um all they just simply lack the initial mining for them to invest in low speed nfts like board ape or crypto punk so that's why we built this nft marketplace uh so the the difference with this marketplace is it's powered by dao and also ai for helping people make better decision and to help people get involved in the whole nft ecosystem so let's take a quick look um just like any marketplace we have um the ift collections and one special collection that we would like to mention is this an ftopia membership so if we take a look inside this topia membership it's an erc 721 token which is the governance token of our dao which means anyone get a hold of this token has the power to participate in our dao so with that being said if we take a look at my personal account page you can see i got bunch of those tokens so i definitely have the power to participate in the dao but what you can do with the dao so this is a concept that we are introducing called review to earn so if you click this button you can see lisa pending proposals that are waiting for reveal each proposal maps to a collection let's add it to our marketplace so if we take a look at one flows this is one of the test collections that we're using in mumbai so once you submit a proposal um we also deploy uh a neural network based um ai engine in sagemaker so this ai engine will grab all the photos and extract the image features from this collection and use it to calculate a novelty score comparing to all of our well-known nft collections and also trying to tag this particular collection you can see similar collections that's associated with uh with this tag because the time is limited so you can see the ai is not doing so well at this point um it's linking a couple kind of irrelevant stuff but we are getting there um and one thing that's really powerful is if you are the owner of our membership card you can actually comment list and make a rating of this particular proposal so once you submit you can actually go back to this test mage which is the one that i just voted and it's currently still ongoing so the community rating didn't show up here but you can actually see your review here um as part of this collection so it's providing this yelp-like enriched revealing system to just help people get better understanding of this what list and iot does and just to get better understanding of how people feeling about listening ft and uh we mentioned review to earn but i haven't get to learn part so once you participated in this kind of reading and reviewing system you can claim your reward so this is a placeholder that we didn't have a chance to get to it yet so everything here is hard coded but you got the idea so depending on how many uh how many proposals that you participated in and what's your rating related to the final read results you will get weekly rewards um through our trading pool um yeah so that is um the ftopia and we're definitely not going to stop um english hacksaw we try to roll out this prototype um so so that we can lead the evolution in the ft marketplace and especially to lower the bar of ift ecosystem and help more people to get involved and we also just applied a twitter account here called unleaftopia underscore market so if you are interested to see what's the next app what's coming next feel free to stay tuned with with us um thank you thank you so much for having us and hope you're enjoying our demo definitely that was all that was awesome uh thanks for uh doing that live and um next up uh we have duoment so whenever you're ready we can get started with the presentation okay i'll i'll share my screen okay so you should no there we go okay okay let's go all right uh you want to play on that cool hi everybody um our team is called dual mint um and uh we're gonna get started in a second so i want to first start by just kind of quickly introducing the team we have hunter who is one of our full stack developers and rico on the call with me is a smart contract developer um anwar was another full stack developer and myself i'm nihil i'm a product designer and art director so let's so we're going to take you through the concept then a quick demo and then talk a little bit about our future plans um so let's start with the concept right um we wanted to solve a problem and the problem was that you know we want to help onboard people to web3 by getting them to own and use their very first entity and the type of people we're targeting is people who have heard about the space but you know there's just been too much friction for them to have dived into it quite yet and you know the friction is very real right so currently just to own ethereum to be able to buy an nft you need to go through an exchange with these massive sign-up flows entering your government id all these kinds of things um and once you actually do get to the end of a transaction you're met with these massive gas fees right so again another moment to potentially drop off or you know so uh so our solution is basically to create a frictionless experience where for someone who's a newcomer to the space they can get in a they can mint an nft for completely free not even any gas fees but you know to make this technically possible on the blockchain we do need someone to pay for the gas fees so what we created is this two-sided marketplace where newcomers can mint their nfts for free but then seasoned web 3 unit web 3 users can donate that gas feed that they'll use and as a reward they'll mint an nft themselves that basically marks their contribution to helping onboard people to web3 in this very critical time so let's look at a quick demo of that yeah so basically here you can see our landing page as you can see is divided in two section one for the voyager who would be the newcomer and one for the pilot who would be like the seasoned webfree user so let's start with the voyager so first of all they should connect with their metamask wallet as they are a new user they should be have no heat no assets in their in their wallet and once they are connected they are gonna need to verify with twitter because we don't want like bot and spammers just to start uh asking for nft for free so basically they will need to send to send a tweet and then they're gonna need to copy and paste the tweet link and then our backend is gonna verify it basically the user will be put in a queue waiting for the nft to get minted for free and here we are the nft gets minted here is the voyager pass which is basically gonna resemble a kind of uh a flight ticket so this is a metaphor that like the voyager is brought into a flight to web free and that's not all then the the the new user is going to be guided through free cool experience to really understand what web free is and what's the magic like what's actually an nft means so first of all nft means ownership nft certifies ownership of a digital asset and then everyone can see it so basically the user will first of all check their nft on openc and they are going to be able to display it the second thing is portability so as we all know the one cool thing about nft is that it can be brought into any web free apps that is compatible with the arc 721 standard and a very cool app in our opinion is spatial which is a metaverse art gallery and so here the user will be brought into spatial and will be able to connect their wallet and display their new minted nft in an art gallery unfortunately right now it's not supporting on rinkeby so we couldn't actually demo it but it's kind of something that we're going to implement and the last thing is access so nft can be used to create exclusive and gated experience and we chose to create a gated exclusive discord server so basically the user will be prompt to this discord server and let me do it again okay yeah i think the bot decided not to work but that's fine and then let's go back to our landing page so and let's go to the voi to the pilot flow so the pilot as nj said is uh supposedly to be like a seasoned web free user who's interested in uh growing the ecosystem and basically create a better ecosystem for everyone so what happens or let me just disconnect from the from this wall letter okay let's say this is the the pilot who has some heat some asset in in their wallet then of course i need to connect her so then the the pilot can decide how many passengers to onboard and basically this is gonna call what we call the duomint function which basically is going to mint an nft for the pilot and then some nfts for the passengers that are currently waiting in the queue so that's it as you can see there are two different styles this one the the coolest one is the one for the pylon the one that you saw before was the nft for the for the passenger and now i'll leave it to nj to do the final thoughts and the future plans of tourmint and let me go back to the presentation cool so what would we do if we had a little bit more time right um we think that there is a really great opportunity to increase value for the pilots aka the donors that are providing this experience and so we thought something that you know could be sequentially released is something like this experience called duomit wrapped for example right where at the end of every year we kind of show uh the highlights from all the wallets that you've onboarded so what are some themes we can pull out from that data which we already have uh from the blockchain that we can get right so doing this basically helps close the loop with donors it helps them feel good about you know the contribution they've made to the space and gives them a much more of like a personal connection to that contribution for example maybe like a couple of their the wallets they onboarded got some really rare and interesting nfts or maybe started their own collection maybe one person became like a millionaire off of buying some random coin you know knowing some of that is kind of like an interesting fact and it becomes a moment where they themselves might be like oh you know what i'm going to donate more or maybe i'm going to share this on social media and then incentivize other people in the space to also become a donor so i think that'll be a great way to kind of like close out that loop um but yeah thanks again you know hunter was on our team uh enrico's with me anwar and my name's nikhil uh thanks for having us amazing oh that was really cool i'm getting a lot of comments on how creative this idea is and how easy you're making for others to kind of get into this space so this is really amazing and uh couple people on the chat and myself would like to know how you created those uh nice uh animations for those cars because i want to figure out how to do that later so let us know how that happens on the chat so everybody can find out this is great um so i have two quick uh announcements here or comments here so the first one is we have about five more demos to go and we'll we'll go into all the prizes and the second quick comment is that we actually had about 16 teams that we were going to bring on we couldn't reach one of them um in time but they did end up responding to us about 10 minutes ago so we're going to have the 16th team also come on at the very end so um we got six more projects to go and then we're going to get to prizes so without further ado let's welcome instant blockchain domain search so whenever you're right yes yes hello everyone yeah that's me um let me share the screen yeah so my tool is yeah it's a it's called instant blocking domain search and as the name suggests it's like a quick search for domain name availability on multiple blockchain name providers like ens um unstoppable and then near near is basically the account name and it also searches uh dot com dot x y z dot io and see if the twitter username is available so let me quickly sorry let me type in my name and yes you can see dot at and dot near is taken about maybe and then dot com and twitter is whatever uh but all these are available so if i click one of them it will open the unstoppable domain and i can buy from here if i want and similarly it works for um like dot com you go to already yes and accordingly so um yes and um another example where it's take the same one name is taken in multiple registries is this one um so that's that's most of it and another feature is um if i search for this home for example so home dot it is already taken but it's shown in yellow because this is available for sale by its current owner um you can see the price currently by price it's it's pretty huge it's like 1720. so if i click this one you will be taken to the openc page where you can make an offer or buy now um yes i think that's it that's it it's a very simple tool and i don't want to take more time uh yeah if this is right if there is any questions or feedbacks yeah no people are asking for how do they use it so i just sent them the link the most obvious and amazing thing is his life right uh yes so i'm going to find a proper name for this application unfortunately two days is not enough to find the name and i'll get a name and then i'll deploy properly but for the timing it's deployed in netlify [Music] uh thank you so much and uh yeah i hope that everybody checks this out cool thank you so much next up we have nft pay chris whenever you're ready [Music] yes hello everybody let me share my screen real quick all right uh so i don't know how many of you have ever tried to issue an invoice or have worked in business to business sales but you probably have tried to collect a payment or collect a signature through using something like pandadoc or stripe or some other payment provider like paypal um and really the the volume of electronic invoicing has gone way up in the last 10 years uh if you look uh at this document i found may not be the most uh you know i don't i haven't validated the source but in some sense uh this uh volume of transactions have has only gone up in recent years and covet has accelerated the need for e-mortgages or e-e uh invoices so nft the the concept of nftpay is very simple anybody can come here and create an invoice so let's say i was a sas business and i wanted to invoice some customer that wanted to do business with me i could just say sas agreement for one one year one-time payment thanks uh and there's a typo there maybe that's uh legitimate so you know what's happening in real time uh i can copy a payment address so uh the beauty of this is that i this could be any address and i don't necessarily need to connect my metamask in order to use this product uh when i create an invoice there's a couple steps that happen behind the scenes uh the first thing is that the metadata for that invoice is stored on ipfs and this is immutable so the information about where that payment should go what the payment is about and when it was created is all saved and unchangeable after it's uploaded the more important thing might be the payment url so when you create an invoice you get a new payment url that pulls in the data from that uh invoice i just made and i would share this with the customer and when the customer is comfortable they can come in and pay with their wallet pay with their credit card uh there's a there is an additional option here for uh continuous payments if it was like a a recurring payment but uh really it's whatever the customer is most comfortable with they can use the mechanism that they want uh if i pay with my wallet we use unlock protocol and go ahead and walk through this process uh i can use the same address and so when this checkout process is actually completed it's going to generate two receipts represented as nfts as well so we forever have a receipt on the blockchain it's not like you know i'm stamping a receipt on a spike if you've been to a restaurant or i have a file cabinet for receipts uh it's instead stored on a ledger that can be forever viewed uh thanks for doing business or you know you could say like excited to do business save and continue you get prompted to do that metamask transaction the other approach is credit card a lot of businesses may not have crypto accounts but they want to be able to still use nftpay to settle on usdc and i have some example information uh thrown in here uh but exactly the same process works so uh typically the payment at the buyer's address would be different than the seller's address so this is the destination address i'm going to here's the address that i want that nft receipt to be delivered i click ok a few things happen behind the scenes the payment gets withdrawn from the credit card when that settles uh hopefully this settles yes um so two uh uh there's there's two nfts that get generated after the end of that process and this is using the nft port we have the buyer uh and there's the nft receipt and it has very similar metadata to what i showed on the invoice and then the the other transaction for the issuer is also generated and saved on ring b and i could go ahead and open those up uh but that is more or less the transaction last thing i want to show is the history tab so as you know if you had an invoice account and you are creating a whole bunch of uh invoices for people as that money is coming in you might want to see all the transactions that you have on your account uh with this rather than looking on ether scan you can simply uh pull the transactions for whatever chain you're using click one of these and go ahead and open that nft or whatever transaction that's on that particular address there's a lot here hopefully you're using a fresh address for the invoices but that is pretty much the core functionality that is pretty much nftp app i have a youtube video as well but uh thanks for your time that was uh surprisingly convenient this is amazing uh well i mean some of you are blown away with this i'm looking at the chat here um this is really cool i hope that uh you're gonna make this available in production all righty thanks y'all cool thanks chris all right we got four more to go uh next up we have spyglass whenever you're ready [Music] can you guys see my screen everything's good sorry the zoom bar moved over and i couldn't find it um hey everyone my name is will i'm joined by my team here um david devin daniel and sudhi and we are spyglass um so what is spyglass spyglass is a tool um is an nft curation and analytics tool so we're not really focused on the nfts that you have in your wallet we're focused on helping you find the most valuable and the best nfts out there the pain point and i'm sure most of you know this because this is an nft hackathon i'm sure all of your but all of you are buying nfts when you're looking at a collection of 10 000 nfts on openc um sometimes it can be a little hectic chaotic because you're opening up 100 different tabs and you're like looking up some rarity tool and trying to figure out like oh is this nft overvalued or is it undervalued um and then by the end of it like once you've determined oh like i want to buy this one someone else has already scooped it up um and so you're always feeling the stress and pressure to find the right ones so this tool really helps you look through the nfts or the collections and it provides some data on top of what openc already offers um to help you make informed purchase decisions um so the way it works and i found out that i can't type and talk at the same time so let me type this in first um so you start by searching for a collection oops i probably typed it in wrong we've we've only loaded up a few collections right now so that's why there was that bug but here we go so we've loaded up the collection and this first view is our flip book view we really wanted to focus on reducing friction for users so making it as easy as possible to look through collections so this view allows users to quickly flip through a collection and some interesting data that we show is whether or not an nft is over or underpriced daniel our our data scientist um he was actually able to pull down all the data from the open c api and run some ml models on it so that's how we come up with this predicted price um i believe it comes from like analyzing the like the current sales data um against traits um and i'm sure we could flesh that out more later on um and then it also will show you like the basic um information for average last sale but what's really cool is it also shows you for each trait what is the rarity what's the average price for that rarity and whether or not this specific nft is over or undervalued by that trade so let's say you are a trader and you really love this board a hat um you can go through filter go to hats filter by that red hat um and then you can skim through all of the ones with the red hat and then figure out which one might be undervalued turns out all of these are overvalued um so um so yeah and then once you find the one that you like you can click this and just buy it on openc um a feature that we wanted to implement but we couldn't get to this weekend was um batch buying so as you're going through these you can you can like them um we also included keyboard shortcuts um so that you could quickly like them and then once you're done liking and and rating the nfts um you could go to the liked collection or maybe everything that you rated eight and above and then batch buy them all in one bundled transaction um so that you save on gas fees um so that'll be a future feature um there's also a grid view and if you hover over um you'll get the table still need to clean the css up a little bit we pushed it right up to the deadline um but yeah that's that's most of the tool um i'll go over um how we made it happen um so daniel david and devon took care of pulling the david or pulling the data down from the open c api feeding it through the ml models um right now we're pushing it through a csv into our own rest api um in the future we'll probably need to iron out that connection um and then we save everything to our own database so this will allow us to run models over time and then also have histo historical price data so that we could show fancier uh data visualizations um over time um and i guess that brings me to some more of the future work um and sorry excuse this deck we were pushing it really close so we didn't put much time into the deck um but this is just an example of some interesting charts that that we were able to pull um so this is based off of like the clothing trait for the board apes um i won't get into too much detail here um but yeah this is one other feature um and then i guess just adding like even more functionality to make to make it easier for people to um go through these collections so like comparison tools um better sort functionalities um things of that nature um i guess would be on the roadmap i mean we didn't really start talking about whether or not we actually wanted to keep this going um until we became finalists so now that we're here we did make a twitter it is a brand new twitter spyglass nft um so if you think this idea is cool and you actually want to see it happen let us know and then maybe we'll build it we're still figuring that out um team anything i missed sweet thanks everyone that was great um yeah i'm impressed by uh how you were able to kind of make all that work out and uh i guess uh it's there you go i'm just i'm just happy to hear that now you're gonna consider really making this a thing after after this demo and going on stage so i hope this becomes a reality and uh i hope that you onboard every single collection that uh currently exists and everybody's excited about it sure thanks carter congrats all right so uh we got three more to go next up is crops in whenever you're ready hey guys how's it going thanks for having us i'll just share my screen real quick cool so we're crops in and our teams consisted of a hobby we took the back end josh we took the front end and myself who helped with the design so today the in the creative the creative economy is currently a 104 trillion dollar market as you know uh videos are a massive massive part of the content that's pretty being being put out um content is growing especially during this time and it's amazing it's amazing market to be uh to be part of and a part of a part of those art uh creator economy are artists and as we can see they're growing there the independent artist market is growing 32 percent year over year and as you can see rolling stone even spoke about it um and how the the market's growing and more and more because of the market um it's growing so much people are starting to make um creator they're starting to to create recording studios in their house so obviously so recording studio can cost anywhere from 500 to 20k depending on your um and depending on your cost and how much you want to be how much you want to be how much you want to put in it um but overall independent artists are joining because they're kind of sick of the terrible deals that they're getting record labels and so to combat that um and but the problem is that they're facing is how they're going to get noticed with so many users all over these web uh platforms so you have for instance on youtube 2.2 billion users uh a billion users on instagram a billion on tick tock and so on and so forth so to combat that and to help independent artists get noticed paid it funded with creative crops and cropton is a platform that pays creators in crypto to use indie artists songs in their videos and lets them share in an artist's success by investing them through our album art song ticket metaverse merch and song royalty nfts and that way artists stay independent and get noticed paid and funded the way it works from a technical aspect is art and artist mints in erc1155 token by deciding how many tokens it will create for that nft and artist puts it on sale on a marketplace contract a creator will use used audio in here hers his or hers video and received 30 to 30 tokens for it and then the creator can buy or invest in the artist uh via the nft and then pay with the tokens he or she received um from here i'll take it i'll pass it on to josh to go through the demo hey folks how can everyone see my screen yep good all right i'm going to take you through the two crops and workflows we have set up right now uh first is going to be the independent artist so as an independent artist i have a couple songs here that i've created and uploaded to ipfs through our ui um and i want to make these available to content creators to use in their videos so um i'm gonna go over here there's a mint button so it's gonna pop up with a transaction to create that min and as i'm doing this uh javi if you want to explain what's going on yeah and as josh said mentioned they probably mentioned previously and there are these things about it is about means tokens how to represent their video and once those songs are minded that as usher said before it's an erc 55 then their disad is allowed to send it so now josh will click on sell once it sell it sells it there are two transactions first of all we need to allow the marketplace contracts to approve uh the to approve it we will spend all the tokens from the from the artist and then one thing one last transaction is mine the second one is basically put that token on sale with the price and the quantity that the artist wanted to to sell it like okay so then josh is showing all the transactions in one and the other one is the marketplace in this case we are in the marketplace i think that is the latest transaction is putting the token on sale right all right so now we have some song nfts available for use by content creators so i'm going to switch over to the content creator context and i know spirit of the soul is a good song i want to use that in a video so i'm going to search for it and say all right let's add that to a video uh it magically works and i got 30 crp um now i can check that in my wallet here if i refresh uh 10 close enough uh yes i got paid uh for using independent content and [Music] then we can additionally if we you know really believe in an artist we can close that we can go to their artist page and there's other ways to invest in their success so to speak and that is with nfts so this artist has two nfts set up a [Music] metaverse decentraland t-shirt or you can also invest in this lonely album and get royalties when people stream that album um you know it's not limited to just these two things there's tons and tons of different ways that independent artists can generate new revenue streams with this but um these are just the examples we have set up right now and uh i'll hand it back to asher to talk about the future of the project thanks josh yeah to address what joshua's saying um um i think the idea the idea is to bring all the things that artists uh would usually bring would usually make money off into the nft space so that includes uh tickets digital merch uh tickets merge um our album artwork and and royalties and all this can be uh created into an nft for for users to invest in and basically as a artist grows and succeeds you share in the success with them um and i'll just share my screen talk about the future of the product and our own map so during this we realized that we actually worked really well together and we wanted to kind of take it to the next level so right now we continue building on the mvp uh get a better understanding of our users for of the best pmf we could have the best product market fit scale the token launch and eventually our vision is to exit to endow with the funds um to push innovation and have a music fund that uh invested on an artist um and that's pretty much it thanks so much guys amazing thank you um i was just waiting to see at least one music nft related hack this is uh this is great and uh visually so pleasant so congrats i'm pulling all this together and i hope that you uh really make this go live and have others use it too thanks so much all right two more projects to go next up we have zeus doubt whatever yes so hi everyone i'll keep it short i'm not gonna start so what we have built is a community management protocol for token gated communities imagine discord if it if it took the web free bill uh so just to see how the mvp that we have built for the hackathon uh imagine we have used nfts i have used energies in my wallet and they are uh that use uh zeus nfts had three meta trades gold silver and bronze imagine them as a discord categories so discord access rules so within the platform there will be certain tabs that can be only accessed by those nft holders and uh for now we we have video content and if a user watches 70 of the content uh they can claim a pope on the polygon network and we have used live fear to do amaze because discord is mostly useful in charting and doing community engagement with like amas and live stream so we have used that so now let's see a demo so this is the platform so the only thing that you will see on the cloud platform is connect your wallet because you can't access anything right so now let's connect the wallet that does not holds the nft let's use nft so it clearly shows no nfp found but now let's connect uh nft that holds this use bronze one so when i connect this use bronze one so it should have the basic access to your just like discord so i get the access to bronze tier the live fear which is used for like doing amas and as well as recorded all of the live stream that we did fast so now let's connect uh which has used gold so when i connect this use gold i should be able to access all of the tiers that are in the discord compared to that discord so similarly you can see that i have access to all of like gold silver and gold and this can be only accessed by the token holders who has that and now let's watch a video right so uh if i watch a video right so if i watch 70 of the video just to incentivize the community they can claim a pope and uh now you can click on the polygon network because don't wanna guess paid fees and uh one of the edge cases many people are wondering like what if i pull the video to the top right i should be able to claim the book but if you watch the screen very closely you can't do that every time you put it forward it will keep you backwards and all of the content that you are seeing uh this can be posted by a moderator or admin in the discord role so they have their own admin dashboard uh where they can put edit review which tier do they want to put in and with the help of fly fear you can do live streaming uh and this is one of the best features for the platform because most of the token gated communities cannot do live streaming why because discord like sucks to be honest it cannot handle so much bandwidth and if you do like on youtube or twitch the link can be shared to anyone so it's just not specific to those communities so with the help of life here you can only access the live fear tab if you have the the token so i'm streaming the same thing so that's why it's like you feel like you're slagging but yeah so that's what we have built uh we want every community to have this their own discord in their website just like a plug-in that they use snapshot so yeah and the the couple of features that we're gonna work on is chat because if we include chat then it will like a fully discord feature and on the live stream as well so that's pretty much it sweet and short awesome thank you this is a really cool one um this has given me a couple ideas to uh update each global.tv so uh a lot of new stuff here congrats all right now we have our last demo of today so without further ado let's welcome our next team nftcam [Music] look for your demo whenever you're ready hi hello um yeah we are mft kim and then um so for all these hackers i'm gonna try to build a project where it will help us to help bring in the nfts into a interactive ai experience uh yeah i think i'll just play a video for introduction and i'll do a show demo afterwards uh we are a group of engineers and designers who are passionate for nft and we created nft cam nfd cam is a camera app designed from the ground up for nft people in the real world we love sharing photos and videos about our art collections to express our tastes and engage with other community members but in the ft world there aren't many ways to express our love for our collections to others visually well except for changing the profile picture of your twitter most nfts stay in the wallet and no one else can see them augmented reality could potentially solve this problem by bringing the digital assets into the real world opening a whole range of opportunities for people who share their collections but now these ar experiences can only be found on web 2 platforms and require modeling and programming expertise to create an ftcam however can turn any openc nft link to an ar experience thanks to the interoperability of web stream with the help of openc api we can access the access of the mft at ease and generate an ar experience according to the type of the nft take this humanoid 3d model from sandbox for example we only need to write once and the ar experience will work perfectly on any other hume noise 3d models from sandbox but it's probably better to see it in action now we are looking at piracy.mt on openc we can copy the url paste it into nfdcam and now we can dance with emt under the hood we used meteopath from google to track the body and use the post data to drive the 3d model the 3d model is rendered in webgl with the help of 3ds we can also connect our wallet to view our own collections right now the prototype only works on test night we can see the list of nfts we have in this place let's select tormented mage and now we can dance with tormenting match in the same way due to the limited time we only support humanoid characters from sandbox for now but we plan to create more ai experiences for 2d pictures and other kinds of 3d models so if you are interested please drop an email to the email address below thank you very much yep and then i will do a quick live demo yeah so that's our project yeah it uh worked perfectly and i was worried about the the virtual camera not showing up on the live stream but it did uh this is great that's awesome congrats well uh i think this is like a perfect uh last demo to end uh this is uh this is absolutely incredible and uh so super creative so i'm really glad that we're seeing uh people blend in uh super cool ideas into the real world yeah thank you all right congrats all right so this is absolutely incredible and this also concludes our last finalist demo so i want to quickly congratulate all 16 of these teams here

quick note on price delivery i'm going to highlight a few things some of these have already been brought up in the chat so i just want to reiterate some of these comments and address some of the open questions that exist out here first up is we will be connecting you with all the sponsors about delivering of your prizes in in most cases youth global will be delivering all these prizes so we are the only point of contact and the ones coordinating everything so look out for an email from us for some cases where we are not delivering the prize uh we'll be connecting it with the sponsors the second big important piece is that although it was required to make sure that your code base is open source as part of the submission process and we did go through everybody's commit history to ensure that nobody worked on something before the project or the hackathon started we'll be doing another thorough review of everybody who is on this list of any prize winners whether it's our finalists the 16 teams or any of the sponsor winners and we'll be making sure that no rules were broken and only then you'll be receiving your prizes on top of all that most prizes will be distributed by the 22nd of january or 21st of january so this requires enough time for us to make sure that everything is in place whether it's getting all the information we need whether it's kyc we need to deliver or any sort of disputes we need to manage which brings me to the last point which is we have 48 hours to dispute any pool price editions which means that if you applied for a price for a sponsor especially on the pool price category and you were not one of those names uh you have 48 hours from now to inform us that you were not consider or you would see your name there so that we can coordinate anywhere from a second review or a assessment and get a good understanding of what what happened and why you were not out there so that's kind of a whole disclaimer on all the prizes and don't worry we will be thoroughly communicating all of this on discord and on email so before we close this off i want to quickly take a minute or two and give a few thank yous um to everybody that made this happen primarily these are the six main actors involved in making all this together so i want to make sure that i give a good shout out to everybody that helped us out over the weekend first of all i want to thank all of our judges who kind of took hours today to go through 255 projects and talking to everybody and seeing all these demos not an easy job but really grateful for all of their time and support i want to thank all of our technical mentors for being there being able to answer questions and basically making sure that people are not blocked whether it's at 2am or 2pm so really thank you to all of you for making this happen so i want to quickly shout out to all of our our speakers who give countless talks and workshops on thursday and friday and making sure that you have anywhere from resources you need to get started with any custom protocol or sdk to just having coordinated any sessions that got you feedback or ideas for your projects this weekend and of course so many incredible people from all of our partners that were here um not only available to answer questions for just a protocol but overall making sure that anybody who has any questions um got them addressed especially for about 400 of you who are just trying to get into the web3 ecosystem so congratulations to all of you and i want to thank to all of our amazing and incredible partners that were here this entire time and i also want to quickly shout out to these amazing volunteers who ran all the behind the scenes of everything from judging to a lot of the stuff we coordinated across so many different time zones and so much in parallel judging 800 plus people at the same time making sure everything happens smoothly uh was not easy and without their help we would not be here uh closing the the day the weekend so thank you so much everybody and lastly i want to give a quick shout out to minnie and mls luke emily andrew jacob heather and liam from the global team uh because it takes so much time effort and coordination and hard work and love to make all these things happen and i know we're already getting messages from how much everybody enjoyed especially for all of you who are attending this for the first time and without all their help we would not be able to run all these events smoothly and uh this is just the beginning of this year we got 15 more to go so congratulations to everybody again and thank you so much for everybody that made all of this possible so before we wrap up i want to make a quick comment which is the final list so we got 16 teams who presented today we call them finalists because for those of you who don't know these global were really focused on getting more people interested in web 3 by having them experiment and really try things out to see what could be possible and as a result we don't call them our winners because we really don't want to be in the first second third category of business here and we really want to showcase really cool ideas that people are excited about and that's why everybody that kind of comes on as a finalist is officially considered first place and a winner for our event and as a result all 16 teams came in equally first and we will be giving a thousand dollars to every team member from each of those teams as part of being our finalist so congratulations to all of these teams so after we verify everything we'll be following up um and bundling all the prizes together and we'll be sharing all those details soon to each of those teams so congrats one more time and i really can't thank all of you who are still here with us um enjoying as well as uh up in so many different time zones and watching this not only live but also on discord and everywhere else so thank you so this won't be a global event if we don't tell you what's coming next so before we close this entire live stream off i want to give a preview of what we're about to uh start after this and i'm really happy to announce that our next hackathon is called road to web3 and it's gonna begin in just a little bit over two weeks and uh this is going to be another similar hackathon like this where we're really focused on getting way more web to developers and designers and builders interested in seeing what's happening in in web 3. so we're going to be working and partnering with polygon on this one and uh as of this sentence this event is now live you can head over to web3.egobl.com to anywhere from sign up or find about find find out about it more and uh we'll be sharing a lot more information on it in the coming few days and if you enjoyed this one you want to attend the next one as well or you want to bring on your friends please sign up and attend the next hackathon so hopefully we'll see all of you in a couple weeks and if not in a couple weeks uh more many months to come as we are running 15 more events this year so with that i'd like to thank all of you for coming in and tuning in hope all of you get some good rest for this weekend and recharge for the next week and i really hope all of you continue building so with that i'm going to sign off and thanks so much everybody have a great rest of your weekend
