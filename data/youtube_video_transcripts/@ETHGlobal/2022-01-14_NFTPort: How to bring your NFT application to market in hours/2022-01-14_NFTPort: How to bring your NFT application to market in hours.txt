second now and just want to say um welcome to our first workshop of the day for nft hacc and super excited for everyone to start hacking later today all right we are good to go so hello everyone uh we have johannes here from nft port with his workshop how to bring your nft application to market in hours um super excited to have nft port here and with that being said i'll hand off the mic to johannes thank you and welcome to nft hack everybody as i'd actually like to start with a sort of a short story how we and if they bought attended as hackathon participants during last year nfd hack and it was if i'm not mistaken of like march or something like that the previous end of the hack and uh as a company or or as a startup we were actually quite in a sort of a difficult spot here because you're in the middle of a bullet and [Music] we ended up attending nfd hack and uh we got a lot of inspiration uh from nfd hack and we actually sort of uh in parts also crew out from nfd hack see all the participants all the hackers they're all the builders of the craters i guess the one of the message that i would like to give you is like nfts is a new space there's a lot of new opportunities and you can create uh [Music] this this nft world so everything that you see let's say about energy board or any other kind of nfc company today uh they're created by people just like me and you um so i guess this is sort of the first message for you that you can create really cool uh build really cool things here in the end of this space uh and as sort of the title of the talk is how do you actually bring your nfc application to market in in hours and then i won't trouble with you any kind of let's say like flashy slides i'm an engineer by my heart as well and so i'll sort of give you a really quick rundown what nfd ball is how it actually helps you and then we'll dive right into actual building together so i'll show you the nfd apis as with with what you can actually build your application um and as a sort of start we like to tell about we are basically striped for nfts so if you ever use tripe then you know it's like really easy use has like three developer apis etc um and we really like to help developers uh ship their entity products to market so you don't have to worry about the complex and the infrastructure uh you can just focus on your own product um under your own users and basically you're already today use firefighters and full of themes um a lot of like known names like such native gateway which is like one of the largest entity marketplaces and if it the question is what can you actually build with nfd board how does it help you then we sort of like to categorize into three different buckets so one is you can deploy currently on polygon nfd contracts and i mean 10 of these i'll show you that as well so those are like your fully fully earned contracts you can customize them etc etc the second big part is that you can very easily pull nfc data into your applications and that is for both ethereum and polygon and third one is what we like to call enhanced apis so let's say you want to actually have like a search bar uh during the application or you want to add a recommendation engine or even an nfc counterfeit detection so your users don't get farted then you have this kind of like enhanced apis as well that you can use so let me come to the docs now and yeah like uh sign up is you could just grab your free api key it's uh you can you can start which is like self sign up and also for nfc hack participants we actually have a package so if you'll dm us in nfd port uh discard channel then we'll actually increase your uh api limits so specifically you can lim for free you can mint up to 1000 fees and get access to all the nfd data as well so now let's uh jump into the api docs we also have some nice tutorials here uh i won't tell you to do deep here but you can basically like how can you actually use 10 of the data main thing you know how you can actually create your nfd collection um if you want to get like 10k and affiliants and how you can create dynamic nfts uh so let me i can actually show you how these dynamic entities look like so we can so this is this is of course like step like uh speed up uh but you can basically let's say you need an nfp and then you can do an api call you can actually change the metadata as well so the nfd becomes dynamic and you can create a lot of use cases with dynamic entities so of course like how do you get your metamask with your homepage and even how you can actually use nfts inside unit as well uh using nfd ports so you can either pull nfd data do your unity app game or mint 10 of these as well and save for enhanced apis and now let's um jump into actually uh we start with uh getting the nfd data so let's say you want to actually get if you go let's say i want to get all nsds that are in the board api clock collection then i can grab the contract there is this can i just add the contract address uh chain ethereum uh i want to include metadata so the response has metadata as well and i'll fire it up and i will get the nfd's so this is if i'll actually exclude metadata for a second then you will get all the nfd's all the tokens in this contract and as you can see there are 10 000 in in total and if you met at the back then you can get like the image uh open cached image uh we'll see like specific like uh all of all that data that you see let's say about the properties you have in the in the response and we also give back uh cache file urls so if you those are like um cached files that we downloaded from ipfs or wherever the original file is stored so you can actually basically uh it's it's similar like a cdn so you'll you can download the original assets very fast from this google pocket so this is like you're doing caller kind of these you can as well do the same for uh getting like a single nfd details um it's also for you do the same for the polygon and we have endpoints for ownership data so let's say i want to get uh say owned by ddr vault i want to get all of these this account uh owns i'm just here i recreate mft zone pan account and i'll get all the nfts to do specific account tones uh so this is like a different a lot of different use cases let's say if i want a bit like gallery if i want to build any kind of uh application where i want to show to the user what nfts he or she owns then that's a very easy api to use you can also get nfts that account has created and migration it's basically if you mint an nfd so let's say i go to a benefit drop collection has just opened up i go to someone's home page and i meant to my own wallet then that sort of initial mint thing is basic creation so let's see if this account has minted any as well so this one it seems hasn't needed but basically if you if you would have minted nfts then those nfds would be seen here then you had data about transactions and we have sales statistics about let's say if you take the same if you want to get part app club save statistics then we get the same statistics like one day one sunday 30 day volume sales like average price floor price market cap etc we can also get transactions by contract and those include on-chain transactions and also for olive contracts off-chain as well so specifically auto-chain data what i mean is opens the plus variable zone or the book data so again if we take the port api club and we want to get all transfers or actually let's say sales and that this in this contract is happening uh so this is unchained data and we can get all the all the sales uh here so he's the buyer is a seller likes um details about the specific nft quantity what's the price transaction hash uh where was that detection took place so it's an open c also you'll get like cancel listings um and you can do the same for basically there's also a barometer for uh you're going to get all transactions in that specific contract uh and what it does is it will return to you transfer permit fees list and and sales so as you can see this uh type sale transfer cancel listing and and so forth so forth now you can do the same about let's say if he coded a specific i want to get transactions that this specific account has done then i can go to recruit detections by account i want to see all let's say all sales that he has then so i can skip all that sales that this account has done or any other kind of uh let's say transfers listings buyings et cetera and the same when i showed for a full contract i can do for a specific nft as well so if you go to this uh type here with three three six eight and we get all all the history of that specific of the whole transactions that has happened to it then i can get all the transactions like transfer sales etc etc now this is the end of the data part as you can see it's like really easy to use like just simple api goals and in the docs you will find all the like the details as well now we'll jump to minting so let's say you want to as you saw like um you want to create your own collection or you even let's say uh you're creating a cave or any kind of like an application where you want to mint an nft based on some user event uh so let's say you know i'm playing a game um i have a sort of i do some sort of request killer monster um and then now you want to from your back end let's say you want to mint and have the uh do my user so this is sort of like uh those kind of like dynamic flows are very easy to uh to do with that with our apis and the first step what you can do is deploy your own nfd contract so it's a standard erc71 contract you will see all the code it's open sourced in github and um basically you'll get all the parameters here that you can customize uh like your contract uh chain uh currently support polygon rinkeby uh each maintenance is upcoming as well and the name of the contract symbol owner address let's say if i were to deploy the contract i would set it as my address then now with something that you can do if you want to create dynamic nfts then you can set metadata update to the less true and uh base uri as well if you want to do sort of a reveal uh where you know nfds are hidden at first and after some time you can actually change the base uri and 10 of these are revealed so if i would uh ask the first step i can deploy the contract again you can do everything from here then after that you can basically already start minting or if you don't have uh haven't uploaded files typeface yet then you can upload your files also type ffs so it's like really easy to uh use let's say i can pick like uh any kind of file from here let's say nfts christmas all right some christmas picture it's a really large picture so i can complete my files and uh the files are being uploaded to ipfs um and they're also back backed up by fire going using nfc storage so let's say wait until it finishes uploading we should pick the smaller file uh usually when you're uploading a larger file to scoop to like do from code for terminal but it finished and now you can see that [Music] i'll get back to acfus url this will probably take some time until uh an iphone response and it's a really large file as well um so and once you sort of upload let's say 10 000 of your nfp pictures or any kind of other assets that you want to upload then you would go as a next steps after let's say deploying benefit contract uploading file first then you would upload metadata type fs and again you can basically customize uh whatever you need to customize in metadata so you can have a name for your nfc description file url this is the same url url that we got from here that we upload if i uh like this but if you really want to you can also use any other kind of file you're on uh even if it's like centrally hosted you know nobody's really sort of like saying that you can't do it just like a sort of a soft recommendation do you use uh decentralized storage within of these external real url this is something like that basically you know an openc you can see it as like let's say your home page uh if you want to up if you're actually uploading any kind of let's say videos audio files any kind of animation url so here you can also add custom fields so basically uh in any of the metadata you can upload any arbitrary data and what you can do is have it to sort of even like key value database in a way so in this metadata uh uploading metadata you can just like add any kind of arbitrary data that you want to include within an ft and here are the attributes as well so attributes are again like the basically properties that you see and uh the the spec is basically opens these uh inspect as well so it's it's in the same format of attributes now as the first that you deployed and of the contract you uploaded your files like the first metadata like this then that's the next step you're basically ready to start minting your own fully owned contract that you deployed in the first step you would basically take the contract address uh that you got from the deploying uh you would add the metadata uri that you got during the uploading metadata like this and and do the address that you want to mean that specific nfd is it your for example your own own address wallet address account address or if i brought the example that you and i actually already meant to an user uh whom let's say does some kind of event in your application uh he buys something or he let's say plays a game then you can and if he enters uh his address then from your backend you can actually already mint uh do that user wallet address so this is sort of the mint thing uh part we also have like helper uh sort of functions or sort of endpoints as well like recreating maintenance you can also up update amit data nft so this is in the case when you during contract deployment uh you set metadata update to the last true and then you can basically update the method of the uri so you can sort of create nft as a dynamic one and you can see specifically and you can also later if you're done updating then you can also freeze metadata so everything is recorded on chain and users also see okay you update it once but you can't update it anymore as it's frozen now on a contract level and if you just want to let's say uh test things out there's like easy minting with urls as well and even in a file upload this is a shared if you're using those easy minting endpoints those will be minted to our shared contract so if you're building your own application etc then we recommend deploying your own contract uh then we can continue to enhance the apis uh so first one is multi-chain nfd search so let's say if you count the open c or any other sort of majority of uh nft applications then you can you have some kind of uh search uh bar rate uh but building a good search is quite uh complex uh or it's not not maybe so complex but it takes quite a lot of time uh handling all indexes the databases etc so what you can have is um let's say you can have uh you can search nfts uh across different chains uh currently super polygon theorem or you can search across both of them and let's say i fired it up and tempo responds all the nfds that have in their name or description the search query so i search for italic so yeah i get all of the nfts back you also have a recommendations ai uh engine basically so and this is based on uh visual content so let's say if i own some sort of uh specific art that looks uh let's say has like abstract art then i can actually let's say typo here but i would want to find let's say similar visually similar images to this one or recommend similar nfds to users then what i will just do here is pass that image into the endpoint and it will respond with a similar abstract nfd's images so it's the ai workspace i'm using computer vision and theories let me see there is in the user interface uh where you can actually test things out as well fingible so this is like a showcase uh application uh built in those enhanced apis uh you can do the text search here and this is the same endpoint that i mentioned to you so with alex plug elixir um you can do the reverse so this is basically the first image search here is the recommendation ai now let's say if i so as you can see this was an original and you can find like similar similar ones or even you can actually let's say you just describe what you want um and basically here you go so uh vitalik is uh smoking with a hat and there is also the counterfeit detection so let's say if you do that this support yield club uh specific one i can take the contract address i'll also filter out the same contract address and of these and three trees 3d68 search for and as you can see uh very similar nfts but those aren't actually the original ones probably openc has even taken those down luckily or unluckily you know it's sort of uh depending on their point of view um and yes those are sort of like um depending on your own use case uh you might want to show the user hey this kind of like nfd has been like created already or you might want to automatically bake things down this is updated developers to decide and uh and yeah those are also the duplicate detection ai that i just showed here as well we can pass in and url token id or even upload a file as well so this is sort of uh in a very quick manner uh give an overview of the nfd apis and the infrastructure um and do the recap you can really easily mint 10 of these deploy your own contracts dynamically in 10 of these you can get enough data from interior and polygon and you can use those kind of enhanced apis which help you build a better product and i will now check what kind of questions do we have floor price so this is the first question i will take i guess this is about sales statistics so floor price uh is actually from let's take this uh board ape one again uh floor price uh is um actually from uh open z so where we're getting the uh for price data the rest of the data let's say dota volume dollar etcetera etcetera number of owners designed all on january what's the delay between a mint versus when it shows up in your index use case for this we'll be creating the live streaming here for being dropped minted right now so i guess the question is about like how fast let's say if you mint uh with our end points and how fast uh the same nfts are being just sort of are available in our own uh and of the data apis and usually it's like a few minutes so if you would need to sort of have a use case of like uh live streaming where you need it in seconds uh then at the moment uh we don't have this sort of a fast turn around in order to support that use case but you can also test that as well it might be good sort of quick enough for you and the second part of question how fast for let's say and transaction is recorded on chain and how fast it is uh in our index again this is usually in between like two to five minutes is the usual uh sort of delay at the moment here c 155 supported and there's two ways how to answer the question one is for mint think the answer answering no uh we are shipping it we're basically like in the testing phase for it uh we're shipping it beginning with next week uh which means unfortunately it's not really for the nfl hackathon um and if they hack but for nfd data if you're pulling enough data from the any nft data api then erc1155e supported indeed alrighty so it seems i got all the questions covered and uh again nfd board dot x y is it um you will if you dm us or just write to uh discord we will also increase limits for you and with that i'd like to wrap it up and hope you'll have a fun and uh successful nfp hack bye thank you so much johannes for the awesome workshop i'm super interesting and i'm sure everyone learned a lot from [Music] this workshop and just to reiterate what johannes said when he first introduced himself he was a hacker at last year's nft hack and created this product and now he's back in supporting this year's nft hack and it's super amazing to have him here and helping to support all of you we do have a workshop right after this and some more today and we also have our kickoff event at 12 p.m so eastern time so please be sure to tune into that and i hope you all have a great rest of your day
