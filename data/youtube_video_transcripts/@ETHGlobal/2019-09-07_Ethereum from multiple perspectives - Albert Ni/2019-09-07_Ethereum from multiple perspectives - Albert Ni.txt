cool alright um one second awesome thanks everyone for coming so you know we're in a college town decided to do a bit of a tribute to my college experience and we gonna do a bit of like a fire hose survey we're gonna go really really fast through a bunch of different ways to look at it today I'm not gonna be able to spend as much time as I'd like to on most of these topics but hopefully give you some interesting food for thought and would love to talk more about each of these things later so first one quick not super important but just brief intro of myself studied math and CS pretty close to here at MIT back in the day I live in San Francisco I have fun experience real early at a company called Dropbox learned a lot there did some other stuff afterward and been helping eutherian foundation for the past couple of years so like I said with today's talk we're going to go through a bunch of different perspectives but before even diving into the specific perspective like why is this important I think one of the reasons it's important is when you have a complex topic it's valuable to take different perspectives to try to better understand it and if you think it's like oh no it's not gonna be that hard to understand this well I decided to dig up some fun quotes from you know about 27 years ago first we have ironically the inventor of Ethernet has nothing to do with aetherium but it did have a lot to do with the Internet so it's kind of an interesting to see a quote from the inventor of Ethernet about the Internet here's something about yeah you know retraining 250 million people who's ever gonna do that for the Internet this was a bit longer but it's basically like my local mall is doing more business than like the entire internet like blah blah blah and I almost felt bad including this he's gotten a lot of crap for this but you know Paul Krugman's infamous quote I don't want to be clear I'm not trying to compare blockchain or aetherium to the Internet like that alone would be the exact opposite of I think what like we should be doing actually what I'm trying to get at is you know a lot of you probably heard of the parable of the blind man and the elephant right the idea is like you know these different blind men touch different parts of an elephant they all get they all have incomplete and incorrect views on what they're touching and and if you think about like trying to predict the future or see where things are going it's kind of analogous to this so that's why I decided to try to take this like multi-perspective angle and the first one is just history as saying often goes history doesn't repeat but it does rhyme and started with a quote from just a couple of weeks or that maybe it's like two months ago now from Balaji on Twitter but yeah I think looking at the past is often just as fascinating it's trying to think about what the future can be and so one thing I thought about recently was imagine being there for typing on a keyboard and like seeing like letters appear on the screen like for the first time like obviously this is natural to us today but imagine being there for like that first moment well when I thought about I was like actually probably a lot of people didn't care a lot of people were like yeah we can already do this with a typewriter you know what's the big deal if you think through like even just moving data around right like many people in this room are probably too young to have used many if any of the the first few things here but there's been quite an evolution through the years for the way people move things around I remember you know my family was not well off the one thing that we would invest very heavily in was technology and my parents talked about how when I was 2 they spent six hundred dollars to buy a 20 megabyte hard drive for the first computer that I had as a kid I was really fortunate that they cared enough to do that but you just think about that for them I mean still better than just doing stuff on a theory right now it's a lot of money or not very much so another thing I think it's interesting when you look to take a historical perspective is you have this like imitation thing that goes on and as they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and it gets even more interesting when the imitation doesn't make any sense so one of my favorite throwback examples is how javascript was originally named mocha and it was renamed to JavaScript because Java totally separate language works very differently was extremely popular at the time they're like all right yeah we're just gonna name it javascript now it's the most used programming language in the world this is kind of like an interesting parallel here you have solidity which is many of you may know it's used to write it's one of the ways you can write contracts on aetherium it's use the interface with the etherium virtual machine syntax was like motivated a lot by JavaScript because of JavaScript popularity even though I think coding and solidity is probably better thought of as like writing you know bash scripts it you probably don't want to take a front-end developer kind of mindset when building snow fund aetherium not that that stops a lot of people but hey that's that's where we're at I'm just like it's a fun fact even like the creator of JavaScript where it's on the brave browser it's actually a great browser if you haven't tried it you don't need a blockchain to be using the browser but it was funded by a token issued on a theory and it's like I said history doesn't repeat but it rhymes all those lines there's this like performance optimization ryan throughout history I'm just gonna go a little bit more quickly here but in 2005 but when I started MIT I remember there was this kind of like contrarian narrative that performance optimization was going to matter anymore kind of made sense at the time like computers just kept getting faster and faster and it's like yeah you could performance optimize but you could also make things more readable or more accessible in other ways are you even gonna need to like optimize things that much in another 10 years of course then the smartphone revolution came along and all of a sudden everyone had this like slow computer with even slower internet and performance optimization started to matter again and now we've got you know blockchain computing just like basically going all the way back to the beginning it's pretty much punch card computing or mainframe computing so now the second respect I'm gonna take is as an engineer's perspective right and one thing that I've found really fascinating over the last 15 years is how much software engineering has changed I remember talking somebody about building seven aetherium a really bright kid a wonderful person but it was like how could you possibly write code and then like you know put it on this blockchain and you're not gonna be able to change it afterwards it just seemed impossible and I was like oh yeah I guess you probably never used the cd-rom right like how do you think when people issued software on CD ROMs like how are they going to update it back back then and it's because like the software engineering companies today have become much more safe environments which is great it's made software engineering a lot more accessible on the other hand blockchain engineering it's kind of like going from the city to the jungle it's an unsafe coding environment and one of the reasons for this is because computing on blockchain is you sort of imposing some laws of physical reality on to the virtual world it's like why you can have scarcity for instance and so I I often note that I'm not sure thinking about writing software on aetherium is like should be thought of as software engineering it's kind of more like building hardware than software and along those lines you know I am confident I'm optimistic about the future of blockchain based systems because you know we can build cars we can build bridges skyscrapers space shuttles and I think we can build systems are complex yet reliable on blockchain as well but we're gonna have to you know use very different best practices than the ones that we're using today the third perspective is the research perspective so block chains are often considered inefficient but they're actually very efficient at what they fundamentally do they allow like a lot of distinct just like nodes or entities to come to probabilistic consensus about something you don't need to know everyone else in the network you don't need to be connected to everyone you know when I was taking distributed algorithms at MIT you're like working with 50 nodes and you were assuming they're all in the same network and all this other stuff and now you can have you know 10,000 and more nodes coming to consensus with with very high probability using like a lot of the principles that power block chains it's just that when you try to then do more stuff on top of this there's these other factors that make them a lot less efficient and what another thing that I think is interesting is from a research perspective well cryptography as many of you know it uses computational hardness as its fundamental building block like the fact that it's hard to do certain things is actually good because that's what allows us to have cryptography and building on top of it and crypto economics which is like kind of what block chains bring into the equation they bring in this like economic component which essentially gives you more like knobs and dials to work with it uses this like economic or incentive based or game theoretical hardness as like its fundamental building block in addition to using cryptography and and other things like that and so just overall I found it fascinating that in an aetherium of watching context I've run into some of the things that I'd really never thought I'd see again after college after I decided I wasn't gonna you know I don't know be like a math PhD or whatever quick examples would be like fair enough little theorem or just like any abstract algebra never thought I'd see any of that again zero knowledge proves I would bring them up his party at parties I thought it made me sound cool but actually probably the that effect is like hey you know you can like there's a single zero knowledge proof and if I like you know put this like ball behind my back and do 270 were like what are you talking about and then even just a professor Ron Rivest who I saw last May at this vdf Day event that I can talk more about if you grab me later on so it's been cool that you know blotchy and aetherium has brought some of these things back into my life and overall aetherium and other blockchain systems have just done a lot to stimulate cryptography and zero knowledge proof research and development as well as just a distributed systems and and consensus and and stuff like that and so moving along we've got the computing stack perspective right when I think about the most interesting technical environments I've been in the seminole like experience for me was when I was 12 I built a computer well I mean I didn't really build it I just bought a bunch of parts there's an excuse as a school project get my parents to pay for you know all this stuff but I bought a bunch of parts and plug them together you know you have to like make sure everything fit you're like a tower and all that and it always left me with this memory like yeah computers a thing you can take apart a computer is a thing that has pieces and each of those pieces themselves can then be taken apart and then always stuck with me you know even when I worked at Dropbox what I thought was interesting was I never really had to go that deep into the stack and Dropbox is already a fairly complex like software engineering system by modern standards like there's a desktop app which very few products have nowadays it had extremely high correctness requirements and even then we were really barely moving outside of this like fairly narrow slice of the computing stack now when I look at blockchain based computing it's really cool to see this opportunity and need to reinvent the entire computing stack I mean it's one thing to be like I'm gonna write a programming language and like no one's gonna use your new programming language nowadays unless it comes with a new context in which it might be like especially useful and so just like smartphones were a new context and a lot of new programming languages and paradigms emerge out of that you might see something like that in in blockchain and similarly the entire developer experience and I mentioned cars and bridges and skyscrapers and I like to tell people I would not want to drive across a bridge that was built in JavaScript and so like we're probably gonna have to do a lot more work on that front as well and overall I just think is the first time in literally decades that so many parts of the computing stack are simultaneously accessible at to be worked on in a practical context and I've like thought a lot about hey what would like to be part of the early days of the internet or operating systems or even just computer computers themselves and I feel really fortunate because in some ways it's like being present for all of those at the same time just in this new context so moving in a different direction for a moment this like legal or game theoretical perspective one thing that the like blockchain and work just being in a blockchain environment has really helped me understand better is so like what is the purpose for instance of the legal system I used to think like oh you know the legal system exists to enforce laws but but now I realize it's actually exists in part to create society-wide confidence that laws will be enforced and we're having a society-wide confidence shifts the equilibrium of how people behave at scale this is what's interesting when you have a big group of people that think differently about something it then has these other macro effects on how they're likely to act and so one things I think is still underrated about blockchains is I'm not sure it's it's totally possible yep removing direction where you can have these anonymous credible commitments for meaningful things that would have been an oxymoron even ten years ago you would have achieved it by using some sort of mutually trusted third-party but overall we're seeing this like new primitive and when you have new primitives that creates new equilibria for new behavior what kind of behavior like you know it's still really really early but it's an exciting prospect a lot of you probably wherever the prisoner's dilemma you don't know what it is I don't have time for to go into it here but I definitely recommend googling and just reading about it it's one of the most fascinating things and one thing that I always try to remind people is the prisoner's dilemma actually is solvable it's just not directly solvable in particular you either have to change the payout matrix which involves some sort of communication or maybe even deeper commitment or you have to turn the prisoner's dilemma into an iterated game in which case it becomes a lot more favorable even if the one-shot game is unfavorable and so again by having this like new type of language that can be built around Garen tee's instead of promises I don't know if this is actually gonna come through but but I've heard people talk about this don't be evil versus can't be evil thing and hopefully we'll be able to see innovations that that can lead to that so the last major perspective is that of talent this is a pretty bold statement but I really think the amount of technical talent blockchain is going to go up a lot and the reason for this is because of a few concepts first top technical talent always wants to work with other top technical talent I mean this one I think is a pretty easy one to understand but another thing to keep in mind is that top technical talent rarely looks for new opportunities they're happy where they are they usually like you know working on interesting stuff and well appreciated where they are and things like that and so if you really want understand what might be coming along you don't want to ask people what they're doing or look at what they're doing you want to say like if you were looking for a change which I know you're not like what would you consider and so counter-intuitively top talent is actually a lagging indicator not a leading indicator that's something that's really important to keep in mind and with that when you see one respected peer become interested in a topic that's worth more than a thousand days of like hype and new cycle so you know I think back to when I joined Dropbox back to 2008 it's like pretty motley crue right and people were like well it's a startup thing that's weird you should be going to grad school you were going to finance you could work at Microsoft whatever and not too many years later you know founders like on the cover of Forbes and people like oh they startup thing it's actually kind of interesting and you know by 2016 it's like it's almost weird if you're not interested in startups so came along pretty quickly so since I think the blockchain based computing is just the most interesting environment that not just software engineers but you know economists cryptographers lawyers probably even multi-level marketers have encountered in a long time it's just a gravity well for different types of people and when more of these people come together like who knows what's going to come out of it so it's my closing thoughts like I said who knows what's going to come out of it right it's not that clear that aetherium is only going to be a part of like solutions problems yeah I think it's quite possible it's also going to cause a lot of problems whether it's aetherium or other just like programmable blockchain systems so that's something that we just like Const only had to keep in mind again trying to look into the future this blind men and the elephant thing all over again it's important I think for all of us to stay humble and just continue to think about what it is that we're missing what is it that we're not seeing as we like kind of move into this new frontier so it's my final quick perspective remember what I said about how like a lot of people don't care probably didn't care the first time like it's like so uh there's this computer terminal thing but what you can do with this computer thing like who even cares about that and I think that that's something important also for everyone here to keep in mind which is almost everyone who's interested in aetherium or blockchain stuff today they've crossed essentially this intellectual chasm but the mainstream doesn't care like for the mainstream to actually you know interface with law change we're gonna have to cross a usefulness chasm and so in this sense like blockchain is very different than like Facebook or the internet or whatever where you can be like oh look at the look at the growth numbers well the first 10,000 people on Facebook I know because I was one of them we're doing the basically the same things at the ten millionth person on Facebook was doing they were just like you know looking at each other's photos and posting on each other's walls or whatever and now but the first 10,000 blockchain people essentially had some sort of like acid trip if Tiffany type thing about the world and the ten millionth blockchain user is probably not even gonna know that they're using a blockchain so we're gonna have to cross this usefulness casts on that's why it's awesome to be at a hackathon yeah and hopefully you know as we look at it there iam in 2019 as we keep building and growing together we'll see a very different aetherium five years from now so thank you [Applause]
