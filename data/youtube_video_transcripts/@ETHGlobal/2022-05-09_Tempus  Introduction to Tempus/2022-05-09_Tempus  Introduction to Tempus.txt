for the live stream to get set up right so um i have georgia here with me and he's going to give you an introduction into tempest today and if you have any questions in the chat and we can take them at the end thanks perfect thank you for the intro my name is giorgia and i'm here to give you very short introduction to tempus and what we built so far [Music] so we started with building a fixed income protocol what does fixed income mean it means like if you deposit funds somewhere either a bank or d5 pool or anything similar to that you would get like a fixed amount of money by at the end after some predefined amount of time let's say you want to fix your yield for one year you would deposit to such a pool and after one year expired you would get let's say five or ten percent or something like that so yeah uh where do the d fields come from so obvious ones are landing staking or decentralized exchange lte tokens so one common thing for all of them is that they are variable depending on market conditions so what does it mean uh for dex lp tokens it means if more swaps are there you will receive more uh more yield for landing obviously if more people borrow you get more yield but there are all of them are risky and all of them can go up and down depending on bullish or bearish market so how tempus fixed income works is uh that we actually build secondary market on top of these yields that are already mentioned so [Music] let's say we build a pool that has some properties these properties are like start date is obviously when we deploy the pool and date is the maturity date so between these two dates you can deposit and fix your yield up until maturity date so one important thing is the actual underlying protocol and the pool we have integrated so far yearn compound other uh lido and i think uh as well but we don't use all of them obviously so the another thing that we need to initialize is also imm which i will explain how actually works in our case uh so yeah speaking of that how how one get fixed rate what we i have here is explanation in case of lido so people can deposit eat for steak teeth to tempus pool they get equal amount of capitals and yields so just to make it more uh simple capitals and yields are in financial terms they are zero coupon bonds uh where capital is redeemable one to one to backing token at maturity and yield token is a zero coupon bond redeemable for the actual amount of yield that is accrued on one uh capital so uh basically uh what does it mean how to fix your yield is actually to sell off your yield tokens for capital tokens and at maturity you will have fixed amount of heat or statement in this case our amm is built to directly trade capitals against yields uh which allows us to have more capital efficient market because you don't need to provide liquidity with additional stable coins if we developed two amms that trade capitals with stablecoin and yields with bill coin we decided to trade them directly it's built as a balancer stable pool with some tweaks uh and uh yeah it's uh basically not only the tool to trade the tokens but it actually sets the rates of uh the market so amn dictates what's the fixed rate that you can get currently uh and vice versa so one if one thinks that the the current fixed rate is too low he can buy more yield tokens so sell off his capitals for ill tokens and that would be basically leveraged yield this was in short i plan to submit a few we as a team plan to submit few medium posts we already have some explaining in more detail all of the parts that i just went through really quickly so if you want to inform more about all any of these you can find it there or in our docs uh so for hackathon um i have a few ideas here let's say i will go through one by one and all of these ideas i think we will have some posts explaining how how where to start building these so one of them is new protocol integration what does it mean you can take for example maple finance or any other protocol that we already don't support and implement the tempos pool for that particular protocol it includes some smart contracts methods like calculating current interest rate or current index liquidity index so yeah it's not too complex but most complexity comes to understanding how the underlying protocol works another one would be new blockchain deployment which in itself probably includes the new protocol integration because uh the only option is if there is some fork of the other protocol but we have really we think that there is no not much sense into integrating protocol with less than 15 million tdl so exploring another blockchain finding good protocol and then implementing uh integration for temples is also something that we are looking uh there's also uh you know knowledge is safe f for tempus this is only for front-end uh it's pretty interesting uh and uh quite nice feature there there is like glide how to build you know this set so one can start with that on top of that any unsupported wallet integration currently we support wallet connect and metamask so any other wallet support is very welcome and on the other two things are also quite good to start uh fixed income front-end i have few ideas for this let's say for example you fix your yield by fixing a little bit less and then you are left with some of the capital that you can use upfront so this quite interesting use case or building extremely simple ui for fixed income that is not a part of a greater temple's which includes all the use cases and then finally graph integration to optimize front end currently the uh we we don't use any any caching or anything similar to that so this is quite interesting use case for us so you can find resources on these links i will i think we can share this presentation publicly and you can find more about temples here and uh uh yeah now i'm open to questions i see some of them are already coming uh guide for gnosis say uh yeah i can share it here as a link but yeah you can just find it in know this documentation it's pretty easy which wallets we were thinking of uh it really doesn't matter uh but yeah any wallet that we don't support or is not supported directly through wallet connect any other questions for me right i think you covered everything georgia um there is a few people that are joining um maybe they might have questions someone asked if you could elaborate on the minting so yeah about minting i will get back to that slide uh yeah about minting so let's say you deposit 100 eat at the start date in case of lido here you would get 100 capital tokens and 100 yield tokens you want to fix your yield until maturity date you would swap all hundred yields for some amount of capitals let's say amm suggests that current uh current yield rate is 10 you would for 100 yield tokens you would get 110 capitals which means at maturity you will have 110 eat back however uh only at deployment time you would get get 400 you would get 100 capitals and 100 yields at the middle of the pool we need to count for already accrued yield so we would get a little bit less of both capital and yield talk but they need to stay in equal amounts until maturity total supply of these two tokens is always equal until maturity because you can't withdraw them separately you need to withdraw them in pairs before maturity but yeah temple supports also early withdrawal if you uh if you let's say uh want to withdraw some of your tokens there is a way to swap to end with equal shares and then you can redeem your capital i hope this helps for anything great georgia i think there's no more questions but if anybody has annie later on feel free to reach out over discord and we can go from there thanks a lot we have all of our a lot of our team members that can answer any more deep questions about code or anything so and i will be available as well so please feel free to reach to us thanks bye thanks everybody
