hi everybody welcome to the integrating the xerox api for fun and profit workshop uh we have megan here who's from our sponsor xerox project he's going to be teaching you guys a lot about it um and yeah if you guys have any questions just throw them in the chat she's gonna try to get to them in the q a section but if you don't get to answer your question in this call or if you have other questions later on feel free to message her on discord in the sponsor xerox project channel okay ready megan thank you so much nisa hello everyone um thank you for the introduction but um just also a little bit more about myself i'm an integrations engineer for the xerox api and today i want to talk to you about um integrating the xerox api especially in the context of a project for this hackathon [Music] so to do that i want to just give a little context about what xerox is how that works on sort of a high level and then really dive right into to the xerox api how that works um why you do say it's a little bit about what you need to know about integrating that into a project and then i want to just um talk a little bit about the prices that are available right like this is called for fun and profit so there's also some profit to be made if you choose to to work on integrating the xerox api um and then i will list some resources that could be helpful for just anyone who wants to learn more about xerox maybe you don't want to hack on it this time but you're just intrigued about the project and want to learn more or you are hacking on on this for the hackathon and you you want to have some resources and places to go for your questions and then um as nisha said i would like to just answer any questions that you have right at the end so diving in um about 0x xerox was founded in 2016 by our core ceos will and amir they really wanted to build infrastructure for what they saw as the emerging crypto economy and over the years we have seen this this economy emerge i think it's it's just really exciting um to see the future of finance and just tokenized value um that should be able to flow freely now in a way that just was not possible before so that is really what xerox is all about um when value is tokenized and it can be um you know sent around on on public blockchains um to different places where it needs to be um we can do that hopefully in a in a more efficient transparent and fair way than maybe what has been possible up until now with more traditional systems so through all of this infrastructure that we're creating um we've seen that it just enables the creation of markets that literally could not have existed even a few years before so something really really exciting there um we've seen just an explosion of um integrations uh with the xerox protocol and xerox api across um [Music] four different blockchains now um different networks we're on just in the last year we've added three so not just ethereum now we're on polygon finance smart chain and just recently avalanche that launched last week um we have um kind of two sides to to the ecosystem so you could think of this in in traditional trading trends it's like makers and takers so what is shown here is supply on the left side that is what you could think of as makers so different um exchanges and other liquidity sources that are putting liquidity into our system in order for it to be consumed by by takers um so we have just a lot of different decentralized exchanges there and also some private market makers and different liquidity sources um but then on the on the taker side which could be interesting especially for if you if you're thinking about building an application that would utilize the xerox api maybe you would be more on this side on the right side of what is shown here this will graphic that um [Music] you would be consuming liquidity from from the 0x ecosystem from these makers so we have um of course matcha which is a product of xerox labs this is our um trading platform that makes it easier to access these new markets so it's a really like a user interface for um the xerox api which is built on top of which i'll get to in a bit how that works and um we have some other really interesting projects integrated here we have coinbase wallet metamask supper defy sabre such as some some really big names and defy and in crypto who are consuming from from the 0x liquidity source so that's that's really cool and exciting i think i believe we have some other um integrators who aren't on this graphic so if if other ones are left out i'm sorry we're just growing all the time and um yeah maybe your application can be the next uh the next little logo here that we will add um how does this work let's let's really get to the core of this which is this theorex protocol um xerox the xerox protocol is essentially we like to describe it as an off-chain order relay with on-chain settlement so um basically that consists of two two kinds of components which are some smart contracts and then some off-chain infrastructure that just relays orders that exist so say you want to swap a token you can go and look and see what what our makers that you would see on the left side of the ecosystem graphic what they have provided is in terms of liquidity that's available and these orders are then relayed across the network and you can actually choose one sign one and submit it on the blockchain to actually realize that transaction so it's it's off chain in that sense but then the settlement is on chain of course um for that so i like to think about this this is a very like basic little graphic that is just how i think of it in my head um we have the xerox protocol as as the core here um of what we do at zero x but then on top of that it's an http api for easy access to these orders so that is the xerox api and then on top of that um are just a lot of applications like matcha and some of those other ones that you saw on the taker side consuming the liquidity that are doing this on top of the xerox api so that leads to the question what exactly is the stereo x api right um the xerox api is aggregating liquidity especially dex equity so decentralized exchanges that have liquidity available you can swap your tokens through them and this is all aggregated so instead of just having to go one by one through all of those sources on the supply side of the ecosystem graphic and like okay i want to to swap my eat or i don't know ustc uh what's the price that you can give me actually since these are integrated with xerox you can just clear the api and it will return the best price to you just that simple um why would you want to do this well dexes are usually very fast and permissionless and they're often the best places or the only places to source certain crypto assets so when you are swapping through the xerox api actually the the tokens never leave your wallet until you're actually submitting your order on chain so that's the difference also with the centralized exchanges in case you don't know um what the difference is there why we do this in a decentralized way we don't actually have custody of your funds at any time that stays in your wallet until you actually submit this transaction um yeah so this will hopefully um [Music] return to you the very best price that you could possibly get for the order that you would like to um or the transactions that you'd like to submit and we can do this through smart order routing capabilities that actually the xerox api has that would actually split up your transaction across different x's and all those liquidity sources that i mentioned so you really can get the best price in that sense you can almost think of it like a search engine um like a flight search engine or something like a google like you know how google flights or something like that would show you uh the best possible price for flights that it finds across different sources that are selling tickets for flights that's sort of what the xerox api is doing but um in this case for whatever tokens you want to swap um xerox api has some different endpoints um today i'd just like to talk a bit about the swap endpoint because i think that's the most useful for building your application um that that you might choose to submit to the hackathon but for sure uh check out the documentation we have we have everything there that you need to know about the other capabilities of the api but this swap endpoint is going to return information on different tokens prices and just return to you the easy to consume quotes um that you can actually then sign and submit as a transaction and i'll get to that in a second how you would sign that um so these quotes are are coming from off-chain sources like the xerox protocol like i said that's the core of everything that's what xerox api is sort of built around but we also do have some other unchain sources from um or some sources like sushi swap or uni swap so they're just a lot of different liquidity sources that are being aggregated and then this is returned to you by the xerox api um you might ask yourself why use the xerox api um especially you know there are there are some other dex aggregators out there and what makes the xerox api so special other than the fact that i work on the right um okay that joke sorry um we are very it's very important to us to be highly aware of how the xerox api performs and we measure that across different categories so we are always looking at um for example the adjusted price so after fees how much money or funds are then um you know actually going to the trader uh after the the swap is complete right um we can do this by by being really efficient with gas usage among other different techniques so we want to make sure that we we are really returning a very good adjusted price and we also look at reverb rates so um if you've ever tried to send a transaction so when you transaction on chain and you know it's using your gas and then in the end uh the transaction fails it reverts and you can see this when you're when you're trying to investigate what happened with your transaction for example on ether scan or something and say transaction failed revert um yeah that that it's not good it's obviously it's costing you money and then your your order doesn't even go through in the end so we closely look at uh revert rates and transactions and we're always trying to improve there and then of course the classic um just you know api benchmark i guess is checking um how reliable is our api and what's what's the response time that it's giving so um we actually run simulations uh across different um dex aggregators so not just on our api itself but just uh you know on all the different sources of uh or possibilities for for dex aggregation that exists on the market and we we are checking to see how we compare in in simulations but then also running analytics on on data from previous transactions and everything to look and see what actually happens and in this sense measure everything that we can around around these different benchmarks so this is just one small example this is actually coming from one of those simulations that i i just discussed so we ran this and to see um how our revert rate compared to some other um aggregators and for for matcha which is our product uh we we are doing quite well and again we're always trying to improve that so this is just a life uh or not live but this is an example of a live simulation that we did just a few days ago all right so how does this work under the hood what do you need to know to get this up and running in your application the api this xerox api is an http api so how you would query it is by sending a get request you can do this i have a small example using curl so this would be if you just want to send it in your in your terminal from your command line um say you wanted to get a quote from the swap endpoint which is what i said i think is interesting for um people building on top of the api in the hackathon and you want to sell your eth for some usdc and you want to sell this amount be careful here this is not actually like with the amount this is also including decimals you can find you know other specifications for different parameters uh all the required parameters and also optional ones including some advanced functionality so if you want to set a certain parameter for slippage or any of the other advanced functionality that we offer you can find all of that in the api documentation and then just build your query from there so this is how you could do it with with your command line but i actually ran this as as a request using my web browsers and api clients and then what you will have returned from the api so you know you you call it and then it returns a response just very simple functionality there you will get a json object that includes everything that you would need to submit as a transaction on the blockchain but this is still unsigned so that's like the next part of this if you are thinking of the request flow you send your http request your get request to the api it's going to return your unsigned json transaction um then you would need to sign it and finally this signed request is submitted on chain so what that could look like is um you would need to sign first you can do this in a lot of different ways you can do that by either running your own nodes using metamask anything like this and then after this transaction is signed you would need to actually submit it and send it over to the mempool on the blockchain to be included in the next block um you can do this with a service like inferior alchemy also again using your own node whatever you choose to do and then you just have to wait until your transaction is mined and the trade is completed so this is actually some quote that is coming from a guide that we have available that i've also included in the the resources side with interesting links you can do this very easily just by including this is a different request than what i just showed this is not um with if obviously this would be with die instead but you you would perform your request just you know clearing the api wait for its response you do need to set allowances before you would submit on chain um but then after you do this you just have to send a transaction so this is like some very um simple like a very simple code example of something you can do and again that guide is going to be available on the resources section and that's that's it that's all you have to do to integrate the api into your application so um [Music] you just have to again be sure to include the unsigned transaction which is returned to you by the api sign it and then send it off that um what's returned to you by the api will include everything you need the call data and gas and you don't have to worry about that you just have the order there ready to go all right so i hope that was fun um i hope that now you have an idea of how you can integrate this functionality that xerox api offers for getting the best price for whatever token swap that you would like to do into your application but now let's talk about the profit part of of this uh equation right so we are sponsoring the if online hackathon this year and we have a total of 8k and prices available and i just want to um kind of go through this and give some ideas again these are not it's not uh that you have to make this certain application that that is listed here this is just to get kind of your creative juices flowing and if you think of something else that will fit into the category that we offer a price for then please we would love to see it we're really excited to see what everyone is going to build um but we do have some just some suggestions so i just run to that uh really fast we would like to see what people would build on top of the xerox api in d5 and in nfts so we have um [Music] a price of 2k for each of these categories and for something like d5 it could be interesting maybe if you wanted to build i don't know an application for options swapping or a cross chain swapping in the case of nfts if you really feel like a challenge then you can add support for erc 721 in the version 4 of our protocol because it's currently unsupported um and maybe er maybe that's that's crazy but if you would love to tackle that challenge that's an interesting idea or you could make an application for fractionalized nfc swaps for example and we're also very interested to see what people would do with the xerox data api so this presentation didn't really dive into that but this i'll also include this in in the list of resources available we do have a data api and also xerox tracker which is just an easy easy to navigate way to to explore data from from xerox and xerox protocol so that could be something very interesting in building some kind of application that uses historical data for example um you might choose to build a multi-chain analytics portal or real-time trades panel um or you could even build a twitter bot of positive slippage that's returned to the user so there's a lot of possibilities there again those things will be in the resource section and we also have finally a category for anyone who has an idea that doesn't fit into any of these um you know the above categories so to speak that just has an idea that they would still like to build um we have an open track so for example if you felt like building an sdk for for the api that could fit into this open category uh the long awaited list of resources i promised you again we have all our documentation and the guide to swapping tokens which i think is really helpful for for beginners to learn how to to implement this functionality um we also have our blog and we have a discord and we would really love it if you wanted to come and join our community and and [Music] meet us there on discord um will also be available i believe as we said in the beginning on the xerox sponsor channel for the youth online discord um i will be posting some office hours occasionally there throughout the direction of the hackathon that you can sign up for on calendly and you can talk about any questions you have or just ideas with our development team but if you have any questions at any time you can also just follow us on the channel and we'll be happy to help you there in terms of just general developer support we have now switched to ethereum stack exchange so if you tag your question with 0x on ethereum stack exchange we'll we'll be monitoring that and we can also help you there and um lastly just check out mata it's a really nice application really simple to use way um simple to use and a nice way to just yeah swap tokens and finally we do have also write it so thank you so much i believe there's a bit of time for for questions um if anyone has any questions for me i don't see any in the chats but i'd be happy to take them oh i will post the resources in the discord yes alrighty if we don't have any other questions then i'd like to wrap up here thank you so much megan for this really great workshop and thank you to xerox for sponsoring um ethonline this year oh there's a question in the chat that just snuck in megan if you want to answer it said our case of using interest data for web three that we can think of um i'm not sure um do you mean i'm not sure what that means does that mean like building a separate website application um i'm sorry could could we actually take this conversation maybe in the discord so i can understand a bit more of what what you mean by this i'm not on the xerox api so maybe i'm just um yeah not the uh like getting a quote from life it's coding okay yeah we'll take it to discord there thank you very much for the question and we'll help you out there in this court um revert rate is what the number of swap transactions that didn't go through yeah exactly that would be the the number of transactions that just reverted um after they're submitted on chain so maybe they ran out of gas or some other reasons why transactions would revert and actually you can debug those we can also help you if you did have a reverted transaction we can help you get to the bottom of y for example yes that's correct any other questions okay i think i'll pop on over to this car we'll see you there um thank you so much everyone for watching this presentation and for being in involved in our community and we're really excited to see what people are going to build this year thank you yes thank you so much
