thank you good day to everyone this is sherry v and i represent sir beth the uni swap customer support for this uni summit and by the way um uh this i would like to introduce you again my um my team cervet support [Music] i would like to introduce you the services that we gave and continue to provide for uni swap as mentioned cervez is a customer support service that handles ethereum related questions service support was created in august 2020 after its founder mike azul to notice that many ethereum application on discord servers originally mica tried to help out some of the projects themselves by answering questions but this quickly grew to be too time consuming unfortunately some of the applications um or some of the dapps don't have um the volume of questions necessary to hire their own in-house support team but they also can't utilize traditional support outsourcing services because ethereum support is too technical hence the birth of servat support cerbette started supporting uni swap during the launch and airdrop of the unit token in september 16 2020. unicef discord server was flooded by questions regarding the airdrop claim together with other ethereum related transactions that needed resolution sorry about that let me share my screen for a bit perfect thank you so much um so yeah um sorbet support aims to provide customers first touch on commonly asked questions we usually hang out on ethereum's discord server 24 7 to give technical support to answer ethereum related questions that are common we are trained in troubleshooting all of the common ethereum problems like gas price selection pending transactions gas limits token balance checks metamask issues and the likes we all easily learn basic basics of product offerings and the users to the best of our abilities with using clients products as one of the moderators we protect the community from spam misinformation and irrelevant posts we also ban scammers from uni swept discord lastly we gather relevant information for issues that needed higher level escalation being a crypto company through and through we accept payments in the form of cryptocurrencies like east die and usdc other coins are also accepted except for scam coins of course as for unit swap you get paid in the form of uni tokens we are composed of seven chat support representatives or professionals on hr and of course our ceo and founder mike zultu most of us have extensive work experiences in different international bpo companies like accenture atos converges and teleperformance our founder is mike zoltu he is an independent software developer he works with ethereum projects and co-authors the original white paper for augur aside from that he also published a blog post describing an attack on maker dao our team members like being cindy sherry and dorsky dav la and yours truly are working from home while providing customer support for uni swap on shifting work schedules 24 hours a day seven days a week this is cervette's timeline from when we started last year up until the present the major events were highlighted on this presentation these were the uh these events were um during the airdrop of the unit tokens last year until the launching of the uni swap v3 this year we are proud to say that um sirveth has been and will continue to be a part of the unisop's journey and progress by way of providing answers to the unisop community's concerns cervette support have handled most of the questions questions we handled are mainly focused on level one issues so if we encounter challenging questions that needed answers that we can directly resolve referring them to the right people or channels is also part of what we do to help and this way we cover more and more people's questions and not leave them frustrated by not getting any response at all since september 2020 more than six six thousand questions were answered by cervette which was roughly 80 of the total questions we fielded upon looking at the pie chart you can also see that 15.2 percent were answered by uni swap friends helpers contributors and admins and 4.7 were answered by other units of discord servers or users taking action immediately is what we believe to be the best thing to do and we can find the like making efforts to help uni swap users in getting their issues resolved firsthand as much as possible on average there are more than 8 000 active units of users in discord daily we've taken on majority of the user questions currently questions are mostly managed privately in tickets which are visible only to the admins uh servaet support team and other uniswap helpers upon looking at the chart you can see that 2160 or 45.5 percent of the total questions were answered in tickets so 26.9 percent were in troubleshooting channel 24.3 percent in general channel 2.7 percent in liquidity providers channel and less than one percent in other channels there was a lot but we only saved three of our feedbacks that we can showcase on here with you and this uni summit take short time to read through some of these [Music] if you have any thoughts on what areas you can improve on let us know um thank you so much guys for your time and don't hesitate to contact us on service discord if you have any questions regarding our services the floor is open for questions if you have any awesome well thank you so much for that that was an amazing overview of how you work uh maybe just uh we'll kind of wait a minute or so to see if audience questions come in um and uh and relate them here but if not i'll still ask you to just uh hang out on the chat on inktober.tv and see if any questions comes in in a few minutes just answer them directly over text uh maybe one question from my end would be just to understand sort of how you think about tracking uh like how do you think about actually managing um how effective you are and sort of how do you actually measure that across so many different channels that you can get support on so do you have any internal frameworks of understanding how you're doing in terms of managing your incoming requests and then seeing how effective the team is we do have um our manual way in i mean seven of us seven of our team members are manually tracking each questions that we answer we just count them not really literally tracking everything else we just count every questions that we answered so that's how we were able to gather the numbers that we have presented this on here today it's awesome another question from the audience is um how do you handle technical questions that come in whether it's with v3 or something specifically so for example for the hackathon that's going on does that overlap nicely with your goals um for for new issues or so for example for v3 we were able to ask our ceo mike zoltu for for any new information we also ask unistop helpers and other admins we work together with them to be able to provide the right answers for questions
