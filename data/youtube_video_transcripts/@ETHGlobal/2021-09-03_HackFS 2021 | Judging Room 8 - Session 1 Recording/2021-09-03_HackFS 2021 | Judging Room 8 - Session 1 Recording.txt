okay everyone welcome to hackfest 2021 so we're joined with over 650 hackers from across 61 countries and 18 time zones so let's dive into our judging format there will be four minutes for demo and three minutes for questions and we'll have a ten minute break every six to eight teams so this is the judging criteria the judges are looking for technicality originality practicality ui ux dx and the wow factor but remember this is not a competition people are here to learn people are here to explore uh to what's possible they're all not aiming to become businesses and hackers are here to get valuable feedback from our judges speaking of judges here are judges judges would you like to introduce yourselves please sparta yeah hi i'm partha from a pillar i had the technology stream there happy to look at various hackathon submissions today hello i'm nicolas antony uh principal alemskop cryptonative investment firm pretty active since 2017. um player one scalability privacy device nfts and happy to provide any feedback today thank you so much judges for taking your time now let's dive into the demos so our first team is team journals so team journals you'll have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a and we'll just wait for them to welcome to the presentation of journal's investigative journalism platform for real-time news events for hackifest 2021 my name is tom plum a full-time crypto nomad and here is what we'll build first we build an integration with tactile buckets to store images and video news events a metadata service that enables news events and a thumbnail service to optimize content viewability in browsers the product works as follows a user records a video of an incident that they are witnessing in the background we upload to ipfs thumbnails are generated and a metadata extraction is happening news uploads are then mapped in real time by using the metadata such as the gps and time to create a local control center of the application of the news event sorry here's the demo so in the overview there is one event called extinguishing fire in brussels with the other account we will log in because we were also witnessing the event to spare speed up the time we already uploaded the video on ipfs where we see here our news event context we're fetching the content context live from ipfs we extract the metadata here we use tools such as deep learning to create context to learn what the video is about and you will see in the insights we extract the gps data the date created and we create four uh thumbnails uh so that the user has a control over how his information is shared um we also do entity recognition uh on text so for example if we paste here a prefab text we also see that alexander the crow and the verbs are being added we publish the data and automatically we'll see our event is being matched to other to the other existing event and we see on the live map that the locations are there together so that we create a unified overview um how it's made is we use ipfs and filecoin for content storage uh lisk blockchain technology is also used for metadata storage and we use user management so that we can enable police and other official authorities in the future a node.js service extracts our metadata and the python service specializes in ai tooling such as by pytorch video we also use spacey and other kinds of cool ai tooling for the roadmap we will add pdf uploads in september a very exciting partnership in november we'll start for ai tooling optimization to create a really good ai funnel such as object detection phase detection and all kinds of cool things uh user moderation tooling is happening in december and for 2022 um we're using i will deploying a mainnet partnership for journalists and specifically will create a medium-like platform for built-in fact checking thank you for your attention and thanks for your presentation now we'll be moving on to the three minutes of q a judges uh part to please it's fine um you go at that last week okay very very clean uh so congrats on that that's definitely uh very well designed and and makes you want to participate um i would like to ask you about how um uh how open it is is there any curation um how you categorize it how quickly things get funneled and and how how the final layout of the page is built basically is it fully open stuff like that so how how is it built thank you very much i i we can't hear i cannot hear you i'm not sure if the other people can can you guys hear him i couldn't you hear me now yes ah perfect sorry sorry for that one uh thank you for the question um so in the first mvp uh we actually do uh the live upload to ipfs so for example if a video is one minute long uh we uploaded the ipfs from that point on we analyze it so it can take a really long time for us to really get the process going so for the next iteration we're starting to plan um chopped up data streams to move very quickly and let's say for example that a user uploads a video we would approximately have after one minute all the information that is contained in the video so metadata the analysis the context creation and from that point on we use the context such as extinguishing fire was the main subject from a video and from that point on it becomes a topic that is matched between videos so let's say for example extinguishing fire in brussels we find three videos of a fire in brussels at that location at that point in time we match those and and move on and gather information from users and hopefully from part local partners to have official data integrated in those news events cool thank you uh one question i had was are you also pinning these videos on ipfs or filecoin uh for uh easier retrieval or how do you manage i mean what if the ipfs links get lost over a period of time how do you manage to retrieve them yeah thank you for a question um so this hackathon we focused on the ipi vs integration was a first start and we used text style buckets so every account has its own private space and we also use the archive function to have really important events archived so that we maybe lose smaller events that people are not interested in but really focus on big topics that people are interested in so we can archive and uh really store the data for longer periods in time but it was for the hackathon the first iteration so hopefully we can move on and and really create custom implementations for those thank you great job team journals now we'll move on to our next theme which is team watch so thank you team watch like the last team you'll have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a and please feel free to start whenever you're ready hi this is the name of watch developed by me john major so what is watch it's a tool that archives youtube tweets and dms on decentralized web using ipfs and falcon network under your decentralized identity idx so what do we need watch basically centralized platforms like twitter have following problems they can take down your content and sense your content like your tweets and dms anytime plus if they disappear tomorrow you will lose access to all of your data so tools like watch makes the data that you generate online on twitter like tweets and dms stored online forever under your control plus make some censorship and take down resistance plus i also think that such tools are first step in migration from web 2 to web 3 social media platforms so demo time so i've already authenticated myself to idx using my 3m wallet and you can see that it's asking me from my profile so i'll just go and update my profile now it's asking me for a weekly storage token so basically all my tweets are stored in weekly storage using this token so i'll go and get this token and paste it over here and update my profile so you don't need to worry about storing a token like this because it is encrypted and stored under your idx so you can see that i've got 0 to its archived so i'll just go and create a new do it such that it gets archived so i'll just type over hey i am j and tweet it so i'll come over here you can see that my tweets are syncing so that the tweet is being uploaded or uploaded on webt storage and stored in norma idx so what happens is that this particular chrome extension watches for all the tweets that i create and triggers an action over here now you can see that my tweet has been saying that such that it is stored in my idx and the tweet data is stored on web3 storage and i can check it over here so this is the tweet data stored on ipfs network using web3 storage so now what if i want to get my old tweets archived plus what if i what if i want to get my dms archived for this first you need to request uh your information from twitter so you'll get a bunch of files which will contain contain these files direct messages and tweet and then you can upload these files to the web page to archive them so let's just i've already requested my information so let's just archive my own tweets i'll select the tweet file i've got all my tweets and open it now my all my old tweets have been synced that means that they are uploaded to webkey storage and stored under my idx so it will take a while because i've got bunch of tweets and there you go uh just take a while there you go i've got all my old tweets archived now you can see that i've got none of my dms archived so let's just go and archive them i'll select direct messages.json i've got all my dms over here and now they're syncing so it'll take a while i've got bunch of messages and so basically these messages are first encrypted and stored under my ideas and you can see all my dms archived so that's it this is for the demo and this is watch that helps you archive your tweets and your dms on decentralized web thank you thank you for your presentation um a quick question on how you see this evolving in so two main main things so do you do you see it at a standalone or a feature maybe of twitter or you know what what is on your view the best way to get adoption and and what's your plan to to get traction to to go out in the world and get a use where do you think it should be placed in order for people to use it which is extremely useful tool yeah so uh an audible uh yes you are yes okay uh so basically uh so the main inspiration for this particular tool was because this particular tool was uh because of a lot of things that we come across today because of censorship there are essential regulations being passed around the world right so the main adoption that i see over here that i will be launching this store on twitter basically because today is the main one of the main medias where people are censored the most so my first step would be to launch it for twitter users as a chrome extension okay make sense so they can just simply install the chrome extension and the moment they tweet their tweet should be saying and after that i will be looking forward to mobile apps uh twitter version mobile app and then other medias but one thing to note over here is that the idx i was trying to integrate with i was trying to integrate from extension with idx there are some issues uh it still lacks a bit but i've spoken to the team about it and they have like given me a certain methods to actually resolve it so yeah that's how i actually think of it as going ahead makes sense thank you what was the most challenging part of this hack which one did you really enjoy doing so basically uh it's really hard for any chrome extension to read web3 data on the chrome window and there are certain restrictions that google has imposed in terms of reading because of security reasons so getting around that was the hardest part but yeah i enjoyed it otherwise uh other than that yeah i think i i think that was the hardest part otherwise i think the other apis are really well off so i didn't face any issues with them thank you thank you great words team watch uh let's move on to our next file coin payment bridge how do i hi hello you hear me yes we can hello charles yep all right so you'll have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a like the last team and uh you'll see a reminder in the corner in the chat okay [Music] yeah um bridge 250-year pack fx ipfs and the frame coin is the most used to decentralized solution by nfp scientific data and other delays i don't know we still don't have a good way to make a payment from us about trying to use prime coins we have five team members to develop this project sounds listed this is a small architecture first we have a controller who allows users to upload the file to the iphone's network and against cnd make deposit with the target territories provider address and smart contract after that the scanner will scan the investment world in a backup very fundamental work as well as the regulatory storage is online and available until we are using the training to ask the smart contract with this founder to the user the steps is this is the process of uploading file also give a custom name and the upload storage file then we make a image and then upload it we're getting there make a payment you can see is the address will be proposing to the smart contract this is a polygon network you can see we have transaction rate with 0.05 after that if you go to the detail you can show the content this is the scanner which can show you how you can deposit this transaction fashion and the information is unchecked then we know that this article has made we send the deal to the micro network you can see here is a pedo cd with a smart controller desk signs a signature and there's an article will give us a proof of allah then we'll make a capacitor for our found here that is the unlocked transaction id we still go to the polygon network and the check is the perceptions you see that there are two transactions made from the contract with the songs one is one transaction is for senders to the storage which is where another one is dragon return to the client iteration the load testing for more work psc and eth blockchain installation will be part of the future so this is about work and thanks to everybody if you have any interest please contact us at team transluct.com yep that's pretty much about demo okay charles i'll uh i'll can please sure you were saying something yeah i was just going to say thank you for your presentation let's move on to the three minutes of q a okay yeah a quick one uh choice like um can you expand a little bit on the uh low hanging fruit use cases that you believe um they will gain initial traction for a product like that like what are they like two three use cases that you uh build this for yeah for example on the polygon or also an ftp storage currently like they use web already have some cool products like webster uh storage or something like promised people using the for free but actually in long term people still need to pay for the usage of the fire coin storage so when they need to pay that they probably will use the ethereum or matic or adi as any other cryptocurrency for make payment then they need to know that after payment that story is truly stored on fractal network so we need the article to present them this is the proof you pay for that with other currencies okay thank you i mean i basically just had a suggestion uh you could probably take a look at a library called esport which lets you interact with multiple chains and provide you with a payment interface as well so right now you are trying to do it through the console if you were to use a library like that you could listen to events of of transaction completion and you could automatically switch across networks that might probably help you to build this product further great we'll do that later yeah thank you thank you great work uh so we'll move on to our next team which is team art mythology we'll wait until they get promoted to begin yes you have four minutes for uh presentations and three minutes for q a you can begin whenever you're ready think we already just checked the microphone everyone yes hello my name is ignacio and we are arthology so we can all agree that nft are now a password but not everyone has access to it like you have to be very tech savvy to be in connection with the nft then the art galleries and the museums are struggling they are late adopter of technology and due to pandemic they had a recession of 22 last year the we've been talking we did a lot of market validation and we spoke with art galleries museums and they all agree that there's an opportunity with nft but they don't know how to do it they don't have the expertise to work they don't know how they they don't have the know-how of working with nft so what we are planning to do is we want to build a solution to support the intersection between the traditional artwork and the nfts so what we are going to do is we are going to connect nft artists with art galleries correctors and our collectors how we are going to do it we are going to support the full cycle from minting to showcasing to the selling and purchasing so we are going to give tools to art galleries to source nfc artists create their own marketplaces and even go even further and create their own virtual reality exhibitions so now we are going to show you a demo of our platform and i would also like you to welcome from my side and showcase how the solution is working so here is a developed platform where all artists and galleries join to explore the nft so i will log in right now as an artist and first of all i have a full control of all the art i am exposing in this uh website at the same time having the full control of the minting and exhibiting it for example i can simply add a new artwork and provide all the details which are relevant for maintaining as well as pricing solution or what i can do instead i can also once uploaded also have the minting process fully integrated into the platform whenever i click on one of the arts which i uploaded i can do the minting connect it to my wallet on the metamask you see all the guest views being confirmed and then i can explore the file which was just minted and see that it's actually happening on there once it takes a little bit of time to to get the contract but yeah so here we have all the information we see that the transaction is actually successful i also can see then the uh poster being loaded and added to my nft profile on my uh on my phone and what it gives me as an opportunity then i can promote my art which is just freshly minted to all the galleries which also available on our platform it gives us an opportunity to uh provide the galleries opportunity to promote themselves promote the art and exhibit the nft art which they previously don't have access to all the art is being stored on ipfs through nft storage and you can showcase it even here on under your user or gallery profiles what we give more you can exhibit also it not only just on the as any regular solution right now allows you to but also in 3d space and that's the most exciting part when you click on 3d i will showcase it in additional tab you can actually create your own gallery with the art being exhibited and showcased as you prefer which is uh providing you full scale solution where you can not only design the art but you also can design the gallery and bring it the art to the actual people to the actual lovers of the art to enjoy and potentially explore and buy the art you can do the same thing not only in browser but also in vr glasses and basically that's how we bridge the nft world to the world of market and to the traditional art we also provide the opportunity to mint the art gallery or provide different art galleries showcasing different solutions which explores the opportunity for art galleries to be showcased in the nft as much as possible thank you we are arthology uh good one uh congrats it seems very clean and neat um a couple of things and just to understand the direction what is your audience and as a good to market strategies are you building a a you know creation more than a marketplace so what's the direction you want to take and and on galleries um are you planning to have a sort of like uh broadcasting tool as well so that you you you want to provide um you know some renting economics that we see in quite a few projects lately uh exactly on the vertical you're working so a little bit of audience and go to market and uh and and how you want to build that marketplace thank you very much uh will you yeah so i think like we are not we don't we're not planning to be a marketplace we don't want to be an emergency we are more like a b2b company we want to support our galleries mainly because they will do the heavy lifting of of selling the nft they have their our collector they have their customers so we want to provide tools for them to explore the nft so what we imagine in the future is we go we are talking currently so this is something that we are still polishing um but we would like to offer for example the possibility uh of an art gallery to have their own nft marketplace embedded in their websites not not in our website so in their website then we want to provide them with tools to recreate the gallery in the virtual reality environment and we want to support the full cycle from the meeting to the selling because we know that our collectors are not tech savvy so they don't have a wallet they have money but they don't have a wallet so what we want to do is create a bridge between the traditional artwork and the nft so how we imagine this is like we allowed our galleries to screen to source nftrt so we they can establish communication and then can define how they are going to work together and they do everything in our platform so our audience will be nft digital artists art galleries slash curators and indirectly they are collectors that they are they are the ones who buys the the the nft but we want to boost the the nft selling yeah thank you very much thank you i have two questions basically i'm interested to know what was your tech stack which you use to i mean create your art gallery at the vr thing as an nft and the second one is have you how do you plan to tackle the very high gas costs on ethereum mainnet given that you're using robston have you considered other side chains for deployment of these nfps maybe for the vr part i would be happy to answer uh first of all we are using 3gs uh to visualize and explore the potential of vr so everything is handled by the 3.js stack and maybe diogo you would be happy to explore as what other tech solutions we were exploring and of course we were considering the high gas fees so we were also looking at different coin systems in order to uh reduce the costs and support all art galleries not to be dependent on the prices of a particular coin yeah just one small comment like gas fees while they are high like an average ticket in the traditional art world is ten thousand dollars between ten and fifty thousand dollars so like the high gas fee is like irrelevant for an art collector who pays twenty thousand dollars so no i'm i'm not referring to the actual purchase of the art uh of the nft i'm referring to minting of the nfp that's where it's very expensive okay okay okay with the minting we're planning two solutions of either uh lazy minting where the final art collector is actually paying also for the gas fee or this would be carried by the by the mar by the galleries who are interested in exhibiting the arts so this is uh where we also want to implement uh the bay in baked royalties for the art collection and yes gallery support to mean something but then they get the royalties if it's being resolved for their own okay thank you guys for your presentation great job uh judges uh we're going to be moving on to our next team which is team meme verse and this is our fifth team so would you guys like to take a break after they present or would you like to continue i'm fine either way okay samia so team meme verse uh you guys can start whenever you're ready hey uh can you see my screen number not yep yes it's it's showing meme website on the screen yeah okay correct yeah this is a platform for quality memes and connections between creators and fans creators this platform provides a way to mend their names as nfd and it gives them a proof of ownership of proof of first they also give them a chance to connect to the fans and in case their needs go viral over social media anyone can attribute that name to that period giving them publicity and visibility for beam lovers they come search and buy the means through this lethality goes to the creator and once they purchase their nfts it gives them access to the exclusive content for example creators can live stream them through live peer and only the buyers bought their names will have access to it they just have to choose an image enter a name description some hashtags this is just to easily identify the meme the image is uploaded to ipfs through nfp dot storage and then a erc 7281 ftp implemented frequencies and anyone can browse the entities now i want to showcase how do i get exclusive access to the creator so this is the community page notice that i have changed your address so that i can get access to this trader i copy this address enter here and click enter login since i have not bought any of their nfds it doesn't let me enter it so first i need to buy any of the entities so let me search for some mean that i want to buy here it's just for any of the keywords and showcases all the relevant results and buy it and the value of the transaction is 0.001 which was the price of the name and here since i bought this meme now i am the owner of this entry i did not look by this since i cannot buy my own this search functionality is backed by elasticsearch where i store all the documents that have been invented and they made it restored unless it's also posted locally right now since i've bought the nft now i'll be able to enter this lobby i enter the creator's address the creator has not started a live stream that's why it's inactive i'll go to obs to start a live stream and start streaming and to like here it should appear here and here it is yeah so uh that was uh the project uh basically a platform for anyone to come and meet their memes and anyone to buy them uh which also gets them access to the content creators live stream great job let's move on to our three minutes of q a judges uh well i see i see it being something you know fun for for for creators fun for communities uh so since we actually invested quite a bit on on on the creator economies and and and the social um the social tokens uh so to speak so if you consider partner partnering with uh some tooling for for for for social tokens or for gated communities and what what what is your plan to uh easy your way in for to to many communities right and and get traction on on communities i think uh i've not thought about tokenizing uh uh like on the aspect of tokenization but uh for expanding to market and bringing traffic to this website uh i've thought about first of all uh making this like a jiffy like website where like through jiffy you can post your gifs on social media right uh so i think if we can provide an api if if let's say a lot of memes are quality means are there we can provide a uh provide an api for social websites where even anyone can pull these memes and use the use these means on their posts for free because a value of memes only comes when it's it goes viral right um and then based on which creators go popular through these memes uh we can then probably promote them on the page and create a community for them specifically and then uh i think tokenization might come after that when a creator a specific reader goes popular uh through the platform um so if let's say their community becomes more valuable and people want to participate in the community probably then i think tokenization might come into picture uh i mean that's my thought um but i i didn't really consider propanation till now yeah yeah you know i mean i mean more um this is a tool that in my view or the way i see it uh as a first time is something that would be nice to be placed in in a place where in a platform where community gathers right there could be many communities many different so you want to be right there where community gathers for a variety of reasons and and you're there available so that everybody can create your meme and adopt it as a meme of the community for example right so that was the there was that yeah anyway good job thank you and for uh for the community aspect like for this hackathon i demonstrated live stream but i think uh this aspect can expand a bit more like we can have a patreon like platform which is backed by nfc where each subscript each tier of subscription is an nft and people who have spent a certain amount will get different levels of access to the creator so let's have spent ten thousand dollars i'll get the highest level of access then uh if i've spent only thousand dollars i'll probably get only a live stream so yeah this can a different level of access perfect have you thought of fractionalizing um means means as you said would need to go viral so i mean if you were have you considered fractionalizing them and then creating a marketplace for them yeah i think uh so uh this might be this might come as a second version uh where i think the first version uh i would like to as i said i would like to have any just an api for social media websites where anyone can pull in these memes that's where the search functionality can come in any data demo data demo where like windows can just enter some keywords and that that's make the meme searchable and then uh then after that in the second stage uh we can consider uh tokenizing those nfts and anyone that pulls in that nfp in the social media post can become a fractional owner by paying a small macro transaction uh or if i'm if a meme becomes costly like let's say it's selling four thousand dollars then probably uh tokenizing them uh so those sort do you have any more questions no that's it okay great work team meme first uh so we're gonna begin our 10-minute break so we will come back out in 10 minutes 1 35 eastern standard time okay thank you cheers thank you very much bye hello everyone i just wanted to let you know that our break has ended we'll wait for the judges to return and then we'll begin with team fragment what up welcome back to this um team fragment are you here um you guys can start whenever you're ready you'll have four minutes of presentations and uh three minutes for q a and feel free to start yeah sure thank you i'll share my screen now okay so to the right can you see it yep hi everyone my name is thomas from the fragment team and i'm here today to do the demo of the data pipeline platform that we filled during the hackie fest hackathon so we first impersonate a user which we call alice by creating a new dataset on the platform because we want that data set to have a transparent history that is publicly published on ipfs so once that data set is imported i will also be able to import a new transformation to manipulate a dataset it has to be noted that each transformation that can be used on our platform are actually fluence module so what does that mean it means that all transformation that will be executed will be executed on the fluence testnet so on the dataset details i'll be able also to check that it has been properly uploaded to ipfs i will now run the transformation i uploaded and you see once the transformation is run i added a new element to the history here and that the data set has been updated now that alice has done that you might want to share that with the collaborator let's call involve sub arrives on the details page and now he'll think maybe i want to check that the transformation is real so for that we have planned the ipld schema i pld schema will allow bob to go on ipld explorer and just check that the input data the transformation data and the output data are all the ones that are claimed by alice let's see here for the output data check on ipfs giveaway and you can see that here it's the proper data you'll be also able to run a transformation just to you know collaborate with alice which is normal i will now pass the button to philly to explain more in why we've done that so after this brief presentation let's dive in and see why fragment may be important first we initially wondered why decentralized networks weren't that much used in collaboration for data science we think that technologies like lin data i still under used in needed schema-less context then we have to announce that platforms like google already are quite powerful they're they're closed in centralized systems but finally we thought that maybe the whole system is missing a formal definition of data processing pipelines and so that's what we focused on so we tried to consider that a transformation pipelines in their simplest form and that is putting road at a at the base of the architecture and stacking up atomic transformations after atomic transformations and that's a representation that works pretty well with ipld the two main components of our architecture are pfs enterprise network data sets and transformation by codes are stored on ipfs obviously the network can identify these elements with their cid it can run transformations on top of data sets and push the result back to ipfs linking it with ipld to previous states of the dataset that's mainly it for what we can consider the backing and on top of it we try to build some more collaborative features that leverage ceramics and idx in the end we think that this new framework can be quite important for a few reasons it's free from any cloud platform it allows data science traceability free from closed platforms it may really represent a plausible solution to problems of inconsistency in open data here are some useful links and we really want to thank all organizers sponsors and hackers and let's keep building thanks thank you i'll start quick one so it's my understanding correct that you like you guys would like to have it fully open um so that those data set can be freely available for scientists and collaborators to interact or you have the problem to basically have a sample of them so that you can see how good is the data set compared to what you [Music] claim it is just to understand as a use case um which audience are you trying to track so the goal with what we we've tried to build is to effectively share a data set between researchers data scientists or people like that and also share and be more transparent on what has been put as transformations on top of that data set we figured out that as of now we have a trouble in data science that when we use data for uh in the pipeline either to extract transform and load or extract load and then transform to use the data we don't have enough transparency and that's what we tried to crack with the with its application okay fair enough thank you which was the most challenging part of the hack and which one did you find more interesting so from our point of view i think that the hardest part of the hack was to integrate fluence inside of the front end and then upload dynamically new services and give them data sets to run because we've never used fluorines before and there is quite a few technical points that are quite advanced i would say as new languages for example the air languages or other new notions about integration of the sdk so that's what i think we spend the most time on during this hack thank you judges is that i mean yep to add a bit more sorry i would i just would like to add the last question that a bit of time also was taken on the transformation atomic transformation design that we presented that is published on ipld just to make sure that it was working and actually efficient for what we were doing since we have a few seconds left i mean it's very noble obviously i when i see those um you know early stage ideas and visions i always try to try to see how hard it will be to reach your audience right reach the people that are actually interested about this and how you really it's a very um network depending network effects depending platforms in my opinion right it all makes sense if a lot of data scientists and a lot of people put the fragments together right so fragment really makes a lot of sense but you need a lot of fragments to to build a bigger picture so i i really go to market in a sense like attract your audience and find it and make them make sure that they know you exist it's the hardest challenge one of the other strategic work on early but congrats thank you very much thank you for your judging and your time if i have time to to answer that it is very true and the fact that we integrate nicely with some technologies like the the wasn't the web assembly runtime that friends uses may help us in fact integrate existing libraries written in either typescript javascript or python and that could run into the this wasn't run time so we're quite with this kind of technologies uh this network effect could work based on uh the integration of existing libraries so yeah there's a challenge in reaching the the audience but still there's no technological uh gap that would not be able to be filled thankfully thank you thank you and good luck thank you very much all right great let's move on to our next team which is fence and meijing sorry if i pronounced that wrong but uh please feel free to start whenever you're ready good afternoon our team created decentralized maging let's put that into two parts and let's start with the imaging a jong is a towel-based game originating in china and often played in east asia the basic rules are to draw a tile into your hand and discard a tile every turn if a discarded tile matches your tiles in a certain pattern as shown here the player can call chao pong or kong respectively to expose their tiles at the end after some winning preconditions a combination of certain sequences of tiles in their hand and exposed tiles adds up to a certain amount of points we built mahjong but all player-to-player communication is p2p the only dedicated servers we're using are to establish webrtc connections between players so let's go on to a demo first we log into the application we use three id connect and idx for identity management authentication our three id did corresponds to our ethereum metamask was that sign message to derive an encryption key for 3id connect if a user doesn't have an associate's basic profile on idx they can fill it out through our ui in my case i already have a profile created so we can start the game in order to do that we create a table uh and that will produce a join key that we can use to join the table so i'll wait for everyone to join so now a third player has joined and now the fourth player should have joined so now what's happening is we're waiting for the p2p connections to be established all meta data about how to connect to each players during thread db a secure decentralized p2p database made by textile after all players are connected the game's finance date machine starts on each player's own browsers all game state transitions and states for each player are stored in web3 storage in ipfs you can show that by going to logs and clicking here and this should correspond to an ipfs log as shown here so here's a summary of what we went through in the demo note that we weren't able to complete betting on our own maging game in time but it's on our future roadmap to complete in the future we would like to improve the feedback on the ui and make it responsive to different screen sizes on the topic of cheating we would like to detect bots using machine learning in order to prevent hacking we will use a special shuffling algorithm so that every player can ensure tiles are shuttled properly at the start of the game shimmy's secret sharing will be used to encrypt each card in the deck so that all players must agree that any given player can see any given card we also need to handle certain edge cases like players losing connection for betting after you implement it we are thinking of using layer 2 scaling to reduce gas fees and eventually support more than just ethereum for betting thank you you can find the live demo at the link below great job let's move on to our q a with the judges you have three minutes oh well thank you it's pretty straightforward so not a uh you know question as such i have a curiosity so we have seen some you know decentralized games and and casinos um on the meta verses uh are you thinking to integrate uh maybe would be fun to have it inside a metaverse or uh in partnership with another platform instead it be um something fully standalone right that it would be harder to attract users and gain traction have you thought about be somewhere or partner with somebody and how easy it would be to integrate yeah i haven't actually thought that uh the whole process of integrating with other metaverses but i've definitely thought that it would be a good idea to integrate with one uh in addition uh we might put i guess have your investment into um community building later on uh uh first you want to build the platform so that it's uh ready for the general public right now it's kind of okay so that uh kind of friends can use it because uh cheating is definitely uh something that can happen in the current implementation honestly thank you um sorry if you'd already mentioned this but i couldn't catch what your tech stack was uh can you please elaborate on that yeah sure so we were using um uh idx and three id connect for uh identity management and authentication we use threaddb on textile to establish a signaling metadata when trying to establish connections between peers and we used web3 storage to store all our game logs okay okay great job any more questions judges look good i mean i i i usually based in hong kong uh so i i see so many people playing the game and they love it so it's a big market obviously um it's a little bit on the older generations you see a lot of gray hair playing the game uh but it's very very popular so there's definitely a market thank you so much let's move on to our next team p2p game we'll wait until they get promoted and they'll have four minutes to present and three minutes for q a like the last team and they can start whenever they're ready [Music] [Music] using fleet so on my next regime that online left the browser is here right it's played so [Music] [Music] by default for now year one or where the period that starts again is clear x so let's make the first move if i try to play again here too if you say let's see let's see whenever appear wins or the game strong the game data is uploaded is the game data that contains all steps of the game that took place the data would we always give a same cd for the player and for the player too or we can say the peers and we can say both of these ids are seen and we can see what's in that data it contains basically all the steps from initial [Music] we [Music] great job let's move on to our three minutes of q and a judges okay but well thank you very much quick one um this is the first step i guess what is your bigger vision so this is pretty straightforward simple for the game but what what i i i'm sure you are thinking bigger right there is something bigger that you would like to see or to happen so what is your really hand goal vision and why you built this specific product for what and how do you get there what what needs to happen for you to realize your vision my vision is basically like if there are two players and they want to somehow uh have this like they have a bet for say their bet like they have each nfd and they want to choose a winner uh so like they bet whoever the winners take the nfc so they can uh bet the nft in a smart contract before the game and if there is a winner the contract uh the nft goes to the winner or else if there is some problem in the uh con in the game connection loses or something else then the game is catch and basically the nft's is going back to the provider and the the main idea is basically is there's no central player playing any role and that each pair has their own data that will be storing and so when one player is sending their steps one each at a time it's added to this one uh peer one and pa2 and when at the end of the game the ps data can be uploaded to iphone faces and since both their data is same and it will also added the pr id because each of the starting of the game the new pid will be generated unique pid will be generated so at the end of the game both that data will be uploaded to ipfs and since it will be same and if they matches both the data so then the contact will be initiated and it can say that it can try to eliminate the cheating uh by any of the peers inserting changing the history of the game and then upload that all that into an nfc that the winner or the loser both can have as a reference in the future thank you so which part uh did you find interesting what did you learn out of this app yeah uh left p2p uh deploying the library for the protocol it was very difficult and finding uh documentations and a limited documentation yeah thank you thank you great job judges do you have any more questions uh well good for me good luck and follow the bigger vision obviously right thank you okay let's move on to the next team storage monkey so we'll wait for them to get promoted and we'll begin hey how's it going oh good thank you hello welcome [Music] hello welcome all right let's get the screen share going just one moment okay can you guys see the screen okay yeah perfect yes this is the storage monkey protocol storage monkey allows users to define aliases for addresses and dapps in a secure and decentralized way users interact with many addresses using this alias manager they can add an address then assign it a unique alias similar to a phone's contacts these aliases may contain personal or private information so the aliases must be encrypted before storing them once they're published to ipfs the encrypted aliases can be accessed by their unique cid the storage monkey smart contract stores the cid allowing any dap to fetch the encrypted aliases when the user visits their site so here we'll authorize the encryption and then call the smart contract to map the cid to the address this interaction should update the ui showing that it has been saved and cue the uh wait time it's just a second or two left here and there it is the new alias has been updated and anytime we visit this app or any other dapp that uses the storage monkey sdk we'll be able to access the my best friend alias that's mapped to the address okay um yeah so let's just explain a little bit on the high level what this is so storage monkey was uh something which was built out of frustration with existing dapps so you can use many dapps for example like the superfluid dashboard we have in front of us and as you will see you have sort of addresses which are your contacts which you're in this case sending money to now this sort of application uh superfluous dashboard allows you to assign nicknames to addresses because seeing the long hex decimal strings are pretty ugly and they don't really communicate a lot who you're communicating with so previously you'll be able to set these nicknames however it was only stored in local storage now this is bad because first of all if you clear your browser you lose all of your nicknames and also they do not share across applications for example i set a nickname on my supply dashboard i also want let's say my metamask to update that so this is kind of what storage monkey is storage monkey is a smart contract and an sdk so the sdk is a full dac developer the adaptive editors app developers to integrate their application so they can quickly sort of fetch the data which maps addresses to nicknames uh and yeah we store everything encrypted on chain so there's no concern that you will ever leak any information about your nicknames um and yeah we're quite excited about this for you the first step of just mapping addresses to nicknames it's quite powerful it's like we've seen this in ens but in ens doing this kind of updating updating nicknames costs a lot of storage however with this we have sort of we can you can view these nicknames for free and you can also update them for free through ipns which we'll be using um and yeah in the future you can do a lot of you can basically store any configuration file and create any sort of standard that can be used to process and share and yeah and i think like the the big you know like the the big concept that we're going for here is when somebody uses our sdk let's say you build some you know some new dap and you're going to see these addresses a lot in your ui using this sdk is going to allow you to swap that address for the nickname the person's assigned on the fly exactly and yeah that's kind of it if you have any questions feel free to ask okay sure so um thank you for that i'll start with one what is the um what is the very intuitive um audience and use cases that you see like the people there are actually needing now and that would love to integrate with you because i think that's sort of keys for this sort of product right you don't want to be standalone you need to be um where where the users are and where your audience are so what are a couple of your platforms you should show up like that so this product was actually born out of the superfluid community so the community was asking for this the however the superfood team actually didn't know how to build this they were struggling to encrypt the information and store on ipfs in decentralized way we came up with a way to do this so that's one protocol which is a clear they were asking for this and they i think they're quite excited about this also clear use cases are metamask for example you know you assign your you you know you have many different accounts your metamask you can assign different nicknames however if you move your meta mask into a different browser or you sort of have to refresh the seed phrase somehow you lose all those nicknames and that can be quite annoying for people uh so yeah superfluid metamask uh sort of anything which involves a a ui with addresses and where people wanna have sort of quick access yeah i think it's quite broad yep and and the idea uh behind the sdk is to abstract a lot of this away so if you're a developer and you're building this application it's as simple as when you enter the app you need to trigger a function that fetches and decrypts those aliases for you and then essentially anywhere that you would put an address right maybe you have a little list of addresses then you just have a simple function that says hey if this address is mapped to an alias let's just replace that on the fly so what kind of encryption you do you use to encrypt the data right now so right now it's um yeah so right now it's uh asymmetric encryption we use the public key associated with the wallet in metamask and so basically like to keep it you know as simple as possible without having to make any new extensions or anything like that metamask lets you encrypt data with the public key and then later on you can actually pass that encrypted data back to metamask they decrypt it internally so we don't have to expose those private keys and then the decrypted aliases come back to the web app so you you're encrypting the actual contents of the file that you're storing on ipfs is that what you're saying yes okay right right so we so all those all those aliases it all gets you know stuck down in one string that string gets encrypted and that encrypted string is stored on ipfs and that's that's very important because you don't want people doxing their nicknames so yeah that was very important uh a very i know i don't know if you have a second left but what would be i mean not a business around it but like have you thought about some economics have you thought about some value created uh who might want to pay for this i know it's it's not the first things you you you ask and actually didn't ask today but it's a it's an interesting thing to keep in mind and if just curious if you thought about it yeah i mean it is like pretty lightweight i mean we were able to you know hack this together pretty quick and i mean really like it for the most part it's almost done we have a few little tweaks that we want to you know do before we push at the main net but uh you know really it's it's more just designed to be one of those like kind of you know public good tools like you can have a little contact book that you can access from any any web app um but i mean there's always you know like we could always set some kind of fee uh with you know setting the aliases if we wanted to try to monetize it but honestly i think we're leaning more that route of you know the the open source public good open source good stuff thank you very much yeah thank you so much for your presentation we're gonna be moving on to our last team which is crimson eighth and yeah so please feel free to start whenever you're ready hi we're the crimson off a team we are a marketplace that specializes in creating nfts for artists who want to focus on their craft the crimson ave team is iris shiu and brittany the problems we set up to solve are there are artists who do not have the technical abilities but still want to sell their nfts on a marketplace and there are also artists who don't have the time to learn but want to participate in this space the solutions we came up with is to assist artists in creating their nfts and like a curator and the value we would like to provide is to assist artists in learning more about the blockchain so in the future they can make their own nfts the tech we used is solidity reacts open zeppelin hard hat and ethers the sponsors uh products we use are protocol labs nft storage and polygon and i'm going to hand it over to she all right thanks iris so here is our crimson off a home page and we are going to create it in the t so we're going over here to create nft so now let's call it north i'll set it to 275 matic and we'll description of northern lights and let's upload this image as our nft so now when i hit create nft metamask is asking for gas fee for the polygon mumbai test net and let's see give it a second there we go here it is here's our interaction with contract and then we should see that 17 seconds ago this was the token id that we created if we go to nft storage here we got our sid and then if we come over here and plug it in then we are able to retrieve our metadata we go over to the gallery scroll down and we can see the latest entity that we just generated and this is the end of the live demo portion [Music] so now we have some future features that we're thinking about and plan on doing for the future thank you for your time that was it great job let's move on to our three minutes of q a judges um a couple of questions uh you said you were publishing them as erc721 right uh yes okay and on polygon um sorry uh nikola please if you have any questions yeah mostly what what's like in the developing phase what's next in a sense that um i i felt that you have a vision and a mission so this is uh like a first version for for the act on what would come up of the action but uh do you plan to have a product and ship a product what would be your mvp and your alpha and uh and then a like a basically a [Music] end goal vision i would like to see how it goes forward yeah i guess like for us it's uh right now once we get this fine tune is uh one idea is to actually because i have a friend who produces an art show so to adopt this to kind of like the another project that did that but more focused in the art shows so adopted to artists that travel to art shows and help the art show itself on board artists as well as um at some point i would like to include like the live pier streaming because a lot of these art shows have live music as well and that uh maybe cameras set up where they could kind of see where the artist booths are so they're able to cut to a certain degree interact and maybe use ipfs chat to interact with the artists at the show as well as um if they can't make it you know in person so that's like the next step but just basically also educating artists about the space and trying to get them to on board as an option because you know sometimes they're just too busy creating their art and um or don't have the the know-how of how to participate in the space yes yes well it's very important we have we took to us because we talked to quite a few um that they're bridging this gap in a sense and narrowing this gap of uh you know you should take the burden of of the tech in a sense and and make it very simple for the artist to uh to enter this new world um so yeah i wanted to know what was the final uh vision and considering all the iterations that your products gonna happen okay yeah the product like from what i heard it looked like very versatile in a sense so i didn't know what was the direction you you firstly wanted to pick so that was uh the reason of my request oh thank you what was the most challenging part of the hack i think for us was like certain things like getting through some documentations and getting to work and you know getting uh the nft storage i think at times was taking a bit long loading our images so just to get some confirmation um but yeah just just working through all the you know little issues here and there okay are you just do shipping um are you looking up at a platform uh out there that is actually going in your direction so what's the landscape what are you getting inspired by um and you know something that you would like to be soon but with better functionality and and and some of the uh addition that you are contributing in in crimson affair well i mean i guess in terms of like the marketplace you know there's like open season wearable but it was more of like you know lazyminting where people anybody could do it and this is more wanting to focus on um you know like i said the artists who might not have the tech savvy to do so and just to educate them but um i guess you know just figure out how to adopt it there's like art shows that um artists have an issue complaining because they have to always constantly fill out forms over and over again to participate in these shows and it would be nice if we have like some sort of like you know did where they load up and connect to their wallet where they could enter into any kind of these art shows that's like virtual um and just display their artwork or you know create and sell and so forth okay okay okay thank you so much for the presentation great job so that was our last team so i would just like to thank the judges for taking your time out of your day to do this as well as all the hackers who participated in this hack fun great job everyone everyone did very well and yeah so uh the hackathon is over thank you so much i think on our link we have one more project listed which uh i believe was uh okay i think it's been updated at least on mine it says uh alejandra m salvera yeah yes yes they were supposed to be 11 uh uh i 11 see i do see 11 as well to be honest and oh now i refreshed an sc10 yeah so if if you refresh partha you okay i mean i have two links open now for my link and now i on one it's eleven or another it's ten okay i think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's actually ten i i did the same i i thought uh it was uh it was eleven okay well it's been a pleasure parta it's been a pleasure thank you thank you very much thank you very much for awesome thank you cheers bye-bye thanks everyone bye bye bye
