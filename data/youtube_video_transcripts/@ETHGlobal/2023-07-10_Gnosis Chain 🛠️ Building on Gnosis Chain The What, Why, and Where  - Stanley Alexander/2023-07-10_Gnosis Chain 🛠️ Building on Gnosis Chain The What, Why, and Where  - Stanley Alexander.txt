foreign [Music] I'm Stan Lee I'm from Northeast chain I'm specifically Northeast Builders ecosystem Builder team foreign so we'll be awarding a total of uh 20 000 USD for the use of knowledge chain so we have uh in addition to our like gold silver and bronze price we also have like different tracks so this best AI project or nurses chain will be I will say best project on Hashi and lastly best project on safe yep so I'll just be going through what it's called is knowledge chain why and how and also going through a bit on what's nurses Builders and At Last I will just introduce harshit so uh what is know this chain so now this chain is a level one uh prove a stake based evm compatible chain so it utilizes a dual token system so for X9 for gasps and gno for staking so the isolate token is a USD pack token so it's a stable coin there's a derived from die on ethereum so that makes it uh possible for the transactions to be very cheap because with 100 you can perform as many as a hundred thousand transactions or more and for another chain is also Community powered and developer Focus so anyone in the world can become a validator on a chain so the goal what's the mission of another chain so notice chain aims to be the most decentralized blockchain we already have the tools actually to measure the level of decentralization as shown as the screenshot and and wise know this chain is more suitable for this goal is currently because we have over 129 000 validators and it's still growing every day and the barrier of Entry to become a validator you know this chain is very low so one knows uh jno is all you need compared to like 32 if for ethereum and now this channel so tries to be accessible for the types you know through like a straightforward user onboarding experience so the key priorities of knowledge chain is uh like I say decentralization we want to have a resilient uh backbone for nurses chain and we also want to have an intuitive related experience for uh anyone who wants to kind of validate for another shin and we also provide a seamless and accessible onboarding this is a process for users into the musician ecosystem and lastly we also have a growing ecosystem of tools and infrastructure to support depth dials and Etc on this chain so uh just to introduce like what is notation I was using cultural like why so uh notice chain with over 129 000 validators it is the third most decentralized chain so after Bitcoin and uh ethereum and uh speed uh now this chain is fast with a original block time of 5 Seconds and getting started with noises chain is generative and cheap because we have affordable transaction costs and lastly because fee science extra stable coin uh we has a notice chain is stable uh cash transaction because the cost is not susceptible to Market volatility so this is the current state for nurses chain so this is derived from this Matrix so we have uh uh around 237 000 active accounts with over 5 million transactions and 129 000 validators with uh 14.9 million dollars in total deposited USD and for validators who are validating for musician we also have a year of 14.6 percent so yeah this is another incentive for validators who want to validate foreign yeah so why developers choose this chain because it's user friendly and uh now this chain is accessible for everyone and anyone can actually interact with your project easily uh he has also a strong ecosystem of budding our ecosystem of exiting projects tools and resources and we also have a grants program by nurses Builders so we also allow public good projects to apply for ecosystem grants and through nurses Builders we also provide project support So projects built with know this chain can actually hit us up and you can receive support for marketing they created it networking and more from the Northeast Builders team so this is a summary of our ecosystem at a glance so this was taken in December so yeah uh from then we still we are still growing so yeah so I'll just go through how to build for nurses chain so so know this chain is a evm compatible chain so anything that you have developed for for example small countries that we developed for like ethereum can be easily put it over to those exchange you just have to check out this uh uh oppressive endpoint endpoints and alternatively also can also Auto config your Miramax wallet you know by going to this uh chain list where we have like a one link setup yeah all of this information will be available in the docs also yeah so this is just a uh for the consideration and like I mentioned notice chain is 100 evm compatible means you can actually use all of the deep tools development tools that you use on ethereum or not this chain without changing anything in fact you can take a smart contract before ethereum and deploy another chain without much hassle so here are the useful resources for another chain so we have the first system notice the io so it's the main website and provides a quick overview of the notice chain we also have a dots.nosischain.com so it's the entry point for all like documentation for another chain and nurses Wallace will just list the support wallets for another chain now this faucet will allow developers like you to actually get a small amount of X die to deploy your projects and yeah for users who like to validate uh for nurses chain after this uh hackathon you can actually visit validate notices.com and we have an interface for you to actually learn on how to validate uh for another chain so yeah I'm gonna just go through like a quick overview of what's not disputers so I'm from Melissa's Builders so we actually provide tools for users and developers uh to get on board on uh position so yeah our tools are on the notice the builders tools and we also have useful information for developers users validators and we also have community events and yep all of these are here and uh all of you can check out and for projects who like to collaborate with us or we can actually reach us out and yeah we will try me with you and yeah and provide as much support as possible so yeah let's switch gears uh today I'll still be going through Hashi so so Hashi is a new project launched by nurses Guild which is a cross chain uh protocol based on additive security so Hashi is the hash Oracle aggregator for cross chain communication based on edited security so multiple inputs and multiple oracles so at this core Hashi is a hash Oracle aggregator and it allows developers to build what uh or in course right hole so read out an array of hash oracles so the main goal is here is to distribute truss for bridges on the mechanism level where essentially you don't have to trust a particular individual Bridge mechanism and allow users to set up a layer of industry for their systems so why has she so Hashi was created when they're going to see skill team because there were many security incidents involving uh security incidents related to bridge exploits so in 2022 there's more than 2 billion dollars worth of tokens they are lost due to bridge related exports so four of the five uh top experts on the red news Dash leaderboard are all related to bridge and because of this there's no single Bridge implementation that is 100 secure so we shouldn't uh building Securities you should not be building security critical systems that solely depend on them and at Bridge designs have also you know some trade-offs whether it might be due to cost security or auditability and most important to take away is that systems built on top of bridges get hacked and get aspirated because they have put all their trust into individual Bridges uh that eventually get exploited so for Hashi essentially what we want to standardize at the lowest level is which is the block header so in addition we want to be modular and agnostic to the underlying mechanisms by implementing right whole so what righto is is a redundant array of historicals so let's say you have a critical piece of data you will not want to save only this data on a piece of hard drive so ideally you want to create multiple backups of this or you can create a raid so in a computer terms you'll be a redundant array of any specific this and so where you have multiple this running in parallel so if in the case that any data is lost you you will actually not lose any data so like any redundant systems a rate can also have its own trade-off so in terms of speed versus cost versus red density so hydro system is like sort of rate but for a bridge oracles so in Hashi we decided to optimize for security over costs and speed so how she will only move as fast as the slowest Oracle since multiple Bridge articles will have to report the same hash in order to consider the hash value because of this robustness security it's definitely going to improve yeah but at a cost at an expense of cost and speed so here are the main components that the team has built and we're at the same time we're still looking for other people to others to build as well so we are very interested in applications such as token Bridges government Bridges and nft bridges and yeah so I'll just go through the architecture overview of Hashi so on the left-hand side you know starting from canonical example we have a token Bridge contract that wants to ultimately mean tokens at the destination chain so on the search screen it's going to send a message to the storage and their message is going to be reported to a variety of different mechanisms into the destination chain so in this case you can see that uh we have this AMD reporter and remote reporter that's reporting to a very a variety of mechanisms into the destination chain so at the destination chain uh each of this mechanism is going to essentially uh validate the message independently and the results from each mechanism is going to be aggregated by Hashi so Hashi will be at the end here and uh so the token Bridge Country will actually automatically request from uh Hashi using a hashtag Associated Idol with the message ID or block ID and if they all agree with each other it will then allow tokens to be minted on the destination chain the the core contracts for Hashi uh is kind of stateless and very unopenated way of querying for multiple Oracle adapters and giri giribashi is the kind of government governable extension to Hashi that allows you to have an honorable country where you can Define explicitly which set of adapters Master agree for a given hash for the system connected to consider it valid so systems are built on top of this will also want to leverage things like storage proofs reporter contracts for broadcasting and then executing messages based on the hash and then relays for listening to events on the origin Channel reporting hashes are triggering corresponding destination chain so for hackers so I like to build with Hashi so what to build with Hashi so we like to see people working on its adapters like client base one and we left love to see kind of optimistic bridge and community-based bridges so diversity is kind of the key here and we also love to see contracts that check for local proofs for some events or storage on the origin chain we also like to see alternate implementations of girigree Bashi so right now it's a relatively kind of simple aggregation Rule and we like to see a different governing rules or different aggregation rules and let's say we will just love to see things built Hashi so like token Bridges nft bridges government Bridges or other novel things that you know we are not thinking about yeah so here are the resources for Hashi we have uh the singular rapper repository in GitHub where you find all the information that is related and uh and get you started and with the losses Guild team has already implemented adapters for no ccmb or improve and connects and we also have deployed the contracts you know on a girly shadow and yeah just to summarize again these are the prices that we are giving out so yeah that would be it thank you for this uh listening and all the best foreign
