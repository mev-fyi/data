um okay our stream is up looks good cheers thank you everyone for joining us today on this fine wednesday um thank you adrian for presenting really excited to see what you have in store for us today i will let you kick it off we're going to be taking questions during so if anyone wants to funnel their questions in through the chat you're more than welcome to do so during the presentation itself um if we miss it we'll come back to it and flag it we're trying to have a pretty interactive session here but adrian i'll let you kick it off really excited to see what you have for us today um and take it away hey thank you so much luke and uh happy to be here hello everyone um i'm here today to talk a little bit more about blockheart on eveblog.art and especially the process of creating your own block style so i'll be sharing my screen i'll be walking through a little bit what does that mean maybe do a little bit of live coding and answer any questions that you might have for the next i guess half an hour so let's get started i'll be doing something kind of brave i'll share my whole desktop here i hope nothing bad happens i am assuming y'all can see this um so uh to give an introduction thank you for those that don't know the site uh this is eve blockheart we do uh deterministic art nfts using ethereum blocks so this is a creator first experience that combines creative coders creating what we call a block style nfd and any general participant minting their own block card nfts using any block on ethereum and using these block styles as templates so you can think of it a little bit as i'm sure we all familiar with etherscan for example so this is a pretty analogous experience you get to navigate to any block on ethereum's history so you get to go to for example block two and i hope this works there you go so here we are looking at the data of the real block number two with a style selected a block style which gives you this cool uh visual representation which you get to tweak um to your desire and you get to then mint an nft out of this of course right now you can't because all nfts have been minted from the style already but uh and i guess you can show a little bit here how these all these are the existing styles on the platform today which they're live here but they also not a lot of people know they're also nfts which you can navigate through openc for example which you can trade or you know give to a friend so yeah um i guess something interesting to talk about in this workshop is exactly how do you code one of these or what do they actually mean right so um here i'll switch to rinkeby real quick and just a reminder uh feel free to stop me at any point in time if you have any questions and i'll go a little bit through what exactly is a block style and how do you create one so uh for starters a block style is a nft and erc721 on ethereum it has a bit of a different implementation than the standard esc 721 and that means that it has a few things like he allows the owner to set a supply or to set a cost value which is written to the storage of this one nft and he allows the owner to also write a ips ipfs cid which represents the code which this nft contains so you can see here an example of the editor interface that allows you to create your own block style so you got to do traditional things like uploading an image which becomes like the thumbnail in the the image within the metadata in the token uri of the token you get to add a title and description use your things and you get to upload a component bundle which is the more exciting thing here right the this bundle can be in a few different flavors so we have things like reactive fiber exactly we do use 3d things you can do things in p5.js which is really popular out there today we can use things with gl react and you can also bring your own solution right we allow for any dependency um you can use a vanilla converse you can do basically whatever implementation that your heart desires with a few limitations that i'll go through in a few minutes and you can provide you know options to the participant on the other side with some default values as well so what i wanted to do is to show during the hackathon we are giving a few prizes for hackers who above all wants wants to work at the protocol level so integrating with the contracts you know extending your contracts uh building more composable solutions or helping with the discoverability of all the 10 000 lockhart and fts that have been minted already but we are we're also giving prizes for someone who doesn't want to or doesn't have the experience to work at the smart contract level but is experience with react or is a creative coder or is an artist who wants to collaborate with a developer and i guess that's what this workshop will be most useful for so to start from the beginning actually there's one page that i haven't opened which would be this one health minute to block stuff so if you are a artist or a developer and you're interested in experimenting creating your own blog style first of all feel free to reach out in our sponsored channel in the if online hackathon discord but also feel free to join our discord where you can ask more technical questions from other artists who have gone through this process before but we also have this guide that you can also find you know documentation which covers the steps so creating your own blog style is super easy and you can do yourself as a self-serve process um on wrinklebeat so you can get a little bit of ring of the eve which is free as you know and you can by yourself go to this page uh an nft token you can pick up the open source template that we provide you can iterate on that for as long as you like and you can later compile your code and then upload it to ipfs and associate it to your block style nfd so exactly this document covers all the steps a little bit more in detail once you have your blog style nft minted you have of course is nice and steep that you get to show your friends that you get to potentially trade but the more exciting thing that a lot of creators uh want to do is propose your blog style to be added to the block card registry this is the step covered here so adding your blog style to the registry means that other participants get to come in later and they can do the minting from your blog style right so they can create whatever supply that you determine of block card and fees using a template using ethereum blocks we have this registry process for many reasons i think one of the most important ones to highlight is the fact that people are able to write some this piece of malicious code right we are literally fetching a common js bundle from ipfs and injecting that into the app during runtime so uh no some bad things can happen that way so we tried to do a little a base a little bit of qa on the code and make sure things are working properly at the very least so one of the things that you'll find in this uh guide is a link to this repo yeah pretty much dangerously set in html is a no doubts friend basically um so we have a few open source uh templates boilerplates on github which i'm really happy that it's been mostly community made so there's a lot of contributions from community members that put together this little project and it has all the pieces required for you to develop your own block style um so one thing i can do actually there's a little trick that i'm not sure a lot of people here know you do you know that with any github repo url you can just add box to the end and then you get sent straight to code some box loading the repo in the sandbox i wanted to do it this way but i think it's not gonna load so let's just see if let's give it another chance yeah i don't think it's gonna take a little bit too long but to save my ass a little bit i did load this locally as well so you can have an idea of what that project kind of looks like so i'm basically just loading the same thing from here uh let's see here yeah so this project is the same thing as this project here and uh i guess i can just very briefly cover uh let's say i'm a creative coder right now and i want to create a blog style so i just fetched this repo from github and i start running this code the first thing you'll see is you have a block.js file which will give you three blocks this is more to give you an idea of what the data structure of a ethereum block looks like right so this is literally a whole block with all the whole array transactions with the full data of all the transactions you have some metadata related to the block which i don't think we have the time in this workshop to go through each field and you have um basically a lot of data from each individual transaction that you get to parse and get to create cool visuals or interactive experiences or animations etc to your heart's desire the number one rule here is that everything needs to be entirely deterministic using the block data so you wouldn't bring um a uh you know soda random um function or library to your style you just derive all the entropy from the data that's already available and to make developers life easier we have a few different flavors here as you know basic examples so when you first load the project you will find a code example which uses oh actually never mind this is a custom project so you're not going to see the default one will load like a vanilla canvas implementation um and you will find a few of the different variations like reactor 5 or p5 right here which you can just rename to just custom style and basically start working on a code for a sake of demonstration what i thought of doing is recently i released this block style called ether marbles and i figured during this workshop i can show the process of modifying the code a little bit and then uploading it here and then having the experience of seeing how that reacts to block data so so here pretty much what you could do i think uh so let's say i want to change all of these to just be i'm going to do something very simple here because i think if i start really live code it's not going to work that well but uh i'm just going to make everything black so the moment i upload this code you're going to see a marble that's basically just going to show actually let me just maybe not do everything black let's just do some random values here so you got an idea like that so i would go here i would open my terminal and i will do yarn bundle so what this is gonna do uh first of all this is just like a create react app um basic app frame um actually i can just run it here and you're going to cut it here now we wait for react to compile good thing i'm multitasking yeah so now we get to do two things at the same time so while that is loading i'm just gonna open this i'm gonna get file upload and i will go to the file that i just created main.js that came out of this npm task i just uploaded here and i didn't notice but this cid should change in front of you and that indicates that your js bundle have been uploaded to uh ipfs um and then i got to just go here and update update so this will create a transaction uh it will be a very cheap transaction you're just writing a new tax field pretty much so i got to just confirm it and i got to close this window and things should be super fast because it's a wrinkly oh and while this loads i can show you the uh sandbox so this is the experience that you get locally right so let's say you want to develop your block style um you start that mini app and you get the code that you're writing here visible on this website so you have the controls here that i got to play with and something that was added recently by a community member you have a metamask connection so instead of looking at the same three boring blocks that you saw on that file earlier you get to connect your model mask and you get to go through you know you'll basically keep on fetching blocks for as long as you have this page open and you will have always like a new uh deterministic seed to be looking at your style as you develop it and of course you get to navigate through it so you get to go to the previous version of what it created i was not supposed to do that so now i believe yeah my update has happened so i got to go to create block card hopefully loads there you go we have live so one thing i didn't realize before getting in this workshop i was working on the stall before um and i was working on the stall to integrate this new other nft that came out recently called palettes right which are just color palettes on chain um very simple kind of inspired by loot is just a nft with five hex color values so uh after talking to the dav we did a cool integration together and i think this shows like a really cool um the strength of composability i guess especially with nfds so you just saw me create the blog style and one thing that i didn't talk about this block style is that it receives the palette as an input type so just a as a little refresher uh these block styles are just react components so we get to pass in whatever we want into it just writing a new prop so what i've done here is that when i press this button it's going to load my wallet and it's going to fetch all of the pallet nfds that are in my wallet right now and it will allow me to select one of my palette and of these and they will colorize i guess the uh the block style so uh i have these 10 beautiful palettes in my wallet right now and i get to okay i like this marble and i like it with this palette and i want to mint it right so you'll be able to open the mint model this is a rinky so i'm not actually gonna do it and when you so basically this is the process that you've submitted your blog style uh it's already live other folks are interacting with it they're curating what the the output they want to mint and uh when they find something that they like they get to come here and they get to write a title and a short description for what they're going to give their nfp and they press this button and they basically mint it so the palin integration is actually something that should be going live soon and since we're here i actually very much uh suggest folks to explore how else can we combine different nfds especially primitive ones into you know cool interactive solutions like this that i guess at the end of the day it makes multiple communities very happy and everybody get to enjoy something fun to do and i guess i'll kind of kind of wrap it up there and i'll open up the the rest of the call for calls if anybody has any oh sorry questions hello hey yeah i have a question first of all it's amazing what you uh you've built there i was wondering if um let's say my bulk art is using react-free fiber and i have like a camera and the user would be able to navigate within the 3g model uh would that be possible as well um once it's minted so the the the kind of guidelines and rules that we have is that the sketch should always be deterministic it means every time you reopen it you kind of get the same output um it's also kind of delicate once we do this uh thumbnail generation right so this happens in the client it just takes a photo of the style as you have it so to answer your question yes it is doable it is possible um you get to come to the code and you get to bring all of the libraries that you need as long as the library doesn't make a third-party api call doesn't require any outside third-party resource and doesn't bring in any randomness right so given that that applies you could very well create like a whole 3d model as a a minigame for example right like a mini 3d cd which you can bring in different blocks you know bringing this deterministic entropy so you can make each 3d model unique to the block um and you get to add the second layer of interaction right you got to navigate using your mouse or using your camera or something like that um as long as yeah you can still reopen it and you can reliably still get the same uh version yeah it's going to be always the same scene containing the same objects that are going to be loaded um just that the user will be able to navigate around the art yeah that's amazing so a little one of my you know dreams out of this is for someone to eventually build something like a minecraft where you're literally walking over newly generated terrain which is deterministic which is based on data which we all create on ethereum um so it kind of gives you the vibe of we're walking over dinosaurs but in a very digital way to some extent right all right all right i i was more thinking of a mini space island where you could explore some planets or something yeah all right thank you thank you since i'm here already and while i've got other questions one thing i also would like to show is once we look at once you mint the block card nft ft it's really not just the image right we we see a lot of nfcs out there actually just go a little bit higher so what you get once you finally meant that you paid the fee you got your token the token will have a image with you took yourself so whatever thumbnail that you capture in the client side will be the thumbnail that will be uploaded to ipfs and written to your token um you also get the animation url which is we do this just on our api which is something that opens for example xbax to be able to display the live canvas representation on the openc page itself these attributes are actually written by the block style creator so you get to customize not all of them actually these last ones here you get to define these inside your style using whatever logic that you create in your algorithm but the most important thing about the whole token is this object with settings right so um if you look actually this is another good one i'll just do one thing here uh what am i gonna do i'm gonna open my net well my computer is really not healthy i guess what i wanted to say is uh the nft itself um each holds the exact parameters that you set in the editor uh which allows us to reconstruct the uh live compass experience so also answering a question from before the other things that the block card nft has which i wanted to show but i don't think my computer is going to help me right now is that it's also a different implementation than a standard esc 721 and it contains unchain so i was going to open etherscan and show you some of the call functions it contains and chain the token to block uh the token to style id and the token to value so these this information is like the most critical needed to inform uh what what what consists of your token right so i meant to does an ft using this block and using this style so that is uh immutably recorded on the nfd itself and this is the metadata file that gets uploaded to ipfs and it has some more granular pieces of information right this information here is actually editable right so after you've minted your nft or if you buy the nft of the market from somebody else you will not be able to change what is the block number or what is the uh the style chosen to create that nft but you are able to change the individual parameters that the block styler enabled in a style you're able to change the title or the description if you find a typo maybe or if you don't like what you see so the the block card nft is semi immutable the most critical piece of information is entirely immutable and chain well the more um yeah additional layer of more granular information is something that you can kind of tweak over time if needed when needed and yeah i would just open up for more questions and then we can wrap this up well thank you adrian that was an incredible presentation and i i'm really excited to see what people do with it throughout beef online as i'm sure you are as well likewise likewise thank you look and thank you everyone thank you everyone for participating today we look forward to seeing what you guys build and thank you for coming to the session we're going to be closing the uh live stream right now um but we have another one that gets in 30 minutes or so so don't miss out and if you'd like to continue the conversation i would encourage you to go over to discord and follow up there
