i think part of the reason why we get like have uh projects like hackathons and why we even like wants to have a decentralized ecosystem is because we know that we are not um always the ones that have the answers right like uh i think our expertise has like a general purpose like ethereum and technology builders is in in the technology in kind of a lot of more global trends and kind of bigger ideas around economics but then there's also a lot of like expertise around you know what specific issues different communities and different regions have east global mexico is a really good push in in the right direction you know just so many people are just being exposed to what's happening that don't even know so like you know my family came and that's 20 people that didn't know what the blockchain was and they're asking me like so what is this so i think if you continue to do these events especially in latin america it'll grow like we needed to then a lot of developers out of latin america have you know built projects that are being used by people everywhere around the world the level of motivation is very high in latin america especially for people from latin america because we are not used to this kind of events we are not used to a lot of hackathons or even maybe we are not used to see a lot of startups growing so it's a big impact for the latin american people to to keep building this kind of projects and hackathons is the community in mexico is alive like it's just so vibrant and people are so excited to you know one learn new technologies but also like go out and play i am a huge east global fan eat global is kind of the reason i got started as a dev in web3 i did my first hackathon online and so coming in person has just been so magical because i meet all of my internet friends and i see people kind of through their full journey of their first project and then their second one and then the third one their startup their vc funding stage it's just amazing to watch people grow and to be growing alongside such incredible leaders massive massive fan of eth global is where i've seen a ton of different hackers get started some of whom have later joined the lens and ave team it's where we've seen a ton of great projects get started and especially for us as builders there's no better way to get feedback than directly from those building on top of your platform looking at it from a global perspective is exactly what we need to do because we want everybody in the world to be included not just a specific region like you know it just helps with everything people have projects that are focused on public goods regenerative finance there's a lot of solar pumps running around so it's so fun to see all of these different communities hacking on local issues as well as like global scalable problems that benefit all of ethereum and for us it's an interesting place to actually see and get inspired from other developers and newcomers from the space to build the uh future of the internet yeah i think it's one of the communities that is first of all not like incentivized by some big centralized company i think that's what makes it so powerful it doesn't matter it's like i always say it has um you know music has no language and all those things i think ethereum is sort of getting there but it doesn't matter like i'm i've been in so many different countries everyone gets it what adherent does and what they can do on it the community is so warm and so accepting i think it has to do with the fact that everybody that's here is chosen very consciously to be here and probably had to do some really hard work to get here in the first place so everyone's really excited the next time somebody comes in it's really warm and welcoming
