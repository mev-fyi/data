[Applause] [Music] hello everyone um we have alex and melena here from out protocol who's doing a workshop on build a dow powered app without if you have any questions they can go into the zoom chat and they'll be more than happy to answer them and with that being said i will pass the mic off to our two speakers thank you hello everyone it's great to be here well it's great to come back all right so i'm alex i'm originally from italy and then the co-founder of out and we have here milan milano hello hello so guys without further ado let me share my screen and here we are so the the main idea of this workshop is to introduce you to out and the magical things that you can do with our protocol and our products so first of all is an expandable protocol that allows not only a native dial tooling but also native pro based membership for the house themselves for this uh challenge for building up our dap without we are offering 5000 us this is and we will show you later how to easily uh get started now uh the main concept about came from the fact that we believe that dallas themselves are a societal shift are people that just randomly meet on the internet have actually the power to organize to communicate and work a completely different way as well as potentially subvert or disrupt jurassic world structures for example the very concept of the organization government employment corporations and so on can be completely different as we know them today now the the issue with us of course is that the fact that is decentralized governance brings in uh completely brand new different problems in governance itself for example uh we've seen how many members are motivated by financial reasons and joining an organization so we have the so-called civil attacks where usually trying to gather financial benefits different members have either a parasitic behavior just create multiple accounts spamming and creating uh let's say sort of potential manipulation and risks for the rest of the community as well as we've seen how governance tokens are not always the best idea in voting decisions because um basically by buying a bunch of tokens in the market you may manipulate the outcome of an election voting round and so on which is you know plutocracy at best as well as the fact that sometimes we forget the taos are contracts that exist on the blockchain and uh they can do much more than what they are used for nowadays so at the moment we we basically have uh at the moment um we basically have a sort of hierarchical structure where decisions can just be taken by a collective by voting either off or on chain but then they need to be implemented by a restricted group so the entire community needs to trust a small group of leaders for these decisions that they took collectively to be actually implemented this is our old pyramid trust now what we what we are doing is basically to bring roles and uh commitment to the different numbers directly at contract level so we expand the concept of what the value is being expandable uh also means that we we have a sort of gateway that i will show you in the minute that allows you to bring what we call the legacy down contracts so for example different uh moloch's thermal clouds or argon or gauss stack and others that you can see in our documentation can be imported easily and expanded creating generating basically new uh down contract not already have distinct concepts basically by bringing roles directly on a contract level membership and governments combine with each other members can receive and assign to each other tasks that are specifically for a role and improve the way they coordinate with each other and they manage their workflow so this is what the powered app is in itself so you can build any piece of technology software project idea that you have in mind and is led by your vision but we give you the possibility to have a down infrastructure behind so that your users the users of your depths are members of your community they have a role they do things that are functional and bring value to the project as well as receiving more meritocratic rewards based on how much they participate in a certain way what uh what a dell power that is is a sort of bound between a project a product and an entire community from their users so uh now i will be showing you a few uh products that we have available for this act uh we will be releasing a few uh a few more things but for now the spoilers so this is the out expander and the out expander is basically the gateway to access all out environment ecosystem it's the very simple application where you can import to the existing now contact that you are working with or um using for example the akka style if you want to access this way and uh directly from our ui you can add the different roles that you expect in the community there are always three roles and i will show you a couple of these cases in a minute as well as adding some interesting aspects of the community for example the name the logo and the description it really gives a hint of what people can do there this is what we call uh doubt is a decentralized donative authentication system is just like you know a typical google authentication system so um people users members to the web space can easily login using the same account but this account is out id can be claimed only by joining the first down so by joining the first community they can claim a self-stolen non-transferable identity that then can be easily used um you can use easily for example it's an authentication system on a platform it is compatible with any different framework front-end framework and this allows your members not only to connect a metamask wallet browser wallet and have a 0x name but also to have a nice avatar that represents them as well as a nickname that is unique so you already know what they can do and they already know that they can be recognized this is how the out id looks like is a social profile that you can see directly on your own page is at my dot out dot d slash your nickname and as you can see it has different uh on-chain records for example your different social accounts as well as your unique beautiful nfd card that represents your identity and showcase is what you're doing the communities that you're part of now uh of course these are brand new concepts uh so what can you actually do with that now for this academe specifically we conceived a few ideas that we would like to serialize first of all again to have a double powered app doesn't change what you're building so don't be influenced by this it's just a way to have a more functional community and really turn your users into part of your project and product now that i said these are three simple ideas that you can easily realize without a service dao you can imagine it as any sort of freelancer collected so designers marketers uh any uh for example a music production and so on so there are different functional roles three that you can customize at the moment of deploying your your dao and the participants the members of your community can easily pick their role as well as their commitment meaning that then for example your clients will be able to see who is available in on a specific date assign a specific assignment uh to uh to a specific role and so on and so forth so then at some point you may even turn it into a showcase portfolio of the different experiences completed an activist group um so you can imagine it as a source of ngo there are multiple moving parts uh parties is very difficult for example to access information in a fluid way so uh you can create a simple rule based access without and this way different organizations or parts of the organization itself can access different documents information data and so on and so forth and the curation market the curation market is one of the main use cases that we thought of when we started to build out uh you can think of for example an art or an ft marketplace uh where there are three simple roles they're always the standard ones a creator that creates some artworks activator that makes sure that there is a high quality in the collections and a collector a collector is the person that wants to be exposed to beautiful artworks because they want to buy them uh accuration market can be launched in uh really minutes uh using out and uh of course you can build any sort of identity brand and so on on the top of it is completely your choice and we don't influence that at all so as you can see these uh main products that we're releasing and this is alcatel uh which are making accessible for your desktop are a way to you're compose to have an actual collective innovation and to use tools that basically don't prevent any sort of choice that you may be taking or your community may be taking on the long term so uh you can easily turn your uh your dap into a coordination engine and make sure that it will drive and keep innovating over time so this is uh what we have been building for you and is ideally autonomy within and beyond the digital borders of the community now i will leave the world to milan uh so hello hello hello um yeah i've been showing you i will be showing you guys how to start it so how to uh expand your dial uh if you don't have it out how to use the one that we have deployed hackers though um because you know it's a hackathon so yeah we we imagine that maybe you don't already have uh with thousands of members and uh also how to integrate the authentication system so i'm going to share my screen um yeah i can alex can you confirm that you see i guess just here uh so first of all the place where uh the place to start um is for sure our documentation uh i'm going to do a little walkthrough on how you integrate it and etc so first of all in order to expand a dial you should already be a member of the dao otherwise uh it's um it's just not gonna work uh so we have deployed uh hackers dao uh which is our own uh stanbird it's the skill wallets legacy standard uh it is deployed on both um gurley and mumbai and um if you join it from hackersdale.id that i'm currently doing then you will be able to um deploy an expander of this dao using using the same the same account um i set it to aggressive so that it [Music] so that it happens a bit faster but let's see oh we always need to trust yeah we always need to trust the guts of the blockchain in this case so no words we have time yeah i intentionally put it to put the cast to a crazy force so that um yeah okay there we go uh so now i am a member of the hackers now and this is the address of it this is the one deployed on gurley and i can go to the playground and expand it so let's see how this would go i need to join with the same with the same account i want to do it on girly now these are all the dial types that we currently support uh so if you are using another another type of dial just select here whichever it is for the hackers now it's skill wallet legacy the dial address is the one that i just got from here [Music] and here we select the template that our uh that our dollar presents let's say that we're going for web3 tooling uh and our rose would be a hacker mentor and sponsor uh now the minimum commitment level is important because then when um when new members are creating their out ids and are joining your dows they will have to select a minimum commitment uh higher than what you have selected here let's say that we don't require a lot of commitment we're just lurking around and that's it so and now what happens under the hood is that [Music] is that our dow expander registry is deploying a new contract for you which is a link to the previous dow contract that you've had with on top of that having the concept of interactions and roles and now this is the expanded dial contract address and i'm gonna copy it and if now with we're gonna need this address in order to integrate the web component which is the the centralized authentication system that alex was talking about and it's very simple it's basically a web component an npm package and if you just follow these instructions that we're going to do now i'm going to do it in react but this cross framework so you can perfectly you use it for angular vue.js or whatever you prefer so here i have an empty i'm just going to put this here so that i don't lose it an empty um racked up the only thing that it does is to return an empty div on in the index and what i will do is that i will get this example for react i will splash it here add a missing import uh and put our own our new address that we just that we just got from expanding without now here the network is important you should select corely or mumbai depending on what you depending on what you're using and the other thing which is nice is that you can here select one of these um nice button styles if you have light and dark modes of your app and things like that i will go with simple and one thing that i forgot is obviously to install the library i missed step one okay cool and this is basically all it takes uh like in our case it's an absolutely empty uh page with a button in your case it would be your your app your landing page or something but basically what this button lets us do now is to connect so to login with our out id or to create a new account and what i'm going to do now here is to create my out id as the signer as the dow expand expander creator so basically the this account that i used for the wizard yes and i am nincarena i am a mentor let's say and i'm very committed now out ideas come as non-transferable nfts so basically what is happening now is that um all of this data is put into a metadata file on on ipfs and that's why it might be slow depending on the date and once we're done with that yes we're going to uh mint our uh out id uh in relation to this uh community that we have that we are currently using so in this case this uh it's online demo dao well it will take some time but very nice so far i would like to use it um yeah i think i uh okay we're done uh great and now the last thing that i'm going to show you is how it actually looks like in this my dot out that i did it uh that alex mentioned actually i had it here where did it go okay so this is um your let's say down native user account if i connect we don't have time for that but if i connect my wallet i can edit and add some socials change the commitment levels and things like that but this is how it looks like um and yeah that's pretty much it fantastic thank you milan everything looks good maybe do we have time for some questions yeah we should have like nine more minutes so if there are any questions right in the meantime as a last [Music] showcase i will share my screen for a second guys and uh there is a qr code you can scan it straight away and basically you can use it to directly join the hacker style and start hacking on out so i give you a few seconds to scan it hopefully if you enjoyed our presentation i will jump on it so all right so here it was um i will be sharing it for me later or you can watch watch it on youtube so uh in the meantime thank you very much for glenna uh and well i'm not sure if we don't have any questions then please feel free to join us on in our channel we are out protocol and best of luck with your hack yeah um if anyone has questions you can also come off you and ask it live if you want to otherwise we could give another 10 or so seconds for any questions to roll in sure don't be shy we are here for you is anyone working on any dao related project yes so hi daniel i think you're a little muffled you sound very far away okay so i am working on something that is kind of like a memberships marketplace sort of like um you know if you had like a dao or some kind of uh community or maybe like a service and you wanted to uh you know have people find you uh you would uh basically go there and you would put it you would basically just you know like register it or something like put it out there so users can come and like search for that so i was just kind of curious if you know odd protocol can be applicable to something like that you know right now i was thinking about lens and unlocked but you know just watching the slides it kind of struck a chord but i really don't know what it is but there was just like something there so i thought i should you know put it out there and gets some feedback from you guys sure it's a nice idea first of all congrats them no well of course you can use it for example for authentication um you know it's in this is basically creation market it means you need to make sure that uh whatever type of content information stone that in your case is web3 tooling is understand is actually existing there is some sort of reputation behind the person that is adding it and so on so of course you could for example have um open permission last time behind the hood and use it for members well thank you milan for doing that and the other question um for members to log in create an account and once they have an account like the minimum commitment for example and so on then they can actually start posting the public uh content so the tools in this case so yeah you can definitely use it for this uh this kind of applications so creation markets and it's definitely one of the use cases that we have in mind uh if you want you can reach out to us in our channel and we can help you out okay sounds great sounds great i think i like the idea of like authentication and you know civil reducing like civil and all that so yeah cool cool thank you for sharing very nice idea just basically self-sovereign as milanesa said so all the information comes from the user from the owner of the advertising you can easily do it from your profile that's my.id slash maybe and from there once you connect your wallet you are recognized as the owner of the account so you can modify for example your own records or social records or you can withdraw from a community and so one thing that i forgot to mention uh just leaving it here uh this uh example that i just this sample repository uh that i used for the demo is pushed in github and you can check it out and and use it if you want this is the one perfect thank you milan and yeah that's true if you want to we already shared this link as well in our server but you can easily access all of these information tatters dot out ready and you have everything in one place just hey heck out so and i think our time is up uh thank you all it has been great pleasure as usual so yeah awesome um thanks so much alex and melena for taking the time to do this workshop for eath online um as i understand uh you're actually you actually started from youth online two years ago or was it yeah yeah that's great to hear yeah so yeah we love we love hacking and you know that's why we spend so much time with hackers it's one of the things that we love the most and uh we want we want to give a little bit back to this fantastic community for sure and like we all definitely appreciate it and we're really glad to hear that um one of the success stories um i do think you have one more question uh you do have like two minutes if you want to answer that really quickly um yeah uh it really depends on what you want to do with it uh like for this very basic integration and using like for instance for using it as a role-based access level in your ui and things like that you don't need to use any kinds of smart contracts you can only use the web component which is an npm package um so it really depends on what you what you are doing if you want to fetch only fetch the user profile you can do that by username with an api that we have which is just for querying and for anything else basically it's smart contract calls um but yeah maybe if you if you have like okay you did it all right so thank you danny thank you and i think that's that's a wrap yeah a great workshop as always um and yeah we can end things here um so yeah i hope everyone has a great rest of your day and happy hacking thank you thank you bye
