workshops uh we have pan from protocol labs ipfs file coin um here to do a workshop on build 3d voxel characters and the magic of voxel and questions go into the zoom chat if you have any pan we'll leave them all till the end so definitely stick around and with that being said i'll hand the mic off the pan thanks a lot anna hello everyone um i'm tan i am a file coin fps advocate um yeah very passionate about design and free graphics uh in fact i i began my career as a designer a few years working as an artist and got into coding i was trying to animate computer graphics so it's safe to say that i'm really happy to be here today um i'm very excited to be given this opportunity to teach you how to model your very first voxel game characters using this open source 3d voxel editor magical boxer and um if you haven't heard of waffles before um this is just like a very brief uh introductions uh what are voxels or us well luxury structures like 2d pixels except they live in three dimensions so if you have painted using early microsoft paint program then it's very similar except in magical voxel you will be painting in uh x y and z axes instead and why are building muscle style uh feral games right like what are the benefits uh what i can think of is uh for one um it is really quick and easy to model and gives your nft or gain a better time to market right like you you don't have to uh you don't have to hire uh like a a really um experienced 3d modeler or anything like that if you want to launch your nft project or a game anyone can actually model your voxel characters it has the nostalgic look and feel of those 8-bit you know nintendo games so it's really really relatable to the general audience and not just hardcore gamers um voxels are highly configurable because they are very modular right so as you can see so it is much easier to create variations attributes and props for your nfts or game characters if you've done some gaming in the past few years you might have come across this this really awesome game uh crossy roads um being shown here on the screen it was a very popular arcade game a few years back where the players sort of control an animal character um the most prominent one being alboso chicken to cross the roads and just dodge the obstacles like cars and trains the game actually popularized the modern warfare sound game and you know since then there have been many knockoffs and other games being inspired by bossy routes um to go all walks of style you know after the success of prostitutes of course um minecraft yeah i i forgot to mention this of course minecraft it's probably like the first ever 3d game that made voxel style so popular so that's kind of a legend up there for what this word i think there's a pretty good chance crossy roads use magical fossils for their game design as well um because my magical voxel is free and anyone can use it um so but if you know anything better just please let me know hey pan sorry to interrupt you really quick uh we're we can see your speaker notes not sure if you have them up on purpose or not oh no okay sorry about that no way he's just going to let you know yeah cool all right better now yes yeah okay so today we'll be modeling biscuit um here's this kit uh it's our final coin resident 4g um biscuit this is the hackers hackers tip um we will spend a bit of time getting to know our way around magical voxel ui and some of the components here then we will talk a bit about um the basic of designing uh and building muscle characters from my experience as a designer you know just enough to wet your appetite and get you playing afterward um and then i'll dive into building the corgi model while we learn how to use the tools in magical vocal by learning background because i believe um getting your hands dirty is a lot more fun than just listening to me lecturing then in the end if we have some time left uh i'll be happy to answer any questions from you or otherwise you know if otherwise we feel free to join our fine point slack or dm me on twitter or discord um my twitter username is at pansy shane p-a-n-c-y c-h-a-i-n and my discord username is kansey p-a-n-c-y tnc hash 5150 um so before we begin um we need magical russell of course so please go ahead and use the link to download here the first link on the screen if you like to um just just follow through with this workshop and um also the second link here is uh it's pretty optional um you can download obj to gltf using npm to use as a command line tool or javascript library on your front end to convert obj models to glbs and what what is the gmail lv format um glp is a 3d5 format that's using or all kinds of stuff online like vr ar uh web apps you know it supports uh motion animation um it also is very fast because it has a very small size so um glb files are kind of like a binary version of if you have heard of this is the gltf um gl transmission format file which uh uses json instead so it's human readable um gl b is not human readable um but it's very popular format to be used on the web um just because it loads very fast um so on the command line uh obj 2 gltf command line is totally optional but highly recommend it i can see some what is happening on um sketching on the screen that's cool someone has been creative here okay um let's go on to modeling your design all right so i'm i'm assuming that um a lot of you are designing your ears or you know you have some you know design passenger um and that's why you're here um so we're gonna talk a little bit about how to model your design um in the specs perspective of a designer or modeler um so you can see here all i have to start with was this um 2d cartoon version of the fortune um i didn't have much to start with so it was pretty fun also because it left a lot of rooms for creativity and interpretation here are the keys to modeling your voxel characters the first is to capture a few distinct qualities of a character um you know apart from colors colors are surprisingly are very of the least important representation of something um for instance if one day i just turned green and my hair turned red you you would still be able to tell it's me right so we we don't think of colors as being the identifying trait we just we can use them as a variation in your nfts or or whatever um as an example you can see the core g here what i think makes a corgi a corgi um are maybe the long upward deck and the big chest like you know it's a very proud job right like when it's it's walking or it's it's standing straight it looks very brown and of course um compared to it's it's you know his stature um it has a very stubby uh has a very stubby set of legs um and of course the chunky and much bigger hind legs and the buttocks so these are the qualities you want to capture in your when you model your boxing characters and here are some more examples of um you know modeling voxels after pixel-based art as you can see to the right is the 2d version of the artwork or design from this music video gimme proof um from five point um and to the right hand side are the fossil models i created um the second key um to modeling your design your voxel is to get the right proportion of the character here you can see the pickle heart character here um the wrapper guy here um his iris he's um the the black spots in the eyes are clearly one unit pixel in the in the 2d version right so that could be converted to a unit voxel one two one through 3d and i started with that and the rest kind of followed you related to it since pixels and voxels are very similar um the challenge the only challenge i think lied in interpreting the depth of or the size of the model based on the 2d pixels you know so i did um some guesswork around that um that is where you get to be really artistic and creative about your your modeling and after all it's really all about not taking your original designs literally and really make sure the voxel models look great on their own okay so let's let's dive into magical lobster ui and patrol and i'll let's go really quickly let's okay so i i hope by this time if you wanted to follow through you already have magical volatile on the screen um but if not um this session is recorded so you should be good to go later um if you can see here to the right hand side of the screen of the magical voxel ui here that's the color palette so it should be um it should be you're really familiar to a lot of you who have done some editing and graphics editing before so let's just choose this colors and whatnot here they have some predefined colors and right down here um you could see um you could also add your own colors and okay here um to the right hand side of this color palette is the brush paint the brush paint is very important it's actually where you um you'll be using a lot um the brush paint here most of the time you'll be using the three brushes here a voxel brush face brush and box brush and for each brush you could actually um choose an action attach action erase action or pain action let me show you this so let's um i'm using the voxel brush and then i choose the erase action as you can see here you can sculpt away voxel by muscle that's pretty cool all right and um the attach action i'm still using the voxel brush let you let you build you let you paint or add waxes in any color that you like keep in mind that boxes are like pixels so you know they're the smallest units here there you go and of course paint paints means you can paint the existing voxels in any color that you like again you can see that we're painting the whole boxes okay we're not painting just um any side of those lobsters we're painting the whole voxels the face brush here is very interesting um it lets you deal uh with the whole face contagious face let's see this face i want to erase his face there you go so i can erase it face by face i can switch to attach mode and that would just add more faces and of course pain you can paint it face by face oh and by the way um you know just how you rotate your model and you know um you know zooming or panning is very similar to any other um 3d modeling softwares here there's not there's no surprise here and last but not least the box brush here um just allow you it's very similar to the voxel brush that allows you to kind of fill planes of voxels instead of like you know dots of voxels you can build planes it's it's free handy okay let's move on to um down here um below here below the brush pane you would see the um the viewing page here so you can let's delete the model here right okay you can um you can choose how your your your space will look like you can turn off turn on the edge you can turn off and on the grid and the frame stuff like that and of course um the the center here is the editor where you mostly work with the model um and then to the right hand side of your editor window here is the edit pane here so what you can do okay what you can do here is that you can delete your model you can select your model and you can scale your model and there's a lot more things you can do uh to transform your model and um to the right hand side here is the project pane so that's where you can you know save and you know open your projects and stuff like that and the last one here is the um export pane here so that's where you export your model into some other file formats like obj for instance okay so without further ado let's try to dive into building our 4g um i'm going to show you this really quickly all right and this is biscuit power wrestling question i could render it as well um so magical also has a really decent um built-in renderer as you can tell so let's start with this okay and then um i'm just gonna [Music] delete the model oops okay really quickly okay um so if you're starting here from scratch just delete your whatever model you you're seeing on your screen and then um make sure your your space is set to 40 by 40 by 40 so you have some some room to work with okay and right now i'm just kind of bringing out the the corgi so here okay so keep in mind that um you know on modeling from the model that i i've built already um if you're you know in real life you'll probably be modeling from from sketch or from 2d sketches and stuff so it would just like take a bit more work here okay um so for me i like to start with the snout of the dog um it's just like a very messy place to start so let's see i think i should start with a four by four voxel cube so let's start with the um with the box brush and attach action and then let's do it um four by four there we go pretty good um let's change the color to something more realistic here boom okay and then um i'm switching to the face brush and attach action so i can extrude it up for lots of units okay and then i'll switch to voxel brush and then paint mode paint action here and then i'll just paint the nose and watch this this is something that's really handy here um go to the mirror option here right under the brushes and then click x what it does is it lets um you kind of copy whatever you're working on across the x-axis um you know sort of like reflecting your work to the opposite side which is really handy because a lot of times your your vocal characters are symmetrical um so i'm gonna show you so i'm just gonna paint the nose and see this you know it just automatically um painted the other side as well and then i'm just to use the water brush and the erase actually to scalp away the mouth a little and that's it i've got the snout and then i use the move tool move it up a little bit so it's easy to work with okay and i'm just kind of going around here let's do the head of the dog here let's start with the box and then let's do the orange brownish orange for the skin tone okay and then sorry attach the box there we go switch to face brush and then um use attach action to extrude it a little bit here note that we're still doing the mirror thingy here so that's why it's you know if i right now i'm on a face brush and using the face brush and then attaching the voxels i'm gonna do this offset yeah so you can see the um your work set actually being reflected on the other side is pretty cool um attach i'm gonna extrude this up one two three four four of also yes great now let's paint the eyes here um let's see it should be around okay sorry flop so brush and then pain action and voila okay i'm happy let's do the iris it's pretty awesome okay let's now let's move on to the ear it's the box brush attached let's do the ear here oops now that's a different color i can use the eyedropper to select the color that i want from the model too that's what it did um the box brush attach there we go nice all right and then i use the box brush again just kind of build something here and then the face brush i use the paste brush to extrude it up all the way all right and then i use the voxel brush and the erase action to just kind of sculpt away the parts i don't need right and then i use the face brush and then erase action to just get rid of the whole thing now um i can select the the paint here and then i can paint with a waxal brush and paint it inside of the ear like that okay so we're kind of almost there this is stuck the hardest part ahead actually and then um let's paint this part here as well okay i'm happy here now we're going to use the face brush and then attach and then we can extrude this oops sorry i like the orange color extruded all the way to the ground like that and then let's approximate here um i need it to be a little taller so i'm gonna move this up here and then i'm just gonna use the face brush to extrude that more and then let's approximate his body use the box brush and detach to create like a plane for his body like that and then face brush to extrude it okay um okay so i'm gonna move them up a little bit more like that okay i'm happy with the size then i'm just going to use the voxel brush to erase this part i don't need to use the face brush is better very good much faster okay and let's start modeling the legs let's do this okay before that let's just paint this right here take the light yellow and then paint all right um that's just my detail here we can just kind of paint that there we go okay um let's use the box brush and then attach to make the base for the front leg it should be around that oh maybe bigger and then um that and then just the face brush to extrude all the way to the ground okay i kind of like the length of the legs here so i'm just gonna oops sorry just switch to the box brush and then do this okay um so i have a pair of nice planes lots of planes for the front legs really great so i'm just going to paint the socks for the this guy here fossil paint oops use the paint and then paint the way okay and then i'll use the face brush again and then just kind of extrude it a little oops there we go and then let's do the highlights here okay all righty it's just the box brush again and then the highlight should be slightly higher up here okay all right and again use the box brush to define the plane and then the face brush to extrude down away here and use the box brush to kind of oh we can just sculpt this away actually so use the boxer brush and erase action and make his hind leg a little round and cute like that okay i'm happy here okay and then um let's stay with the russell brush and then paint this sock oops what am i doing i forgot to choose the paint voxel and then paint away okay all right i'm kind of happy here use the face brush and then just extrude it so that they are as thick as the front plate again sorry okay face attached boom boom boom okay you sort of like have the whole thing and just the tail here so i'm just going to turn it off the mirror option here because it's just easy um let's just so erase make his butt up a little rounder and then um the box okay maybe a little bit too much okay all right and then i use the box brush just maybe make one more here up here and that's it boom we have the corgi okay um we should have some time here okay so here's the thing um what you can do is that if you press tab you enter the word mode so with word mode you can sort of just move things around without touching the model so you have you you can't edit the model directly but you can sort of put things wrong in the word mode this is where you work on separate um isolated components um so you can you can choose to work on um the legs the face and your head ears and stuff like that a separate components which is pretty handy um so let's say if we choose this uh space and then we press tab to go back to the editing mode we won't be able to touch our origin model because we're in the a different local space which is pretty handy because right now so that you can just kind of um model something else entirely isolated from your other models okay all right now it's the time to go to export okay let's save this first here um let's duplicate this yes and then um let's put some name here let's get clone one save boom and then now you can export to odj um it looks fine so you can save it here and then let's switch to our terminal here this is totally optional but um kind of recommended here so you know if you have downloaded obj2gltf here this is where you can use it um you see the um in the folder here you can see a lot of a bunch of files obj files um and mtl files material you know png file for the textures um so it's kind of difficult to handle all these files um when you know totally online so you use this command online obj to gltf to just kind of you know um convert the obj file to this glb file here and this glb file right here is very small and you could totally use it for your eft store and stuff because everything is self-contained you have material color everything you are you see in your editor will be embedded in that single file um which is pretty convenient so um yeah um congratulations if you've been following through you have created your first voxel module um um it's it's pretty it's it's not basic um you know um there's a biscuit model it's already really a good start here and um [Music] hold on okay so the next step i the next steps i recommend is to try to upload your um glb files to an ftd storage um and use the cid to fetch and display your 3d creations on your nxt store or game and you can also um you know just use the javascript library of nfc.storage as well if you want to programmatically do that on your frontend web application you can also try to import your obj model into blender and add some um reckons kinematics and use them in the game engine like unity uh also checked out dolby maxamo mcsammo i think um so after you break your model you could plug in some pre-defined animations and start seeing your characters animate without having to do any work and again thank you for being here uh i hope this has been fun and useful for your nft and gaming projects um in the future or within the build quest event um if you need some help or questions again just hit me up on twitter slack or discord um i'd be willing to help is there a question yes yes of course uh maybe a minute more to answer a few questions feel free to come off mute if you want to ask your question live yeah i think he's um yeah hello hey uh what's up sorry i think i i i didn't have the correct um yeah my question is uh is it possible to uh use uh an image right of a drawing um as a background so i can use it you know to sort of um replicate it on magicka boxer maybe so can you repeat the question again about the background yeah i have an illustration and i would like to use it uh as a background so maybe again or like you know in cinema for this you can put them in one of the views and sort of it is your guideline not to move then moderate into a 3d object so i was thinking maybe here i could use an image and then kind of like drew the boxes yeah yeah slowly yeah yeah i i think you can totally do that okay how how would i do that um so i i i i'm not sure at the top of my head but um i can find out the answer to you all right super thank you yeah um you wanna you wanna hit me up on on twitter or or anything yes you can follow up on this definitely awesome thanks awesome thanks for your question does anyone have any other questions for pan awesome so uh we can end this workshop here then um that was super interesting pan i really enjoyed seeing that and i think everyone else did too so thank you pam for taking the time out of your day to do this workshop for the build quest hackers um for the rest of you if you have any questions for the ipfs team um that you can reach them on uh both eighth global discord and their discord and with that being said we have more sessions or workshops planned for the rest of the day so definitely hope to see you at all of those as well and once again thank you pam for doing this really really interesting workshop thanks adam and thanks everyone for being here um feel free to just reach out to me if you have any more questions or you don't help awesome have a great day everyone
