so good ghosting right so you know when you get ghosted by a girl from a dating app she never shows up right it sucks you know that you're gonna want to get ghosted on yeah so that's that's the origin of the name so it's a savings game so using Ave in the background users commit to deposit 990 die every week users who follow through for a year eventually get sue withdraw all their money and users who drop out lose all the interests they can still withdraw their principle but they lose all the interest so what happens is users who stick to it get a higher APR than they would if they just put the money in ami so starts off like this and then over time you see people start dropping out you know they start ghosting you your friends are as loyal as you fought but your APR goes up so you're happy right so goes thing but made good so yeah this is what we built it's on Kovan at the moment we can show you in a second but one thing I did want to talk about is that we have a very good referral program so if if you have any friends who you think might ghost you this is a very good way to find out if they're good friends so invite them you will get 10% of the interest that they should earn and if they invite other friends you also get 1% of that so it's very good to invite friends and you'll find out if they're good friends or if they'll ghost you over time we can also calculate some stats so you can check out how many plays are in who are the most infectious players who have spread the love more and you can also see the prize it grows every day and how long it's going to take before the game ends so yeah we can show you our quick demo we call it quick it's not actually quick because it's web free stuff so it's gonna take a while and it's you need to press it once in a week or you will be hosted or you will become the coast yeah this we think this is the best UX one button actually metamath makes it like a five but that's different okay and it's going through we think in the background and overtime overtime you know Kovan it's taking its time and then you can send the next confirmation then it was saying that it's sending the dye guys let's clap for it come on come on give it give it some cheer come on hey success so we didn't ghost anyone this week but maybe next week we'll drop out who knows yep [Applause]
