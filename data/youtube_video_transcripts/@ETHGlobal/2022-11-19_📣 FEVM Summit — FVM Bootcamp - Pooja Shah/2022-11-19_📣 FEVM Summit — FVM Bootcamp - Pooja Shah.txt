foreign [Applause] [Music] we're gonna go to our last but certainly not least talk um so thank you again to our last panelists um and uh yeah gonna invite Puja up to the stage uh Hey pujo feel free to uh share or share your camera unmute yourself um and welcome to the stage uh excited to hear about the fem boot camp from Puja and always wonderful to have uh we should be a part of uh anything we're doing basically so welcome to the show thank you super excited to chat about this um today and also very excited to be participating in the hackathon this time so that's been fun um yeah I will share screen um awesome well yes as Jacob mentioned I'm here today to talk about the sem bootcamp also formerly known as the radius Fellowship um fvm Edition um and so uh for those of you who who may not know me I work with Tepper labs and radius is a project that from Tepper Labs it's a decentralized talent Marketplace um and so for the radius Fellowship this is a program we recently launched and it's um we basically saw that there was a need for people within the web3 space um to have more like protocol specific training if they were interested in finding future like opportunities within uh within web3 and maybe in that particular protocol ecosystem and because we know and love the filecoin team so much and also our have been watching the progress of fbm and febum uh really closely over the last few months we thought we would take a run the first version of this protocol specific training program with fem so the radius Fellowship more broadly um is an advanced training program for folks who are interested in learning how to build with new protocols we are really excited to kind of introduce a community element to it so this is a cohort based program and it's um you know folks apply to be part of the fellowship we go through a little selection process so that we can make sure that the cohort will have really great connections and really start to build that sense of the network and Community amongst itself and then we're also working with the various protocol ecosystems to identify grant opportunities for the folks who participate in this cohort so they get an opportunity to build something that's real um sort of like Get You know we all love hackathon prizes so it's sort of a similar vibe in the sense of um getting some funding to work on something that's meaningful within this ecosystem building a community getting the training um to know how to like really confidently build within that ecosystem and then seeing what that sort of opens up in terms of future opportunities after the program is done uh the first cohort as I mentioned is focused on fbm and we're starting this program in early January next year the applications are closing next week but they're still live now so if you do want to take a peek at that um the website I think was on the previous slide but that's at fellowship.radius dot space um and we are looking for folks who you know especially for this first cohort we want to make sure that everyone is really set up for Success so looking for folks who do have a few years of engineering experience but it doesn't have to be in web3 so I think a lot of the folks who are maybe participating in this hackathon could be a really great fit for the first version of this uh program and then we are currently charging a fee for the course but there are fee waivers that are available as well and that's something that we are planning to be like fairly generous with so ultimately you know if you are interested in participating in this program and you would be really excited to complete all the um the assigned work and participate in projects with other people in the cohort and really just do the work of um you know going through this boot camp because it will probably be a fairly intense experience for the folks who are participating um we for this first first version would be happy to wake the B it's mostly just about making sure we have people who are like really excited about this and willing to put in the effort um it takes to be successful um so just to give a little bit of an overview of how we're thinking of structuring um this program the there's it's a four-week program officially but there are a couple of um pre like precursor weeks I would say or kind of Preparatory weeks for folks who are newer to web3 um the first week uh or week negative one as we're calling it is kind of a more General introduction to web3 broadly sort of like the ideology of the space um and especially how that ideology and so that ethos translates into how we think about building projects in web3 um I think it's like a very unique space largely because of just how strong um how how many shared values and principles there are and how that does translate to how people think about um building software and and projects more generally so we I think it's always important to start with that um and then we'll also be doing a little bit of a deep dive into solidity um this the first version of The fvm Bootcamp is going to be focused on fathom because also just because of the timing it's early 2023 and so um Feb will be like pretty robust sure by that standpoint by that time but um I believe at the the timing of the fem um itself is scheduled for like later in in q1 2023 so that's why we're sort of focusing on febim for the first version but we will be doing a little bit of a deep dive into solidity uh for folks who this may be like their first time kind of experiencing it or um they're sort of like newer to working with slippy and then the full program which everyone will be participating in who's accepted into the cohort um is the four-week program and the first week of that will be focused on bioquin protocol fundamentals and also some of the architecture of fdm starting to do some introductory um content on on that front the second week will be more of a deep dive into how fem itself is structured and some of the tooling that folks can use if they're looking to deploy projects we'll also this week talk about use cases and start to like brainstorm and ideate on really valuable opportunities that might exist um in the Falcon ecosystem to build high impact projects in on fbm um and then the third week will sort of kick off formally working on bigger projects there will kind of be like um you know smaller projects that everyone is kind of doing the same thing the first couple weeks and then week three will be more like uh Choose Your Own Adventure type of projects with teams that will help you form um and then if you're interested in that could also work solo and then week four is kind of like wrapping up those projects um or deciding what the next steps would look like if they are going to be longer term um helping to construct portfolios and so on if that's interesting and then the uh the last piece of it would be thinking about how to set Folks up in this cohort for whatever future opportunities might be interesting to to you so whether that's looking for Grants to continue the work that you were sort of doing during the program or like finding new brand opportunities whether it's looking for full-time opportunities in the fbm or you know like sort of that General ecosystem or other ecosystems or like finding teammates to continue working on exciting projects with uh this is a little bit of just today how we are Imagining the weekly structure will um what kind of look so there's we've planned basically a live session uh every weekday and there will be some amount of async work as well um pretty much every every day although a lot of this will kind of be at your own pace um the non-life sessions at least every week we'll sort of have a project assignment as I mentioned and then you know we're trying to introduce other other sessions to make this like you know like fun and Expanding Horizons in terms of thinking about opportunities and run through more broadly so we're planning on doing weekly guest speakers who are all gonna like all amazing humans and also giving cohort members sort of like private AMA sessions and so on with those speakers um also doing like small group sessions so that we can really start to build um that like Network and Community within cohort mates um some of the types of live sessions that we are planning on organizing include live coding sessions lectures on many different topics sort of government by the theme of the week and then a number of different like deep Dives which we will we'll you know be happy to sort of organize and schedule based on interest but these are some of the topics that folks have already mentioned being interested in that we're planning on covering um and then also just throughout you know the program we are really here to basically support we're doing this because we want to see how we can help set people up for really amazing careers in web3 um and so there will be numerous opportunities to kind of uh get feedback and mentorship from uh from the folks who are running this program and also others within the ecosystem and as I mentioned you know we're working to identify projects and grant opportunities for folks to kind of pick up during the program as well so you sort of get that like real life experience a little bit um this is the current uh group of folks that is organizing the fellowship um and it's myself Rohan and Steph um all really friendly people and um yeah excited for you to meet them if you decide to participate in the program and that's pretty much it if you have any questions feel free to email us or you know DM us on Twitter and the website is fellowship.redius.space and you can take a look and apply if you're interested thank you amazing thank you Puja um it sounds really exciting and I mean also like a perfect segue from like if you hack this weekend and really like what you see and want to keep going and um this seems like an awesome way to sort of take that that deep dive and go through like a really rigorous experience and maybe at the end of it it probably will be life-changing for some of these people so I'm really excited to uh to hear that and I'm glad that we talked about this at the hackathon um I think it's perfect perfect timing
