foreign ERS of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to pragma the goal of pragmine is to open up what's happening in this space to even a wider audience in Waterloo is I think a hub of a Canadian computer science right that's uh a university where there's just a lot of um you know really great and you know Frontier research happening it's amazing to be in Waterloo I went to University here it's also where crypto kitties was born and you know I was obviously one of our first big projects in and what kicked off all of dapper Labs so it's really exciting to be here almost exactly six years after we started the whole thing before soccer time we did one project specifically stood out you may know this as cryptokitties and when we're coming back here after all this time grabbing sites announced that we have purchased a crypto Kitty for everybody here and it's now in all of your wallets it was a very intimate space and you really got to feel like you're in the same room with some of the speakers especially enjoyed metallics talks foreign Hawk I thought it was a great way to start the conference and it was really gratifying to see all the other teams building amazing things in the ecosystem the AP 1559 and the merge together they massively reduced like users experience confirmation times like for me they reduced it from like this weird thing that's between two minutes and an hour to just reliably being able to get stuff confirmed in 12 seconds it's actually something we've been working on for over two years it's called Problem protocol and what I presented on stage was the first live demo of our test net we're here at Waterloo to actually announce a new product feature that we're going to be offering called tally swaps powered by cow Swap and this allows Dallas to do on-chain Mev proof swaps for tokens so it's very transparent you don't have any trust requirements and it's all on-chain natively [Music] love Innovation Community like regenerative projects and so kind of what I'm trying to bring into the web 3 ecosystem is like converging all of my passions through building cool projects and meeting cool people for us we're starting to open up Quest creation to everyone so we believe that in decentralization we want to have a permissionless protocol where anyone can send in receive quests just like anyone can send and receive emails so we think quests are a way for protocols to assign work for anyone to assign work in a decentralized context the end goal of this is that we want to populate empty worlds there's so many of these metaverses autonomous worlds that are very empty they're ghost towns and we believe that it's going to be a factor of humans and NPCs playing around in these digital worlds and giving life to it [Music] I think the most important thing I always want to get across when people hear me talk is that we're just started on this technology that you know there's there's no way in which we've figured out all of the interesting use cases that this technology can be used for by now there's just so much more to discover and I just want to encourage everyone and get everyone excited about the idea of finding new use cases and not just leaning on and recreating what we've seen before I don't know
