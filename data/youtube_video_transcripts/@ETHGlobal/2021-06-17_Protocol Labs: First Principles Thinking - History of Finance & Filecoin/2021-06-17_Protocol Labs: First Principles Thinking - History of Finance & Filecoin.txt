all right thanks everybody for joining us today um here with protocol lab uh we will be exploring first principle thinking history of finance defy and file coin with zx sun and um if you have any questions please post them in the chat here and after the talk you can join the sponsor discord channel with critical lab where zx will be bringing able to attend more of your question if needed and on this note i'll let you introduce yourself and take it away hey thank you catherine let me uh share my screen first great let's see can we all see it yes it's all good great awesome thank you hi everyone my name is zx i'm very excited to be here at hack money um i am a lead crypto economics lab at protocol labs and today i'm very excited to talk about uh first principle thinking history of finance d5 and falcon i want it to be i want to share some kind of mental model to how we think about new application new use cases new protocols as we enter this hackathon and and hopefully there are some like new ideas and opportunities that we get to explore um during the hackathon from this talk before we start i want to just have a quick advertisement about my lab crypto economics lab is hiring we really work on crypto economy is a pretty young and emerging field and then we work on at the intersection of like network science statistics game theory resource allocation or graph algorithm market design also institutional economics and governance and then we are really hiring for these three roles data scientists political engineer research scientists so we hope to do like research in this like pretty push the boundary forward in terms of our understanding of crypto economics and and emerging uh emerging markets and then we get a prototype and build many of these new interactions and and we have the capacity to really understand analyze data from live networks so if you're interested check out our website feel free to apply and with that um with that let's get started so why first principle thinking so um i think we are in a very um fortunate space that we get to define many of this new protocol new interaction new foundation of many of these new networks first principle thinking really is about breaking down problems and observation into these like fundamental building blocks and we better reassemble them into base uh reassemble new possibilities based on our goals right like if it kind of requires us to ask what are the assumptions and and what is the what is the fundamental thing that is really driving these changes and i think like a lot of the social norms and rules that we are very accustomed to today they are kind of from over the years right they are not where they are today um just like out of thin air right it's all context and path dependent sometimes we might get boxed into a certain way of interact interacting with certain things uh unless really drill down deep into what is the what is the goal what is fundamental uh thing that something is doing and how can we assemble new interaction while the new building blocks that we have at our disposal and as we build really as we build this infrastructure uh for both like social technological and financial networks i think having really solid reasoning goes a super long way and so far at least in the case of like crypto economics of foul point it has been really useful for us um in reasoning in in coming up with new designs and reasoning about the dynamics and uh help us to design like new networks and protocols and the next question here is like okay so why do we care about history of finance well but i feel like at tech money i kind of feel obliged at least uh sometime time talking about history of finance but of course i'm not a financial historian or economic historian uh it has just been something that really fascinates me so i hope to share that with you and and as we um hack on the next generation of finance and money we get to look back and see how things has evolved right like what problems are financed off uh what's the trajectory and why is it useful and and that hopefully give us some answer about what's next what's the mention right like um maybe maybe on this talk the takeaway is oh like it's actually all made by humans and we are really fortunate we are the onset of charting the next chapter in history that that's a pretty valid outcome as well so overall that's the goal um to talk about financial history understanding my first principles and then i want to talk about how d5 and falcon really go hand in hand and how can and there's so many new opportunities that's possible at the intersection of like d5 and falcoin um so brief so uh one more thing right like finance is a really broad topic right like it's uh history of finance can mean many many different things so it's pretty much unrealistic to cover that all in a 30-minute talk so i'm going to do something really brief and rather um just scratching the surface to talk about different kinds of markets different kinds of structure mechanism how when they first appeared what are they used for and what some of the milestones in that development so first is all of the credit and debt right these are the earliest form of finance and extra pretty much uh early human history and the big part of credit really reduces transaction costs and creates this economic expansion like we saw example when like um in ireland of yap i believe where people transact with like rhinestones where like those really big white stone people just basically mark the the record of transaction instead of really carrying the the coin and and then a straight extended merchant banks and credit network were developed around the world basically a different uh different boom and by cycles to really facilitate this transaction and provide liquidity and that is a key thing of like credit and in the modern world access to credit has been really powerful for social mobility as evident in many of the micro loans experiment that people have pioneered insurance right there um insurance not a big part um it also took form in a very early um human history and different kind of community whether they are abused co-ops merchants uh military even i think the real thing here is like the risk and uncertainty in the real life can be really daunting and how do we really pull together and mitigate individual risk exposure and i think like as we have seen today like we have various kinds of instruments it's pretty much like in every aspect of our life and then bond which is one of the largest market in finance um well rather it's largest market in finance um actually one of the largest market in finance um so there are different phases and it really started off with raising money to fund wars um and and even though like that's no longer the case today but that the whole structure of bond has kind of um persists right like you really defer by the few parameters in terms of principle maturity yield coupon and quality and then you have different ways of really distributing calculating the yield distributing the coupon and then there's different underlying and so on and so forth in terms of equity and stock where equity really started formally in the public traded form uh in early 1600's when c voyages and explanation in the new of the new world is at its prime right like uh back in the day it was a really high risk venture to really do this kind of exploration but it's also very high return so um dutch is in their company issue um issue this like first public traded uh equity of their company to really shoulder the risk and also allow like individual investors to uh to share the return and that became really popular and then there are many boom and buzz cycle of the stock market i'm sure people have heard of them and then in the late 1700s um this is like 24 brokers came together to sign an agreement which later then became the new york stock exchange this is quite interesting uh in some way if you look at if you put up a web three lens it's like oh 24 uh crypto bros came together um enter into some kind of dial structure with some kind of governance um kind of constitution of some kind of agreement that govern how this style this market should work and then as the iterate then they then formalize that into a new york star exchange and then um in i think in the 1970s electronic trading really um really turbocharged this whole like the trading space by using electronic training platforms and settlements and that creates a whole new different kinds of market that we see today uh in equity and then we just also derivative the first i recorded it is actually back in ancient greece which is also very interesting where the philosopher is speculating on the price of olive oil so i'm i guess like this philosophy also enjoy you farming today in the d violin and also broadly speaking durative our contract that really derived value from underlying and then they are mostly used for hedging and speculation as a fun fact mcdonald treated another may not have existed if if not for discounted contract that allow business operation to really hash manage the risk of like price volatility risk which we do see a lot in crypto markets today which i'll go about which we'll talk about again and later part of my talk commodity is another one uh it first appeared like pretty early and then people started like setting like standardized contract that would be the problem with they'll be delivered and this kind of foreign contract similar to the uh soil soy and corn future that was used in the mcdonald case we're really used to as a hedging and speculation instrument as the global global trade extended and then uh chicago board of trade was founded later on and decorated futures country that created extreme traded futures and what that does is really bring standardization on product variation and that brings a ton of liquidity to the whole commodity market so take away so far right like um as with my a rather cursory kind of like overview of the history of finance i think it's financial history is almost as long as human history and it's always evolving with new markets new instruments and new theories right and then many of these are catalyzed we're catalyzed by technological improvement or events human history and really it's that uncertainty in real life as a business owner uh or as like an individual as a participate uh in in various economies that uncertainty it's it's scary and then like we want to able to find ways to be able to manage that risk and that's the core value prop of finance brings to the table uh i think there are some repeating themes here they are managing risk reducing uncertainty facilitating transaction providing liquidity and also price discovery and speculation so then if you look at d5 as like a new frontier and what are the new building blocks that we really bring to the table right like i think like permissionless and verifiable markets and being able to decompose them into many primitives and i think one big um powerful tool that we have here is that the descriptive economic incentive and mechanism that allow us to create and or incentivize the formation of a network of a market uh very quickly so then the natural question is uh what so we are familiar with some existing uh protocols that we have in d5 and how do we find new inspiration new use cases as we collectively push the boundary forward and i i and that's this is where like um how my goal for the talk is that we have this mental model of like okay so how finance has evolved so far and then a lot of building blocks that we have on the table what did we really bring and are we making any assumption in some of the previous financial structure that we have seen can we really challenge our assumption and then define some entire define entirely new interactions and that's my kind of my firm belief i think for web3 to win right it really is about new interactions new business models and new markets and and apart from that there's also this part about how do we empower traditional businesses or empower web to businesses to make them um um to to make blockchain really mainstream and then i really want and this gives you this segue to talk about follow coin uh falcoin from my point of view it's really uniquely positioned to support both web 2 and web 3 use cases and make blockchain mainstream useful to empower traditional businesses with the power blockchain but however uh and also first principle thinking was applied uh to navigate this whole design space and that uh design constraint space as we design crypto economics of alcohol um right and then so what is style coin so falcon can be thought of as an airbnb for cloud services but it's also more than that so let's let's do a recap on what is filecoin then i will talk about how how it relates to d5 and what are different financial services that's possible and then we go through some of the ideas that i some of the pretty high level ideas that i have so um this is a pretty common um this is a pretty common uh mental model we think of it as the file coin storage export economy right where you have like these are the participants in the network in the economy you have researcher developing algorithms and then you have minors amassing different kinds of resources by storage data centers compute and they have developer building a building on the raw material to really improve the storage experience to build applications uh tooling and so on and also define new experiences that the world has not seen before and then because all storage requires collateral you have token holders providing collateral for these miners and the miners exchange these goods and services with clients through falco and the overall goal of the storage expo economy is to really attract more potential clients and participants into the ecosystem so when we think about using uh storage on filecoin people are using storage provided by miners on filecoin when you think about using services they're using services built by developers on filecoin the protocol itself cares about a very specific thing which is like is the storage reliable it produces like um it produces like a periodic proof that the source is indeed uh reliable and being uh and and verifiable so it's really multifaceted it's a utility token right like um some kind of uh token uh some falcon will be spent whenever someone uses a network it's a platform economy it's a protocol it's blockchain network it's also a community and economy and ecosystem is always evolving right just like any other economy that we see so um here are some key crypto economic uh mechanisms within foul coin right i will try to explain some of the first principle thinking here and how and the overall goal for the network and the crypto economic is really to incentivize reliable and useful storage right um and then there are five key mechanisms first one is token minting and the goal here really is to align minor meeting curves to network utility i would talk about pretty high level what token minting is on file point there are two uh maintain curve one is called the baseline minting the other one is the simple maintaining symbol minting is just a simple exponential decay baseline meaning it's kind of like a kpi driven kind of minting curve and when we when we look at this uh we look at historically what the traditional blockchain network when you do the minting it's pretty much just time-dependent that creates pretty bad incentive right because you mean the most tokens when that was at least mature and then like um um and the damn academic or create strong enough incentives for participants they're joining the network later on right and we and and however we keep both because the simple meeting in the bitcoin style it just basically means on a fixed schedule a fixed amount right that creates a counter balance in the events of shock so that's why you want to have you want to have the good parts from the simple maintaining at the same time you also define a kpi right now the kpi is close to three extra buy starting from genesis and growing and double every year so for the falcon network to reach its maximum meeting potential it needs to reach that one yota by 20 years so there's this combination of a kpi driven kind of minting and also this time dependent to provide counterbalance to shocks that goes into the token meaning curve to um to create this uh to create this incentive alignment with network utility and we're using the size of network as a proxy of the network utility next one is token investing right like all block rewards um the goal here is really to align stakeholder with the long-term behavior of the network right all stakeholders have some form of masking in since genesis and all the blood rewards 25 of that is immediately available to fighters to provide cash flow liquidity and 75 of that will go through a six-year linear investing period right so and this 25-75 is not random right we did lots of analysis to understand what's the impact right we want to provide liquidity to minor because that's really key to the profitability and operation of the mining business but at the same time we want to make sure that miners are aligned with the network in the long term right and as they earn rewards there's a big problem the major there is always a big proportion that rests over six months so that also makes falcon miners slightly less sensitive to short-term price movement because people are uh when they choose to mile on foul point they opt in to be at least a medium term to long-term align with the network and be um and be a believer in the potential of the network collateral and slashing um this is to align participants with the reliability of uh storage so um collaterals have two purposes one is consensus security and the one the other one is uh storage reliability um so for you to mine firepoint it requires you to pull up some collateral for the storage collapse for the storage collateral that is expected 20 days of block reward that is also not random right like uh we don't want that to be too high to be a deterrent to mining but that should be substantial such that people have might have a very strong incentive to maintain the data on the network uh next we have five coin plus which is a pretty groundbreaking thing in all crypto and or institutional um economics and governance it aligns participants with uh useful storage by adding a social consensus layer on top of the purely resource-driven network so it's a decentralized um kind of dial structure where where you have a decentralized network of notaries that brings in clients uh they're very that notarized clients and then miners who store the deals from this client get a 10x in their storage power which increases the chance of them winning more block rewards um we will talk more about this in in a moment as well but this creates a strong incentive to towards like servicing like useful data useful deals on the firepoint network and then lastly narrow transaction fees uh we adopted ethereum's eip1559 so this aligned token supply rate of network usage where like every and and the basically really is the reflection of the supply and demand of using the network so so far i think right now the protocol has more than i think 83 million five point block in collateral um and then it has burned more than 26 million five coin uh in uh you know transaction fees but all you know right like uh given that i think the economic is set up to um to really align the participant with reliable and useful story to really make blockchain useful right we talk about web to interaction when somebody wants to store something um they can find a minor that stores them um or the web through interaction where we define these kind of new experiences and so on but the volatility of cryptocurrency market can still be daunting for average users and even for miners right because they are running a operation so this is where we can come in and i hope to suggest some of these ideas um that we can explore during this hackathon so the first one matching uh with stuff on credit right i think falcon loan is a big one right like loans are useful in shooting miners from token price volatility and also provide this return to token holders or lenders right and then we can also explore collateral free loans which are some kind of some form of credit they'll be very meaningful for new miners under represented region to get started and as mentioned receivable receivable financing block rewards uh linearly invest over six months right so this is basically very similar in uh in traditional um supply chain where you have this uh account receivable then you can do financing on that to provide liquidity and improve cash flow payment and insurance right uh payment bridges for clients is a pretty common misconception that client may when they use filecoin they might need to rather the token validate the risk of powerpoint that's not the case because clients and miners can agree on deals denominated in fiat and then clients can convert these currencies other currencies they like into falcon and then clients will no longer have exposure to the token price volatility and storage and minor insurances as mentioned um there's collateral and slashing right like all the collateral most of the cloud of the miner put up uh are subject to slashing throughout the lifetime of the sector uh throughout the lifetime of the binding process so they have a very strong incentive to make sure the storage is reliable but then again right what if it's there's always some unlucky event that might happen so that will incur penalty and this is the way the insurance may come in and then clients and lenders right they may also want to ensure against the default risk or the credit risk of miners this is where installed insurance contract can be explored next up we have financialization of data we talked about that in the last global events a big part here is like data boundaries right like you can have so we uh we can check out that talk for more detail but the high level is a falcon brings lots of scale to distributed storage and there's also verify there's also a verifiable proof on the storage on the periodic basis so we can then create we can then bridge that with like different like smart contract platform and then build different kind of like smart contract logic right so then you can see like smart contract putting together funds um as a bounty for the storage of particular cid cid is an id of content that's stored on ipfs flash filecoin network and the funds only get paid off when there's a proof that it has indeed been stored and that's an extension of the data boundaries you can have data valves other forms of way or we or sometimes we call them a smart data supply chain right like you can have this style organization workflows being formed around data that people cares about care about and their members can join by proving that they have stored this piece of data or copy of the data or to they've pool and then like data tokens all these other stuff will be a natural next step as well uh next we have derivative right like i think us never matures as it's useful to define different grades of storage services as we see in the commodity markets right for clients to trade or consume um to have an easier time trading and consume different kinds of storage and then if you can have some kind of like verifiable delivery then you can have storage futures which people can then trace different grades of storage that are coming online in the future there's also price discovery so while right now people are building different kinds of uh multiple airbnbs and dropboxes on filecoin to do like client minor matching right it's also quite it'll be also quite interesting to explore how can we match storage demand and supply in a decentralized way and also uh storage deal options right like right now miners are very strongly incentivized to take five plus yields and many are very many are willing to pay clients for using firewall which is quite amazing if you look uh if you look at overall crypto all the other crypto other crypto networks and however it's kind of unclear uh how much are we willing to pay as a community to bring clients onto powerpoint right so there is some kind of price discovery that can be explored here as well so some key takeaways here of of a presentation um so far um financial history is really closely related to human history right like and it's really in shape by technological improvement in historical events and if you look and if you look back there are many moments in time where individuals organizations come together to define new standards new ways of doing things and we are really fortunate because we have so many toolboxes uh so many tools at our dispersed disposal to really define new experiences and their financial services are really useful in managing risk providing liquidity and enabling practice price and salary so um and and the rise of um and the rise of financial services in the in the real world really match with the rise of human as a civilization and i believe the rise of financial services on foul point could also be key to the rise of coins as a useful storage economy and there's a ton of potential here at the intersection of d5 and filecoin that i really invite everybody to check out and uh lastly uh online venture just announced falcon basecamp right at the end of our hackathon i highly encourage everyone to apply to basecamp to really take our ideas and projects to the next level and then we'll be able to iterate on business model and go to market and many many other aspects of business and lastly happy hacking feel free to reach out to me on twitter or discord and i think now we can answer some questions if you have time oh we have three minutes so it's perfect for some quick questions yeah definitely feel free to jump in or post in the chat if you have anything let me quickly check on youtube yeah so there's a question yeah there's a question about um about able to ensure data availability and integrity so um well depending on the context here but just to be just uh the falcon protocol ensures that there is approved of the storage right like um that you can basically check for each but uh when as a client when you use the service of a miner it's really like a kind of a one-to-one relationship right like uh that really depends on the miners uh service sla right like i think there's lots of room to build this kind of airbnb like services on power file coin to provide a better ui experience for clients and there are many uh i believe there are many clients looking to use file coin but i think it's kind of that there's lots of huddles to jump through as it is today to find the right miners even though there are many people building different kinds of tools so the short answer is like um it's not really on a protocol level right it really is like on the minor and client kind of level and miners are strongly incentivized given the rise of different reputation system to provide a higher tier of service next question any resources for file video streaming or ipfs or falcoin i believe i think there is some work with video coin life here um and then there's also i think huddle was doing some kind of videos like video conferencing on ipfs i think there's lots of room there of a building new business model as well right like we stream videos and then we encapsulate them into like um into nfts into other different kinds of token create new incentive we're gonna bring more content onto web3 uh the question from youtube what about the filecoin wallet i'm not sure what default wallet is there are like many teams building different wallets um that comply to the protocol standards thank you um great thanks so uh someone else on youtube was asking where to join us so you can join the um well the file coin uh discord channel itself or in the e global event you i can definitely as a hacker you can definitely join uh or even not as a hacker there's a lot more global economy global community and there's a private event uh for hack money where you can join and um just take part of the sponsored channel if you'd like so you can engage in the conversation there great and there's also falcons there i think the entry point should be on the website um let us know if you can't find it or i think someone from the community can help you as well awesome thank you so much for this great uh presentation zx i really appreciate it uh thanks everyone for joining uh i hope you have a wonderful hacking a couple weeks
