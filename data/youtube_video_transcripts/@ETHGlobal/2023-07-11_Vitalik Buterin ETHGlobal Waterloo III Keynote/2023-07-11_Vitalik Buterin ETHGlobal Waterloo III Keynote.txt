foreign [Music] information about who's coming here and what they're excited about we realize that there's a lot of you who are just getting into the space and wanted to understand what could be possible so to make sense all of that we decided to do a really interesting talk we're going to spend is I'm going to invite metallic here on stage to tell you about what are the possible ideas that you can think of not just yeah there you go we're going to focus the next 30 minutes on things that you should think about building in the space where we see there's a lot of progress that could be made a lot of things that could be made better and things that are just not getting the attention we'd like to get and all of that should help you get some ideas for your hackathon projects and hopefully even other bigger projects that can turn into more than just side projects so without further Ado please welcome vitalik on stage okay braids hello everyone so today's um I wanted to give a talk about some things that I've you know talked about in the various contexts some over the last year or so but basically the focus is on like what kinds of things really does it make sense to start working on right now and you know what kinds of things are actually really accessible to people that are like just getting into the space right now um so then the big picture to me is that ethereum has two decades basically the last 10 years are solving problems in theory right so a lot of discussion around switching for proof of work to proof of stake a lot of discussion around uh improving scalability a lot of discussion around look solving privacy problems around you know improving security various other things um but you know it was still fairly theoretical the number of people actually using you know the blockchain is fairly small for most of this period but then the next decade is uh needs to be a much more of a focus on you know it's solving like very concrete problems that people in the real world have so there are many of you very many users of uh ethereum crypto all of these things already today right um but I think the way that it looks to be is that in many places very few people have found a use for ethereum or other blockchains aside from Trading digital monkeys in many places very many people have found uses for it but they're largely using centralized exchanges um so um just uh telling a story uh this is this picture um minus the anonymous masks to protect other people's privacy is from my trip to Argentina back in uh 2021 and I remember visiting and I remember just seeing the really sewage ethereum Community you know crypto Community more General developer Community um just the sheer number of people using East uh Middle School years in all kinds of cryptocurrencies to save money uh because which is actually a really big need for them because of the currency situation in the country and even people just accepting it for payments right like I just randomly walked into a coffee shop and it just happens the guy just happens to you know know a lot of things about cryptocurrency happens to have a binance wallet and I asked like hey can we pay with Ethan he said sure um so what huge amounts of adoption but there's a catch and the catch is that even though there's a huge amount of crypto adoption a lot of it is like actually Finance wallet adoption right so basically yeah there are lots of people who are using no posts ethereum and other crypto things they're actually using it through a centralized intermediary now why are they doing this right so sexualized exchanges are cheap meaning if you want to just uh you know send someone money inside one of these a centralized system you have zero fees it's convenient um in particular payments are instant binance to buy this transfers instant um when I paid Elders in ethereum wallet um it the transaction took I think something like two to five minutes to confirm um and no this is actually something where we have made some improvements right so who here has a used ethereum before 2001 me um cord here is used to theorem in the last six months um possibly has noticed how like the it has become somehow much easier to get transactions reliably confirmed quickly this has happened because of two protocol changes one of them is something called eip1559 which is this uh very kind of weird economic technocratic thing that has a lot of interesting math behind it um but the basic thing that it does is it changes the fee market so that instead of requiring a fixed amount of transactions at every block I mean the blocks are allowed to be like bigger and smaller and I kind of adjusted to be very short-term changes in demand right and instead of keeping a constant block size the protocol keeps a at a constant transaction fee or What's called the base T within a block and that adjusts um over time right so because of this instead of a transaction taking some random amount of time that's after minutes a transaction can be encoded in you know about one or two blocks and then what the merge did is as a weird byproduct of statistics and the difference between personal distributions getting a block every 12 seconds it turns out that the average amount of time you have to wait until your transaction which gets included into a block is divided by divided by two it's only half as much so if everyone here is in math uh proof assignments prove it uh due date 72 hours from now go um but the point so like ethereum has made a lot of strides on this question already actually but when I was in um Argentina at the time efp was abortion had not yet happened ep-1559 had happened but the wallet I was using did not yet support it and now that what it actually does support it right so the choice exchanges are cheap convenience protect the user from mistakes um you know if you screw up you can go to talk to the aircraft that were service maybe kyc again and say you'll get your money back with ethereum wallets that's something that at least was a status quo you're not really able to do you know you have your 12 word seed phrase and if you lose your 12 word seed phrase you're screwed if someone else takes a photo of your tall word seed phrase congrats they have all your money right so centralized exchanges don't really have these issues now there's a darker side to centralize exchanges right um could you recognizes some of the people in this photo yes right so centralized exchanges are you know also sometimes you know not very yeah trustworthy uh they you know do stuff and uh sometimes they decide that they're better at having fun with your money than you are okay thank you okay so how do but basically um you know there's a we're seeing this is a cube you know a space that is all about decentralization what is decentralization it is we are Building Systems where you cannot be rockfold right now there's many kinds of uh of of being a rock fall to there is you know having all all of your money is stolen from you there is being walked out of a PayPal accounts and and them holding your money for 180 days with no recourse there is being locked out of a social media platform without no recourse you know there's all kinds of rock pulling that that happens right and you know in a desert centralized system you're supposed to have you know programmatic rules that are transparent that kind of describe the process as under which I mean like things happen in whatever application you're participating in right and it's a nice stream and it's a good and you know it's uh good to you know try to put more control and power back in the hands of you know users and communities as opposed to these I know far away centralized actors but there are challenges right so I've got I am I think some of these challenges are kind of you know the fundamental philosophical challenges but some of these challenges I think people don't appreciate the extents to which they are technical problems so it can be technically solved they just haven't been properly technically solved yet right so one is scalability and fees right so when I get paid um at the that coffee shop in Buenos Aires the transaction fee was like something around three or four dollars right if it was a binance to finance transfer it would be zero dollars now back in 2013 I remember there was this movement that was really trying hard to get people to accept Bitcoin as a consumer Merchant payment mechanism you know just for people to like pay for pay in restaurants paying coffee shops in Berlin there was even these districts at kreuzberg where people made this movements to convince a huge amount of restaurants in one region a two start accepting Bitcoin this was called the Bitcoin keys I actually let's do a couple of uh of these places back in the day there was a a burger place there was this nice vegan restaurant there were a couple other ones and there was this like really lovely movement but then that died down over time why did it die down basically it's just transaction fees right back in 2013 the main pitch for why you're supposed to accept Bitcoin instead of accepting credit cards is like well minimum a credit cards charge what 2.9 percent on every transaction right actually PayPal charges 2.9 percent on every transaction for international payments PayPal actually charges 2.9 plus 3.9 percent plus more on uh no foreign exchange fees it might have changed it might have changed since then I actually don't know rainbow this was like B pitch back then and it was true back then and the problem is that like well you know the whole fees being low staying basically stopped being true right um so these you know that's a deal breaker right like lots of applications that are totally fine and that make a huge amount of sense if the transaction fee is negligible stop being true if the transaction fee is 8.43 um or here is interested in as using alternatives to sweater sweaters or here would be interested in using alternatives to Twitter ifs registering your accounts on that alternative costs 8.43 um 69.12 um it's 384.41 cents okay so you know we got some True Believers which is good right but you know the point is that like these are kind of a boring topic but they will are like they are eight killer of things that otherwise would be extremely promising and I think the corollary of that which is really powerful is that people should not assume a category of applications has failed just because it has failed in an environment where setting everything anything up costs eight dollars and 31 cents uh problem number three um privacy um here just allows the idea of broadcasting to all their friends and future friends and family and and the government answer every company um what exactly who they're making what kinds of payments do okay we got some True Believers which is good but you know privacy is valuable right so the other challenge just kind of making all of these happen while keeping ethereum recognizable ethereum right so what I mean by this is that there's lots of different groups in ethereum that are building lots of different stuff and that's good that's beautiful we have an open ecosystem it's you know we have lots of groups operating independently and it's possible for new people to come in and start building independently without asking for permission without you know you don't have to apply for an API achieved um but um one of the challenges is that there's you know there is the possibility that like things end up branching off into totally separate systems that don't really yet kind of intersect with each other and that look very different and that have very different properties from what already exists right so good scaling is being able to do what you do now uh but paying uh 10 or 100 times lower transaction fees bad scaling is when you know you have some totally new thing and people tell you tada this is ethereum this scales but it just looks like a totally different thing and if your friends turn out to have used a different way of scaling ethereum if you're not compatible with him and there's no way till it move between these things and it's like not clear what the properties of these these things are and it just turns into a massive confusion right so there's also a challenge here which is like more like a coordination challenge right which is that like actually yeah you know making sure that all of these uh different pieces the scalability pieces the account security pieces the Privacy pieces actually work together with each other right and this is difficult right but this is um something that I think we can start moving towards so one concrete example what's who here wants to build a wallet what would serve fund you know um so in the previous decade of ethereum it was enough for a wallet to just support sending people each um you know pause showing your QR codes so other people could send you eat it and you know possibly yeah you know logging into a a Mini web browser so you could go access some depths right in the future this is not going to be enough for a wallet right a wallet that make actually makes sense in a post-scalability world is a wallet that needs to support the ethereum lawyer one and also at least all of the major layer 2 protocols that are being built on top of ethereum crossover 2 transfers need to be built in if I have all of my money on optimism and you have an account that's uh or you want your money on arbitrum then like I should be able to click Send and that should automatically route my money through some kind of you know cross lawyer to exchange protocol so so that it gets to you good and like this is something that should happen automatically this is something that like you should not have to go and you know personally fumble yourself and like figure out what hopdod exchange is and how to use it it should all be middle behavior that just happens as part of the sense but a way for recipients to express how he wants to get paid this is another thing right it seem it's the looking like Azure SS are not going to be at us right an address we know just 20 bytes but 20 but but you know your address where right or if you want to be paid on optimism do you want to be paid on oligon or maybe you're happy being paid on uh you know aziki sick and Kakarot and polygon but someone else has coins on Kakarot and scroll and arbitrum and you know it turns out the polygon is the intersection and then you just make a direct transfer there right like this is the sort of stuff that you just need to do right and this is the sort of stuff that what tradfy does under the uh a lot under the hood right like who here has used the credit card reader internationally right like there's a lot of DC though like under the Holy Cross exchange protocols going glad and you know realistically cross lawyer to ethereum has to do the same sort of stuff right now the nice thing about this kind of project is that you don't have to invent your own cryptography to do it right you don't have to like build your own fake thing from scratch all you have to do is just like hook together a couple of protocols that already exist right you just have to you know hook together existing tools for accessing Optimus and existing tools for accessing you know a CK SEC and you you want to um you know okay in hop protocol possibly a couple of other routing protocols have the possibility of adding more route more routing protocols in the future and you know like have a sent button that kind of puts a bunch of actually yeah no route stinks correctly it possibly create your own um you know format for how to provide the information of where you want to get paid and then if people like it then you go at that you know two months later you might end up making your own ERC uh so you know it's uh like actually I think within a range for a yeah for a hackathon team but like this is a like this type of stuff is the sort of thing that I think we need more of another while a challenge um social recovery and multi-sig so if you just actually if you just go to my blog vitalworks.ca and if you just like control F for social recovery you can find like this is incredibly long post I wrote on the topic but basically the kind of sub worry of this idea is that an existing ways of doing wallets are just incredibly insecure right so you know most wallets are what's called eoas externally owned accounts there are accounts that are controlled by a private key right the reason they're called externally owned is because other types of accounts are controlled by a piece of code which is part of ethereated right so the problem with EOS is they're controlled by a single key and if you lose that key you're screwed if someone else steals that key you're screwed if you make multiple backups of your key to reduce the chance that you're going to lose the key that increases the chance that someone's get a steer you right so you know it's actually like it's actually not a very good design for a huge number or like a number of people right I mean honestly it's not even sufficient for me right like I keep my body and diagonal multi-6 so what is a multi-sig it's a wallet where there's multiple keys and you need some portion of the keys to move the body um social recovery is a kind of a closely related concept basically you have a wallet that has one key but there is a set of backup keys that are going to be owned by other people and that set of backup keys has the ability to change the main key if you lose it right so social recovery protects only for us not ideal stuffed multi-safe for attacks against the loss and theft the advantage of social recovery is just because they only need one um key it's a signed transactions normally it's easier right so social recovery is good for like a hot wallet um and uh multisig is good for like a cold wallet right like multisig is great for you know storing your life savings for example but you don't want to store your life savings in something where you know the stuff that's needed to to just to drain all of your money away sits on one device right so making a wallet that's like actually good at supporting this and then privacy so privacy is also an important Challenge and uh don't want to get into this it's detail but there's a lot of like really fast privacy technology that's uh really that's really worth worrying so identity right so EMS on Layer Two was happening right um so yeah that's over here has a DOT yay so it's like uh you know a big part of the the emerging ethereum identity layer right if you want to have a name and you want that name to be decentralized until it really because you would like you and not so to be dependent on some other entity then let me know ens decentralized system on top of ethereum it is the way to do it now one of the problems was he had asked is that it's expensive right now there is the registration fees or easy eight dollars a month and that's about as large as you know regular dnsds but there is also transaction fees right so the last time I did sub-operate an operation uh to adjust uh do something with my ens I think the last thing I did was that when I published a new blog post and because my blog is a year it's ipfs I am you know use it I need to like actually update the itfs record inside of the contract on ens which contains the ibfs hash and that's a transaction and I think that cost me about eight dollars right so now what if transaction fees go up play a factor of 10 so like what they were last year or two years ago right then that transaction fee of eight dollars is going to be a transaction fee of 80 right so enes and layer 1 is expensive and may get more expensive ens on layer 2 is the solution right we want people we're doing Layer Two is where it's users are scaling but we want ethereum to like what we want applications that people actually use to actually benefit from the scaling right and there's like lots of hidden assumptions throughout the ethereum ecosystem that kind of assume that you're only your one and if we want people to actually benefit from way or two scaling then we kind of really need to start breaking down those assumptions and we need to start looking at the important applications and basically seeing you know what how do we make the Warrior 2 fredly so this is a screenshot from something called on opsynames.xyz and this is built on a protocol called CC IV what this does is basically you have a smart contract on layer one which owns the domain ecc.in and then that contract has a logistics that is based on the ccit protocol that basically says if you have a sub domain of ecc.es and you're looking for that sub domain then you can go to this other phase so you can basically check what that subdomain actually is on the optimism now right so instead of doing everything on the layer 1 sub domains of ecc.it all get managed updated created destroyed on optimism and so if you were to have your domain.ec.e updating any records only requires being on optimal sum it does not require any layer 1 transaction and so from a gasty perspective everything is vastly cheaper now this is the Optimus one I I have asked a couple of other twos if they have equivalents and like a couple of weeks ago the answer from the water issues that I asked was not yet but I imagine they will very soon and very possible some others already do which is great right but like this is one example I think of something that is good and that we need more of which is the ecosystem like really actually adapting to layer 2 scaling and making sure the layer 2 scaling actually translates into real benefits for users which is great now other things in ethereum identity right so this is an application called zoo pass um it basically yeah you know it was uh developed at zuzulu which was the sort of experiment in the spring in Montenegro which I mean I would try to basically create a kind of pop-up so there's a mini City that combines you know ethereum and you know zero knowledge techno attack and a couple of other themes um but one of the really interesting things was that of you know this year in knowledge aspects right so this QR code contains AZ kslr it contains a0 knowledge proof right and that's what that zero knowledge proof says is it proves that I am one of the residents uh with uh of uh obviously without revealing which one I am right so this is the in-person uh use case right um and that the universal use cases basically you have this thing on your phone and I mean we have because he has a thing on your phone then uh you basically you could go and you can show it or like you can use this things like this as you know proof that you have the right to enter someplace and without actually yeah you know re revealing your identity and every time and like and letting yourself be tracked everywhere um it's uh the sort of thing that like really ties into kind of a lot of e-government stuff except it allows you to do it without you know compromising privacy which is uh unfortunately the default that a lot of these schemes end up running into um again there's also an online component right there is applications like Zoo pool uh for example which were basically you log in with Zupas and so always there's a little more residents were able to log in and you're able to get one account so you or is you're able to make one vote right it's a polling system anyway to start a full any weighted vote on a poll you're able to make one vote without revealing who you are but at the same time proving that you are illegitimate folder and that you can't make more than one vote right so it's a privacy preserving voting system that is anonymous but at the same time it ensures that the Kremlin can't go and vote 58 200 times so this is um like basically I think there is like a big story here which is that with cryptography we actually do you know have the ability of giving people very high levels of privacy and and anonymity but at the same time you know for basic actually achieving the uh a lot of these you know security gains that you know the sort of pure uh try to achieve you know anonymity by doing no verification at all it's not is not able to achieve right so we can get like more privacy and more security at the same time and this is also kind of we're like part of you know the growing ethereum identity stack um other agastation protocols this is the ethereum attestation service EAS so you can also make off-chain attestations about things and these are real like systems that are increasingly talking to each other right so we have these tools right we have names and names that are becoming cheap we have a growing list of really fascinating ZK tools and growing usability for those EK tools we have option at the stations we have launching at the stations what can we do with all of this one example is uh you can use this technology and decentralized social media platforms right so lots of people want to use the Twitter alternative who here wants to make a Twitter alternative okay no that's good it's actually better not to have too many hands because we don't want to have like you know too many Twitter Alternatives where each one only has like you know 50 people on it and uh you know at some points people just get bored and go back to Elon land um but them you know forecaster exists so lens exist a couple of others exist too and you can like some of these are starting to you know like integrate more and more of these ethereum features right so with wireless I mean we can use your existing ens name forecaster I think is going in the direction of ensens and integration with ccip um and then the other thing you can do is instead of trying to copy Twitter you can try to do some totally new thing designed for new use cases right so one of the concerns that I have with kind of this old Twitter ID approach that everyone is taking is that like it's standard startup advice that if he wants to take make something that like really takes over from an incumbent you can't make something that's 1.1 x better you have to make something that's 10x better you have to like you can't just like appeal to you know sort of you know Niche ideological appeals you have to like create a whole new category of activity right like Facebook did not kill Myspace by copying Myspace um you know Twitter is a not copy Reddit and uh if we want if we think about like what is the biggest you know new social media thing that actually has taken over very recently well I mean realistically it might be Tick Tock right so that's like Tick Tock is not just a different way to put it to yell to a genetic characters and so one other way to think about the social media problem is why Otay let's create something that's web3 native that is decentralized that is that you know has these kind of open and transparent rules that are executed within the software but that is designed for some other use case one interesting Theory natural use case is kind of discussion and governance within communities right so existing CEOs are a good potential user of this and possibly even new communities that wants to kind of turn into you know Community is that years or use various web reads also organize themselves could also be a nice use case um so why um alternatives to opaque centralized mechanisms for some aspects of moderation right so anti-spam proving that you're assuming and not a bot lots of ethereum based reputation stuff that can be used for this already like just having an existing address on chain requires you to have paid a transaction like that's a significant degree of anti-spam already right like okay if you look it so there's this website called buyax.com right it's probably worth just like making a transparents B what b u y accs.com you can go and just like buy Google accounts Twitter accounts and like all kinds of things right and they accept Bitcoin and ease for payments so you know it's uh all great right and the average cost of an accounts on these is like somewhere around six or seven dollars right so like this is what the spammers are paying right and I mean this realistically the spammers have like far better results than any than this right um so if you're in like having a new account on ethereum that is paid transaction feel like right now that's like already you know like better anti-spam than what social media networks or as good against spam as what social media networks are providing right and then on top of that you can look at like do people have you know posts do people have approved some kind of proof of humanity stamp um you know if you want to integrate World coin you know have people scan their eyes like you know I mean my guess my opinion for that is like that should not be mandatory but you know an option why not um if uh people once you know you could use some kind of function over all of the different identity things that people have you can use EAS attestations um with zoo pass you're able to make zero knowledge proofs that prove things about um what based what are called stamps which is kind of a pope or kind of an attestation system that exists within this within the Zupas system like you can prove things you can prove some function over the stamp some what stamps you have um without revealing everything about yourself right so there's like a lot of alternatives for like emc's fam that you can combine together that are like Theory what free native even today reputation like helping users identify you know which accounts are worth listening to and Witcher talents are not serious um you also just another benefit you know the user owning their identity and identity being portable and the connections you make within the yes the system being something that's easily portable if you want to switch to another application better tools to protect against Bad actors while preserving privacy I wrote this um post on privacy preserving applications on xenius and arts about a year ago and one of the really fun ideas you have here is you could have a message board which is anonymous but at the same time enforces a rule that says that each user basically has a limited amount of reputation and if some moderation system which could be anything could be centralized could be decentralized could be down votes could be whatever uh maybe flakes some particular post then you know you lose one point and your accounts can only survive for us for as long as you still have points right so like you don't have to choose between being um you know a totally transparent and being fortunate you can like literally explore every single point along the Spectrum right so a lot of like these very powerful new possibilities become available because of zero knowledge proofs and like eyes yeah you know highly encourage people to try to look at and explore these kinds of things DARS um so What in deal governance is like a really hard problem right like we've had lots of daos but one of the challenges that I see it is uh there's like a lack of originality in terms of like you know thinking about what makes a Dao right like a lot of people have this mentality that like all you do is you create a thing you issue a token you give your friends some of the token they can start selling the Silicon around and then if you have tokens you can vote right and there's like a lot of people who think that this is a Dao right and I have to admit that like I that is totally not what I had in mind when I started thinking about the concepts back in 2013 right so Zao is decentralized autonomous organizations like basically you know organizations that have like ways of ways of organizing people and communities that involve oh you know you know using some kind you know blockchain and smart contract based technology right you know there's like a lot of really powerful things that you can do there but like you really wants to go beyond using coin voting because coin voting is broken in all kinds of ways now first advice of doing Dow governance is like governancy is hard and if you can avoid it then you should probably avoid it so creating Singletons right is hard and it invites political problems as soon as you create a Singleton like as soon as you create a single thing that is logically centralized like even if it's architecturally and politically decentralized if it's like a logically centralized single thing that act that's that looks like an actor then that invites political problems people are going to have expectations about how it's going to act fairly people are going to um you know have complaints about like was the thing set up fairly was that was this community pre-mined still like favor some group of people that I'm not part of right so creating Singleton's is hard invites political problems if he could go without a single sin at all then that's a good idea but sometimes having a single scene is unavoidable right and so try to move Beyond uh token based governance as I've already mentioned token based governance just has all kinds of vulnerabilities all kinds of uh just problems in how it ends up actually working in practice um one I think question you should ask is uh are you decentralizing for robustness or are you decentralizing for efficiency right are you are you defending against internal threats are you defending against external threats and trying to solve for censorship resistance are you trying to decentralize because you want a mechanism that helps more people uh provide input into the decision and by doing that create decisions that are better for everyone are you trying to make a decentralized system because you see that that will be more efficient in some way or decentralization for interoperability right this is a third category you make a decentralized thing so that it can interface better with other decentralized things right if you're making a decentralized protocol you don't want to build it on top of centralized apis therefore if you want to serve other decentralized applications often you have to be decentralized to right so I think it's like always good to look at like which of these reasons for these four decentralizing things you're going for and depending on which one of these you're going for like the kind of governance that you're going to have is often going to look very different right so this is also something that's worth thinking about experimenting with new mechanisms right so quadratic funding is this interesting thing that Glenn Weil and I mostly I mean it was some involvement from me came up with back in 2018 it was really nice um it's this uh kind of sort of democratic sort of market-based way of funding public goods the idea basically is that you have some Central Pool of funding and it serves as a matching fund and if the and it allows other people in the community to donate to projects and the Central Pool of funding matches projects that get donations from other people now the matching Works in this interesting way where basically it uses this clever formula wants to compute the matching where the Practical effects are that smaller contributions get a bigger matching ratios and bigger contributions and everyone's matching ratio is greater if a larger number of distinct people contribute to a project right so things that are actually public goods to a wide group of people get a larger matching ratio than things that only benefit a few people um so this is like a really nice idea and there are like various decentralized academics that are actually building on top of this um or using this as their mechanism there is a CLR fund uh which it uses a zero knowledge proofs to implement this in a privacy preserving way so a lot of really nice nice things happening also retroactive funding so retroactive funding is this idea that like instead of giving grants to people because you think that they are promising and they will do good work you give great you give prizes to people after they've done good work and the idea is that um retroactive funding is uh easier to implement because it's easier to understand what already was good than to understand to try to agree on what will be good in the future and the general idea of this is that if you have a retroactive funding mechanism then you can combine that with an investment ecosystem right like you can basically you know have people actually you know give investments into projects and they too can get rewarded if a project ends up really succeeding against some and gets a very large retroactive payout right or you could have independent developers where if there are multiple different retroactive funding systems in the uh in the ecosystem then they can start working on projects and they know that if they succeed enough then they are going to get uh get some offer of a reward so a lot of interesting stuff happening with retroactive funding optimism has done two rounds of uh retroactive funding so far um and they've done like these very big rounds like the last one I gave out I think about 20 million dollars and it just like gave funding to a whole bunch of projects that like did really good and valuable things to the ecosystem like I think I believe even some amounts of uh funding ended up going to the people who created the ketchak hash function and like it ended up being a pretty substantial Grant right so a lot of like really good experiments happening with that too right so this is kind of this other side of really interesting stuff that you could do with crypto right like you can create these mechanisms to try to you know solve problems that have to do with like things that are actually good you know not like not being rewarded enough and not being able to compete with you know big exchanges offering people you know two and a half million dollars so a lot of like really uh a lot of really amazing opportunities here too right so like yes sir kid collisions right there's lots of valuable stuff happening on ethereum both on the application layer and on infrastructure um there's some of the big themes cross Layer Two privacy continue to work on mechanism design identity ZK things are also much more concrete than they were five years ago right like five years ago there was a lot of like more abstract discussion of like oh this will solve Financial inclusion this will solve Supply chains this will solve fraud and I think the discourse has advanced a lot that is much more like specific applications where like you can't just go you know it's saying Rands and words around and like oh this will make the Asia you know the medical vaccine ecosystem more trusted because we put QR codes on things and like you know you know you have to like actually think and like have things that make sense in the real world and not just like you know the gbt4 world or whatever right um another I think thing is that this is an era where it's probably easier to come in and help and participate than it was five years ago and the reason is precisely the fact that there is more of this focus on concrete stuff that's closer to the user basically that a lot of the deep Tech has been solved right or it exists and is being constantly improved the problems that I talked about today they're not really problems that involve building deep Tech they're problems that involve taking existing technology and just applying it in the right way putting it together in the right way and like packaging it any way that actually yet makes sense to users right and this is the sort of stuff that the ecosystem you know really needs right now and so you know if people wants to work on any of this then you know I'd be Asia very you know happy to see the results so thank you oh amazing well hope you enjoyed that giant brain dump of ideas you can work on and uh there's a lot of people that actually already talked about doing some of these projects as you were filling out and signing up for the sakathon so you can get a lot more feedback here from our mentors and all these things and everybody in the audience and everybody who's watching this live stream especially a whole new Bunch from from Nigeria hope you enjoyed this talk
