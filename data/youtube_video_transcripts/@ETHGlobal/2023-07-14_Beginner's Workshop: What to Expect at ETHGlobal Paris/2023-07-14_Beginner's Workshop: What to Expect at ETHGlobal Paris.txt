yes yes I got a few people and I said okay cool yeah this is this is basically aim for you all I mean not to say that veterans uh these Global hackathons can't join um but certainly you know geared more towards the all uh feel free to you know ask any questions interrupt me kind of want to be as bit as interactive as possible um and yeah this will be uh on YouTube later as well so if you maybe you have folks that weren't able to make it feel free to share that with them share this with them as well um but yeah I'll go and get started so uh thank you all for joining uh name is Rory Arredondo I am the hacker success manager at uh youth Global so I've been in this role for uh just about four months now and uh one of my main tasks kind of reviewing the feedback uh from from our post event surveys and also just getting feedback from from hackers in general um to uh to you know just how figure out how we can improve upon Upon Our events and so one of the things is you know we should have we got requests for having kind of a bit more workshops beforehand for beginners who are completely new to our hackathons uh just so they know exactly where to you know how to figure out where things are um to show show and find let them find things you know and that maybe they didn't they weren't aware of before um and really just kind of set you all up for success for the event before actually getting into the event that way you're you're ready to go hit the ground running um so yeah that's uh that's basically a little bit about me uh we do have a member from cartesia Zach if you want to quickly kind of give your skill um and then we can go ahead and get started here howdy guys uh Cortez's been a almost almost every Global hackathon since Global San Francisco we're going to be at almost all the ones in the future and we'd really love to meet with you all so what cartesia is is we we will we are a layer two and a layer three and we allow anyone to use any Linux compatible programming language to build any decentralized application that they want and Deploy on any evm compatible chain without being restricted to just solidity so yeah see us at our booth nice cool cheers thanks Zach um so all right so what we've got here what I've got on the screen is um you know just our main homepage if you haven't you know become too familiar with this yet so uh I just kind of want to walk through like kind of the schedule like from Thursday until Sunday of the chain of events that way people are completely aware of what's going on you know from getting to end pretty much um some of you may have seen that the we have a an event called pragma Paris this is completely different than these Global hackathons so um it's this is a ticketed event that you you know you have to purchase tickets and as hackers you get discounted prices for it but this is more like a conference so some people get confused that you know if I applied for the hackathon I can go to pragma or if I apply for program I can go to the hackathon uh that's not the case so I just wanted to clarify this with anybody you know thinking that if they submitted a ticket for this that they would also get to go to the hackathon but um it's if you haven't seen this site or if you're interested like definitely check it out we have a lot of a great lineup of speakers for this for this event um and it'll be at uh really another neat place as well the um where is it at the Pavilion vendom so it's got I mean I think his nickname The Vault but it's a really really cool spot as well and uh yeah so I mean there we have we've had past you know this is this will be our Tokyo the fourth pragma event so we started in Tokyo earlier this year and it's just again more conversations more uh panel discussions and opportunities to to network uh with other attendees and we're aiming to have around 250 uh attendees for this event too so um yeah that's just one thing to keep in mind this is on Thursday and the other event going on on Thursday is a cafe Paris and so this is also geared really towards uh folks who are looking for uh team formation basically this we've kind of iterated on this event a couple times again this is our first fourth time doing this Cafe and this will be the first time where we basically it's meant to just be team formation the entire the entire day what we've noticed for the previous cafes is that people hackers will come and just kind of start chatting with each other meeting each other and just naturally form teams throughout project ideas so we thought why not just make this a whole all-date information session so if you're chatting with somebody on the Discord or maybe you're meeting with people beforehand and you want to do you want a place where you all can get together this would be the perfect uh spot for you you all to do that um and again it opens you know pretty early and stays open pretty late so another reason why we have this is you know if people want to arrive to Paris early but they didn't have time to check into their hotels this gives you know people another place to kind of just chill and hang out beforehand as well there'll be food there drinks um only you just only confirmed hackers will be able to participate in this um and then we also have some mentors there on hand as well but if you haven't seen this please go ahead and you know go here and apply to attend we'll do registration for the cafe but um of course you know as with any venue we have the limited capacity so we'll definitely keep an eye on the registration numbers and monitor attendance as the day goes on excuse me but uh yeah this is again a great opportunity if you're you know meeting with folks beforehand or haven't met met them prior uh to to come into Paris and a great uh spot an opportunity to to do so and I'm not if you have questions like I can't really keep up with the chat so feel free to kind of just interject um and that way I can I'll uh I'll answer questions uh uh uh live but uh I do plan to cover a lot of stuff so if you want to wait till the end and that's totally fine as well um and so yeah something obviously the main event is the youth Global Paris so let me just go here so yeah unfortunately I mean applications have closed we uh you know each Global Paris has become a very popular event so if you have had members that maybe you want to join your team that didn't take in time or that um just completely forgot to submit an application then um unfortunately we're not opening the UI for applications anymore we're at venue capacity we have close to a thousand hackers that would be participating so it's not as big as our Tokyo event but it has been bigger than Lisbon and Waterloo those events were so um that's just something to keep in mind unfortunately you know we're limited Again by venue capacity so we can't accept uh everybody as everybody that we'd like to to accept um and uh yeah so uh one thing I guess if you're not familiar with this dashboard to go go a little bit back to the team formation aspect on your dashboard here you can see that you know if you're you're a little bit of team information so creative team or join a team if you click this I agree to my Discord username being shared with other hackers to contact me for information you'll be able to see um other folks that have signed up that have also opted in for this so if I click this find team members and it'll basically have my information my details and then I can filter for other hackers uh who have opted in who are attending the event have opted in for this their information so you know who they are what skills they have and their Discord IDs as well so hackers I want to join a team teams are looking for more members um so I would highly suggest that you click this Discord but uh button that way you can also see who else is you know looking for for other further folks to join their team or for for them to that want to join a team um it's kind of a bit hidden so I mean this in the future we do plan to have this this profile a bit more more public and open Within each of your your profiles uh just to make the team formation aspect a lot easier and again if you maybe you you had somebody that was joining but planning to join but didn't stake in time then this would be a great way to find excuse me find somebody else to join your team pretty much so I mean there's definitely a lot of talent out there so don't feel bad if maybe somebody that you really want to work with isn't able to come there's definitely a lot of folks that are here looking to for to join teams um so and just to go back that was on the the dashboard and under you know your team section um and yeah just make I mean if you haven't done so already go ahead and connect your your Discord to to your Docker dashboard as well if there are any issues with that you know feel free to just send me an email or um so I can type this it's a hello at youthglobal.com uh you can if you have any issues with with that or any any other sort of issues in general just feel free to send me an email at hello youth global.com okay so yeah so um the other thing is I want to go back over here is uh the schedule so a lot of people will ask some questions about you know what's what's the scheduled chain of events and times and everything anything and everything you could find will be on the schedule here so we're currently you know July 14th this is going on um the time zone will be based on whatever you want to set it to I mean it so it's just keep that in mind whenever you're in Paris it probably will automatically go to Paris anyways but um yeah so just that's keep that in mind when it comes to like judging submission uh project submissions um so yeah for Thursday we have all the different events going on with pragma and Cafe um and then as I said you know lunch breakfast some small breakfast items will be provided at uh pragma and the lunch is provided as well and then Cafe there's food provided throughout throughout the day basically uh Friday we have uh registration opens at 1pm so the venue you won't be able to check into the venue until 1pm uh usually a line a cue starts forming you know outside a little bit beforehand but um that you won't be allowed to come to the venue before if you if you do so and once that does open the venue's open 24 7 so from 1 p.m Sunday until or Friday until six six or seven pm on Sunday evening so um there there will be a chill space that we set up Friday evening it's a few you know mattresses and pillows and stuff but it's certainly not you know five-star accommodations and there aren't any showers in the facility so if you're planning to come and maybe you just want to stay the entire you know weekend at the venue you know that's totally acceptable but that you know you're sipping a situation may not be the best most comfortable so um definitely highly suggested you know to team up with folks other hackers to share airbnbs or or do whatever but we definitely do have people that do stay at the venue 24 7. our workshops start at 2 p.m so these are a partner-led workshops and we we have these basically all of them that that occur right before hacking begins around 6 PM so um again you know definitely definitely keep an eye on the schedule and figure out you know what what uh what speakers you want to go to and what workshops you want to go to because this is a great way for you to also get project ideas if you're still kind of stuck on what to work on this is a perfect opportunity to to listen to folks from the different partners and just again just kind of get get those ideas um and we'll I'll show you another link that we have as well for for getting ideas uh dinner will be the first meal that's provided so this is from Friday's dinner until Sunday's lunch all the meals are provided there's tons of snacks and Waters and drinks and coffees as well so um you know don't you have to worry about you know which what you'll have to do for food um not sure what the uh the menus exactly look like but yeah and so there was also late night snacks as well um like midnight snacks that we have and if you're still at the venue uh registration on Friday closes at uh 10 pm as well so you know but as we get close to the evening a lot of the East Global staff you know goes we go back to our the rooms and kind of for us and recuperate for the next day um and yeah so I mean if you aren't able to register but on by on Friday then it will be open on Saturday so and then on Saturday it closes at noon so we we do this just because we want to make sure that everybody gets checked in beforehand and takes advantage of the workshops that are going on and everything um so yeah if you're if you're having issues or if you maybe your college or teammates are having issues to try and check in you know definitely send us an email let us know that what's going on and uh we we I mean we can certainly make some exceptions but ideally everybody checks in before Saturday at noon um and then 3 P.M we have uh we have we do have a project feedback session with the mentors and then there was also Friday evening there was also a um uh team formation and brain idea brainstorming session with myself and Austin Griffith uh so he's actually we're gonna this will be the first time that I've worked with Austin doing this so definitely if you haven't found a team team member uh Team yet uh come to this session it'll be in one of the workshop rooms we only have four rooms so it'll be in one of those rooms but um if you don't know who Austin Griffith is I mean he he does a lot with the within the ethereum space from the he's from the EF and uh just really good at kind of facilitating ideas and helping people get get unblocked when it comes to comes to that um and there will be a few mentors on hand as well and then this project feedback session again this is an opportunity for you to check in with the mentors and kind of get any feedback maybe on the current status and progress you made with your project it's not mandatory um but you know it it's there you know in case in case you you know you need some some help um and one thing about this is that the mentors we have um there there's there will be uh if you go here to the uh the mentors tab we'll have a list of uh currently confirmed mentors so far for the for the event so who they are what their skills are their Discord and Twitter uh feel free to reach out to these to these people um and you know ask ask for their for their advice or help on on anything you need they will be wearing like these bright yellow vest construction looking type vests so they'll be walking around there's a mentor station but they'll also be walking around uh to the different uh around just the the the venue um that way they're more noticeable and that they're you know you're not having to come to them they're coming to you basically they're here for you know to offer support and guidance and answer any technical questions you may have uh we the each partner will have you know their own sort of mentor cynical Mentor specific to their protocol and framework but uh these are kind of just general General mentors uh here who aren't uh necessarily tied to a particular protocol these are past hackers they're past um you know past East Global finalists past folks in the industry who just want to want to give back pretty much so we're definitely grateful for their for their time on this um if I go back to the schedule and so yeah so one of the main things is after Saturday we have dinner and then the last main thing basically is the project submission so the project submissions are due at 9 00 a.m on Sunday and we strongly encourage you all to submit your projects you know a couple hours beforehand uh just because within like the usually the that last hour people are everybody's trying to submit stuff and it can clog down the system a bit it might slow down you might get really nervous and your video is not going to be uploading properly or something goes wrong so just for your own sanity check just make sure that you know you have everything filled out within your project submission form and the video and everything just kind of the videos don't necessary it's optional but we uh on our showcase page we do add uh you can you have the option to add your video to to the uh to the Showcase can it be yes it can be edited after um submission so like well you can edit up till submission and then yeah after after that once once judging is done then we can uh we can you can do whatever you want with it so some people they'll add a video and then they actually I want to re-upload a video so um they'll just still you know make tweaks and changes to it um but as long as the projects are submitted by 9 A.M then you'll be good to go and then judging starts at 9 30. so um this will be live live judging in front of we'll have it but we're gonna have about 16 different uh rooms uh for you all to present to judges each room will have two different judges and so a lot of the um a lot of those folks you can find here it's kind of a mix match because some people are speakers and they're also judges so if you're curious about who any of these folks are definitely you know just go going through here but you'll have um let me go back for for judging you'll have seven minutes basically to to present your project to the judges you'll have four minutes to do your live demo and in three minutes for a question and answer so it goes by very quickly and um it's it's after that you know you're you're done you're basically good to go you can if you want to apply for a partner partner prizes you can go you'll be you'll be able to do the to do partner prizes asynchronously after you've done your uh your live judging with the judges and so this is there's two different tracks there's like the top ten finalists track and then the um and the partner partner prices so you don't have to do both um you don't have to do both of them if you want to adjust your partner prizes you're certainly more than welcome to to just do those as well um and yeah so kind of to go into that so the and the partners tab this is all of our partners um that will be helping out uh for for our event and then going to the prizes again if you have if you're still stuck on you know project ideas for for what to build on or or what to do uh definitely check out the prizes section as some a lot of the partners they have they go into specifics on what exactly it is you know they're looking for in terms of the bounties um what prizes they're offering and some of them have you know just different uh links to different uh um uh documents for for ideas as well so if you haven't seen this definitely take the time to do this before you get to the to the venue that way you sort of have an idea maybe what what uh partner you want to to work with um what stack you want to build on top of like um and yeah and then the FAQs like if for for any sort of like admin questions like this the FAQs covers a lot of different uh areas especially like when it comes like when you get your steak back so we generally after the event's done it you successfully submit a project you get your steak back two to three weeks after the the event finishes um it'll be in the internal transactions tab of ether scan so it's sometimes we get a few questions people saying I can't find my my um my you know my State can uh where is it I don't see it in my wallet so that's just something that that that that we do get a lot of questions on um so the other thing I want to kind of go over is the uh the Discord so uh hopefully everybody on here is already you know connected their Discord they're signed up but you know definitely if you're still looking for a team you know people have been obviously posting on this on the channel definitely take advantage of this it's another way for you all to find teammates um and in The mentorship Help Channel this hasn't been opened yet so the the partners Channel hasn't been open yet but this is where you can again message the mentors as well uh they'll all be in here um and then the partners all the different partners each have their own you know partner Channel so again this will be a place where you can if you have specific questions um that maybe the partner isn't at their booth at the venue you can't get a hold of somebody then ask them ask online and then they'll be able to assist you uh here as well um so yeah sorry the pitch the pitch is uh seven minutes so you have four minutes to do your demo and in three minutes the Q a from the judges so um and you you don't have to have a video it's it's just if you want to post it on the Showcase so like after once you're done um everybody's everybody submits a project they'll be added to the Showcase page so some of some folks they do have videos uh assigned a link to their to their projects so I don't know if this one so yeah this this person or this this group you know you have they have a few their screenshots and everything but then they also have a demo video that they created so the the video isn't required for uh for submission it's just it's nice to have if you want it for having it for you know so you can we can you can post on the Showcase page um and this is basically you know some people with they use this as their for their CV or job interviews it's like hey I participated Global Waterloo um and you know we won these prizes and you know this is this is this is a demo this is what I've done sort of thing but if you're com if you're selected for like top 10 finalists then that's gonna be a live demo so you're not playing the video you're just going to be doing it live on stage during the closing ceremony foreign specific uh timing around around judging it's it's kind of like first come first serve so you you'll it'll you'll your hacker dashboard will be updated with uh sort of like a time uh you know from from here to here but there isn't like you're not a sound like a specific time you're not assigned a specific Judge you basically will queue up in the green room for the green room and this is basically making sure that all your team members are there that you've submitted your projects that you're you know you've done everything you needed to do before you actually go and submit your uh demo your your project for the judges so it's um it takes a little time kind of sifting through that uh just just to make sure that every everybody that is checking in that you know everything is is good to go but we try to make it as smooth and quickly as possible so it does once it gets started you know the flow the flow does go through um it just depends on if people and their teams are you know currently president and on sometimes people you know you've been hacking for 36 hours you might get tired you might go back home or go sleep and not wake up in time so you have to come back and rush so it just uh eventually it gets done though judging starts at 9 30 and goes until you know basically noon so you have there's a couple of hours opportunity for you to to um you know to to present to the judges um and one other thing I forgot to mention is some of you may have seen this let me put this out of the way is the other team formation slides so this is another another way in case people we're trying to find different ways for folks to to participate um in in find teams making sure that everybody has a team that they found so you know you're basically just filling out following the instructions here and filling out a slide so people just kind of add their own little uh quirks and tweaks to it but you know project ideas skills about me if you're looking to join teams Etc um I will send this in the chat as well in case you haven't seen this so okay let me see oh and the other thing is um we do have a city guide oh why won't you let me do it ah there we go I will send this in the chat too so this is a city guide is something that we put together uh for folks maybe the closest airport is the water safe to drink temperatures and stuff and just a few um suggested like how to get to The Venue from the airport and into just some like fun places fun places for the city you know outdoor activities cultural visits accommodation and then the Silas events so this is sort of it's starting to uh populate as well so if you're looking for other things to do outside of East Global Paris or pragma Paris or Cafe Paris then definitely you know check check these out as well these are these are events that were submitted and vetted by the global staff so um it's um yeah a lot of these are free too so maybe if you have somebody that didn't sign up to hack or forgot to stake or something then you know feel free to to um you know invite them to to these events as well because all of them are free um and yeah and then one of the one of the main things I wanted to mention too is at registration you you'll be given you know your swag item a lanyard that has your name on it and then a T-shirt and then also a wristband so The Wristband will be placed on your wrists and this would basically be the only wristband that you get so do not lose it do not take it off we know some people don't like you know showering with your getting it wet um and it's like I understand that I guess you think about that go to Music Festival and you know if you're going to a Austin City Limits or or um I don't know uh Tomorrowland or something you know do you lose a pet you lose your wristband you're not getting back in so that's kind of the idea here uh don't take it off don't don't lose it um if you do if on some unfortunate reason if you do lose your wristband uh we will slash your steak and give you another one or give you another wristband of course but we will slash the the 0.05 eth that you use to stick with so you know bottom line just don't lose your wristband whatsoever keep it on at all times um if you lose your lanyard that's not too bad but the wristband you have to have to keep that um yeah yeah so yeah it's this will be on on YouTube yeah I couldn't at Tomorrowland I was trying to think of Coachella and I just Tomorrowland came to mind so but yeah it's it it tends to be like a point of contention you know some people don't really like showering with their wristbands I think the the reason behind is just a lot of hackers maybe don't attend music festivals where you have to you know have The Wristband on at all times so it's just kind of getting that mindset that hey you know just don't take it off just keep it on um because we don't want to you know it's the venue's open 24 7. so we want to keep make sure that we're just allowing people who have registered for our events to to walk in and attend um so yeah uh please clarify boilerplate rules um boilerplate rules are you talking about oh wait let me let's see I think I know what you're talking about but it just I think you're good the boy players I think you're talking about for the uh maybe like the rules to project submission and judging so if you go to the info center um again actually real quick the info center has like these tools and resources section so a lot of different links to different uh sites within the ethereum ecosystem again if you're stuck on uh you know ideas or anything like definitely check out check out the this list of uh of links that we have it's a it's pretty massive and extensive um so I you know definitely proves that your own uh you know leave the leisure but it's a definitely a good area to also kind of uh review and research um and then yeah so like for the boilerplate so uh every like once hacking starts at 6 PM you know everything is everything that's associated with your project that's when it that's when it counts so like anything else done beforehand uh would not in terms of code like obviously you can brainstorm ideas you can you know write down stuff on paper or you know do whatever get some stuff going brainstorm wise get your ideas down but then as far as like building you know writing the code and everything shouldn't start until after 6 PM uh on Friday and so yeah boilerplate rules like if you have like um like here here's the uh like to answer radium's uh questions so it's if if you're unsure of something when it comes like a boilerplate or a starter kit you know just send us an email um and we'll we'll we'll CL we can clarify it uh it's I think some a lot a lot of times it's okay um some people have some really very unique specific situations and cases but um if you're unsure of something just send an email to hello edithglobal.com and uh we can I can send that over to the uh to the project reviewers just to clarify make sure that you're good to go um The Wristband is not made a favor it's sort of like a for pragma it's a it's a paper wristband but for for uh for the hackathon it's sort of um I don't know like a fabric so it's it's uh it's kind of the one you know you it has a little uh wood wooden piece and you just kind of pull it and that's how it tightens whenever you pull it so we I tell we tell the volunteers not to put it on too tight because if it does get too tight you can always bring it back to the to the venue like hey you know it's too tight I need to cut it off it's cutting off circulation to my to my hand um and we can totally do that that's that's acceptable that's fine um uh it's okay to create diagrams beforehand diagrams yeah diagrams I well I mean depends I guess how it depends on the how detailed they are um I would say I would say it's probably okay um but yeah I mean if it's just like for you if you're brainstorming like just right now like I don't know from Project from point A to point B or something um yeah I would say that's fine it's a requirement to be in a group uh yeah so good question is a requirement to be in a group in order to work on a project uh if yes how many people must have to within a team or group so you're limited to five team members um no more so and you can hack solo if you want you don't necessarily have to uh you know be be on a team it's up to you preference wise but uh no more than five five team members um and yeah I mean if you want to work on a team then definitely just take advantage of the uh you know just the different Discord channels find a team Channel or uh from your hacker dashboard so yeah so some of you folks are just joining I'll just quickly go back over here to the dashboard and if you enable if you agree to your Discord name being used you can go find team members and they just search through all the different team members um yeah how much prepared work can we bring besides just the idea I mean like you know it's as far as no codes being built that's fine um if you have like ideas for like starter creates or boil plates that you want to use uh that that's fine um you know you can kind of like Get get your thoughts around stuff together and then but it's really the main thing is that you don't code uh before you know before 6 p.m on next Friday we can demo in the 20th uh question was can we demo in the afternoon of the 23rd so let me check the 23rd is that Sunday I think so right yeah uh yeah so well uh the judging will will wrap up we try to wrap up judging before lunch at 12 30 so it would be you know anytime between 9 30 and and 12 12 30. um we'll if if it goes over like it just it depends on how many how many teams submit projects you know for for Waterloo I think we had close to um 130 projects submitted so for and for Paris because we have a lot more hackers there's probably gonna maybe be closer to 200 projects not really sure but this is why we also have a lot more judging rooms as well um so uh so yeah it I would say you know it's not going to go all afternoon you know the sooner because we we have a schedule that we want to start you know the the finale closely finale at 3 P.M and then finalists will be notified at 2 30. so uh ideally we finish before lunch but if we go a little you know after lunch then that's fine but it won't go all afternoon um uh we're hacking what else okay what about forking and open source that has no previous web3 features and adding them would be the hackathon project um that's a good question I would say uh I would say send an email to hello youth Global and kind of let let us know what exactly maybe you're you're looking to do um I'm because I I guess I I'm not I'm not a uh project reviewer so I can't necessarily say what would and wouldn't uh count um but yeah I would Clement I would uh I would send over like if the question what about forking an open source that has no previous web 3 features and adding them would be the hackathon project so that was the question um so yeah anything like that I would send send us an email hello to global.com just to clarify exactly what it is you're you're thinking of of doing and then I can get clarification from the my team members who actually do the the reviews and judge what what is and isn't um what would and would be a disqualifier uh do most people find a team before meeting a person at the 20th or usually most on location before the workshop start uh yeah I mean it depends previous in previous events you know we still have a lot of people that show up to the team formation sessions um on the Friday evening uh Thursday the whole the whole day information session will be unique just because we um you know we haven't tried this yet so we're gonna see how it goes but I think a lot of people do I think for uh if you want my advice I would say try to find a team member beforehand that way when you do get there in person that you can just hit the ground running and you don't have to maybe worry about finding a team member uh we understand that you know sometimes Maybe team members might keep their options open or they're they're being you know recruited from a few other teams so um I would keep that in mind as well uh just because you know some people like maybe they're they hear an idea that they really are interested in as well um but ideally you find somebody beforehand but it's not the end of the world if you don't find a team member before the hackathon starts as well um there are definitely people that are still looking for for team members um the Friday evening hahaha sorry oh uh so 12 9 30 12 30 would be the best time yeah so judging will be basically between 9 30 and 12 30 on Sunday uh thank you Clement uh what happens after the finalists are notified and during finalists announce is it the presentation time for the teams uh so the finalists are notified yeah around 2 30 and then if you're if you're a finalist you'll basically you'll be told to go to a meeting meeting spot and then we'll do like a green room we make sure that you're because if you're a finalist you'll be doing a live demonstration uh during the closing ceremony in front of everybody that's that's attending East Global Paris so we we get you up on stage we we test out your your your um your laptop make sure that your demo is working you're all the the you know all your tabs everything is good to go um and then we sort of line you up you know where where you need to be whenever the uh the closing presentation begins um and then the the during the three o'clock the global Paris finale that's when that's when the finalists will will do their demo and kartik will you know announce prizes and all the other stuff and then the after party foreign so yeah that's kind of uh I mean those are the kind of the the main things I really wanted to go over um I don't know if anybody has any questions like feel free to take yourself off mute uh or type in the chat I'm able to keep up with the chat now so um yeah this is a open invitation to just ask any questions you may have or anything maybe yeah yeah I need anything uh and then also one thing like so I do uh I read like if you have any specific feedback on anything up until now or even you know for afterwards definitely send send me an email at hello with global.com and because we take uh you know everybody's feedback into consideration and you know definitely want to continue improving so if you have ways for making even this session more more better definitely let let me know as well so that way we can I can go back to the drawing board and figure out how we can make this more useful for future events too um but uh but yeah so that's kind of like it I mean so I mean if you want to join a team uh you know you can uh if somebody's invited you a team you know enter their token if you want to create a team create a team as well um for your project you know make sure that you feel as much of the information you can uh because whenever you do shoot I'll just go and do this if I click this create a project got to do a few things test I'm gonna pick my emoji um this what project what category describes your project D5 click confirm create and then so we recommend some starting submissions early so there you go uh you can fill out as much as you can um you know whenever hacking begins and that way so whenever you do it's time to submit your project that you're not kind of behind filling out all this other information as well um and this can be edited up until project submission so you can always go back and and change it to and yeah Zoe you have your you have a question yeah thanks Rory this was very uh helpful uh one question for the the presentation again so um in the seven minutes because we are there with the team is it do you recommend that only one person presents and then how should this be best done is it like with some slides or we really go into the code or we copy the code into a slide are there any recommendations yeah that's a really great question actually so um it depends like what I've seen in the past is generally maybe one if it's like a big team maybe five members one or two people will be the ones that sort of maybe talk through the project and then somebody else does the demo um it could be just one person that does it but um I think it just depends on what works best for your team specifically um because they're yeah it'll be you know it'll be two judges sitting across from you and then you know one your team members one to five team members how many there are on the opposite side of the table and then there will be a TV that that you'll look hook up your laptop to so then they'll be able to see you know what you're presenting um so some people do slides but it I think from what I I've seen like the judges really are more focused and interested in the uh the technology so like what what your code does the what your what your project is capable of doing um so if you're if you're maybe worried about slides like I wouldn't spend maybe too much time on the slides and maybe more time just on the actual project the code itself um because then I mean you're I think if you're able to demonstrate you know I guess it depends on how far along your project is if you're able to demonstrate your project successfully from a from a website or or something then like that I think that's good enough if um if you're maybe your project is missing a few a few features or or something then maybe having some slides on what what uh what you see it being capable of doing uh that might help too but I think it's really just Case by case depending on uh on the on the team situation um but I for me personally I think that yeah if you're if you're able to you know just to do like an actual live demo on on on your website uh then I think that's probably the the best the best way they do we do ask for whenever you submit your project like there is a media upload section to have like screenshots and stuff so I mean but that can be again taken from like your your actual the website or the code itself cool thank you [Music] I think I've missed a few questions unless we're the answer uh after part usually ends on six at 6 30 on Sunday uh yeah it's it's around 6 30ish I mean they'll be like you know drinks and maybe some small snack items but um yeah it'll be around six six thirty um and of course you're not you know you don't have to stay the whole time people can come and go as they please so um but yeah you're more than welcome to to stay whenever and at least the venue kicks us out which is usually I think the latest maybe like 7 P.M um uh yeah thanks thanks Zach for answering that question our project's made on any other layer one chain from ethereum like file coin no systemina eligible to come finalists and Zach said yes as long as they're youth Global sponsored partnering offering a prize so yeah that was the question um yeah even at youth Global Lisbon we had a finalist attack on cartesi and I think win second or third so Anna asks what if our final project is a mobile app do we just do the demo using the video presentation oh yeah if it's a mobile app you can actually um I'm trying to think I've seen a few people do mobile apps so uh yeah I figured I'm not sure how you would find a way to like just just display it on on the TV I'm sure you can we'll have a lot of cables that you're able to hook it up to the TV um but um we you don't uh you wouldn't um let me think I know for youth Global San Francisco you know y'all had so many cables and equipment that it was just really easy to just hook a phone to a screen yeah so I I imagine there wouldn't be any issue or prepared yeah because we I've definitely seen a few few mobile phone presentations um I think it would more likely be um there's tools on computers to kind of mirror your phone screen on your computer and then your computer would be connected um I don't have like the tools off top of my head but I know there is tools for that that people usually use for that awesome yeah Kevin I was going to ask you to chime in too I wasn't sure what cables we had or what was provided and do it with QuickTime as well if you're using iOS you can actually mirror your phone straight away yeah was that you a lock yeah that's me hey awesome hello I just saw your response to Anna's question so yeah if it's iOS and you can use QuickTime to mirror to your notebook and then just play out hopefully that answers your question Anna and say can we submit to as many partner prizes as we would like a resource Mission limit uh no you can submit to as many so how you're going to do that so when you're in your project you have the media upload then you fill out the tech stack um and then select prizes so this it's not I mean the functionality is not open yet but you'll you'll be able to submit like top 10 finalists and partner prizes or just partner prizes only top 10 finalists means that you're going to do the live judging from 9 30 to 12 30 on Sunday morning and this is so you can you can have the opportunity the chance to to become a top 10 finalist and participate present your projects at the closing ceremony and then when eth Global we have the top 10 funnels we have our own it's like set up prizes that are if you go back to previous like uh youth Global Waterloo if you look at the look that up on on YouTube or any of the press events you'll see you'll kind of get an idea what it what to expect in terms of each Global finalist prizes and then for partner prizes yeah so once this opens up you'll be able to select the partner prices you want to apply for and so you can apply to as many as you want um and then with each within each of these you'll you'll be able to fill out exactly like you know Lincoln link your project to a specific line of code and then the description of why why you think your project qualifies for for the particular Partners prizes um but yeah there's no limit to to how many you can apply for I will say I mean some people there there could be a strategy behind it if you know some people just focus on maybe one or two partner prizes and then in the hopes of you know it just makes it easier for them to kind of just hone in their project on that on those two maybe one or two partners versus trying to cover all the different uh partners with with one single project because if you go to the partner that the prizes um tab here there are specific criteria like whenever you're applying for a partner prizes so definitely just you know click on these and see exactly what what sort of criteria they have if any some might not have any um but you know just keep keep that in mind like just because you maybe you you do you you built on top of a partner's uh platform or something and if maybe it's a full price but maybe you didn't necessarily meet the the partner's criteria for for winning a pool prize so just just keep that in mind whenever you're uh you know designing your projects um I think personally I would think it's it's best to maybe just kind of focus on a handful of partner prizes um instead of trying to do a lot of them but yeah I mean ultimate to answer your question so like there's there is there there is no limit but yeah there's a any other questions or anything and uh yeah if not I mean definitely I'll do the email again here um send it you can always send an email to helloityglobal.com uh I answer those emails so if you have any questions about anything like you know let me know I'll I will be physically at the registration desk most of the weekend so whenever you check in I'll be there and you know just even Sunday morning I'll be there as well if you have any issues with like submitting your project or anything like that um and uh yeah we'll be monitoring that and then the Discord uh you know we monitor the Discord channels as well so um yeah oh one thing uh sorry last thing we just we just thought has it been officially opened yet but we have a pragma Paris Discord Channel as well that that we haven't this will be the first time we've done it um so it should open up later today but um again if anybody that's attending pragma and they want to keep talking if you've met somebody at pragma you know definitely you can you know try and find folks here or meet up with folks here afterwards and so this will become you know eventually rolls up into like all the different pragma events that have happened like one big channel so this is something new that we're testing and so we'll see we'll see how it goes but that's another way for folks to kind of Converse over over pragma so yeah I guess if there are no other questions so thank you all for attending and uh yeah this if you have any questions feel free to reach out if you're unsure of anything definitely a lot of stuff can be found on the website so you know I would definitely especially the schedule tab just you know everything is on here uh to forget that the mentors tab that we
