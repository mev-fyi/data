Kartik we should be I'm just gonna double-check the streams and then we should be good to go yeah I see yeah it looks good on my own circle I will leave it to Kartik to start it off in the Kartik when you're done you can just turn off your video and it should hide your your view sounds perfect take it away so welcome everybody our panelists and all of our attendees and also the general audience that had the ability to kind of just sign up and not tune in to this panel so I'm partying with the co-founders of youth global and I want to just kind of give everybody a quick update on unhak money and what's going on with that so before we kind of get to the actual good stuff which is what you're here I'm gonna bore you with some informational spam so hack money is is our first ever online hackathon that's focus on defy if global has been doing this thing for two-and-a-half weeks now so this is this is week three of our four week event and as a quick update things are going amazing we have some of our amazing defy sponsors a lot of them are on this call and in they're all working towards having over 350 hackers build really cool defly projects we are just in the process of sort of collecting and guessing or rather sorta estimating the number of projects we're gonna see a submissions and sort of what they're gonna be building and so forth a number is going to be just a little bit over a hundred and and it's just crazy because in two weeks from now we're gonna have about a hundred and eighty five projects in this space and I'm perfectly comfortable saying that this actually doubles the number of BFI projects that exists very very immediately and so with that as a quick update on everything that's happened with youth youth global one hack money this event is two more weeks from for finishing for participants that are on on the zoom chat will be kind of covering over what happens with with judging for our your hacks if this in the coming few days the hundred plus projects pool gets you submit and talk about what they built on another lashing like this thing in general and on top of all of that we have our amazing kind of mentors and sponsors that have been sort of on our discord channels kind of helping out and anything from technical teachers channel mentorship just making sure that everybody who is trying to work from 15 different time zones is is getting the help and support that they need so as part of one of these events are as part of the hack money we're doing a panel like this you kind of have a lot of you get the opportunity to ask and learn a bit more about some of the projects in this space so I won't go into the individual introductions but I do want to introduce Camilla Russo who who works at and is the co-founder of the defiant and she will be interviewing our panelists and asking them questions about some of the cool things that they're working on and sort of what's next for their projects and what's defy for indie fine so with that please welcome Camilla to I take the stage great um hi Karthik thank you so much thanks for having me here at HACC money very cool to have a t5 focus hackathon so I'll quickly introduce our amazing panelists and then we'll get to it there's a lot to cover so okay so we have Hayden Adams he's the founder of yunusov 80 centralized exchange automated market maker Stanny kulikov found out other a decentralized lending protocol Johan Eve ohright okay sorry about that Jonathan Eve he's a product manager at decentralized oracle provider chain-linked hard lumber he's co-founder at uma decentralized synthetic exchange and issuing platform and calling me strategy lead at the centralized landing protocol compounds finance so lots of decentralized in the project descriptions here so I wanted to start with you know asking this question to everyone in the panel specifically about you know what you're expecting to see at HACC money so what do you think is the big thing that's missing in in defy that would you know make make this sector more attractive for for users for it to increase adoptions what do you hope to see come out of the hackathon um if you want to start standing yeah sure I mean the youngest first right yeah but I think I would like to see like a lot of defy is pretty much focused now a lot for example we have different kinds of for example stable coins or or interest berries for example like a dicey die and so forth and everything's focused a lot on kind of like the the US audience and I think what could be very cool to see is that kind of like the BFI accessibility should be more global so so kind of like a people participate in dfi they have like kind of like equal chances for example from Europe for example if you're earning in in euro currencies or pounds and you kind of don't have the the currency foreign exchange currency fluctuation risks involved so it's more easier and of course like a bit of adoption through defiant benefits of the deep I seen in other parts of the globe actually you can have the globe like this is like the coolest thing ever I found like I have it in listings for a long time but I think this represents very well be the kind of like a hackathon because like people are participating here like in many different countries and like very demographic the Democratic thing because you don't have to travel to this hackathon and spiritual and that's like what I'm expecting from from this particular hackathon that we'll see more use cases where other parts of the work it could actually benefit and and also that some of the hacks actually help different parts of the globe so that's like something very big I I'm looking into now thanks definitely that definitely goes with the purpose off of defy right all right wanna go next yeah sure I mean I can't carry the way I look at this I like to think of almost a competitive way how does deep I win like what does defy do and what is the aspects what does defy enable that nobody else can compete at what's it's unfair advantage and so I think it's actually really interesting to think of this in comparison to centralized finance so c5 which also you could say is traditional finance like finance and it mechs and coinbase they can do if trading they can do stable coins they can probably do some some synthetic assets what is it stuff that defy can do that finance coin based bit max just really can't do and what is the stuff that's going to actually like suck new people or new energy into the decentralized finance ecosystem because I don't feel like we all believe we're all believers that decentralization is is the right ethos but I personally want to like not rest on that as the thing that's going to have this space win like what is the stuff that's that we can do and then to make it more concrete you know the personal tokens someone just like really new innovative financial products I think that's where defy has the opportunity to innovate and these hackathons are examples of where people can innovate at a speed and in a kind of the advantage of the permission listen it's that we all have can innovate in a way that other more centralized options just can't compete yeah I agree projects I just can't in centralized finance and traditional finance are my favorite things about about the five mr. Haden how about you yeah no I mean I completely agree with heart I want to see more things that can be done outside of defy I want to see more like highly experimental things I want to see really weird things that like you just are like wait really that's weird but like no like I mean a good example is like you know the things that I hadn't really thought about right like flash loans like those are stuff that I hadn't really thought about no one could do with that sort of thing until defy or some of these kind of experimental something kind of exciting in the u.s. top area is needs like rare physical goods that people are issuing limited-edition stuff and and selling so yeah I definitely want to see more experimentation on that front something that I also am pretty interested in for this hackathon because it's like a longer form hackathon usually it's like two to three days and so you end up having like these like really janky you X's but with a kind of a cool idea behind it I would be very interested in seeing you know higher quality UX behind the projects because I think that UX is like one of the the biggest things holding the space back and so Ching really QX experimentation and kind of new ideas on that front would be it would be super cool that's a great point yeah it is a longer hackathon so the bar has been raised you're just deliver like I'm more finished product Johan how could you what are you expecting yeah sure I mean on my side I do feel like defy Eastern form alright deal for some great alternatives to put in the traditional world right now a lot of these people if like not know the option the D file is like basically for me G Phi is a great option you're like it's not the end goal it's not it's an option for everyone to be able to switch off from the traditional system does they know today and to have something better to have something where they have ownership of their assets to have something where they don't trust assistants or custodian right but know that I'm starting to realize that a lot of these people are completely oblivious to deify writing even more than forbid in the early days I'm a bit coefficient Venusian I would hear of people buying some Bitcoin because the government you know was inflating the money supply and stand for a lot of countries similar to this right I feel that deep I currently should probably aim and I think I can join what Stanley was saying here to speak to demographics which turns it was the same demographics in the Western countries like Europe the US but try to unbarred people who running into stuff right now today like you know that America in Africa I think that would really be the good and in this case it's also having graduates great products which can allow people to easy transfer Fiat web access to local currencies good so charlatan is a dollar but maybe the pesos may be the one may be you know a bunch of other currencies currently everything is indexed on the US dollar right eye is indexed on the end I think it would be great to see some more openings there and being able to speak to people who are more from the traditional world because today I feel like defies really addressed to the people who origin system right to the people in here young four to three years I've never seen anyone who just joined Tyrion and went to defy direction this something I haven't seen yet and I really hope it does happen soon because I think the word running needs it when you look at the situation today you know I think you really need yes opening up define for you know both traditional finance and traditional web or web to and and also from people from maybe emerging economies who haven't participated as heavily as people from developed countries and in like building all this stuff and and last but not least in this panel Calvin what do you think um you know I agree with everything that's been said I think you know I got into cryptid a lot of people got into crypto because here I think I'm the crypto cuz it's a little bit of an outsider perspective so we like weirder stranger things we see a lot of experimentation hackathon is sort of a perfect breeding ground for experimentation without a lot of constraints I also agree that like basically broadening the audience of defy is really important I think really interesting there is as you just kind of alluded to more bridges between web 3 and web 2 I actually like coins are like a pretty straightforward or like clear bridge between dollars at defy so continuing to build out those connections but also give three really specific ideas just because they're really top of mind for me at compound I have a big folk sort of understanding what might bridge the gap between large financial institutions or funds who use centralized interest rate markets like Blackfyre Celsius or Genesis and products like compound or oven and I think there's really three main problems one is basically credit extension so no matter how trust lists are not trustless this is the ability for somebody on Ave or compound to take their unused borrowing power and give it to somebody else liquidation alerting so right now you basically get instantly liquidated if you are marching called and that's basically untenable for a lot of institutions they need to have a day to respond and then also liquidation insurance which is really related to the same idea these institutions have the collateral available but they have it but they just don't want to be you know severely over collateralized because it's an efficient use of assets so credit and liquidation are two big problems that I think can really increase the usefulness of interest rate markets and if I write no great points I'm going to have concrete examples of how you know if I can can be better used by I may be larger you know users companies or just like larger whales because yeah like lending is the the main use case right now so yeah it's it'll be good to see these ways to just make it better and more usable okay so I want to go over to want to talk about composability if this this is kind of the one of the main features of decentralized finance I mean the the way that all these staffs and protocols can work together and and combine to form new products and you know it's just enabling so so much innovation which has been great but it's also opened up the space some would argue two vulnerabilities and attacks and so to address is I you know I'd want to go to Hayden and Sonny to get us started on on this topic I mean you know soft price feeds and flash loans have been kind of two little pieces that have been used by attackers to exploit these systems so what do you think I mean maybe maybe hating you can start like how come developers and builders stop composability from becoming a curse yeah so I'm gonna start by saying that I have never in my entire life said that a unit sloppy one should or could be used as a price feed safely by like an external system and so like that kind of maybe is my I mean so I think what I would say here is that you know if you have a permission list decentralized system on some level you have to accept that people are going to do stupid things with it and like do things that aren't safe with it I think it's important if you're building a project to very clearly message what your project can and can't do and maybe you can you know improve on things so that it can do some of the things people want to do with it but that's kind of a separate thing which it's like really no you you want a clearly message like and this is what you can safely do this is how you can safely do it you want to you know clearly warn people of the risks and then you know anyone participating in deep I should say is there something I want to put my money in is there something I wanted you know you because I think that you know these these are protocols like unit swap and compounding right they're becoming these like building blocks there's these other more complex systems but people have to be careful we're saying oh well just be something like just because something uses unit swap or something uses compound doesn't mean that system is safe even if you a swapping compound are safe so it's just something that where it's really like you should exercise caution when using any project that's composing other projects and that's not to say that those projects can't be safe in fact they can be safe in and it can be great and there's all sorts of ones that I love but I just think it's about exercising caution but I don't think that you know we should stop innovation and stop pushing the bar forward so I'll touch on on the flash swaps as well I'm a flash acceleration ask myself I think that you know if a project is can be completely broken by flash swaps then it's complete can be completely broken without flash swaps and also right so if you have a bunch of East right like the same way that you could flash flop some eath and then you could use that so you know push some price on you to swap and then that breaks an external system that's using that price unsafely um if you have a lot of you just do that directly or if you need another token you could just put it in compound and borrow it exactly and you know with enough eath you can push the price on anything on you to swap a large amount and you don't need flash swaps to do that and so it does like lower the barrier of entry to kind of you know messing around with things flash mobs potentially but anything that would be like completely broken by them is like inherently broken in my in my mind and I think that flash swap will sorry flash loans and we've been experimenting with something we call flash swaps at you know swap I think that they actually are like a real important use case where they you know they there are many transactions where the upfront cost is a lot higher than the net cost so you know for example if you if you see you can just sell some efore die on you know swap and you could maybe sell that die for Isan another training protocol you know potentially the net cost of that transaction could be you zero or even negative so it doesn't actually cost anything but there's like this initial upfront capital requirement and the stuff like flash loans and flash swaps they really lower the front capital requirements which i think is something that like is you know decentralizing in nature where it allows more people to participate and stuff like arbitrage rather than just you know whales so I I'm a big fan of it all right okay so I guess like what you're saying is innovations like flash loans and flash swaps actually you know drive the defy and just fine us forward because they they make it more efficient and so just because they're they're being used by by an attacker doesn't mean that that mechanism is flawed itself just that you know the system that is able to break because of flash loan was poorly designed in the first place and you know yeah and I will say that you know if people are using your product in a very like if people are using a protocol in like a very unsafe way it does probably point to like things that that you know an open an opening for you know in improvements and an opening for like something's like you know people are using something that's unsafe and that means that they want like you know a safer version of it probably it just might not exist so that's something we're doing with like you know swop v2 we created sort of a more robust framework for decentralized price Oracle's on top of you know swab that is you know more manipulation resistant although you know we yeah any what do you think honestly like they're something like what if flash on this showed that like what you're capable to do basically being a basically a developer or wondered sitting in your mom's basement and and dropping a piece of scripts and just basically doing just very amazing things for good and bad so I think assist in and said that the fast ones aren't like basically something new I mean fashions are just kind of like lowering the threshold of capital required upfront do different kinds of transactions in terms of compressibility so in terms of like when we look previously what kind of attacks we had during this year's with flash loans what we can see basically that those those particular attacks can be done just by having that way like capital and and I think it's just about building systems that are resilient to different kinds of attacks and that's why basically we have different kinds of Oracle systems in place for example it if you're using chain link and also the the unit operation to you and so forth so these kind of things are pretty much like improvements but in terms of like compressibility it really is a fascinating feature because if you look at the the flash phones that for example other has one of the interesting things that it provides is it's basically more liquidity and kind of like spread so the liquidity inside the whole PFI ecosystem for example there was interesting brainstorming I had with Mariano Conte from Megiddo and basically I wanted to swap a vault CDP world from one corridor without under one without actually returning the loan and that wasn't possible and we came up with the kind of like a conclusion that you could actually use flash loans to do that and then I just tweeted about it that hey actually this is pretty cool can just is someone interested in building this and I would just use it for the day from the day one and and David in Twitter basically came and said hey I will I would try to build something out of it and and in in four days he basically created collateral swap with with the use of the flash loans and the cool part is that basically you can swap your CDP collateral from one to another and the compressibility here is pretty awesome because it basically fast flash borrow from other die and you close your CDP let's say if it's dat collateral which your long sell it for example in fiber units for and and basically for for even the the collateral and open a new CD t get the in returning to other and also you can do even more core things dishes just like start you can basically actually really finance the whole loan so instead of like just collateral swap you can add more transactions in between the borrowing and and returning the loan you can actually refinance the whole lawn into compound for example you find that there's even what we rate loan in in USD C so what you're actually doing you're doing you're basically doing collateral swap interest rate swap and currency swap and to make it even more interesting you can put just like an automated bot running this for you and make it as a service and also running the liquidation service on top that you just flash loans like device ever does so you can go like so many layers on this compressibility and I think what's the key here is that actually like you're taking liquidity for one place to another in and just kind of like using the whole space for you and building this kind of like of products and and cool part is that it's also like human comes ability so let's say david build the collateral swap and and basically he's a developer this is a developer tool and then end users start to use it so you are actually building completely new products without actually having that up from capital and i think it's a huge that's actually it's very important especially like hackers and this this hackathon ya know completely agree i mean the the number of things like that can be built because of this composability feature in in defy is is absolutely mind-blowing and you know I think it's definitely one of the things that makes if I'm more likely to win because it is a competitive advantage with with other systems that don't have it but you mentioned this this idea of layers and it's something that I want to talk about because beyond attacks there's the question of whether all these composability and that's working together whether these races the the like raises systemic risk in mpfi I mean the possibility you know being so you know such a big part of it that if it breaks it takes like so many other different applications down with it or you know just just as an example I wanted to go to let's go to Calvin for this one what do you think about about this you know potentially but composability increases systemic risk and and defiant on how to prevent it yeah um I think that it does increase the stomach risk I think that composability sort of interconnectedness is part of the goal here if we're trying to build like a fully you know robust functional system of sort of financial alternatives to what exists in traditional finance they're gonna have to be connected I don't think that you know when when they're issues that happen because of composability like exploits or people lose money people like to say oh defy is just learning the lessons that traditional finance has learned in the past like these overly complex systems that nobody understands that fail it's going to get complex it's complex things didn't get much more complex I think sort of the hope is that there are two really main differences in these Defy projects that hopefully kind of cure for the issues that come with complexity that aren't true in traditional finance one is basically radical transparency like the fact that everything and then to is really community ownership or community stakeholders whether through tokens of protocols or whatever different other methods so these are two things where like in traditional finance you have some Bank which is an entirely black box completely non transparent and owned by some set of centralized entities instead of the users those two things are radically different and defy and I think the hope is over time it will lead to an entirely sort of different safer approach to composability we're still really early complexity is dangerous or can be dangerous and I think obviously it has been and it probably will be going forward no but great point about transparency maybe mitigating those risks and Johan what do you think yeah my visit there are risks with compressibility right I mean on our set of training it's even it's even another episode which is basically connecting unchain and option a connection with the real world right and it's also interconnectivity composability that being composable with real world legacy systems basically having defied be able to discuss to speak with assistants on my side of course I do think there are risks but it's like with everything if you build the product and you always have in mind end-to-end security and you apply the principles which are basically the principles on which theorem was built on right transparency decentralization good enough incentive systems I do think that you can provide a layer of infrastructure which is good enough for projects to build on right and again I think GFI and everything we're doing here is just about options right at the user I have the option to use this protocol and as this product code I have the option to plug into another photo call and to plug into something else right so since I have this option I can always check how secure is this protocol what does it do what are the risk here right and am I putting my users at risk whenever I'm going to plug into something new or into a new source right so I think it applies for workers do I think this Oracle system is safe do I think I can use it to get real-world data oh I think I can use it to check the price of dye if right now if it's safe then I should use it and protocols can plug safely into me right into what I'm doing otherwise I shouldn't use it right so I do think there is a risk of course there is always risk the traditional client like traditional financial system is not exempt of it actually I think because there is so like because there are no options in the traditional world since everything relies on two daughters like once the dollar falls what happens to it I do think it's a huge strength first words is composability and I think that if it's done when there are risks but the benefits are ten times higher than risk if you look at you know what you have at the other option and alright I wanted to ask you know you come from a traditional finance right so how does systemic risk they're compared to systemic risk in in defy like in what ways is it maybe riskier or or less or not as risky yeah no cami that like being the leads in perfectly to what I was gonna say which really underlies a lot of what Calvin said um I would reframe your question like composability exists in traditional finance it just exists without transparency like hedge funds literally just move money from one place to another and put on these complex trades and I actually think you even have some examples there is um something called the futures basis trade that cost a bunch of hedge funds probably a couple billion dollars just you know last month that blew up when the markets did some some crazy things and that's an example of a particular hedge fund arbitrage strategy they completely relied on composability in traditional finance this is trading futures versus cash bonds and doing all this stuff except there was absolutely no transparency into who had those positions what was going on what the risks were and so I really think you know Calvin's point the radical transparency this is just a different set of trade-offs composability here or the money when he goes thing does definitely create risks but it's completely a different framing given the transparency and given the ability for like Danny said some some dude in his mom's basement can kind of be the guy to figure out some of these risks and there's this community centric approach to security that I think is really powerful so I think it's just a different trade-off yeah it's interesting I think maybe when we're like so deep into define we we kind of forget that this this happens in traditional finance too that everything is connected but just in a more opaque way and when things break it's even more catastrophic than when things breaking in defy okay and then I want to now go go to you know talk about governance another kind of huge topic in this ecosystem and you know starting out with the protocols represented here that have governance tokens on a more kind of active you know community well you know decision-making system so you know it's been kind of a really interesting trend to see a lot of platforms introducing governance tokens to allow this transition a more community led system and increased decentralization but at the same time the kind of what the example we have so far or I guess the biggest example we have so far is maker towel system and you know voting in maker dial has its you know pros and cons but like one of the things that that is you know hard to oversee is how how how feel how little participation it has so how do you kind of balance what you know like handing over governance to a community but then have it be so concentrated that it doesn't actually achieve the goal that it set out to do of being more decent trellis decentralized so yeah I want to give you know opinions from called Calvin hardens tiniest compound galleon uma are introducing tokens and in some ways within their systems so I'm signing what why don't you start yeah I think one of the interesting parts is that when I look at the governance system is first like what are they governing like usually like pretty much you're either governing monetary policies whether they are parameters in the software or the software itself and I think what the governance allows basically the community to do is to kind of like create a product that they want to support and one of the things that I'm mostly afraid of I think basically we kind of know what are important things and what are not in terms of like governance but I think what I'm kind of like scared is that the governance models that we have will pretty much like we have entities governing the the protocols and and the solvers that are actually there is less power for the actual users to govern and this is kind of like something that we're trying to figure out that how do we keep a governance where basically we don't have whales or big players deciding or venture reforms I mean venture capital is very tie into the ecosystem it's basically an ecosystem where kind of like venture capitalists see that there is a lot of potential here they want to invest in the space and they want profit no one's is in this space basically to to make only good things I mean definitely they are but they're also here to basically get monetary benefit and my biggest fear is that that goes beyond basically what the actual user or the community needs and that's why I think that's very important that we're able to have protections in the governance systems that actually users have lot of say on the product that they're using on a daily basis and and basically that's very difficult to achieve in a token based governance there are mechanisms to do of course that and another thing in terms of like monetary policies is what's important is the open sources that pretty much that the token-based governance that they govern open source protocols because the issue with proprietary code is that you are kind of governing something that might be someone else's property and there might be claims or or those conditions that you're governing my note basically have legal kind of like oversight in what you're governing so kind of I'm trying to figure out like how to make the open source work in the token-based governance and that's something that I'm really into into that and I think one model that works very well is that there is protocol based governance basically the the maximum things that the protocol can do and minimum things and there could be kind of like a macro level governance in terms of like in the actual usage and and how those for example in all this case what we're doing now we're going to announce a governance protocol where we have two folded governance so we have a we have so-called macroeconomics where the whole protocol is governed and in terms of parameters and monetary policies but also each and every morning market that we are launching and the next one is it's basically using units for liquidity liquidity LP tokens as a collateral and and also like everyone who is participating in that particular market ha all right you actually participate and decide what kind of parameters there are in this particular market so it's kind of like a balance between the limit or a combination economics and microeconomics and that's something that we're trying to figure out now at all they're now interesting I mean it's it's a really untested space so we'll be I mean yeah we'll be great to see what these experiments how these experiments turn out a common compound I mean you recently started you know we should come talk in and I think just had two new proposals within within the system so how are you trying to to make governance actually achieve this goal of being more decent choice I mean for an outcome tokens is only used by shareholders off of compound right like it's it's it's not even distributed widely within user so how do you get to that path yeah I the perspective I think I can sort of talk to my personal perspective governance is very complicated I think everyone with within on the combat team probably has a slightly different perspective but I first got into just for a little bit of context I first got into crypto and really Bitcoin because I thought it sort of merged these strong interests ion technology economics philosophy and really how do you design systems that are useful and good for large groups of people they manage incentives right and somehow huge groups of people are able to sort of work together collaborate or achieve amazing things in these really called complex systems in like society and like the traditional economy and now I think in dphi you're finally starting to see a ton of experimentation that's a little bit more along this sort of economics and philosophy really like how do you organize a community a line of thought and you see a lot of mostly technologists now moving into this world of like political theory basically the talaq is someone who have been brilliant at this a lot of people are but it's a very different beast than solving technical problems I think like when you talk about governance you're talking about human problems I think you look at like governance in just the world in political systems and it's an unsolved it's a problem that probably has a different answer in society every couple of years so I don't think there's gonna be any like hard and fast rule to what is a good governance system I don't think any efi governance well first of all I'll defy government systems are super super young except for maker and even there's just like a constant process of experimentation but I don't even think we have really great definitions of what is the ideal amount of decentralization we don't even have a definition of what you decentralization is all that scent is just we you know have a pretty we think novel and experimental token distribution plan that's coming for tokens to be basically distributed to users of the compound protocol it'll be another experiment defy itself will probably need a hundred more experiments to get to a point where there's a really robust governance system in any project governance is really kind of months old you know in obvious token khyber they're all the synthetics there are these new sort of governance aspects that are being added to tokens that are just months old so it's really really early but I'm excited to see what comes next obviously yeah it's hugely ambitious like you said like all these protocols are trying to solve technical problems but you know have been untested but also like societal problems that have you know with solutions that I've also been untested so it's it's an incredible undertaking and I wanna with this question about good Hayden says you know Adam I think everyone here UNICEF is the only vertical with no no token I'm like really minimal governance so why did you decide to go with this path and unmute yeah so I'm not I'm a big fan of you know community participation community stakeholders I wouldn't say that I'm anti token or that I'm anti governance I think that it's you know very important to be very careful with governance I think it's you know a tool to be wielded with caution because you know it gets to the fundamental security properties of the system that you're building so with you know swap my approach has always been you know automation first you know automate everything that can be automated and then you know if there's anything that can't be automated then maybe you know that's an area to look at putting in governance and you know obviously there is like an efficiency component where you know it will govern in to make more efficient but less automated and that's of its own trade-off space but you know I worry about you know if kind of broad governance over things that don't necessarily need to have like voting or governance on or you know if if a group of people could vote to break something then you know that's just something to be aware of and maybe it's impossible to create that thing without that but if it is you know then you know if you can automate it then people can rely on the system you've built to you know work more reliably you know they can rely on etiquette I kind of continue to function for as long as you know the smart contractor as long as the etherium works and I think that's like a very powerful thing and it's just you know I'm hesitant to you know break that fundamental property where people know that they can always rely on it for sort of experimental governance I and I'm a huge fan of all the government experiment and I will say that you know of all the protocols in this in this call Eunice WAP is the one that's probably most suited towards automation like the use case behind it I think no trading is more suited towards automation than something like you know like a you know a pooled lending thing we're pulled lending you have this you know you have this broader systemic shared risk and for something like unit swap you have these like separate liquidity fuels and they all have their kind of their own risk to them but it's not you know liquidity providers on one pair aren't gonna share risk with ones on another pair and so you have like very clear stakeholders in each system that can almost make local decisions without needing this broader governance to it so I will say its not no thats not a shot at anything I think that I I love all the governance experiments going on but I'm you know I'm very cautious of governance in general and think people should be careful with it Jenica would you ever consider issuing an yunusov token and you said you weren't opposed to token no I I mean if I thought that it you know if I thought that you you know fill the role that could not be done with you know with automation and for sure interesting okay so I really want to leave time for for questions and I really wanted to talk about uma and teamlink tokens but I think we're running out of time yeah I think we should go to questions oh my god we had so many more topics that we didn't discuss but we'll have to do another panel so let's see what are some of the questions people in the audience a virtual audience had okay how would you weigh an account by believability so related to governance I think people were talking about maybe alternative governance systems where maybe you know people could vote according to their maybe the reputation rather than you know the amount of tokens they hold I think okay there they they were directing this question at I'm Stanny so maybe a Sonny can start and if anyone wants to add to to censor go ahead yeah alternative to tokens or different model I mean I think the governance really it depends what's your governing I mean if you don't need a token to govern I I definitely agree like if automation I mean I run a real provide your Maps if I if I queued like like basically head and said and and also like I think what shall be said about kind of like organizing society is better that's also like very key part you're you're probably not always like governing different kinds of monetary policies but you might actually want to just organize things better and I think what dowels are doing very well I mean they are organizations and kind of like you're able to create a global organization and just basically organize and and basically community in a more efficient way or more like a transparent way so I think in terms of like alternatives many of the yeah any of the the kind of like inferences I see is how companies are governed for example I think like the difference between let's say a token based governance or how theses are governing their investments there isn't that many difference every every kind of like investment burden whether it's social capital investment monitoring investment or just basically a pork investment there is always governance in place it just happens in different ways and I think it really depends on what you are particularly governing and and I think as we heard here like everything so early it's very difficult to say like anything what will be like the many the exact correct model to defy protocols and I think what's the coolest part like everyone is having their own kind of flavor of governance and it's kind of like will be everyone is having their own experimentation and basically time will tell what will fit everything and I think that's also kind of like the same thing with with you MA and and they're like future governance model I mean everything has a flavor yesterday I actually wanted to hop in there and kind of riff on that idea for a second and talk about governance in traditional corporations too because you're right like governance exists so traditional corporation we have shareholders who elect like a board of directors who elect a CEO to make all these decisions in this company right and if you think about something like Jeff Bezos and Amazon right you can't ask the shareholders to make all the decisions Jeff is making running this giant trillion-dollar company but like wouldn't even be conceptually possible or technologically possible to put to a shareholder vote every decision Jeff is making but what's so cool and interesting about this space Loraine is that we're designing more simple protocols to sort of Haydn's point automating a bunch of things and then having a relatively limited set of decisions that we actually don't need to entrust to like a CEO to make we actually have a technological system to ask token holders to make those decisions so it's almost like designing a company where you don't have a Board of Directors you don't have a CEO you have the shareholders directly making the decisions of the company or the now protocol for you and I think that's just a really cool concept a really cool thing to experiment with that's kind of fun okay so another question people have is how realistic is it to use flash loan bots for average users so hate instance you know UNICEF has been pushing this this forward what do you think it kind of depends on what you mean by average user I think of the you know the the biggest users of you know swab for the most important you think that's like the developer is building on top of it and in that sense I think you know definitely any you know any solidity or most solidity developers kind of capable of creating smart contracts and capable of you know building on top of these protocols and creating you know composable applications should be capable of using you know flash loans and flash swaps and and and and the like to you know use all these kind of use cases like the ones that Danny was mentioning earlier if they're talking about like you know running an often arbitrage spot that uses flash loans to lower its capital requirements and you know not require any any upfront capital I do think that you know that it's gonna require some level of technical sophistication but less capital so you will still need you know to run kind of like off chain Bolling systems you always need to be kind of you know somewhat technological but at least there would be like a lower you know you won't necessarily need to hold all the tokens that you would otherwise need to hold to participate in the arbitrage but yeah you you yeah one shield for project called photo combo so they're kind of strike they basically tried to create no codify building blocks for for basically I mean users that aren't developers really interesting to see like what happens you can basically combine like taking out flash loan and making the arbitrage but it's it's of course like interesting to see where this thing goes but I'm very excited about all no stoppin yeah yeah I'm excited about the no code movement since I can't code it and I really like defense up all right okay so let's see oh there's one more question and then we'll have to wrap up someone is asking can I create a token on guma using team Lee random number Oracle and traded on UNICEF so who can answer that one I mean I'd have to ask like what that exactly would be if the idea here is that you created token that at some expert aid in the future has some random value so it's like a bet on some randomness that's kind of crazy but couldn't you do that yeah then and can you trader on you so up yeah I have no idea how anyone would price a token today that has some random value at some point in the future probably at the average value of the random number generator and maybe some kind of game very safe to use something like this like a card or something yeah but I guess the answer here is okay this is a hackathon you guys can build whatever you want and it's pretty wild what you can't dream up okay so that's maybe go see a category of like really weird things that maybe we'll see come out of this so I don't know buying this token would be like betting on like chance I guess like randomness which is pretty cool all right okay so we have a couple more minutes I don't know if I'm pushing it but you know there's one question that I I really wanted to talk about and there aren't any audience questions so just you know to ask you quickly about this the connection between traditional finance and empty fine I'm just really interested to hear how you guys think that will go go in look what will happen in the future if you know defiant and Trust I will work together and if I set out to replace it if traditional finance has a chance at like building competing protocols like if something who wants to answer this one and I don't think we have time for everyone to to go for it but who like really wants to okay very quickly on my side I mean I still think that's here it's really again an example of options right and I do think that it's very probable that the two systems will work fine in parallel for a long time still because again people won't be forced without is right it will be about options I think a lot of people are very comfy being in this traditional financial system that they have today and that basically the alternative we'll talk to a lot more people as we start going towards a path where you have negative interest rates basically a lot of stuff which will attract investors to the g5 words and yeah I do think that's also a point for records were basically since rates is part of systems running for a very long time you'll still always in the bridge between these two kind of words to communicate with each other yeah also also think defy for now it can definitely provide a a good option of a good alternative for those dissolution with traditional finance or just not not getting enough you of them on their savings all right I think we'll have to wrap it up unfortunately this has been such a great talk I have so many more questions to ask you all but yeah we'll have to leave it for the next time thank you so much and thank you have money for putting this together and see terms of quick closing we have we have over 50 people joined from a little bit over 20 countries attending this is the past hour so thank you so much for everybody who took at the time during their morning's or late nights - hey everybody chat and uh with that just quick notes on to the all the hackers that we saw off your check-ins for for this week they'll start today so if you haven't gone back to us on on disk or word please do and for everybody who's looking to get feedback on their project for this week that feedback session will happen exactly 24 hours from now so 10:00 a.m. Eastern or North when 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time so that's that's 21 hours from now I am in a different time zone and uh and you get to chat with some of our mentors and our sponsors and also some of our judges and panelists who I'll get feedback on what you're working on so thanks again and we'll we'll see you all on this Court
