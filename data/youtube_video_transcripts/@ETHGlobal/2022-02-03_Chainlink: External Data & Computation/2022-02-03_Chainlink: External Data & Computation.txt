thing right today pat yourself on the back that's a great way to get this hackathon started we're joined here by patrick from the chain link team awesome guy awesome team and he's got a great presentation coming up for you um i think we'll be taking questions at the end i forgot to discuss that with you prior to this but if you'd like we can take questions during if you have a preference uh other than that i'll let you introduce yourself probably better than i can and you can take it away the floor is yours awesome well thank you so much for the introduction and hello everybody welcome to the uh the chain link presentation for road to web 3. part of the eth global hackathon suite really excited to be talking to everybody here um and be participating in this hackathon so i'm going to do a little presentation here but i really like to be uh to have these be pretty collaborative so i think youtube chat is disabled so everybody in the zoom here um you see the chat uh yep luke just posted in the chat if you have questions as we go along feel free to go ahead and ask great so i love these be collaborative that's really how you're gonna learn the best that's you're gonna get the most out of this um as well so let's jump in i'm gonna go ahead and share my screen here hopefully everybody can see that let me make sure i can see the chat all right cool so yeah so today we're going to be talking about hybrid smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks now there's a lot of big words in there uh what do those mean what why do we care about this why do we care about all these different things oh actually excuse me but before we do that a quick introduction my name is patrick collins i'm a developer advocate at chain link labs work on the chain link protocol you can see some of my contact information there and my little frog that's what i go by on twitter anyways so these oracles smart contracts decentralized what what all these big words let's go back to basics for a second right for a quick second let's remember why we're here why are we doing any of this right why are we built why are we at this hackathon what are we building what is the purpose of all this technology technology is really only as good as the problems it solves so you don't understand the problem don't really understand the technology don't understand why we're doing what we're doing right so let's go back let's understand the purpose of smart contracts because in order to really understand chain link we need to understand what we're doing here why is everything we're doing so important so let's go uh let's take a look at traditional agreements today and and that's the uh the problem that blockchains solve and that these smart contracts solve so what's the issue with traditional agreements what's the issue here well the issue is that the people who are creating these contracts and who own the execution of these contracts have this massive conflict of interest right whenever we make an agreement with somebody basically what goes on is they say hey if you do this i promise i will do something back for you i promise i will do something and there lies the issue right is we have to trust that when someone says they're going to do something or entity or a group or a corporation says they're going to do something we have to trust that they're going to do the right thing and we put a lot of trust into them doing the right thing right when we work with a bank account we trust that they're going to let us withdraw we want to withdraw when we work with a landlord if we're renting someplace we're trusting the landlord isn't going to kick us out or evict us for weird reasons sure there's all these laws and legalities that can help protect us but that there's this whole line of hoops that sometimes you might have to jump through to fight back right and there's all these things that can still happen when those laws are are maybe a little bit more gray and additionally the people who create these rules have this conflict of interest now what do i mean by that what is this conflict of interest if an insurance provider for example says hey i promise if you get hit by a bus i promise to pay your medical bills they actually aren't in the business of handing out free money right that's not why they're in business and any business who uh whose business models they hand out free money up they're probably gonna get they're probably gonna go out of business pretty quickly right so they have this conflict of interest they don't want they don't always want to fulfill their agreements now where have we actually seen this happen in real life well most recently we saw this happen with robin hood right what was the promise that robin hood made robin hood said hey come to our platform they painted this wonderful picture of what working with finance and working in the stock space looks like this they come to our platform and we promise we will give you access to the markets and to stocks and to investing into shares and all this wonderful stuff and then what happened well if you were keeping up with the news around that time they pulled the rug on their users and they said ah well not like that you can't interact like that because it's not good for us anymore so they did what they went back on their promise all these users trusted robin hood and they ultimately didn't fulfill their promise because there was this huge trust assumption that we made when interacting with robin hood now whether or not it was right of them to pull the rug doesn't really matter they had the ability to do so right they had a switch they could flip and say ah not anymore and this is this trust assumption that we made we also saw this with uh one of my favorite examples is the mcdonald's prizes so more than 13 million dollars from mcdonald's uh monopoly winnings went to some some crime rig right so this was again uh mcdonald's making this promise hey play our monopoly game we promise you're going to have a fair chance of winning and you didn't you did not have a fair chance of winning because it just went to the same group of people 13 million dollars with the same group of people you had no chance of winning so they went back on their promise now whether or not they had control of that doesn't really matter right there is all this lack of transparency that made it impossible for us to even know if they were being honest with their promise and additionally i have bad faith insurance here which i didn't want to put any exact cases in here but when an insurance provider says hey you get hit by a bus we'll pay for you and then they don't and that's no good because that can obviously lead to tragic consequences so there's all these issues with traditional agreements and that's why we're building the world that we're building that's why we're here that's what this is really all about it's these smart contracts these these cryptographic agreements that remove these trust assumptions because you no longer have to trust somebody is going to do the right thing a human being an error-prone human being is going to do the right thing because all these agreements instead of being executed by a human being are executed by autonomous code in a decentralized context so no one entity no one entity is running them they're run in a decentralized context this means that we can move from these paper guarantees these brand-based guarantees where they say hey trust us just because to cryptographic math-based guarantees if one plus one equals two do this and that will always happen exactly like that and if the math works if the math checks out it'll do exactly what you say to and this is incredibly powerful because it's much much lower counterparty risk it's much trans more transparent uh you can do things in more efficient effective ways because you don't have to worry about ooh can i trust them you can look at the code and the code will always do exactly what it says it will do which is incredibly powerful so we can move to this this cryptographic um these cryptographic these digitally superior smart contracts now they also have all these other advanced as well like security guaranteed execution transparency like i said trust minimization with which this big one and efficiency but um for simplicity usually when somebody asked me what's what's the deal about smart contracts i usually hone in on trust minimization because that is one of the most powerful pieces uh out there period but all these other pieces um also make these smart contracts in these blockchains outstanding now now patrick we have these smart contracts great we did it awesome the world is a better place well not quite so smart contracts have this issue right these blockchains have this issue what can they not do well they're deterministic systems by design which means they can't talk to the real world they can't get real world data they can't make api calls they can't do an http url call they know nothing about the real world now why is this an issue well if i want to do an insurance agreement for like a farmer i'm going to need weather data if i want to make a d5 protocol i'm going to need data about the price of different assets if i want to do you know et cetera et cetera et cetera the reason for this again uh this is a little bit more technical is these systems are deterministic by design whereas if you started introducing non-deterministic data it would destroy their consensus algorithm and they would never be able to agree with one another right if you tried putting you know random numbers for set per se one node would say hey like the state of the blockchain is seven another node would go well that's not the random number i got the random number i got was nine another one would go the well the random number i got was one chaos would ensue they would never get anywhere right so they're intentionally deterministic um which is a limiting problem right we can't do market data events data retail payments bank payments etc so this is where blockchain oracles come into play now blockchain oracles are any device that interacts with the off trade world to provide both external data and external computation to our smart contracts also known as hybrid smart contracts when they work within oracle in some capacity so they have their on-chain logic and some off-chain external data external computation et cetera so these are blockchain oracle now you go oh okay great patch we did it we have blockchain oracles we can now get data problem doesn't quite end there why well if you use a single oracle a single node a single point of failure you have effectively reintroduced the issue a lot of people say okay cool i'm going to build my smart contract application it's going to be great and then i'm just going to use a single api from some random free api that i found online and boom my app is decentralized and good to go well you've effectively reintroduced a centrality point of failure that api could go rogue it could go down they could be malicious and want to screw with your app you've just given them you've handed the keys over to them and you've done all this work to make everything decentralized so we don't want to have single points of failure we don't want to have centralized oracles for our decentralized applications we need both our logic layer on chain and our data layer and external computation off chain both to run in decentralized context now here's where we have arrived at the solution here a decentralized oracle network so that all of our off-chain logic all of our off-chain computation is decentralized and our on-chain logic is also decentralized so the data layer and external computation decentralized logic layer on chain also decentralized so what is a decentralized oracle network a decentralized oracle network is a network of oracles that talk to each other and talk to the real world to be this bridge between our block chains our layer ones and the world's data sources and this is where chain link comes in and chain link shines um chain link is a decentralized modular oracle network and it allows us to build these oracle networks that can do pretty much anything they can get pricing data they can get random data they can do external execution computation etc it's this infrastructure that allows these smart contracts to go from you know fun agreements that can do a lot of token transfers and on-chain stuff to feature-rich incredibly powerful limitless customization agreements right because once you have access to the world's data and the world's computation world's your oyster sky is the limit so it's these decentralized oracle networks that are going to keep our smart contracts decentralized and give them feature rich features and give them all these amazing features and again this is giving rise to the system what's called hybrid smart contracts we have some on chain and some off chain uh and i will probably say smart contracts but usually when i'm saying smart contracts i'm referring to both hybrid smart contracts and uh raw kind of regular smart contracts now before i go any farther we have um about 40 people in the zoom call which is amazing uh which means that uh we can take questions right we have a small enough group to take some questions so this is such a crucially important piece to really understand you know why we're here what what this all means so before we move forward does anybody have any questions any questions at all anything you might be like uh following along maybe yes cos okay great question we'll get to that so uh we'll we'll hold that one off for a second and uh yeah please ask questions because this is how we are gonna learn the most amazing oh my goodness i love questions yes okay yes cost we'll get to cos can we compare chain link to anything in web 2 uh yes i will answer that question soon um but actually no i can answer now um sometimes it's compared to http http as being like or or the rails to connect you know different uh applications in web 2. that's kind of the closest one so it's really kind of this um this transportation layer if you will to uh transportation and um execution layer to transport data and external computation so i guess that that's kind of the best analogy how's the integration with docusign what does it do i'm not familiar with that um but i would imagine you could make a docusign integration with your smart contracts all the oracle work more or less the same or go for example uh i'm not familiar with ergo um i don't know who ergo is sorry um but okay great questions uh i'll continue on i'll answer uh some of the gas questions that we move on all right i got nine minutes so chain link features so what are some of these features that you can right now and for this hackathon jump into the docs grab put into your application and use well the first one and the one of the most popular uh features right now is chain link data feeds or chaining price feeds and this number is actually outdated powering over 50 billion it's actually now something like 75 billion um helping secure some like 75 billion dollars in the d5 space which is the same what are these chain link data feeds well in our smart contract applications a lot of them need pricing data like what's the price of ethereum what's the price of a dollar versus solana what's the price of you know polygon what's the price of all these different applications so we need to get this data from the real world because to to a blockchain blockchains don't know anything about pricing right that they're indifferent to pricing pricing value is something that we humans have assigned to things so what we uh what needs to happen is all these data providers all these exchanges need to get aggregated through a network of these chain nodes and delivered on chain into what's called like a reference contract that any developer could then go make a read call to and read ah okay that's what the price of polygon is that's what the price of ethereum is and then they can use it in their smart contract applications and in fact if you go to data.chain.link uh oh okay so it is it is 50 billion excuse me if you go to data chain you can see some of the most popular ones here you can even click on one we can actually change go to different net all that some different just a few of the different networks here maybe we'll hit f2usd and we can see all these independent node operators reporting what the price of these assets are right and you can see all these different parameters on there but these are independent node operators grabbing this data aggregating it so we can have decentralized pricing information and here's kind of a quick picture of what these models look like it's all these chain link nodes off chain talking to each other delivering in a single transaction with all of them signing their answers with their private keys to a smart contract for people to use um here's just a couple of the protocols who are using these price feeds synthetics with a few billion uh being secured by these pricey sushi swap using these price feeds for margin trading compound obviously for pricing underlying collateral of their applications and ave doing doing something similar with billions and billions of dollars riding on these price feeds being decentralized being secure and being incredibly powerful and one of my favorite parts about them and most of the chain link docs is that they come with i call it like one click um one click use so if we're in the data uh the data feed section here we can click using data feeds we can scroll down and we can see all the code associated with them we can go ahead and click open in remix remix will pop open i'm zoomed pretty far in and we get given this uh sample application here uh with all the code already let me with all the code already here i don't have enough time to really go through it but i can demo it right now we've also got a ton of videos i'm showing how to use this we're going to go to we're not going to go to mainnet we're going to go to a covent test net and there's a whole bunch of different test nuts we're going to deploy this contract and while it's deploying the main function we're looking at is this get latest price so this is going to get the latest price of fusd in our smart contracts and if we scroll down now we hit get latest price we can indeed see what the latest price is now a question that we get a lot is why does it look so massive well decimals don't work so great in solidity um so you have to multiply them by some factor of 10 and the factor of 10 defined for this price feed is is eight zeros so this is 2650 and that's the current price of ethereum now now somebody did ask what's the cost associated with these and that's a great question so uh for price feeds in particular uh price feeds are currently being sponsored by a number of different protocols right because any time you request data uh these these nodes are paying gas feeds to deliver this data on chain whether it be ether whether it be polygon you know whatever chain they are paying data paying gas fees to do this so they get paid a link token or what's known as oracle gas to to cover the costs of both running infrastructure and also delivering these data so that's kind of the value of the link token here they're getting paid in it and if we scroll all the way to the bottom we can see a ton of different users who are helped sponsoring these feeds right so that's the current business model um excuse me that's the current model of these networks where these ex these protocols that rely on these feeds being up being reliable help sponsor them so that they can continue doing exactly what they do so um and right now because they're being sponsored they don't to me they don't cost anything for users to um to call them and to use which is great for us developers we can just go ahead and call the contracts that might not be sustainable so that might change the future but that's basically how it works the node operators get paid link token to delivery data on chain and right now this is free for us which is nice or it doesn't cost anything and something really interesting about d5 is like it's we're just scraping the surface uh with all the different things that have yet to come now i'm running a little short in time so i'm going to kind of speed through the last couple of of uh uh features here that'll answer some questions another one of the really powerful out-of-the-box applications is chainlink vrf uh this is for getting random numbers because blockchains are deterministic so using something like the block hash or some timestamp or hashing some other weird stuff isn't actually really random and you actually run the risk of somebody manipulating all those variables that you have and ruining your random application which is really unfortunate and it's happened many times so chainlink vrf is a way to provide a verifiable randomness into your smart contract so you can have provably random applications uh there's a ton of protocols like pull together um uh axey infinity uh the gochee pokemon all these ether cards using these especially for gaming for d5 there's a ton of different uh use cases for chain-link vrf next easy out of the box and i gotta speed through this because i'm running really short the next um the next out of the box easy one it's gonna be keepers and this is decentralized event driven execution so uh right now in order for a transaction happen somebody has to press a button and say go do that computation do that thing and that adds a layer of centrality because somebody always has to press that button which in the keepers does is you have a decentralized network of chain link nodes read some smart contract registry on chain they do they call like a check upkeep function uh checking to see if that event has triggered maybe it's a time based trigger maybe you know the price of an asset is has reached some number maybe the liquidity in some pool reaches some point um but once that uh data once that event has triggered the chain link nodes will go ahead and perform whatever action you say you can kind of think of it as like if this if this happens do this right if this do that or like a cron or you know any any event scheduler um that's what these keepers do and then the last feature is uh chain link any uh api calls so chain link nodes can be completely customized to do literally anything you want them to do go check out the documentation this does take a little extra effort because you have to set up the nodes you have to set up the networks you've set up the decentralized network so this is a little bit more in depth but that functionality is there for you to do literally whatever you want um definitely check out the docs um definitely check out yeah definitely check out the documentation check out the blog we've got a ton of youtube videos go to the solidity and smart contract starter kits in our github repo we just released one for daptools and for solana as well a ton of polygon notes in there too and that's basically it and for this hackathon in particular we are doing uh four thousand dollars in prizes uh four one thousand dollar prizes to the best protocols that use chain link uh in their projects so really looking forward to seeing what everybody builds and i know i'm at time but do i have time to answer some of these questions in here i hope i do um i'm just gonna go ahead and start answering them luke feel free to cut me off whenever because i know i'm like five o'clock on the dot okay i'm good to go all right sweet all right cool uh all the oracle oh sorry how to specify the call to external data okay so if you're looking to make a call to a very specific api or piece of data definitely check out the any api call documentation let me pull that up screen check this is pretty much what you're looking for so uh if we scroll down a bit we basically we put our api right in here and this is if we put this in the browser this is what this api is returning all this data here and maybe we want like the volume of this this token or something basically we then say okay great let's go raw f use the volume 24 hour so that would be raw f usd volume 24 hour and um multiply it so that we get rid of all those those decimal places and then in some fulfill function it says okay great once we get that data just save it to some some variable here so we we saved it to a un256 public volume but you can do whatever you want so that's how you get like specific data but again this is a centralized api so you probably want to do some work to set up a network of nodes all graph gap grabbing different data from different apis using different nodes right and that's what i was saying by this tool requires a little bit of extra work so the price feeds have basically gone through the work already created a bunch of different nodes a whole bunch of different data providers to make these price feeds incredibly uh decentralized and secure great question rory no coding skills here new to web3 am i able to use chain link out of the box um yes so chain link is a developer tool so you could learn to be a coder actually there's a there's a ton of amazing um content out there and i i feel like i have to plug um this video if you're looking for like an end to end like literally start from nothing excuse me literally start from nothing to become a blockchain developer like this this course i'll drop into the chat goes through literally everything but yeah chain link's the developer tool so i'm sure more and more people are actually more and more people are building protocols to make some of these services easier and easier for everybody to use great question scrolling up uh chain link iot uh yeah uh so a ton of people have done chain link iot chain linked iot projects which are always really cool um where it's really kind of just it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when when is somebody going to build one that's mainstream that has a lot of value that a lot of people use what oracles are available on mumbai polygon testnet good question so so i um i often do most of my testing on an ethereum test net just because of the reliability and the uptime we can check if we go to polygon data feeds we can check polygon main net we scroll all the way to the bottom uh mumbai testnet so there are a bunch of feeds on here um i think that you'll probably have a better experience using one of the ethereum test sets and then when you want to deploy again because it's a test net you can you can find free gas there um and then when you want to deploy to polygon you just deploy the polygon right so they're both evm everything's going to be pretty much the exact same thing so uh just if you're looking on the docks just go to um like polygon matic data feeds uh you can also find get random number excuse me if you go to contract addresses you find polygon matic addresses uh mumbai tesla addresses etcetera everything is going to be in the docs if chain link is still get the price from exchange decentralized why is it better than get directly from authentic apis eg coinbase how chain the candle if the prices are different from a different debt amazing question robert amazing questions all right let me let me tackle these one at a time so the first question oh i lost my the first question is if chain link is still getting the data from exchanges why is it better than just getting the data directly from that api amazing question so let's draw a comparison here right how is it how is polygon running with or how is ethereum running it's running by a ton of individual node operators running the software so in the same regard is that centralized well yes right centralized a whole bunch of individuals are running the software each individual is centralized but when you combine them into this collective it becomes decentralized now why is that better than just having the whole blockchain run on my computer why is that better well it's more secure if it's just on my computer somebody could break into my house you know kick me down and uh boom now ethereum belongs to whoever broke into my house right uh it's gonna be uh uh uh more uh trust minimized right if it's just me and i become malicious and i say hey i want all the money and i just i have the ability to send all the money to me centralized right so we want to have ethereum and pog on all these blockchains decentralized and it's the same thing with data right we want to get data from multiple sources let's say we did just do everything from coinbase right and coinbase said oof there's some protocol relying on our api we don't like that protocol well we're going to delete the ap the api that only they use and boom now they're screwed and in fact we've actually seen this happen before where sometimes a lot of these authentic apis have issues right maybe even for a blip there was a time when uh coinbase's api accidentally said the price of usd was like 30 percent higher than it was and liquidated a whole bunch of people because there were people relying on that api so this is something that we want to avoid and this is that's the antithesis of what we're doing in this space right it completely again it defeats the purpose of what we're doing because you're adding back in this switch you're adding this centralized feature back in and so chain link is better because it's it's removing that single switch every additional node every additional data provider does what it removes the chance of one person having the power to destroy everybody and that's what we want and that's why it's substantially better great question amazing question how can link handle if the prices are different from data source eg binance and coinbase another amazing question so let's say coinbase says um polygon is two dollars and let's say binance says it's one dollar who do you trust well this again is where the decentrality comes in this is why not having one of these people as the the single centralized sole proprietor is is good right so we say okay great you know let's maybe let's look at the volume on each one of these exchanges let's look at what price they're getting let's look at um who are the buyers who are the people allowed to buy we can come up again with a decentralized aggregate so we can aggregate from coinbase from binance from you know all these other all these other exchanges to get a truly decentralized reference you're on the ball great question how do you feed price and smart contract who's going to trust you if you do oh lucas perfect actually luke is perfect who are you going to trust if you do it by yourself who's going to trust you if you do by yourself hey come trust my api that that your your your 20 billion protocol yeah trust me trust my centralized power where i have the ability if i want to ruin you right exactly good point lucas could you use chain link for something different than price feeds yes absolutely random numbers uh event driven uh execution and literally anything else you want so that chain link any api feature gives you that functionality to do literally anything but again that's definitely the most uh labor intensive one right because you have to set up all these these these pieces of infrastructure so yeah so i'm i'm again this is isn't a matter of if it's a matter of when i'm waiting for uh when you know there's more weather data on chain there's more sports data on chain there's more you know every type of data on chain great question great lucas lucas is on the ball lucas i see you in the chat hold on lucas uh so chain the golfers pay eth gas fee in exchange of get link back if each gas fee becomes crazy high will this stop nodes from running amazing question so uh so this kind of goes back to the payment model of these node operators and they get paid more uh when these these gas feeds get really high basically that's kind of it yeah so no it won't stop the nodes from running there's so many chains right it means blockchains are new companies so many networks out there we can build here uh we can build there build on polygon build on ethereum build you know blah blah blah what is your vision for the future is possible to start building really an open source in a public operating system for the planet something really open source and public amazing question thank you for this question um [Music] the tl dr of this answer is yes it's absolutely yes and i think that we're moving quicker and quicker to a cross-chain uh world a cross-chain environment where there are going to be multiple chains and they are going to do different things and they are going to have different value adds right we have polygon right it's a it's a much cheaper um side chain right and it's moving towards being more layer two layer two e and that's that's a whole nother conversation um we have ethereum which uh has this really uh decentralized first mantra but it's really expensive right now right we have all these different chains that do all these different things and what chain link actually does and what really really sets shielding apart is chain link is this connecting piece that connects them to each other that can connect anything right and can we actually build this in the open source yeah that's what we're doing right now all of these well most of these blockchains are open sourced and you can see the code and you can participate in the code and you can participate in the networks so absolutely yes can we just request some search engine and take the first result mikhail you absolutely could do that but once again let's say the search engine doesn't like you and wants to give you bad data boom now you're screwed now your application is ruined so yeah you can totally do that uh it's just not going to be very secure application right again and this goes back to like the coinbase question it's like oh well hey like you know coinbase is super reputable like why don't we just use coinbase hey like facebook is super reputable why don't we just use oh google's super reputable you know the surgeon have named me one centralized group that's never had an issue you can't right uh google has gone down facebook's gotten down uh microsoft's head is you know all these systems they've had issues because they have this this centralized flip that they can switch somebody owns what they want what they can do could chain link be used as a voting system yes yes it could be ricardo and oh my goodness i'm so excited for when that happens that is such a a fundamentally important question an important problem for this space that has not been solved yet whoever solves that basically creates what's called like a proof of personhood right you have to how do you prove that somebody is a person right and you use a chain of oracle to prove that they're a person and boom now you have a way to do more fair voting so it absolutely could be and i'm very excited for when that day comes amazing question ricardo all right adam if i launch my own chain link no to run my own any api job can i set uh it at a free price you absolutely could um but you will have to pay gas feeds still so you could make it free you would just be losing money anytime somebody requests data is the data cache some uh is the data cached sometimes before chain link delivers depends on how the nodes are set up excuse me depends on how the nodes are set up they could be um yeah it depends on all the nodes instead of they could be most of the time i would imagine no right because then you're not going to get the most fresh data so in the global public really public outside the immediate chains do you not have to get the approved of all nodes i'm not sure what you're alluding to or you're thinking about here [Music] how would you so this is actually a really interesting question right and it's kind of like it's almost like you're alluding towards like hey like i want to build something global in public but i don't want to have people approve it or individuals approve it and that's really interesting right because then if that's the model you're looking for then you're getting closer and closer to chaos actually as opposed to consensus right hey i want to build something but um you know i don't want i don't want nodes to run my software or i don't want you know you can actually do that but if there's no consensus then it kind of doesn't really make sense right once again you're going away from the mantra of this um of what i think is really global public and open source uh maybe i'm not following what you're saying but um yeah curious what uh what the follow-up is there hey everyone getting close to needing to set up the next workshop so we'll probably close the session in a few minutes i remember continuing conversations in the discord in the challenge channel yes absolutely yes um all right cool i was just gonna say thank you for for handling all the questions uh if anyone has any final questions we do have another session coming up at 5 30 with the team at sequence which is going to be great highly recommend that but if anyone has any last questions uh well patrick is still here feel free to shoot him in the chat otherwise we can get prepped for that next event coming up in about 15 minutes as stated i do highly recommend continuing the conversation in discord it's a great place to start the chain link channel great place to ask questions if you
