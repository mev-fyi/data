I'll start contact red minus X here the opening ceremony yesterday I talked about - X is a new initiative developer fixing trying to foster innovation on the - platform yeah I'm just going to talk about the - Papa which is a bunch of products that they've all been facing that involves him go yeah freelancer doing I work for northern Asia by just almost I tell this all is basically a very work on adoption campaigns so cities or festivals are kind of you know micro and macro how to adopt a usage interesting okay so you know but it's probably this is sort of a entertain we should welcome the deaths the TomTom api's which you might be just did in their trust wallet which is wallet they require last July that has a wit source waiting for a for SDK and then two other things that people can develop on and then we have a binary pop one - charity foundation [Music] I don't know which part divided up when you guys want to learn and oh you know like you might be do smith.com api's I mean are you okay you know about futures that margins we just announced just just lean disgrace knees we just announced to nutrition products one of those requiring objects and we are kind of having this training competition to to kind of gauge community interested you don't want them listing which one people have interest in they just finished out a few days ago and then we have a margin product sentence of what people can leverage their creates a margin and also we are gonna have an ending product which is my tomatoes we're spending so on the.com exchange side would be debating just kind of having more products that are more comprehensive for traders if you just doing stuff you know towards the derivative which into the Big Mac space and then I guess this year earlier this year we launched the binding chain which is a public train native x4 family so today he has already become the largest he's another change in the space I can go through that message is managing so this could be the same as Bitcoin we're currently not would sort in and within you know live on maintenance for about four months now the reason I can see the didn't want to preach was because our competitors are trying to come up with their own decks and in open source they could just walk in he wants to see more dimension [Music] so maybe you don't know about your notes that produce documoto proposals today and in future will wear these right now us we're now will kind of have that there's a question though that I would call the witness notes at be certain like those you can run it yourself back notice the connector or notes or any we have what they call accelerated notes whichever knows that be one next to the baby's okay close connected directly it's kind of inconvenient like the government's as I said so yeah there's fun unchanged of this an object an object of this is how we kind of improve the chain and we go through the same thing as which is so you can sew the back to the second standard so that one is a kind of a better a bad way to describe like madness and effective is the 22nd may just reflect what a toga dividing change should happen if you have come to BRC 20 and for engineering companies we have two things that Dolly's going on today I guess I'm a proposal to list to issue a token and I'm eligible about it to see what you know today so back to standard basically has these things engine for them which issue transfer to again and then the next functionality is native to chain it has orders way to do myself cancel all of them different orders and Apache project I think it's changed we've been apart for gently to change is something that and you look at the latest greatest like I said you can propose trading pairs and valleys book to decide and I miss how they you know how we support our co-chairs bonuses the fees are thanks and we have revised it as the price of EMP went up so this table so we try to devolve on the by a chain user submitted tips and tricks manager going from an easy to hard I guess the existed SP accelerated militant REST API into stuff and then but also extreme and then you can also you know we have a bunch of SDKs are given either by us or by community it's expanded beyond each language is now and of course we support a lot of audits we have our wet wallet and binding start over and create a wall there and then we have trusted each other so abundant on mobile support I think we support training so we don't have to do Bobby some tests test points so you need to have at least one BMG because you're fighting each other any requests for or you can you know as one gave me an hour or a balanced attack you can just contact us of the score it was that easy [Music] beyond these armies like I said you know things I mean we're very open to other ideas I saw exited you know because this perspective around like building something that so so we didn't get us these are something to swing in the interact with the community and in general the community there's a telegram channel and this one so for this hackathon we are just getting out fellowship and then you come a little bit about the finest culture program it's a program that started in April this year to support open soda dominica and want to see more doing lots that are free and open to use for other developers so we have this project friend program where the only environment to get the grants today is that this year the health of the work has to be open and what was always over so we have unported around 40 plus private so far if you go to this thank you you see something follows it up with some notable ones are like we don't necessarily just grant you know give up grants for finance related on it the first group projects are actually created so we give grants to I'm elevating water bringing mobile water green swap which topics watt which is also project as well but they yeah this is the end of the all right so um what is it is there a way to have like smart contracts operate on buy shoes that like a say but let's say we wanted to have a buy smart contract only get like only give you by X point with certain set of conditions our bed a buyer I don't want to have it write a separate central server yeah like outside of the fire house I'd buy an ad server or the buck in the network right is that possible so we don't support smart contracts at this point we do have a proposal combat fleet that supports HDL skin Tommy Peggy to other jeans especially if you're Jane where you could potentially like sent over OPEC you're talking about chain to etherium for some spiced area come back it's a trusted bridge so he's not gonna trust this thing yet but you can do that with three which is gonna be so for now there's no so the reason is because you know we have to keep it so any additional kind of delay in the state transition it's not gonna help you know you want to but in the future you know if we we find a way to do it do smart contracts with while maintaining mental islands of the back step yeah like using other chains all right so will it be acceptable for now if we submit idea to have it do you have a proposal that would use that maybe a external simple sir but could later be adapted into a smartphone yeah I mean I mean that's a trusted contractor trust so there's some change that the conditions were how you kind of yeah if they say like instead of a way to trust this to this my server best ever I'm telling you very platform all right like what well you talk about linking to other smart contract platforms in the meantime what right that's party - definitely yeah for now I think you know I'm just happy to say assume well what are you doing buddy hey well it's just like anything that releases B&B when certain set of conditions are met right like mini stinks of any smart contractor so like we're going after this tab there's a way to do that before to anything yeah yeah I mean the idea that you know by this game yeah I just came out a different like yeah I think I mean they're all considering everything I would think that ladies whose the weeks ago which you know basically runs a paradigm you trust don't other kind of decent like trust this way to do it is just a wall some ways yeah we could say but now and so far thing you know the Syrians are still on the center has changed and the greedy still there I do it build up like great to be created on the debts and people are serious about [Music] in question it doesn't have to do it by a chain yeah so with keeping independent like oh it's like the answer to initiative to kind of play engage you know currencies to kind of like issue stable coins so they're moving backwards but that isn't moving backwards isn't reading my role in this is to get away from that crap sure yeah I would say you know yeah some people see us moving forward is a step forward because it is still continuing the digital currency kind of would just be on that depends on your perspective okay some people thing is a small step to its where we want to be I know all of us you'll want to just go decentralized well it seems like we're entering we're bringing them back into this one we kind of strategy you know adoption bridge how do we reach all masses even its you gotta have a children for so you gotta do is gotta do it I think there's compromise that has to me yeah that's our next Madame s it's very wallets being used as trust as user adapts as well maybe it would kind of arbitrate you have oh I don't know I'm sure yeah for like mobile stuff you have to use my water that picture there yes yeah well I like that it's still there yeah I think that's something that doesn't have to solve is that yeah you kind of caught me there no one's ever asked you if you do the market right you know I think you trust well it because I think at this point is there water with the most that McCain supported mainly because of the trust fund important open source where changed it just in your video change with possible in themselves and jury base to mean that you don't have to building okay you are okay how many guys are the party shaker so I was thinking of doing something with a smart contract yeah we're like outsource liquidity from finance and then it would be stored in account that would trade on behalf of the user using a smart object but seeing as you guys don't have smart contract I think I'll just use the API and similarly okay yeah I'm very interested in what you do around adoption what like what kind of activities so okay so right now we're on the ground in Amsterdam so we're I mean it's just grassroots to be honest it's just painstaking so I used to do kind of like more like online customer acquisition both kind of getting users a second sub and then I realized for crypto it's not gonna work like that like we have to have the online campaigns and we have to have the offline painstaking work so they kind of do hybrid hybrid models of that so we target let's say events or festivals where they're going to have maybe 5,000 ticketed people are born so whenever there's a ticketed event it could be a festival South by Southwest Coachella or these conferences as well because we're inside the network right you have a ticketed event and then how can we leverage to get in humans like you know celcius has the you know they'll send you Celsius with text messages well if we have 5,000 person event and everyone put in their cell phone number everyone can get you know some kind of some kind of coin $10 everybody gets it right and then that we have them and then we we design kind of like a digital experience to say okay everybody got this coin and what about to make I've got this coin go to this area you can play a game but you can get a beer you can get a snack right so that's incentivizing you just stop pointing and you're going to use it now right so we do that kind of stuff where and that's that with those events or to test so when it's not like it's not a full it's not full loop but it is going to be like okay so maybe they got this point they now have in turn brand new user when will the legally and how can we keep them active in it and then creating methods for that and then Amsterdam we're getting ready to do like a promotion week and we're all boarding bunch of restaurants and then the next Web Summit or the next space fin tech conference will do that promotion and then the restaurants that are taking crypto will have incentives for again the ticketed attendees so it's just kinda like step by step but we're always leveraging large-scale events so that we can get you on board of new users and then the data so for now for now we're not so we're not trying to do from art kind of period is that we are going to give people what they need not give them the whole education so we we have a we using partners that give them off ramp to get Fiat again compromising right because we can't teach everybody everything and things so for what we do is it work you're gonna murder that's very simple can I make more money right and we're saying we're promoting you within the space we're bringing on incentives specifically for this one promotion week where people are going to go to your restaurant because they get a deal we're giving them free promotion and they can get the Fiat off-ramp so it's not a risk for them
