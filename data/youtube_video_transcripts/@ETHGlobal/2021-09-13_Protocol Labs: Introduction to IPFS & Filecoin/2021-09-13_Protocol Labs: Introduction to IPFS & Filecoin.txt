all right i'm going to uh i'm going to open the room up all right all right welcome everyone let everyone join we have some viewers also on youtube if you're in the youtube uh you'll need to come into the discord into the um the zoom chat if you want to do live questions because the questions can be posted by everyone in the zoom in the zoom chat hi everyone i'm andrew with uh eath global you have just joined the 4 pm eastern workshop i don't know what time zone you're in everyone's from all over the world we are here with michelle lee of protocol labs she's going to be doing a presentation an introduction to ipfs and file format um we can take questions in the zoom chat um feel free to do that we can cover that at the end and at that point at this point i'll just let the shell take over thanks thank you um it's great to be here let me get the screen sharing set up for this talk all right how's everyone doing today thanks for coming happy monday um it's great to be here i i'm really excited to talk with you all about decentralized storage um i'm going to assume that if you're at an eth online or youth global event that maybe smart contracts is what draws the majority of you in and i'll talk a little bit about application architectures how smart contracts relate to decentralized storage um how ipfs and filecoin work in brief and then some of the possibilities and building blocks you can use to get started with this ecosystem i'll check the chat periodically so feel free to drop some notes questions anything you want to know in there um so today i'll cover ipfs and filecoin talk through some of the core concepts and explore possibilities um in this session we're not planning to do any deep dives into cryptography or economics um or hands-on tutorials but i have a lot a lot of links for you all um so hopefully this can be a great launch pad for for learning more if you're interested um like i said let's zoom back a little bit i think this is you know a really exciting time in the history of the web because we're at the cusp of this transition from everything being sort of web 2 based um to introducing web3 in a lot of different ways so if you think of i mean this this colorful set of rectangles um is one way we can think about application architectures right so we've got front end in the in the red on top and then that front end is driven by logic um whether it's smart application smart contracts or standard application logic um again you know with different ways to combine web 2 and web 3 logic um and then underneath that logic you have your data so um you can have lots of decentralized data solutions you can have web 2 data solutions and today i'm you know really excited to dig into different ways you can combine some of these tools so um you know like i said you can have fully decentralized apps top to bottom you can have combinations of the two um lots of different possibilities today and i think you know we're seeing the majority of apps that use decentralized tech whether it's ethereum or side chains or new smart contract platforms um all you know making really creative use of the possibilities available um i want to also highlight uh this yellow block which i'll dig into more a little bit later it's what we call storage helpers and these are tools that make it really easy um and developer friendly to connect the filecoin and ipfs network to your uh decent centralized apps so we're gonna dig into some examples um very very soon but first what the heck is ipfs so um ipfs stands for interplanetary file system it's a little bit of a misnomer because it's not like a dropbox or box where you can just upload your files and get them back in exactly the same way you put them online the exciting parts about this are that it's fully distributed there's no central server there takes advantage of some content addressing schemes essentially like fingerprints for your data that make it really resilient to disruption that make it really efficient and overall it's a new approach to the web um that breaks free of the centralized services that have grown larger and larger and taken over the you know 90 of our web traffic um there are two uh important concepts to understand from ipfs um the first is the peer or the node you'll hear these terms used interchangeably and a node in ipfs you know does a whole bunch of different things anything from you know providing services to other peers um having a unique id um setting up encrypted communication channels um but it is essentially part of a network or a swarm if you will um it's kind of the atomic unit of a peer-to-peer network um every peer also has an identity and um and and like uh this um qmt who has a long address like that that's used to identify it in the network um okay so we've got our network of peers once they connect to each other what content do they have how how do they know what contents each you know any other peer holds this is the other key concept of ipfs that's really exciting so um in the traditional web every file has a file name and you end up with files like final final final copy version eight um with content addressing we run data through one-way hash function that produces a unique and reproducible fingerprint called the cid content id so instead of index.html for example you you get a cid out of it and um in this diagram to the right you can see um it's actually a tree of uh cascading cids that all make up the routes to your data so um if your data comes in and gets a new file name we actually you can uniquely identify that match that and it provides a great and resilient way for nodes to um you know fetch data from other peers and and also have trust in what that content is um when you use this decentralized network in the wild there are a couple operational things to consider so who actually runs this global network of decentralized nodes and why right so you can run your own node which is which is fun and a really cool exercise um and and uh you can participate in this peer-to-peer network but if you're running a production scale um you need other things to happen right you can't just kind of like shut down your computer and have your data go online so you can um hope your content becomes popular enough that other nodes want to pin it you can also run your own network of nodes which is what a lot of production users do so they'll manage clusters of uh 10 nodes around the world for example or you'll have a an academic research team in a few different locations globally all run nodes so that they can you know update their data um across the entire network um but this just does require some infrastructure work and not everyone wants to take that on um lastly you can also pay a pinning service basically a hosting service to store your content on their ipfs nodes and there are a few great companies pinata temporal and fura that provide this kind of service but what if you didn't want to pay any single provider for this data what if you could do this in a fully decentralized way using web3 and using trustless ledgers so if you were to start from scratch and design a storage system that is both decentralized and reliable this is how we came up with filecoin so a couple key aspects of filecoin um one it's compatible with ipfs and web3 so ipfs is the building block it means that the two networks can share all the benefits of content addressing in cids um and filecoin also integrates with web3 networks like near chainlink cadera and others two it's entirely verifiable so you don't have to trust a single entity you can check the content ids that are recorded to the blockchain um for confirmation that your data is still being stored the way that it was supposed to be lastly it's very big and very decentralized eight exabytes um it's it's now out of date we're just crossed the threshold to 10 exabytes um from hundreds of storage providers across the globe and this network is governed by consensus instead of any single corporation um all right so filecoin how does it actually work under the hood um this is the the workflow of storage deals that kind of powers filecoin um the first step is that you or your app make a deal with a provider to store your data um and once that uh once that deal is agreed upon filecoin preps your data it translates it into a directed acyclic graph it uses the same processes as ipfs so the resulting cids are totally compatible between the networks next the storage providers generate an initial proof of replication and that's the part of the storage deal that they publish to the chain um so once that uh initial proof of rep hits the chain that means your storage deal is active and um and it starts running so over time providers have to keep proving that they still have subsets of your data and we call those proofs of space time um as they continue to to submit correct proofs they're paid incrementally for keeping up the storage deal and when you get when you're looking to retrieve your data or get it back you make retrieval deals that kind of use the same mechanisms to get your data back from providers um and so this is you know this is a series of steps that puts really usable and reliable kind of metadata artifacts about your storage on chain um it provides a universal reference so if anyone wants to verify if you if you want to verify that the data has been around for a certain period of time or that the data hasn't um been tampered with or decayed the cid's on-chain are kind of a really great resource to be able to do that now all this back and forth is just for your information because when you come to use filecoin there are a number of tools that simplify this for you into a single api call so it becomes as easy to use as aws for example and i'll talk through some of those tools in a moment but essentially this is the relationship between ipfs and filecoin so ipfs um provides a lot of resources for fast and flexible retrieval um there are gateways that bridge from you know your standard http network to web3 there are different options for installing local nodes for integration into browsers and then filecoin is kind of that persistence and verifiability layer um earlier i said i would talk through some of the services and tools and libraries that make it easy to build on top of filecoin and ipfs and let's jump into that now um first i want to go back to this stack diagram right where um the you can have um web 3 built in to your applications at all different layers so you can load your front end from ipfs you can log in with dweb wallets you can use storage helpers to put to put content on ipfs or filecoin and we're going to talk about some of these tools in just a moment so fleek is probably one of the very easiest tools to get started using ipfs um it's basically a way to host your site or application on ipfs um all you do is connect your github repository add some build settings and it automatically deploys for you um you essentially don't need to understand how ipfs works under the hood to get this set up um but they have some great you know logging and debugging tools to to show you what's going on um this is a great way to get your websites and web applications on the open web it's compatible with almost any modern web framework and it's basically dead simple to use so this is a this is a great way to get started if you're just looking to host your ipfs host your web content on ipfs um there are also a bunch of uh different storage helper tools like i said really recommend choosing a storage helper it simplifies deal making it stores to both types of networks with a single call one option uh if you're building desktop apps specifically is to use fleek's space daemon sdk it combines ipfs um and some file coin tools into one background service it runs on your users desktops and it can be bundled with the desktop app um another really great service is estuary um it's designed for both uh for general ipfs and file coin storage there's really seamless deal making verification available you can see the web interface on the left here but the majority of the usage actually happens to the http api and in the middle screenshot you can see some of the deal tracking tools that let you see exactly what's going on with your data um it's uploaded immediately to a hosted estuary node so it's available on ipfs network and then that node goes and makes storage deals with six providers around the web to ensure that your data is also stored um more permanently on filecoin um this is a great tool especially if you're doing any sort of high-performance uh and large-scale data storage um another tool to know about is nfp.storage so this is basically an api library and service um designed specifically for storing nft data when you up you load your data you get back really nicely formatted metadata that's designed specifically for storing nfts and there's a javascript client library available and http api and you can also configure this as your service as your remote service in ipfs the docs have some great examples and great illustrations of what's going on behind the scenes so this is another great way to get started um the last tool i'll share is powergate um powergate i you know i think the name is very appropriate i think it's also a power user tool these this has some really great integrations and bridges to near polygon and some other web3 services if you want a lot of configurability um and and options this is a great tool to consider so essentially it's a docker container wrapped around an ipfs and falcoin node with a bunch of configuration options um that are set by default but you can also change um and uh you know essentially use a few different commands to stage and store and retrieve your data it works there's a js and a go client and it uses a grpc api so you can kind of bundle it into your application um so those are some of the tools the storage helpers that are available um you know we we're really excited to see a lot of developers using these um it's uh it kind of opens up the doors tremendously for building on top of filecoin and ipfs and storing your data in the new world there are a few resources that i want to share the first is this verifying storage on file coin tutorial um this walks through a bunch of the concepts that are at the you know at the root of everything that's going on with the falcon protocol and how it works so this is a really great tutorial um it's also part of proto school um which is a fantastic resource for you know um additional interactive lessons and and um courses on some of these key concepts for web3 so this one is great this is a content addressing uh course and um i think this is this is a great one for anyone interested in content addressing and uh you know cids and you know using location uh using content addressing on the decentralized web um another uh tool that i want to reference is the documentation for filecoin there's a reference with links to everything but also some getting started tutorials and explainers so that's a great resource um and then if you want to understand what the heck is going on you know how does this all work um this is a great paper to check out engineering file queen's economy and this talks through the different aspects and um and uh leverage points and incentives that are designed into the filecoin network to make this all happen and provide free storage for a lot of humanity's most valuable data at the same time compensating storage providers for um contributing their resources to the web um lastly if you need anything at all um we've got a great team that's available to answer questions or just chat you know talk through your ideas um in the file coin slack file coin dot io slash slack links to the token to it to an invite um to join that slack and the phil builders channel is the place to find lots of these people and um you'll be hearing more from this at the end of the hackathon i believe but um we have a fantastic micro grants as well as open grants program to support your uh independent projects that use ipfs or filecoin or any of the kind of layer tool two tools that i've um talked about so you can find uh some you can find all the info at grants.filecoin.io um or you can shoot us an email at grantsfilecoin.org to learn more about these programs let me go in the chat i think i see a couple questions um cool first is a shout out to ian who runs an ipfs node awesome um and thanks andy for inviting anyone to post questions to the chat i'm going to stop screen sharing now um if there's anyone at any questions or things that people want to know um let me run through these okay i need docs for accessing data and integration with web3 interface so um web3.storage is probably the best place to get started um oh actually let me make sure i understand your question streetcar um are you talking specifically about the web3.storage api or are you um are you interested in more generally um understanding data and integrations more generally okay um let's see i think the uh filecoin docs is a great resource and then also going into the fill builders channel um if you kind of explain what you're looking to do um or what you're looking to build um you can find people there who can give some guidance or comment on on your designs can we fetch data from filecoin just like a normal backend um so currently fetching data from filecoin has some delays and that's why we're really recommending that you use some of these storage services because they provide an ipfs layer in addition to filecoin so ipfs provides that really fast flexible retrieval and then filepoint is is essentially like your cool or cold storage um if you use web3.storage or estuary um or nft.storage all of these fetch data just like a normal backend let me try to show you an example from here so this is the retrieve function and it's uh you know to use it as a single single liner to get your data back um is there moderation or censorship of content is what thomas wants to know um okay so i want to make a distinction between um protocols and services so just like http itself doesn't censor content file coin and ipfs protocols do not censor content but any of the storage services that we enable um all you know have a code of conduct or terms of service um that represents you know what um what these providers are willing to support so you can imagine um for example nodes in europe want to support gdpr they can actually the nodes actually can publish their content policies and when you make a deal you can check with each provider what is their content policy what do they support what do they not support um if you use any of these services like web3 storage or estuary um you know they basically deal with miners that support the policies that that they want to um enforce um if you make storage deals directly with um with providers then you can follow you know any any sort of um content policy that they want to promote um fill rep which is stands for file coin reputation is one of the underlying tools that you can use to sort of examine minors over time it'll include their content policies but this this describes like how how they're ranked and published and it even includes i don't think it's live yet but it's actually gonna include um a note for providers that use renewable energy which is super cool um [Music] any links to learn more about filecling hackathons grants opportunities yeah um absolutely uh let's see um grants.filecoin.io is probably the best starting point all of the all the processes happen inside this dev grants repository so you can read about next step microgrants and the details there um you can see some of the accepted proposals and just check out you know what are what are some of the more outstanding proposals that have gotten funded um you can check out the open grants workflow as well and then this section rfps includes some of the areas that we're particularly interested in funding right now we have a lot of joint grants for um web3 integrations uh there's a couple you know storage provider tools outlined here there's there's more of these coming so these are kind of specific areas of interest that um that we have a technical sponsor for and a funder for but you can also apply through the open grants program as well um jose if if you have any questions about that you can't find the info that you're looking for just send us an email to this address and we'll direct you to the right path um mike wants to know what's the cost of using filecoin does every api call require a transaction um the are you talking about the like the financial cost or the um bandwidth cost uh maybe i'll try to cover both of those um so there's a really cool okay great um really cool program called filecoin plus that is at the heart of some of these programs so it basically incentivizes storage providers to prioritize um useful data and that's what we call you know data from um from from anybody who has applied for um for this thing that we call data cap both estuary and actually primarily estuary but nft storage as well do some very lightweight screening of users and then provide storage for free because essentially um for providers it's more prop it's more valuable for them to store real data and then earn block rewards based on that than to store garbage data so this means that services like estuary and web through storage and nft storage can offer free data for consumer usage shubham wants to know amazing can we structure our data like we do in different databases um you can structure your data however you want uh when it gets imported into these um these networks uh cids are generated but when you retrieve them they get returned to you in whatever format that you you put them back in basically it serializes it into a car file and then deserializes it when you read read it back out um any sort any links for open source applications using any of these data storages you mentioned um if you want some demo applications um we the documentation has some examples um and so that would be a good place to look uh and then um there's an image gallery example for web 3.storage that you can walk through and then i think there's a full github repo that you can fork and play around with um destroying and calling cost you token and gas fee too um it will it does not the costs uh is free to end users it does when you make the deals yes there is a small amount of gatsby associated with writing anything to the chain great well i think that's the end of the questions that i see um anything else feel free to find us on file coin dot io slack my handle there's mosh um i've left some email addresses and contact info in the chat and um thanks everyone for coming and talking decentralized storage thanks michelle we'll end the stream here remind everyone they can always go into discord also and find the um find the full team there um more workshops this week that was a great presentation michelle super appreciated goodbye everyone
