yeah there's 14 people on youtube so that's good yeah it looks like we have a couple a whole bunch of people have just been joining so we're good whenever you're ready jacob yeah i think we can get started with the stream i'll kick everything off okay we're good awesome great well thanks everybody for trickling in and for watching on youtube um you know excited to have uh pocket network um as one of our event sponsors um as well as you know running a prize that really almost any hack can take advantage of uh for this event so um you know be sure to check out what they're gonna say here and of course on the price page afterwards um so yeah we have we have alex and we have alberto from the team here um they're gonna take it away um and uh i mean they're the experts so i'll turn it over to them um and yeah feel free to you know at the end you know same time for questions or if they're open to it you know drop them during during the actual workshop so um yeah without further ado i'll turn it over to the pocket network team great thanks a lot jacob i appreciate the introduction so hi everyone i'm alex romani i'm team lead of app solutions for pocket network so i'm here to talk to you about what is decentralized finance and is your app really d5 so what does decentralized finance mean decentralized that's a word with many connotations finance is easy decentralized does it mean free from uh banking controls does it mean free from governmental oversight doesn't mean free from sec oversight means different things to a lot of different people i want to talk to you today about decentralized data so decentralized data is the often forgotten part about d5 where are we all getting our data from almost 100 of us get it from centralized networks we probably all share the same sort of four steps when we start a project we open our ide we create a folder we make it a git repo and we get an api key we get an api key from a centralized provider because what are you going to do when you're developing a product are you going to spin up a node running full nodes isn't simple running archival modes is absolutely getting ridiculous it was a year and a half ago i think the last time i tried to spin up an archival mode two terabytes in size for blockchain data and it's just getting crazier as we go we're up to five terabytes now you can give it the most powerful hardware in aws and it's still going to take you weeks and weeks and weeks to sync so no one does this obviously we all get centralized api keys as our application grows we grow with those infrastructure providers and we get off of their free tier plans and we start going to bigger and bigger plans and we we pay them but is that really decentralized is that really can you call it really a defy app when we're all getting our data from this centralized database there's got to be a better way we all make these sacrifices for centralization but we don't have to so i want to talk briefly about what is pocket network and i'm going to skip pretty quickly through these background slides because it's really not important to what we're doing with the hackathon but i want to give you some background if it sounds interesting please connect with us on our discord please connect to us on the ethonline discord we have our blockchain devs they're happy to answer any questions about how it works and you can connect with me in the application solutions team about integrations so pocket is a protocol that incentivizes people to run full nodes for any blockchain or really any publicly verifiable database now that little second part at the end makes it really interesting that any database can be a it can answer to a pocket note so not only does it incentivize people to run those notes but it incentivizes node owners already running them to open them up to you so for you to get to that rpc data they one want to have security to their node and they too also want to get paid a little bit so we pay those with crypto economic incentives we pay those node owners to open up their rpc data to everyone we control that access through our pocket protocol so a quick overview of the protocol we have sdks that use that our client your clients use to get their sessions those sessions then allow them to relay requests to external blockchains those external blockchains can like we said literally be any blockchain ethereum based bitcoin base whatever chain based it can be an external database as long as everybody can agree on what that databases content should be so what are pocket sessions sessions are deterministic and stateless and that's important because that's what makes the protocol trustless you can get that same session of what nodes you're supposed to talk to from any pocket dispatcher you get a new set of five service nodes with each session and one relay batch per session comes in to activate those payments now that batching is important because that's a bit of the secret sauce with the protocol and how we make the whole thing work for the blockchain briefly gloss over the finality layer but again if you be curious please grab our white paper come talk to our blockchain devs happy to talk about it we use a tender minute tendermint consensus pure proof of state we forked cosmos sdk quite a while ago and we've actually contributed back to their ecosystem with some fixes and like i was talking about our special sauce is the zero range zero knowledge range proof that our blockchain does came up with to validate and pay for relays in a batch system so you can imagine if you're doing thousands of relays per minute and node runners are taking in those relays and they're serving you this data well they can't do that proof of work for thousands of relays they have to batch that proof of work into one small little proof and using this special merkle sum index tree we validate these relays and we pay out so 89 of our block block rewards go to the relays process one percent to the block proposal validators of the pocket chain and ten percent torque and that was important because the pocket protocol is going to become decentralized we're going to you know reach um take ourselves out of the governance of the management of the protocol and it's going to become up to the doubt so what happens when you normally get on a free tier plan well your application grows and grows and grows past the free tier 100 000 relays per day the most typical that's pretty quick to get through like that that's not a lot of relays and soon you're going to be paying months month over month to this fast service charge so with pocket it's different you purchase your relays through an initial state and that initial state doesn't go anywhere you purchase that pocket you stake it and you get an x number of relays per day in perpetuity until you want to stay here the developer state rates like i said are adjusted to participation rate governance all this of course doesn't matter to you your bandwidth is free we're giving each online participants 1 million rpc calls per day that's 10 times what you're going to get on another free tier and we also include more chains than they do right now we have mainnet ethereum archival ethereum poa covan rocks and rink bee goldly and pua dye so that's really interesting we have xdi already on our our system so that you can do these cross chains uh you know interesting applications uh using this and more chains coming online soon it can be anything i'm you know advocating for big bitcoin and getting some other more uh more older chains on but this right now we're focusing on our ethereum system so how do we get started as an application developer on pocket super simple sign up to the pocket dashboard create your application in the dashboard and determine your integration map now if you're like me and you say well i have to sign up to a gui a dashboard that doesn't sound that appealing and if you're like me i i would rather do everything through the cli and good news you can't you can do everything through our cli if you're a normal pocket customer not on the free tier so unfortunately our free tier signs up through the dashboard which we just launched today you get all of your information all of your data through the dashboard and manage your application because we're actually the pocket speakers that hold the private keys to your free tier relays so let's go through real quick what it looks like to get that dashboard and get that free key if you've done this before on other infrastructure providers which i'm sure you have it's going to look pretty familiar so there's talk about these integration methods real quick there's two methods of accessing the pocket network we have the fully decentralized method and we have a mostly decentralized the fully decentralized method is our base pocket s pocket.js sdk integrates directly into application has the lowest latency between your clients and the nodes that are servicing them so i mean that's really important right when latency is important to your application you want the fewest amount of hops you want the most direct amount direct way of integration that's definitely the way to go it also gives you more ability with the configuration files that you can modify yourself and how your application talks your pocket now we also have another service that we call a pocket gateway this uses a centralized dispatch system to serve your application the information on the sessions and it also proxies the relays for you so if you use another centralized service provider it's going to seem pretty similar but the one caveat there all that data is being served by decentralized nodes you're no longer beholden to one stack on aws one stack in gcp you're hitting nodes all over the world serving you this data that is agreeable so a quick look at pocket.js and what that integration looks like uh it wraps the json rpc call so you communicate with the pocket network your clients have a direct connection to the blockchain nodes that are servicing them signs and verifies every request that's made and it's also available as a web 3 divider so if you're used to integrating with web3 provider it's the exact same integration method with apoc js if you look at our github repos you can find that web3 provider pocket gateway if you're used to using the centralized services that we've all used before the pocket gateway will seem very very familiar you adjust the security settings of the gateway via the pocket dashboard those settings include things like whitelisting origins whitelisting user agents uh setting a security key that must be required within the request same sort of thing on the dashboard you get your endpoints for any blockchain so why do we have these two integration method methods and why is our ethon line price pool split into two well the gateway's easy anybody can do the gateway everybody's going to sign up for an api key for some service to get their data for this hackathon might as well be pocket anybody can do this and get in our price point so that's the gateway prize pool 500 down to 100 more interesting on the other side is if you actually do the direct integration method which i'll show you in the end probably takes you 15-20 minutes at the most much bigger price pool and much more flexibility in what you do with the system so let's take a look at where everybody's going to start because that's how you're going to access your free tier and get your free relays is the pocket dashboard dashboard.pocket.net these links are of course available in our east online discord uh feel free to jump in we'll help you help you get set up so the three basic steps sign up for an account create an application and wait for the application to stay so this is the part that's different from other providers is that we're actually staking pocket on your behalf when you go through this process so we have to wait for a block to pass for that state to activate so create an application very basic fill in a few fields application name email etc create an app now this is the important part where you're getting your applications uh private key file so like every other screen that has a giant yellow information warning bubble there uh this is important right you want to make a very secure passphrase you want to download this file keep it securely you know walk it away in a password manager that's once you've done that save that file right the next screen you're going to choose your chains what that your application wants to connect to so on our pocket maintenance we have like i went through before all of the ethereum chains that i detailed now you're not able easily to go back and change this so with your free stake in your free tier wrap i suggest just using all of the ethereum chains you never know if you're going to want to you know eventually uh talk about wintery or you know get an archival feed so there's no harm in staking every ethereum chain that you ever might need to talk to your relays aren't split up you have the same number of relays for however you want to use them that's it on the next page you'll see do you want to pay or do you want it free choose the pre launch offering get started for free that's it once you hit that join now your application is going to start staking your application will be created you'll have a new selection on your left hand side when you go to apps you'll be able to select your application and the state status is going to change after about 15 minutes somewhere in somewhere between 1 and 15 minutes when the next pocket block passes your application will then change the state and a new button will appear gateway settings so let's go through that really quick first easiest method of integration this is going to look familiar to the settings page of other centralized infrastructure providers you have your application id your secret key and here you select your endpoints for what blockchains you're going to access same sort of configuration you might be used to do you need a private secret key required and you want to whitelist user agents origins once you've done that that's it you're done you're set up to be enterprise pool you use pocket just as you would any other service provider and you're entered now let's go to the slightly more complex maybe 15-20 minute way to get involved and get in that bigger prize pool and that's using pocket.js so as we went through that process in the dashboard there's two files that we need to fetch there there's the aat and there's the private key so that private key is obvious that one came from the big warning screen the aat comes from your application detail page so there's a little box on that application page when you're after you created it and after it states that you'll be able to copy that those fields save it to a file called aat json once you have those two two files that you get from the dashboard you're all set to go now i'm not going to go line by line through gold and bore everybody with what's going on these files this example is on our repo in the readme so don't worry about you know noting anything down here you'll be able to go to the readme and it explains it even in more detail than i'm able to do here i'll go through a few of the quick configuration options just letting you know what what's going on here so this is just boilerplate config code that's setting up the pocket service for you to access now the two lines that you might want to change in there are the dispatch url that's really what's making this decentralized you don't have to trust pocket you don't have to connect to our pocket network node you can connect to any pocket blockchain node that's running the pocket blockchain run by any infrastructure service provider so right now we've launched with a couple professional service infrastructure providers uh skills rivet quick note a couple others that actively provide these services every day they're our service providers that are providing this blockchain data we're also bringing in other nodes i i run node personally uh so you can you can also write a pop-up blockchain without even stating you can become a dispatch and get your own dispatch request so that's the decentralization part you don't trust us at any point the configuration there instance you can look at that in the pocket.js it's pretty obvious and the next thing you might want to modify is that blockchain so that constant that constant that the blockchain 022 indicates ethereum main net easy switch if you want to talk to ringpi kovan or any other any of the other networks that i showed before after that we've got two requires to go in the file the aat that we talked about and the ppk they say i'm including this pdk in my file does it hold any funds no your your application that you get from the dashboard that that private key does not hold the funds the funds are staked by us so this ppk is not going to cause any loss of funds that's it you're done boilerplate code two requires and then a little block code here so you know admittedly there's about 10 or 15 lines above this that i didn't put in the presentation but that's just boilerplate stuff that unlocks the aat and you can see there the rpc query that's sending the relay to the external blockchains so every time you want to fetch rpc data you send it to that relay and pocket will answer you back just like you were talking to your own personal gather parody node that's it what can you do with pocket protocol we want to find that out so our like i said our pocket gateway prizes are lower it's easy everybody's able to enter literally everyone in the hackathon has the need for this data so anyone can enter and get in that pocket gateway uh pool what's more interesting if you do the longer the longer introduction the longer you integration what can you build what can you do on top of pocket protocol alberto is an expert in researching what things we might want to build or what things people might want to build on top of the pocket protocol so he's happy to answer some questions maybe give some ideas of what could be built there's also the possibility of building uh nicely building quality of life things on top of a pocket protocol that would make things interesting to us if you built it on top of pocket.js things that would improve quality of life for every person that uses pocket chance so to find out about more about pocket network contact us either online discord our discord and as our bonus for each online participants your pocket ebay api keys will never expire that's 1 million relays per day for all of your projects in perpetuity just for signing up so that's it for pocket network and how to connect [Music] so i'd like to take some uh q a alberto is here to answer any q and a uh i'm not sure if i'm supposed to be reading chat or if uh jacobs won't read them up to me i'll check chat here how long does it take for you to add a new chain like bitcoin from kev uh great question absolutely takes us no time at all so the biggest time that it takes the biggest time investment that it takes is the node infrastructure providers coming on board so if any of our professional node infrastructure providers already have bitcoin nodes spun up we could literally have it on pocket an hour two hours like it takes a lot of a few database entries uh some governance chain on-chain mechanisms to add the new chain and we're off to the races and the cool thing about pocket is actually anybody can have their own chain so like if you go through the governance protocols and governance mechanisms you can add your own chain now and if there's demands please let me know like i said i've been advocating for bitcoin for a long long time i really want to see it we haven't made it a priority yet but if bitcoin is a priority to you shout it out in our discord and that'll help me echo that up the chat of the chain so that we can get more things that you want specifically added to pocket uh yeah very cool can existing ethereum nodes participate in pocket network absolutely yes we want that like we don't just want to incentivize new nodes to spin up that that's actually not even a very green solution we want these existing nodes that are already using this power in the world open up right like open up securely through the pocket protocol let us give some access to your data because you have spare cpu cycles like unless you're really slamming your nose to the max like they're sitting there idle most of the time you're probably not using the max capacity that an ethereum node can offer um because it needs so much cpu and so much ram and so much sd power just to keep synced there's always the rpc calls are not very very long time so yes of the chain so yes absolutely existing theory notes can't participate in pocket to do that if you have a node and i don't want to touch too far on this and go too far before we're doing but if you are a node runner come hop on our discord happy to help get you set up getting the pocket that you need to stake and become a note that was the last question in the chat if there's any more or if alberta wants to hop in and maybe offer some grander ideas of what you can build on pocket that would be cool for sure uh yeah i first uh thank you alex uh that was amazing uh it was an amazing presentation um but yeah i'd also like to echo what alex previously said um one you can always build services on top of pocket network itself uh for example the pocket gateway is such a service that we built on top of the the the protocol um and what it essentially does is sits on top of the protocol like like skin and it forwards the rpc requests uh to the underlying uh network of of of node operators um that was an idea that we threw around that i actually thought of it as something i wanted to run myself i like i cleared it with our ceo i'm like would you mind if i ran this as a business like there's an opportunity for we call it aats as a service like let me run this service on top of but it's like oh no that's that's even better for us let's just start that us but yeah that's the sort of thing how can you use pocket.js yeah exactly um same thing with our pocket wallet um and a pocketblock explorer uh the the same rules apply for for that um but i also think pocket network is very uniquely positioned uh to to build uh applications such as like a decentralized block explorer um because there's so many issues that uh plague traditional uh block explorers or at least the the way they're architected right now um like there there's uh usually a single point of view uh with these uh block explorers that end up sometimes leading to issues around handling uh like uh forks and and block uh reorgs and that might be because they are relying on like a single node so by being able to cure multiple nodes uh through a session and every application that connects to an external blockchain via the pocket blockchain relay network gets connected to five random nodes on the network so they're going to be able to cure multiple nodes and essentially get uh the the most accurate data and the best uh uh uh essentially like blockchain data tip um so that that actually i missed a configuration point that i wanted to make it in pocket js we've built in a consensus configuration in pocket js so in case you're running something super sensitive you absolutely need to trust this data that you're receiving a simple flag in the configuration allows you to demand consensus you can specify an odd number of nodes that must agree on the result of your rpc call so say you demand a consensus of all five nodes you send it out four nodes come back with one answer one node is behind it comes back with a different answer well then there's other configuration options do you want to either a you try that call reject the answer or accept it because four was enough for you so all those configuration options are available in pocket js that you don't quite get in the gateway uh yet awesome uh so yeah piggybacking off of that there uh these node operators are essentially they're incentivized to serve uh the the best most accurate data uh to to to applications um if not they get slashed and potentially jailed um so that reminds me uh i should probably make some straight to jail memes uh referring parks and rec um and i think another uh application that uh a pocket network is uniquely positioned for is uh actual like decentralized exchanges or or dexes um and they could potentially also be like uh communicate like uh cross chain um but like a lot of the current iterations of uh dexes that exist on the theorem right now are are like smart contract based and then they have a decentralized front end um but with pocket you could essentially have a decentralized back end as well and truly make it unstoppable um so for me like i'd say those are like the the top two uh use cases uh that pocket is uh uniquely positioned for um and that's where you're gonna get out excited about the prize pool you're you're gonna cross chain or you're gonna do something novel that we haven't thought of uh some sort of application pocket protocol uh yeah so he's the judge he's looking for something that that is something that either we've thought of and not been able to get to or something that you're thinking of and we haven't even it hasn't occurred to us yet uh kev had another question can anything go wrong what are the worst case scenarios uh if any so on with a pocket gateway i've added some quality of life things to that so it retries uh things that they if you have a networking issue it does a retry automatically uh those are sort of quality of life things that you know any application would build in if you're relying on any sort of external api uh the gateway does that for you automatically that's something that's pretty easy to build on top of pocket js so you don't really have to worry too much about getting uh not being able to connect so the worst case scenario is if nodes are continually or even purposefully returning wrong data they will get slashed like there's the pocket.js the protocol has it built in so that if you return wrong data and a consensus and you get um challenged for that data you will be automatically slashed um and eventually you can get slashed to the point of a node where you get jailed and you're taking off the network um now the gateway on the other hand has other quality of life things where if it gets repeated 500 errors back from a node it ignores it in that session and those sort of quality of life things are modules that you can actually steal from the gateway like you can go to our gateway it's open source and you can grab that that relay that node i call it a cherry picker that node system that will ignore things you can use that on top of whatever application you're building with pocket js if you want to modularize that make that better that's something interesting that would interest us too so but yeah that that's about straight to jail that's about the worst thing that could go wrong in this system like if you use if you simply decide to use the gateway you're really not going to notice any difference from choosing any other centralized infrastructure provider except that now you know your nodes are decentralized um so the section kind of reminds me another point that you brought up in the very beginning of this workshop is that uh you could essentially uh call to a any public verifiable database yeah um so uh another potential use case uh that that someone could build is a decentralized uh version of a vpn like a dvpn um uh and i i uh so i like i would love to see see that uh as well um yeah any any publicly verifiable database is a and you can even get it yourself on the chain on the pocket blockchain yourself for new governance yeah so stock indices uh exchange rates all those sort of things that uh projects like link uh think they have the verifiable database market cornered on actually is doable through pocket as well uh and i'll be curious to see how someone could tackle the oracle problem uh with pocket as well let's see it let's see it uh does it make front running easier or harder for ethereum oh no good question i am yeah um i i'm going to back off as a not an expert and there are probably people more expert in this room than me uh to give an opinion um it's sad because i know some people on the core team that would talk for hours on front running um that makes me feel like i'm not expert enough to talk on it uh so i'm not going to give a verifiable answer either way but please hop on our discord and talk to someone smarter than me who can't answer that uh that looks like that's it if there's any other questions rolling in if heather or jacob want to hop in i've been watching the um youtube stream and there's a lot of excitement but no questions okay great well hopefully that that's fantastic hopefully we may be easy enough to use that you don't need it like it's yeah obvious easy to use and if there are questions happen awesome thanks a lot for the feedback there david appreciate it are we all set yeah i think so thank you so much you guys that was a super good presentation great thank you very much appreciate that a lot of excitement about pocket great like everybody can use it yeah hop in our discord we want we were aiming for the maximum participation rate of youth online so show me a project that couldn't use us right so let's get it and also spots are limited in our free tier so make your application quickly do that yep about everyone thanks guys thanks thank you bye see ya
