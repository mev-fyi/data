foreign [Music] let's welcome Jesse to talk about bass and unchain summer hi glad to be here thanks for having me it's Friday I wear my Friday shirt and it's on chain summer Let It Go well when I hand this off to you I'll first want to say congratulations on what incredible week this has been I've only seen incredible amazing excitement on everywhere else on social media and uh I'm sure the rest of your team and you are feeling incredibly grateful for how this it's all has been I kind of family come together so big congrats to all of you thank you yeah we're excited about it um you know it's been a massive team effort it's not just base I feel like the whole world's starting to come Unchained this summer and so I feel like we're we're just joining the party uh so you know it's been so inspiring to see how many folks have been hacking over the last week uh I think we had what like a thousand plus currency more than they were were 11 Shifty another 50. I mean that's crazy uh that's crazy yeah I think that there's a few a couple hundred of those who are building cool things on base um so it's super team super dream super chain Unchained summer all the energy I'm ready hundreds of projects under the projects yeah it's epic I can't wait to see them all um also just doesn't make a fun fact um we uh inspired by super are doing a hunting summer um next Thursday and Friday at coinbase and so uh that means that you're gonna have another you know a few hundred hackers uh joining the efforts you know and we're not gonna be going through the super act stuff but it's pretty cool that we're gonna have another couple hundred folks building on Jane this summer oh wow yeah yeah it's happening um so I think what I have like 20 minutes right now to to get going and we can um end it a few more minutes so I know you have lots of slides if you're ready we can uh I got some slides uh you know pulled together we're doing it uh it's been a hectic week so everyone bear with me as I do this but I'm like look at the Australian resting people in the chat maybe just to start if you're in the chat in the super ACC Summit chat maybe you can just drop like where are you calling in from uh maybe like don't slag or drop a country I guess it's in there but just like give me something uh but yeah hey everyone I'm Jesse we got New York City summer let's go um let me put out these slides you got San Francisco we got the Canary Islands India let's go we are international crew um pretty Epic okay let me put these slides up uh I hope folks Arizona we've got the United States we got Ireland um hey everyone uh I'm jasi I'm the creator of Base uh I've been in the kind of coinbase orbit for the last seven years been working to bring coinbase on chain and building base for the last two years uh and I'm here to talk to you about base Unchained summer what's going on uh and get into it um and before I talk about all those things I just want to talk about this word on chain I think folks have probably heard it enough it just fight then the title but just as a quick refresher uh the way we think about Einstein it was kind of three eras of the world right now there's the before internet days now so we go offline um I was when really we were just you know like if you wanted to learn something you listen to the news you watch the TV uh everything was unidirectional and if you wanted to create something there were all these Gatekeepers the Publishers The Producers uh the folks who basically got to decide could you have a voice and then in the early 2000s we live and that's when I grew up it was a pretty magical time because I think for the first time we could share it with the world we could write uh and it became bi-directional and that's what created Twitter is what created Instagram it's located Tick Tock we created this incredible wave of creativity that I think like transformed the world to the better of the last 20 years but if you reflect on kind of what way wasn't perfect during that time I mean what left a lot to be desired is even ads we were all kind of having this creates even as we were bringing the states I've been teaching to the world um when we were putting it online it stopped becoming art it stopped being ours I put my content on Facebook and now Facebook set the rules I put my content on Tick Tock and tick tock rules I made an incredibly creative things and they got to decide how much I earned based on it and they got to take most of the money and instead what I got was likes and comments which can't be exchanged for food or any of the things that let me live a better life uh grow happier family Build a Better Business and so we believe that we are on the breakfast right now the next generation of the internet which is the unchain era um and we believe that the big shift that's happening is that for the first time not only can we read it right but we can also own and for the first time when we have creativity when we make things and we put them into the world those things remain ours The Song Remains ours and we can earn to reach this one the piece of writing remains and we can urge every time someone engages with it um and we could enter this next era where I think we're going to see much more economic freedom we're going to see folks uh having much more resources and we're going to see folks having much more sovereignty and feeling much more autonomy to actually be able to live their lives and so that's on chain and I think the thing that's excites me about it feels like it's finally here just in the last three to six months it feels like we've really started to have new use cases being built on chain on Chain music with things like sound um unsaid media with things like Zora medical highlight um just incredible folks who were her neighboring roles for Creator launching games uh today on the live stream with the parallel team who's building incredible trading card game uh we have on chain communities uh you know I've been working in in the city of oaklandsfield Oak which is a community currency there Unchained advocacy coinbase has been Leading The Way with uh stand with crypto which is a fully on-chain advocacy campaign where you can mention nft to support get involved uh and activate to you know bring better crypto policies in the world and so we at base are basically trying to figure out what can we do to make it so unchain gets accessible to everyone and that everyone can start to build um we opened up base mainnet for everyone this Wednesday uh so that was a huge milestone after six months of Hardware um and many of the folks who are listening into this are building on he said I think there's like a couple hundred teams that were Building on Base in some way during super app and there's been so much energy over the coordinated as we open up on just to give a little bit of work on bases in ethereum layer too it's built on the op stack it's part of the super chain that's why you're here for super hack and we really think that bass is going to enable the next generation of Untamed products uh and that people are going to have an easier time people are gonna have an easier time using those through interfaces like coinbase and coinbase wallet and all the other incredible walls we're working with rainbow and rap beat and frame and metamask and trustable uh and that this combination of easier application building and easier application using you're going to enable the next wave of crypto adoption that brings millions of Builders and billions of users one of the things that's really important to us in decentralization and so we've been talking about kind of three commitments to the centralization that we've made for base um the first is technical investment decentralization we've joined as the second core developer of the op stack alongside Labs uh we've already made a bunch of kind of key contributions on scalability uh we're working right now something called up ref which is the second client for the op staff and also working on Security Council a few other technical initiatives to help base to centralize faster in every openstack change essentialize faster we also are participating in an open neutrality framework called The Law of chains this is something that we helped go create with optimism over nine months uh and it's the thing that allows us to keep base open and decentralized and permissionless it allows us to ensure that base looks and feels and acts like ethereum and then finally our third commitment to decentralization is that we are funding public goods we're taking a portion of all of the transaction Revenue that's generated on base and we are routing it to the optimism Collective to funds this is uh uh you know really our commitment to ensuring that the underlying infrastructure that enables basins can enable the next billion users to come Unchained as a sustainable funding source that can grow over time and so that's what base is doing but I think the thing to kind of ground us all in is that we're still very early in this journey um there are less than 10 million people on chain there are 8 billion people in the world and so we have to get around 10 million to 8 billion people in the world I'm seeing someone ask just in the chat can you index base with the graph right now the answer is yes the graph fully supports based as does pretty much every other infrastructure provider and so if you need a tool um I would just say ask uh you can pop in the base Discord you can drop in the chat right now I'll tell you yes or no but we've worked really hard over the last six months to ensure that everything or as much as possible supported out of the box okay uh and that's because we believe that it's not just gonna be based it's not just gonna be coinbase it's gonna be all of us that get us from that 10 million people on chain to the 8 billion and so the way we're really trying to kick that off is with unchain summer uh you've maybe seen this on the internet over the last week uh this is uh really bigger than based you know we think about base as joining the party but that the party started at the beginning of the summer when the world started coming on um and our contribution is basically bringing a bunch more people uh to build a bunch more cool stuff and share it with the world and then hopefully bring a bunch of users into the ecosystem so they can experience what's happening uh on chain and get excited and get a crypto wallet um today just as a like shout we did a really cool mint from parallel uh they are building a trading card game you can get a starter pack for parallel at unchain Summer with the parallel or just the uh this gets you uh early access to the beta um it gets you all the cards you need to get started uh the game is really really cool um really excited about it uh folks have been loving playing it and it's all fully on chain we also have a bunch more coming up so tomorrow we're doing launching music with another blog we had to get one two brand in there and so coke is doing a really cool piece of uh on chain art with a bunch of uh artists including kind of the van Gogh a bunch of emerging folks on Sunday on Monday we have a day of action for stand with crypto where we're gonna be telling the world why we need clearer policy on Tuesday we have Blackbird who's doing on-chain restaurants with loyalty they're doing the summer pass uh and then every day all the way through August um we have something else cool happening on chain uh and so if you want to get involved in Sovereign every day there'll be something new to do we also have a trending Tab and a community Tab and so if you build something on base this summer uh let me know you can tweet at me you can DM me and I'll make sure that we get it featured in the community section uh and then if it goes by well if people are minting people are engaging it'll show up automatically in the tunings and we're seeing a ton of eyeballs right now watching somewhere I think yesterday we saw that there was like a hundred thousand class people who visited and so this is a great way to show off some of the cool stuff that all of you all are building um every day in building in in super Act and I think my message to all of y'all is this chart down here that's the gross of l2s over the last year you can see that it kind of started at zero ethereum is the Blue Line uh and then it's kind of gradually grown up and we're at this inflection point where it's growing but there's still more room for it to grow faster and so our belief is that this is it that word here that the time is now that the tools are finally ready that it's on chain summer and that's gonna take all of us to ignite what will be probably one of the most incredible gross Journeys uh we've seen ever in the history of humanity as the whole world moves and so that's my message uh if I add one other thing to say it would be let's go build some cool stuff uh we have a thousand plus hackers here for each Global um we know that there's already a bunch of projects being built on base and other chains that are going to be really impactful that are gonna help tell the story of on chain um and so if there's anything I can be doing we can be doing to better support y'all uh if there's anything you need to make your own chain Summer Dreams Come True please let us know um one last plug on that is we have a hundred each of additional grants alongside the prizes we're doing for super act that are open right now you can learn more about those at prop.com based or you can just Google on-chain summer Grant and those will come out those are for all sorts of things uh you know creative projects uh Building on Base account abstraction infrastructure uh and so if you're building something cool this summer uh please submit it for a grant uh we'd love to support you in the next generation of builders on base and so with that those are all the prepared remarks I have drawn questions in the in the chat uh and I'm happy to answer them uh we can take a few more minutes and then we can call it a day yeah absolutely uh we need uh there's no way for people to ask questions to you directly over voice but if they type anything in the chat we get to see all of them maybe relayed that we do have a technical question coming in which is uh is based already indexed by the the graph right now I mean yeah I answered it I answered a live um because I got the chat live stream um it's fully supported by the graph and pretty much every other infrastructure provider and so if you need something um you can DM me about it I'll make sure you get it sweet um the the other hack ideas yeah or you guys just ask what hack ideas am I most excited about uh I'm most excited about people building cool consumer product uh it feels like the technology is finally there like we have a kind of abstraction we have low cost l2s we have like grid wall that interfaces um I don't know if folks have seen friend Tech but that's been kind of like popping over the last 24 hours uh on base uh and I think it's a great example where it's like you literally just put your phone number you could transfer to e uh you can build uh whatever you want or you can you know like do that free coupon there and you have to engage with crypto you don't have to get a new wallet um so I think that that's awesome I want to see more experiments like that I'd love to see people build consumer products on base um I also am really excited about anything that's Unchained summer themed uh telling the story of the world coming on Jane this summer and every summer until everyone's here I think it's really important and so we'd love to see projects related to that I see someone just asked Linux or Windows if I had the paper between those two I think Linux um you know I'm a hacker I grew up on the command line uh and you know I use bass for a while and actually Chooser uh it's so a little bit out there um but saying when I'm sensing Mac your bud Mac yeah yeah yeah you know like yeah what am I gonna do I'm a Mac User I grew up like taking you apart iPhones and watching and Steve Jobs Keynotes and um yeah grateful for all of the incredible products that Apple has built uh Bryce just dropped into prop house around um yeah you just go to prop That Base uh everything's retroactive and so build something cool put it in there uh and then folks are going to be kind of selecting what gets awarded the grants he's like uh maybe one one question to produce but but uh What uh what's been kind of a big learning from uh from the last 48 hours well it's been a big learning for the last 48 hours um I'd say the biggest learning is just like man there's so much energy out there it just needs to be activated like we weren't really sure how people were gonna respond when we started telling telling everyone this and that like this is the summer the world comes on Jane and I think you like realistically the world's not gonna lights we got a lot more work it's a very prettier every summer you'll be on chain summer I feel like there's something about the like just a vision that we're painting that is getting people fired up and it's like juicing creativity and getting people to do things that maybe they didn't feel and I don't know that's been really refreshing it's been energizing uh like I feel solidly out of the airport like we are solidly in the Builder summer Unchained Sun uh grow it all bring the world um yeah and I bet a little bit of a relief too now uh now that it's murder there this is a little bit less pressure and yeah you know you get to see things through it so yeah I'm really grateful that this is down the world now and now we're past the launch man it's like it's stressful launching something and so it's been pretty it's been stressful three months of getting here and I think it's not it's it's kind of non-stop through the end of August like every day I'm doing a live stream from now until the end of on Saturdays Sundays included it's just telling the story of unchain summer every day we're doing a new Midas and sometimes included so the next 20 days are going to be I feel like the pressure valve being released of like oh this thing is out in the world now people are using it people are starting to like build on it organically um that's been uh really really great um I also see one more question in here what's our internal goal kpi foreign honestly we've already we've already exceeded all of our internal kpi inspirations are you kind of crazy enough like if you look at the activity on date like the goals that we originally set we didn't know what to expect we're like launching a new you know trying to compare other folks who recently launched new out twos and um I think we've already been like kind of Blown Away by the response um you know just like today I think yesterday we crossed a hundred thousand unique transacting addresses on Base today I think we're gonna attract towards like 125 or 150 000 yeah like it's crazy like that that's way bigger than we were anticipating um and so I think we're kind of like doing a little bit of internal reset right now okay like what do we what do we go on for the rest of the month um and my attitude is that it's day one like 150 000 is Big relatively right like I think base has the most transacting addresses of nl2 today and yesterday uh maybe not yesterday will today but in the grand scheme of things it's tiny right like we're talking about millions billions of people that we bring out and so I'm just now recalibrating let's go get to a million acting address it um I think the the biggest like internal goal that I is um I just want to make our products like all the products work better on base like that's been a forcing function for like our on-chain summer is a forcing function for that like there's a part of it that was just like getting energy getting momentum getting movement but the other part of it was like making it so every day the coinbase team the coinbase wallet team other wallet teams who are promoting on Jane summer are doing activities not James ever like they have to go through the experience of trying to use a non-chain product and seeing what works what doesn't work and just in three days like every day we've done a retro an hour long throw with the coinbase team the coinbase wallet team and the base team uh for the last three days and every day we're like here's a bunch of that's really broken that we need to fix and so I think that's probably like the single biggest like North Star for me this summer it's like can we make a 50 Improvement 100 Improvement in quality of life and quality of experience of people who are trying to transact every day um yeah yeah and uh it's set up to be in the right world too because you know I have this really tight feedback loop where you get to actually see and try things and you'll see the next iteration 24 hours and 100 100 uh I'm thinking so asking about parallel about Prime on base Prime I think is on base already um it can be Bridge via layer zero like 80 90 sure of that if you want to tweet acne I can tag the parallel team and they can give you any information that you need that's a response to gof um Nico awesome to hear that the Dows migrated to base this week we want more of that uh we're here to to make that happen um and let us know if we can help and then David dab Judy do you have a question on l2s um on navigating the regulatory space you know in general our feeling is like there's a lot of Need for regulatory Clarity um in the U.S and in countries around the world and that's why we've been advocating for that employees and stand with crypto and all the other stuff that we're doing um I think in general our belief is that layer choose are an extension of ethereum and that um like ethereum we should be standing for and fighting for uh layer choose to remain open permissionless and decentralized and so that's one of the big reasons why we are part of the super chain uh why we're part of super app why we're building on the op stack why we spent the last nine months working on this open neutrality framework called The Law of chains um because we believe that it requires decentralization requires open source it requires real commitment to ensure that and so that's that's what I'm focused on when I'm not focused on on chain somewhere I'm focused on ensuring that layer two remains open permissionless and decentralized because that's what's going to be required to have a global on-chain economy uh in a global launching all of us can build on and that all of us can stand on as a Level Playing Field so I think I'm at time car tick thanks for the questions everyone who is here thanks for being here thanks for hacking thanks for being a part of super app thanks for building this summer and if you launch stuff for unchain summer tweet at me will get it featured on the website um if you're looking for cool things to do on chain go to unchainsummer.xyz every day there's one cool thing to do on chain get on chain this summer let's go build some cool stuff awesome thank you so much Jesse and we'll see you on chain awesome nice car to you later bye
