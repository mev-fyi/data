and that is uh we're super excited to welcome gary vaynerchuk uh who is his hero entrepreneur he serves as the chairman of vaynerx and he's currently the ceo of vaynermedia he's widely regarded as a really big person in defining what next internet culture is and just the relevance of like how social and internet makes everything um different for for us um interviewing gary will be jacob williams from the global team and jacob and gary are going to talk about collectibles nfts and his views on the future of this space so without further ado please welcome gary and jacob gary thanks so much for being here so happy to be here jacob and uh hi everybody who's watching uh i i said this once in 2009 we're at a social media conference if you are watching this right now for the majority of people a lot of this is old news and this has probably been a four or five year thing but let there be no confusion you are disproportionately ahead of the game and i hope there's a lot of happiness and challenges and interests with that and so i'm very honored to be here and thank you for having me thank you yeah i mean maybe that's a good place to start we'd love to kind of maybe learn a little bit more about sort of you know how long you've been thinking about the space you know i know you've been talking a lot about nfts recently on on your podcast on on youtube and everything um i mean when was your interest peaked like when did you kind of take a look uh the journey is in 2016 a gentleman by name of aaron battalion and a tremendous technologist cto of living social and just somebody i'd really admire of being an incredible nerd aka really technically sound but in intuitive consumer behavior which is obviously where i live and so we would always have these jam sessions at south by southwest and he i bought bitcoin in 14 and this was 16 south by and he started explaining ethereum to me and my brain went into oh this is interesting this is platform not currency and i'm like i'm not a financier like i to this day get you know i'm all about nft life and all my friends that want me to get excited about currencies i get it and i'm like i don't to me it's not like doge this or or bitcoin this or altcoin to the moon that like it's just not as interesting to me the same reason i don't buy a lot of currencies or trade or even stocks on the public market whereas you know t-shirts and garage saleing and sports car like so um and then there's the the things that will go into deeper beyond they are in collectibles of nft life that i think the smart contract to access and you know uh touching and and feeling peop things and experiences you want um so that access and and part of of this smart contract so that excite me so anyway i you know i bought a bunch of ethereum and 16 in the same way that i'm looking at vr today which is it's looming but it's not prime time for every person in kansas that's my game i'm listening and watching and far you know i always hate when i enter a new space at this point in my career because i have the baggage of my career and so like i've been trying to be very thoughtful about that because i i get upset when i do something and and i'm so appreciative i'm humbled that people ign even this beautiful intro you know kartik you know like i understand that i've done nice and well and have done but i always think i'm only as good as my new at-bat and if i come into this space and i'm a clown and make you know and i'm wrong like it erases everything i've ever done you're only as good as your next day right so i've come in somewhere around february march april kova time i'm like wait a minute that nft thing that i've kind of like really far away like i know what crypto kitties are like you know like like you know i remember looking at that carefully um this is starting to happen a little bit and then i had a conversation with rohan from from dapper and top shot and i'm like huh and i was in the heat of my sports card thing physical it's interesting and then the fall came and all this time what really me up was kovid you know i'm i'm the c you know a lot of times people forget for all my loud mouth tactics and putting out tons of content i'm the active ceo of a 1300 person global company that like and it's client service it's not even like tech 1300 which is a hell of a lot easier to manage you're just getting bombarded by people so you know navigating being the captain of really rocky waters during covid didn't get and then i decided with michael rubin from fanatics to do the all-in challenge and we raised 60 million dollars you know to help people that were hungry during cobit so i had 0.0 minutes march to august to what i wanted to do which was like why is my spidey senses then the fall came we navigated all that trauma and i actually saw offense for vayner x for 2021 so then i got suckered again into like putting in extra hours towards wait a minute i could set up a nice year for us that's probably a good idea then it was late late december i feel like i've got that all accomplished and i'm like okay i'm gonna really dig in now and i started doing real homework you know you know and i started having some you know friends you know that i started like i started kind of dming quietly some friends uh kevin rose was instrumental you know got into a form of the founder of digg.com truly what totally kind of web 2.0 him and i spent a ton of time talking about it he was instrumental in like check out flamingo check out this i'm going to introduce you to matt for crypto i'm like okay like it just started feeling 2005 to me then you know i put out a little piece of content or two which allowed me with my you know awareness these days to make some new friends um jeff holm holmberg uh you know was it i just have to give him a shout out kid that i spent a lot of time talking about crypto punks and hash masks with and i'm a learner i'm a i'm a learner from the bottom up i can't learn from like a tech backwards place i have to go from what are humans doing and then i go backwards up i'll learn about level two issues by by understanding like trying to buy something and being like what the this gas like that's how i learned yep and i'm also what my big advantage is i understand people cold that's my strength and so you know the last four months have been two three four o'clock in the morning canceling important and taking another thing you know you and i met that way i'm just taking me there you know i'm just trying to be part of the community i got excited i started talking then i was like i have to start talking way more about what this moment really is which is the technologies forever internet 2000 some of the stocks the projects are incredibly overpriced and there will be absolutely in this world's terms ico crashing culture with and so i've been trying to put that content out there so people are being thoughtful i've been learning a lot more about wrapping and forking and burning and you know i've really enjoyed it and so i come to this talk a incredibly humble and knowing i'm in the middle of my journey on the consumer side like what people are going to do i have a flag of conviction that is as large as anything which is nft culture is here for the rest of my entire life there is 0.0 doubt i've only felt like this twice in my life 1994 when i heard the internet for the first time that and i'm like in a day i'm like this is going to change my life and sure enough i'm not building 500 liquor stores for my dad anymore i'm going to do this winelivery.com thing and and then friendster myspace it was a little bit more of a slow burn but it was definitely when eric castner my lead developer at winelibrary.com started making me read techcrunch and i was like okay and boom you know youtube he showed me actually that's not true there was a single moment eric shows me youtube and he goes remember four years ago when you're like can i stream wine videos on our website and i told you it was eight trillion dollars and only two people would watch and you were like no i'm like yes he's like well now you can do it for free on this thing and uh and in february you know that was in 2005 and then february 2006 i started wine library tv which really changed my life because that's what made me use twitter and facebook to promote that show and then i became a practitioner the only other time i felt that way was somewhere here in january really only two months ago when i did enough homework of like it went from spidey senses to my life is going to change and that's what i fully believe as i sit here i don't know now i don't know it took me a decade to learn a lot of tech to talk the way i talk today about web20 social the internet i still have plenty to learn about blockchain i'm sure i'll say things in the wrong terminologies and things that nature those things are irrelevant to me meaning i have the humility to be corrected and i love everybody in the community i have the patience to learn some of the real core things i'll need to just just i always like to be just dangerous enough so i'm not an idiot but where i spend 100 of my time and 110 of my time is why are people gonna do this how is this gonna affect somebody who's selling their home can they put a can they put this on the ledger and like make a vig every time this home sold in the beginning how am i going to launch my book wait a minute music artists can do this wait a minute who's the first providence i understand that completely that's everything that's social currency why do people wear gold watches same reason they're going to buy this does the blue check me anything on instagram it sure does of course can i take a picture into jpeg who gives a you don't actually own it and in 13 years everyone's going to actually look to see honestly like that's where i play my game i love it totally yeah i mean i think it's been amazing to see you use your platform and i think a really positive way and then kind of bring people into this fold uh and and kind of the mind worm that all of us i think have been thinking about over the last couple years um and yeah i think you know you do this in such a genuine way comes across really well uh so really appreciate you helping out there jacob if if everybody really knew me and were inside my chemicals if they understood you who you are in this space and i consider like this this authentic crew to me to me people that were really active november 1st 2020 back are really part of a crew that's different than let's say oh yeah you know february 1st 2021 right and i've lived that twice in my life that was when i decided to learn what the internet was at all and boy were those tech nerds and then i met them again in 2005. they were just different that early you know people don't understand what silicon valley looked like in three four five six like it was so different than the status that it has now and i think i i see a lot of those characters again in this world now the internet is so much more mature and accepted mainstream that the the juxtaposition of culture pop culture fame non-fame like it's different but it's still the same which is much like a band that goes on to become pearl jam that early crew feels a relationship to the technology and the movement that must be respected by people like me that come along and that is my number one kpi you saying that to me is much more important to me than me doing business well with this platform so thank you for saying that no i appreciate it i mean you know you said you kind of come to this with a little bit of baggage but i mean i want to talk about kind of you know you've had decades of experience of trading uh trading cards right like uh sports cards and that kind of thing and you know collectibles is one of those pieces on the nft world that you know is really coming into position right now i mean top shot is huge you talked about uh rohan was talking later uh in the summit today about top shot and dapper in general um i guess kind of curious about sort of what are your thoughts about the future of the collectible piece and how do you see that sort of coming on the chain and beyond just top shots right now and by the way to your point i use baggage as a slang term to an incredible gift that i'm given which is i have notoriety and respect and and of course that comes along with razzing and i people think i'm sure you know and i get that but for the most part what i mean by that is i can't do what i did in which was and six which is go to uh six apart's blog and ask a question or go on or in 2006 7 being on twitter like i didn't have the clout reputation you know personal brand whatever one wants to call it and what i mean by that is i when i say baggage i use it as hey i think too many people are coming into space acting like tough guys and tough gals like they know and i'm trying to come in like hey i do have conviction of a couple things i see comma i'm not trying to come in here like there's a million people on twitter that are ogs that can run circles around me on the understanding of the technology of blockchain you know and crypto and things that nature where i feel incredibly confident is what people are going to do and that's why i'll go to this part let me go to a place on collectibles that i have not heard people talk about i have a lot of experience in that thank you i also have a lot of experience in something else that a lot of people know me for which is garage sailing right and i actually believe that the garage sailing part of me has more insight than even the sports card version of me and let me explain when i go garage saling i buy things based on knowing that people have nostalgia and pop culture in their blood and so when i buy a new york city bus pass that has the world trade center picture on it i know there's no inherent real massive value or when i buy huckleberry hound in a stuffed animal from knickerbocker the stuffed animal toy company for three bucks without even looking at it on ebay i already know that's forty fifty dollars now let me tell you why that story is important there's going to be in the advancements i'm going a little further and beyond collectibles what i believe is going to happen i'm sure given the nature of where we are in the life cycle of nfts and who's in this conference outside of the people that just came in from my tweet that are probably going through learning there's a lot of people here that i think most of the audience here could be giving the talk that's just what happens in the beginning which i respect tremendously i think everybody knows and is probably frustrated when everyone's so fixated just on collectibles and art when we're talking about and and by the way i felt this with e-commerce and social media people get fixated on the first thing that makes even any level of sense to them and then that one of those things become the conversation i mean i remember when people talked about the internet in 95 96 only from the lens of browsers and search engines yep like there wasn't any conversation around like e-commerce and you know like you know so because a lot of the early tech people weren't merchants like i was so for me the reason i bring up the garage sale thing is the following i'll use myself as an example now i'm going to use a concert i'm going to use coachella coachella has bracelets physical bracelets there's nobody here watching this right now that's not confused or confused that in 15 12 7 6 3 years that becomes a token and it works and then i can't wait to see like token readers and like well like there's so much fun innovation coming right for sure you know you know smart contracts that check off that you use like it's gonna be so cool right what i know though as garage sale gary is seven years later somebody's gonna buy the first if it goes on that festival because becomes coachella right somebody's gonna buy that token the same way i would buy the bracelet at a garage sale for 25 cents and sell it on ebay for 19 i know that tokens that are really not collectibles and arts but representations of smart contracts are going to have a secondary market at a scale that most people haven't made the chess move connections on and that is going to be incredible because that is going to lead to incredible behavior at the ip level to try to do thoughtfulness for the audience to create that economic aspect the economic aspect of that is going to actually force leagues musicians festivals things to actually care more about their custom right now we're in the golden era jacob of the people launching projects that really don't give a about their audience at all it's a fast money grab i'm going to draw something a picture of me or something that represents me i'm going to mint the 10 000 of them and because right now and they're gonna make some real money i mean we've seen some athletes and somebody's make real money what i know is gonna happen on the other side is the people that are holding the bag of that collectible have paid overpaid so much no different than pets.com or etoys.com as a stock that doesn't mean nfts are not going to be the game changing thing of this generation it just means that project is not and what you're seeing is short-term transactional behavior right now of people land grabbing for quick bags but what they're actually going to do is hurt their brand because there's going to be some fans on the other side that are sad that they paid 3 000 for ownership of an nft but now the market says it's 17 aka beanie babies right so so i'm worried about that from for everybody in this cycle that the person that's buying it and gets held with the bag but i'm actually worried about it equally for you know they deserve it because they weren't thoughtful but it doesn't mean i don't have compassion to somebody who doesn't really there's some people because i've talked to a bunch of celebrities ip they don't even realize they're doing bad things for their audience they're delusional they don't understand supply and demand and where the moment we're in so they probably in our a lot of them i could tell i've had the combos they actually think they're gonna do well like oh someone's gonna pay 88 000 for this and one day it's gonna be worth two million i'm like first of all your ego is insane second of all you're very much misunderstanding what's about to happen which is the tokenization of everything do you know how much supply that is it's influencers jacob right influencer marketing i was right in 2009 when i wrote crush it and you have the logan pauls and a charlie demilious but there are tens of thousands thou hundreds of thousands and millions of people making 50 to 200 000 a year being an influencer instead of an accountant or a gardener and loving life that's going to happen with nft that's going to happen with artists that's going to happen in a lot of places so i don't know i think there's a lot of thoughtfulness that needs to come to the market here's my thoughts it is the game changer for collectibles arts and pretty much everything in the world um there will be incredible love layers of bubbles and no different it's like the stock market was invented and there'll be plenty of ibm's and ge's and amazon's and there'll be plenty of enrons i mean there will be space.com right i think we all know personal personal brands are going to do things you know uh i'll give you an example this may be an extreme example but if nfts have been around for 60 years somebody might have done incredibly well with o.j simpson investing when he was in a high school football player and he put out his nfts and they were the rookie cards and in 1991 you look like a genius you bought something for three dollars it's now seven trillion dollars and then boom a moment happens and like there's you know there's a lot of things that are going to happen with these nfts but i think the macro is incredible and i think when you have people like i'm glad wilhelm's coming you know what he built with dapper and flow and top shot incredible you know i think he'll add a lot to that conversation but my big thing is that this that we also are now at a place where i as a 45 year old man would rather wear cool sneakers have comic books that are graded to 10 own video games still in the box graded sports cards wear hoodies wear t-shirts like the culture is becoming more collectible nerd fun like the investment portfolio of a 45 year old man with my wealth 20 years ago was real estate and stocks very partisan i have more in stock sports cards comic books toys nfts that i think is not going to stop and i think that's going to lead to a lot more demand than people are anticipating very cool yeah i think that totally makes sense i mean um just the number of assets that people are looking at every day is it's just it's an order of magnitude more than it was uh even like 10 years ago right and i think there's no way that's going to stop it's not going to stop and people enjoy it now i enjoy absolutely my crypto punk more than my tesla stock i enjoy my super mario brothers in mint condition more than i enjoy my part ownership with my dad in the real estate at wine library i enjoy i enjoy i enjoy and that that part the mixing of experiences and nft smart contracts is going to be game changing absolutely well maybe um a good place to go here i mean this is gonna be a hackathon right we're gonna have 600 people building stuff all weekend uh and hopefully you know 150 or so projects by sunday what do you think is missing from the ecosystem right now or what do you think what do you want to see built right first i want everybody who does something cool to dme at garyvee on twitter because i want to see it perfect uh the i want to see real life readers you know i want to be able to create nfts that create hall passes in real life and i want to be able to read your wallet physically like a scanner at a venue and then it marks off the ledger that's been used like i want that i know i know there's the roadblocks right now for that like some i'm not naive enough but like if you're talking about what's missing that's definitely coming that totally um uh i'm very fascinated about um the royalties changing based on you paying a different price just throwing out some random right now to get some yeah i think it goes good yeah i just think like when you buy something could you lower its royalty by paying more for it up front like that i think that's kind of cool um the physical you know i like what the artifacts people are doing i think the phys like i'm a big both and guy i think there's right now or like no yeah like they are like i'm gonna still buy this and i'm gonna buy a ton like so anybody who can capture things that create an ecosystem for and let me throw an old world problem at it can somebody create the operating system for warehouses that can take on all the physical versions of the digital in a world where a lot of people want to stay anonymous and don't even want to take ownership of the physical like like you know i'm thinking about projects that yeah custodials thank you you know that's interesting to me that's like a boring tech operating system that can turn old warehouses into something very valuable that might be fun and um oh i've got a big one i actually i need this one i want somebody to create the communication layer i want to be like i'm going to launch a project i want to be able to talk every day to my 4 000 people in a deep way in a decentralized way and not have to force them into a discord or something like i'm very like i want to be able to say right this second i launched a project i want to say hello to somebody like so in wallet communication i think it's huge like on-the-spot communities yeah i want to just basically be like yo thank you again for supporting my thing or yeah all of you right now here's a link like i wanna support my thing and a lot of good things are happening i want people to communicate to them that's huge for me actually that one's actually that's my kill that to me is how you start the social networks the reddits the discords of the world in this game let me talk to the people that bought my yeah it's amazing to see the communities that have formed around crypto punks or hashtags search everything but that's because that's because discord link on the site dude you get it yeah i'm talking but it could just happen yeah because don't forget four years later i'm not following where these transactions have gone i might get a little money and i know it's happening but i don't know that jacob sold it to kartik and when i want to do something for the people that own my right now i want kartik there not jacob because he went into my discord but no longer owns it so that that to me is huge totally now i can see that this all right i have to go yeah i know what you're thank you you're being sick yeah yeah yeah i heard stop at 1 30. but i just looked i'm like by the way anybody who's watching this please hit me up on twitter to just say hello i'm i'm the word i would use is desperate and honored to be a tiny piece of this community and want to make more friends and would love to get anybody's thoughts on anything they heard and i definitely want to see if cardiac thought i said anything interesting before i leave you want to jump in carter uh no i i want to say i think uh the coolest part of this is that i think we're finally getting to the piece where people are thinking about it from what the interaction looks like uh for the end consumer of that content whatever that may be whether that's art or a way to integrate into a community and i think this is kind of the right way to think about it because what you're talking about is how do we actually make this valuable for the end user it doesn't matter how the tech is set up correct that's what gets to the millions and not because i came in with like because what made quote-unquote garyvee was i was a liquor store son of a liquor store owner with a 40 person watching youtube show and once i understood social immediately i just did what i did in real life which is if i can bring more value to them than i ask for in return and that is going to be the winning formula in the nft because we're talking about economies and communities here the end at scale and that's the scale i mean that's you know that's why i'm probably getting there's you see the goosebumps oh wow look at that isn't that cool no but really like i literally called my mom and said nft is the manifestation of my life's work and i'm in the prime of my life to take advantage and to contribute to it do you know what that feels like to me like to your point you know how thoughtfully serious i was taking the words that came out of my last 30 minutes we're still early i have this place in the ecosystem a different ecosystem web 2 not this web 3 thing but it still carries and if i can deliver 30 minutes of thoughtfulness here it can be meaningful and i'm very honored by that that is i mean gary love loved the the no opinion on everything and then the right kind of direct view on this and i think you're i mean i'm just checking out the chat here there's a lot of comments on people just agreeing with a lot of things you've said and just that's something that means a lot to me from this community please hit me up on twitter folks because i have meetings and i want to see some things bye everyone thank you so much thanks so much gary thanks jacob and um i mean that was great i think we gotta figure out a way to get gary back in and have a much longer conversation so um thanks jacob and thanks carrie and for all you that have questions we'll find a way to get them answered uh after this
