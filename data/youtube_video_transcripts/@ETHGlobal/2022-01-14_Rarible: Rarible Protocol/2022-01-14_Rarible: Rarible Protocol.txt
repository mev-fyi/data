awesome we're ready to start uh thank you so much for joining uh we have eric and gawain here from variable we're gonna do the workshop on wearable protocol i'm super excited to have them here and also thank you so much for the rest of you for tuning into this workshop um with that being said i'll pass over the mic to um eric and going hey guys nice to see you here um yeah i'm just going to do a quick intro about wearable doubt and then going it's going to jump into the sdk and get into the more technical side of things so my name is eric i've been um in the dao space since like 2018 2019 a long time uh right now leading the efforts at wearable dao um so you know sorting those efforts and helping grow the ecosystem there we have a really great community of builders doing all sorts of different things we have a variety of products in the nft space the main one being wearable protocol which is an indexer an exchange and some minting contracts for literally any application that wants to build in the nft space that's the main one and then we have some other products that we're working on um a product called hypervives which is really cool allows you to infuse nfts with erc20s and then release those tokens to the owners of the nfts over time and then some other really cool things that are going to be released over the next month so if you're interested in building in the nfd space definitely come check out wearable dao we have a really great gang of people um and uh there's a lot of really cool things happening so that's a little bit about my feel about wearable dao so come come check us out on the wearable protocol side um i'm going to do a really quick i'm just going to share my screen really quickly um you can get most of the info on wearable.org so that's kind of the the homepage for the wearable protocol i'm going to share with you just this overview um from our docs so uh wearable protocols a set of smart contracts um and an indexer that's released on ethereum and tazos polygon we're hoping to get up before the hackathon um i think it's in the final final stages of getting up should be up maybe this weekend maybe on monday but um possibly today depending on how things go so um the the goal with the protocol is to deploy it on all the chains um so if you build on the protocol you know it's a really good strategy if you want to eventually go to different chains because we're going to be supporting them all um the idea with the protocol is that um you know it's it allows all these different blockchains to interact with it so there's an indexer that indexes all the nfds on the different chains in your application you can bubble up um you know any of those nfts from those different chains and then using the sdk you can interact with the enfts place uh bids and asks on the different nfts you can mint nfts through the protocol using the sdk and there's a common sdk for all the different protocols so it's pretty nice so it's kind of a high-level architecture overview allows you to mint trade transfer burn and also obviously query all the information about the protocol about the nfts so i'll stop there uh gwen's gonna jump into more of the technical side of things and um yeah i'm sure you'll have questions for him so go and take it away hi guys um i'm dwayne and i'm here to introduce the wearable sdk kind of give you more of a deep dive understanding as to what it is what it does so basically railroad protocol is a um let me just yeah so rebel sdk is a protocol um with a set of smart contracts and indexing and i can allow you to interact with an existing shared order book and it has a lot of liquidity and all the wearable users um are at your fingertips which we have over 500 000 users monthly and verbal.com uses wearable protocol under the hood as the main way to communicate with the blockchain so wherever protocol does all they have to be lifting concerning minting sales fittings and options um where you can actually use your own custom erc 721 smart contracts for erc 1155 smart contracts and these are compatible with our trading smart contracts and in addition to that we've also created a set of special smart contracts where uh where we call them wearable toby contracts and these contracts allow you to use lazy minting and which lazy minting it basically removes the need to have things like heath to pay for gas where the user would only need to sign a message in order to create an item we call these items signature items we also have we also have baked in royalties so you can specify the arbitrary set of royalties that will be by the exchange contract for every secondary cell and you can also specify multiple creators to instantly enable nft collaborations a little overview as to what the sdk looks like so so our sdk interface consists of two parts a rush api and an sdk that's built on top of the api the api basically provides endpoints for following controllers main controllers are assets and that uses either erc 721s or erc 1155 tokens collections orders our lazy map feature and ownership activities and different events um our lazymint api also allows the item to be created and stored often until someone purchases or transfers this item only at this point does the item get created on chains prior to that it's considered off chain and then you can actually uh direct call um we actually avoid the domenting function that you would normally call on an nft contract and we use a function called mint and transfer we also have different endpoints that are available for the api that are available for ethereum mainnet testnet um tesla's flow and we have the respective test those and as i mentioned earlier uh polygon we also have a list of some api references um for those different uh chains and we also have a reference for the sdk which this at the end of the period okay so i'm going to start with a little bit of a deep dive here into what our indexer looks like and um so um so we have this repository for our indexer blender and the wearable repository and basically what this indexer does is it provides all of the eft metadata that's available on the wearable.com on marketplace and you can basically query that data using this indexer so um so you can also you can you can query who owns what nft you can query how many erc 1155s an address has or you have 721s you can also query data about events um transfers any mints or burns also create uh lazy mints uh placement laser-emitted nfts from this indexer and also post information uh the way this indexer basically works is it has this listener function where this module listens for the events and updates and um there's a log listener that um accrues all of these different um events um it delivers that um the data model to acc the data model that's available within this this indexer is uh the item which represents the nft uh which would be no would be seen as the nft.item and this can be owned by only one address it's an erc 721 and the erc 1155 we contain multiple owners uh we also have the ownership model which represents the item that's owned by an address and this is a relationship between the older owner and the actual nepti item we also have the item history where all of it's from these i from these items and ownerships such as the transfer the minting the burning et cetera this listener listens to these different events from this block from the blockchain and saves this and recreates the state of the items and ownerships and we have the token which represents the smart contract also known as the collection um and this is um this is actually on the blockchain and the items live inside of these individual smart contracts um so we so this is our ethereum indexer if you're looking to display you know keys in any way you you would want to query this data you would want to use this indexer that we have available for uh now i'm going to step into uh the sdk and kind of what that looks like so our sdk um so yeah i also want to point out that one of the most difficult parts about utilizing the sdk is it's really just setting it up that's probably the most difficult part once you get past that everything else is super easy you have about for a lot of the functions they're about three lines of code uh so what we've done is we created this quick start application where you can easily just get in really quick and you can set up your your um your interaction with the protocol so um what i would suggest is probably starting with um we'll share this slides as well so you can get access to these links but um this link will give you that starter application where you can get started and then i'll just get into some of the functions that you can do with so um one of the functions that are available in the sdk are obviously being able to get items by a creator this function um basically basically just queries um the information that's available to the creator where you can actually this is what the function looks like here um where you can actually get get that particular item i'm using this await uh function that um gets that information based on whatever blockchain you're using in this case ethereum and the contract address associated with that um yes uh the screen you're sharing right now i don't know if this is what you want to share but i see like some purple buttons and it's kind of cut off interesting okay yes i'm not sure if that's what you actually want to share but what happened [Music] okay let me know if this it's still those purple uh okay now i see some colors it's good thank you i appreciate it great so once again i'm just gonna run back so so this is the initial um items so you have this awake function that um gets whatever items have been created by a specific creator um in this in this case we're using ethereum blockchain and this is the contract address associated with that particular collection but um so we uh so we utilize that in order to get those different items um your nft whether that's through lazy minting or whether that's through um for the um through the lazymit functionality so what that looks like is this this function here is an example so we have a mint item that does asynchronous and we we contain we grab the union address facebook so we have the blockchain name and that's followed up by the hex address associated with the collection [Music] there is a token id that's required um there's two ways that you can actually generate this token id we have a helper function that's available within the api um that when you when you get a chance to go through the docs you access the open api uh address you would be able to see these different different functions one of those functions is generate token and you can either do it that way through the api um or you go through the open api or you can actually put in the code itself um an example of uh what that would look like is would be here where you would you would just basically generate your token id request um you have your collection and you would just pass in the parameters the blockchain name and the hex address and then you have your mentor which also correlates to to the union address of the actual um in fact interact with the sdk and then you can just call a token id response where you can generate that token id uh request so you can you can do one or two ways to obtain id so then so then after you after you get that that token id then you you can actually um prepare your your request and preparing that mint request basically um sends a request to the blockchain to prepare that minting process and then that meeting process expects a response where you would do an await and you would request just use that group variable in order to respond that response then returns and you have to submit where you have where it expects the uri the supply you have lazy minting feature where you can at true or you cannot choose to do lazy minting you can actually this is the creators array where you can assign multiple creators to an nft uh based on the account associated with each creator and uh this value here which basically basically is a um is a is a um um it's a uh was it a it's a number that is it's uh audi okay i remember right now but um this number basically represents the value of uh the contribution that that creator may have put into this nft so um basically if let's say for instance they put 3.84 value into this nft uh you can actually if you were to there's actually a little bit of math there so if you were to say um 3.84 divided by 100 divided by 0.001 it would give you this number what that is the same is for the royalties um well um where you would just pass that value um equivalent to how many royalties creator is respected if you know whatever's agreed upon the creation so basically those royalties which would serve continuous payment to these different creators um throughout the secondary market um the next um another function that that that's really a main function here is being able to um to sell and there's actually there's two ways that you can go about doing that we have two functions for that we have the sparks one where uh it's just basic it's just equipment and cell uh immediate uh so uh what this does is it basically um it gets that initial mix and it just immediately fixes it on sale um where you know you would provide what's the number of supply is is according to that um minting or election and then um you know the usual lazy mint whether it's true or false you can set the price again the creators what currency you would expect in this in this example it's ethereum um this would be respect for whatever chain you may be on so for instance if you were using results [Music] we also have where you can just create a sell order where this this is a little this is a different step from actually minting and selling it in one in one po uh this would just this you would be able to call this so order and you would again set your price um you know obviously we're we're on ethereum in this in this example um and i also want to point out something here too before i'm there but obviously we're going to blockchain obviously we're getting our address associated with the nft but this number here it also expects is the token you can uh so we're passing in this token id that's been that's been populated from our api so um we have our ethereum obviously your ethereum currency that we're expecting and then we're setting our price amount and we're setting um and then we're setting the uh the item id which is our our token union address which is here up top and then we're getting we're creating a response uh where we're passing in our sell order from this border so pretty simple you can also extract different information from these properties from the orders from the order response um your base a base fee or a maximum amount that you would accept um so um so you you have a threshold and you can see your nft cell or and um that then you didn't have your response uh where you submit you know your price amount and your currency you can update the sell orders as well uh you can build sell orders you can create multiple bid offers um you know don't touch on these level um you can obviously update that information you can cancel the order so if you are to lazy bit an nfg you um and you need let's say for instance you want to update your base uri in some way um then you would actually need to cancel any orders um prior to creating that new um lazy minted nft um also if you are creating a if you have a sale order and you want to lower your your price uh one one thing to point out you can you can raise the price when you update your sale order you can't lower the price within the sell order pump so in order to lower the price if you needed to you would have to do a cancel order first uh and then you would be able to lower the price um then we have token transfer and um you can burn obviously from your nft token and those are pretty much um and then we also have this really cool function here um that pre-processes token meta um as well so um so yeah so this this is pretty much high level as to some of the some of the functions and pointing out some of the main features that are commonly used within our sdk um and with that um i think that pretty much sums up most of the around our sdk i guess we can [Music] open it up to questions if anyone has any that was super informative to you guys like it's like so so dense you know like i need to i need to have a nap now after this after this session you know i need to process it probably i'm going to have i i don't have like my questions like after after a nap you know yeah we do learn every listing there so we know it doesn't make it as difficult to to uh interact with the sdk uh yeah when you show like that you know like i just want to grab some like libraries and start like testing it like there's kind of there's no questions you have to like start uh typing something you know then you yes you get all the answers so absolutely it's like it's very practical like thank you very much it's like really no problem very good session absolutely i'm gonna start using it for sure but after after hackathon i don't want to start now like after now but there's a question uh by uh dimitri um in the chat there so to put into perspective variable is a nft marketplace oh wearable is a nft marketplace and has the al all the api to query and mint nfp yes yeah yeah so the way to think about it is wearable.com is a marketplace and under the hood they use the wearable protocol which is what gawain talked about here and what i showed at the beginning wearable protocol is the infrastructure layer and anybody else building an nft project can can just leverage that infrastructure to build a marketplace or you know if a wallet can integrate with the protocol or you know any other app can tap into that infrastructure what is the main difference between wearable and openc i mean on the front end interface i mean there are differences i'm not going to go into all the differences of the front end but on the back end i mean you know the wearable protocol is the infrastructure layer it's it's open source anybody can use it i think the wearable protocol is kind of the one one of the big differentiators is that you know we have this tool available and it's you know openc has an api but nothing's open source and it's it's closed source so you know if if you're interested in building kind of the future of the nft space and and you want to build an app that um is a bit more resilient then you know relying on openc api might not be a great idea if i can point on something too i think another really big differences are actually the fees when you're looking at gas when you're looking at protocol fees there's a big difference there from the wearable side it's much much lower from that end and also another big big feature is um you know the the ability to um set royalties really at whatever wherever you want them to be um there's really no no guidelines as to where those where those may want to sit um when it comes to collaborating all right i guess uh that's all the questions unless there's any more there's one more this wearable also feature a property [Music] yes yes we do so like attributes yes we do respect attributes we we actually use the same uh metadata standard as open seas so as long as you're familiar with that no problem yes they do show up awesome thanks a lot guys appreciate this uh thanks wayne um and uh yeah hopefully we'll see you guys around let us know if uh you're building on our protocol uh are you guys on rinkybee testnet yes answers yes um so we also have a grant program uh in addition so you know for any teams building on the protocol we have grants available through the dow one success story that i just wanted to mention coco nft last year they hacked in this hackathon they then got a grant from our dao subsequently raised their seed and now they're on to their second round of financing so you know it's pretty exciting uh we're there to help you guys out and we have financing or funding available as grants post hackathon thanks guys awesome thank you so much eric and glen wayne for taking time out of your friday eve oh it's actually friday afternoon for you right now but to present this workshop to our hackers and thank you to the rest of you for tuning into the wearable workshop um we do have another workshop starting right now by austin from the ethereum foundation um so definitely go tune into that um right now and otherwise i hope you all have a great rest of your day or evening or morning wherever you are
