if you wanna help someone [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] are we both know s foreign foreign thank you everybody foreign foreign foreign okay thank you foreign [Music] foreign foreign no uh it's no Wi-fi so I need to connect on thank you USBC or HDMI yes okay okay we got that if something fails with their laptop are they able to plug in down there to charge it yeah okay thank you foreign thank you yeah sorry [Music] all right let's get this started [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Amigos there are so many good sponsors with excellent bounties [Music] [Music] [Applause] good evening everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of Youth Global and I'm super excited to welcome to all of you to eat Bogota finale to sum it all up we had 1400 attendees this entire weekend 900 of you were hackers all the other amazing Partners mentors speakers and so many more visitors and guests from 62 different countries all here over the past 48 to 72 hours and 34 of everybody that was here was new to web3 and not only bad 31 of people here were from Latin America to top it all off we had 212 projects that came out of this this morning and that makes this the officially the biggest hackathon in Latin America not only that today we crossed 5 000 projects from eth Global hackathons with the end of eat Bogota so let's get started before we go into what the next one and a half hours gonna be about I want to take a second to thank all the amazing judges that were here for the entire morning talking to all of you giving you all feedback and learning about what everybody did and sharing the excitement I want to give a quick shout out to Forest Stephen Liam Puja Jeff stani Gabriel Devon Evan Gaspard Linda yonden Paris James Evan Sean Chris Colin Dennison Lane James Rahul and Mikhail they were amazing they stayed for more than the time he asked them for and they were very gracious about it and not only that when I gave a massive shout out to 43 of our incredible Partners who are here and they're going to be queuing away a lot of prizes so let's give them a big round of applause Aztec ipfs filecoin optimism polygon scroll SSB Networks why connect

fluid the graph Uma autonomy ceramic chain link D gate noses chain lens protocol Moonbeam by economy open Zeppelin quick note ripio sismo uniswap foundation and xmtp they're giving away a lot of prizes and we're going to be talking about all of that right after some demos so just to remind everybody on the live stream and again in this audience this is not a conference this is a hackathon and we care about showing things and not telling them we're going to focus on what people built we're going to do live demos we're going to be proud of everything we achieved and almost got close to this weekend and this starts all off with what we call our finalists so we have 212 submissions we had all these teams go up line up on the fifth floor sometimes complain about the long lineup but then eventually go into a room and demo to some of our amazing judges and they talked about what they built they talked about what they wanted to do they got talked about how close they got and from that whole process we selected 12 finalists [Applause] so we're going to bring these 12 teams on they're going to demo one by one what they did and they'll show you what they were able to achieve this weekend and then we're going to talk about prizes so without further Ado let's congratulate all 12 of our finalists we have friends blob scan Explorer bet streams Eternal reviews pulp super seed quadian Network zipline Anonymous Victory auctions on chain discrete Cloud space and txn.xyz these 12 teams are going to come on in this order and they're going to demo their projects but before we go into the first demo I want to take a second and thank all of these 200 teams that did an amazing amount of work and demoed what they built I'll move out of the way so you can get some amazing screenshots all these teams did amazing work this weekend just because you were not one of the finalists does not mean you were not good enough our goal is to just highlight some of the things that our judges are excited about and things we think are important for us to pay attention in this ecosystem and all of you should be very proud of everything you were able to achieve all of you should be extremely proud of submitting a project and demoing it and having the confidence to talk about and having more aspirations to do more to it after this weekend so anybody who demoed this project will be getting a pull-up just for demoing their projects so we'll follow up with that to all of you soon but let's get to our finalists right after my clicker works we got more in case somebody did not want to didn't get a chance to take their photo there you go let's use our third slide all right all these projects are now available on eth global.com showcase you'll be able to see the whole list of 212 projects that came out of this weekend that includes anywhere from demos to screenshots to source code to live URLs that you can play with so many of them are on mainnet and it's it gets more and more impressive every time and I have to spend more and more time fighting the judges to tell me one project that they really like because it's getting harder so enough talking let's go into some demos so I want to bring on our first demo of the day and that is team friends please welcome team friends on stage [Applause] okay okay good afternoon we're Team friends and Friends stands for friendly riskless ethereum non-custodial staking but better known as staking with friends and since we're in Colombia we opted for staking con Amigos yeah so why friends so today staking on ethereum is still hard you need a lot of technical knowledge it's expensive you risk getting slashed and because staking on a centralized pool is so easy you get a strong centralization risk we at France think that staking should be fun fault tolerant social and rewarding and that's why we built a staking pool Factory so this is a high level overview of what we built we have an operator friends who invites his friends to join the staking pool he creates with his with our website and that way um we have we allow everybody to set up validators and we reduce the risk by using SSV technology to have more fault tolerant validators so we pre-recorded the demo because there's lots of on-chain transactions but you'll see at the end that you can test it out yourself so Stefan all right so I will be showing the demo so it starts off with the the creator of the pool so the friend operator uh so he starts by connecting to his wallet obviously and he's going to create the first pool um so he's going to do this with a factory contract um so this is what's happening now so he's just doing one transaction uh to actually mint that now he receives a specific link that he can use to invite his friends he can also deposit himself by the way uh with this link and this is the view for his friends so the all the friends they can pitch in any amount of eat so here's the deposit and on top you see like the all the ens information of the pool owner itself so to get more trust in the system so you see that it's all Happening Here on chain so this is the contract with one of the deposits going on so when you have deposited you can watch view the pool status so you see now five eight deposited and it automatically means an nft with General as SVG which is your uh your stake so the representation of your stake when the pool is full the SS V validation starts so the operator needs to create withdrawal Keys all those staking keys for ethereum and then he can deposit using the deposit data that he created the 32e that they assembled into the beacon chain so that's what's happening right now so this is all non-custodial because the it's to the he needs to select three other people from the SSV Network that will participate in validating and since all these validators are paid in SSV tokens it also needs to give an allowance on SSV tokens to pay these four parties that will be running the validator so that's what's happening right now the only thing that's left now is to register the SSV validator itself to kick it off so therefore we go to the SSV website and there we import the validation key itself so we skip that part here and then you can see on the beacon chain the deposit is done it's pending here and it will automatically start now the nfts that are created it's very special because you can start trading them on any nft platform so you see that all these nfts they have specific trades so they have like a claimable amount which are the rewards and the initial deposits so you can actually use that as a collateral for other D5 projects so this is our project stake income Amigas or staking With Friends but okay so a few final words of friends Vision on staking so why we did we bake this it's because we believe that it's important to create more small staking pools that are run by homesteakers so that will lead to more decentralization and will help ethereum security uh overall so I've invite you to try it out we made the it available online on friends.fun and follow us on Twitter thank you awesome our first demo on SSV this is already looking exciting with the merge finally going in so next up we have blob scan so please give blobscan a big round of applause [Applause] okay now hello everyone uh we are the develop scan team we have been building on top of the EIP for eight four four which is a new upgrade to the ethereum um ecosystem that is going to allow to put arbitrary data on the beacon chain that is temporary so it is specifically useful for the roll ups and there was no Explorer for it and we built one in this weekend so basically um we we are not sharing the screen um I'm not sure now okay so basically it's a block Explorer and you can see the different blocks that have been minted oops each block has their transactions and the new thing is that its transaction can have up to two blobs a blob is a set of data that you can check with these Explorer so you can see here which is the data that is included and um UDF version of the data in that case a blob data key who and you can also use the X the certain time in order in order to look for blockages blockade transaction highs blob highs or blob commitment in that case we can look for a specific log which has one transaction one block and then um we see here that it has a lot of data that has a interesting thing around here you you can have this is in a in the beacon chain stored in every contain of a devnet and you can have even uh an image um Navi great hi yeah um to continue with the presentation I like to yeah to continue with the presentation I'd like to talk about the where the idea come from this is from the breakout call of the 4844 AIP where Proto the one of the creators of The Proposal such as the possible tooling for this it was a indexer and was missing and we want to take the chance to thank Proto for the support the last 36 hours to reach a useful demo and to give a quick overview of the technical aspect of the proposal of this project here we have the indexer that we are using to fetch information from the both consensus layer and execution layer and we are talking with the execution layer using the Json RPC and a custom either providers that make sure that we are fetching finalized blocks and then we are fetching the week on API to get the vcom block and making sure that the both are going they will become block the Recon block has the blockchain crash of the execution layer and that's when we are sure that we can include this blob transactions and we are able to also query the vikon API for this sidecar that is where the blobs data is leaving and then we are getting all that information and store it in a mongodb and showing in the website and as a quick note I wanted to uh highlight this in red because they both develop transaction and the cycle are the two aspects that are from the new in the 4844 proposal and yeah that's that's it thank you everyone [Applause] amazing all right next demo is bad streams please get backstreams a big round of applause [Applause] for my teammates hello we're like hey Eve Bogota I hope you are doing excellent my name is Marcin and with me I have Yulia Pavel Daniel we are if Warsaw organizers from Poland but we also have hi Jess I'm Lance yes we are bet streams yeah so we are bad streams web free native pay-per-view live stream plus betting platform so the problem we want to tackle is that the global live stream betting is based on an inefficient and non-transparent web to infrastructure so everything is behind thank you it's behind the closed curtain right so you can see some numbers over here 80 billion dollars is the market globally in the US you can see by 2030 it's going to grow 10 percent just to justify the the market is there why we build it right now so we've got web free tools that enable creating a total end-to-end web to web free experience for the viewers finally you don't have to worry about the fairness of price distribution and most important people love watching something live together especially in this distributed world and also getting engaged with what's presented on the live stream so therefore we created bad streams which uses Life beer for the live stream super fluid for the pay-per-view so you only pay when you watch and Yuma for the betting do before and during the live stream on the platform you can build results of sport games World Cup is coming maybe we will be ready for that TV series so like when Jeffrey is going to die in Game of Thrones or what's going to happen on love Island last but not least even put your money on the project that will win on the Eve Bogota hackathon so hello to all the people that watch it at eveglobal.tv this can be web free experience in a year or so right so right now I would like to present you the architecture Yeah so basically when a user wants to start uh streaming first they have to pay they didn't have they they they can play and live peer should be checking if the stream is uh being flow is the stream flowing and then uh we send a notification to the creator of the stream to to notify them of a new Watcher like you were yeah so we deployed the bogotex token on Optimus mainnet who would care about testnet right and it's used for the super fluid paying and also about the Yuma we have our own token Boga ticks and when you think about web3 TV you can think about it as you have an opportunity to tokenize the experience so we're thinking about Yuma with a long short uh pool where people can look at a live stream and long let's say you're looking at a sporting event you can long one team short another team so just making a game out of the experience yeah and on the on the stream there is a chat from streamer in the future and right now we'd like to go to the demo so none of us are front-end Engineers just a disclaimer uh but we do have functionality and we think that uh back end is where we're strong okay so let's start with connecting our wallet um we have multiple choices and web free app is actually a good choice to onboard web to people to web free but let's connect to metamask we are web free people right okay so as you can see we can see our token balance it's um a lot and we have a live stream and right now we are live streaming from the obs and yeah so right now we are live streaming and we are pay-per-viewing this live stream and as you can see on the superflate dashboard our book attacks button is going down yes and we configured we configured live peer to send an event to our web hook system and this is I am the web hook system so I got the event from from lifebeer and now I am sending a notification to our application uh that we as you can see it that we are start that we are live and you can see it yeah so uh that's what we've got so we want to present like end-to-end web free based platform for streaming and imagine like pay per view right now you have to pay Upfront for everything you watch over here you can just pay as you go so once you're not interested anymore you just stop and it doesn't go anymore so basically that's what we presented and we want to say like we had tons of fun during the hackathon like we are far from Poland we also go to lens over here and that was a hell of experience over here and we wish that in every year the next uh like hackathon like this is going to be streamed on badstream thank you oh amazing well if I have more time I will put this on E global.tv all right next up is Eternal reviews yes please welcome reviews on stage thank you [Applause] hey guys um thank you very much for coming my name is Ricky and before I start with our live demo I have one question to you no need to answer at all just think for yourself how have you found the hotel in Bogota I bet you checked some reviews and that's exactly what I did because I don't want to pay for a hotel that is not worth it and I don't want to lose my money at all and that's exactly what we built we built a simple review platform as you can see in here where user will log in with his ethereum address and can evaluate pretty any project that runs on Equity room system and what's the point of this all the point is that we will check the address that user has locked in with and we will check if it interacted with any contract he wants to evaluate if no no chance if yes then you can write a review and this is a thing that will make the reviews from True users so just the user can evaluate the project that's pretty much it so I will show you what we have so far and um one important thing this is a life so you can go and write your review so far we have just one project it's a ens and we choose ens because they have really great API and simple RPC calls which is really easy to implement so if you want to check it out so just click to open the project and there are some reviews in the database that has been uh done before and as you can see I can't write a review because I'm not logged in so I will just connect my wallet and after connecting there is another message I can't create a review because I don't have any ens name connected to that address right now so there is no chance to write a review and this is how it looks like then you are able to write a review so you interacted with the protocol so you you can write a review so just score it between 0 to 5 and write a text review and yes that's exactly how it works and because I have three more minutes so I will tell you some next steps uh of course the step number one is to add more projects we've been thinking about uh some projects like uniswap or cow swap where we will check if the user interacted with their protocols and if yes how often and what time period so we don't want to have reviews from users then interacted like 100 times in next or last two days we won't have for example six month period and 15 transactions I think that's much uh pretty real user the second step we would like to do is Implement a better login maybe with polygon ID where we will create their claims yes as I heard polygon ID so we shall go for that perfect uh where we will create some claims that will tell us if the user interacted with the protocol or not and then we won't see uh his address which is pretty cool and the last thing we would like to implement uh is uh minting to the blockchain we would like to run it for example on optimism anyone [Laughter] and start the text review on some some system I will try maybe ipfs so we won't consume that much bites and uh we were minted to the user address uh for one simple reason because when you have a review platform the biggest issue there is that you can hide some reviews from centralized database like we have right now so uh if we mint it to the user address he has logged in with so we will just checked all the nfts we have minted and simply show it on the front end so there won't be anything like deleting messages or you know hiding something that is not good for us so thank you guys for your attention thank you and uh enjoy the rest of the week and I would like to say hi to my teammate that does not feel really good now I hope you are getting better Shimon thank you awesome thank you next up we have pulp so please welcome team pop on stage [Music] [Applause] hi everyone Welcome to our presentation pulp private and collateralized lending protocol we created a peer-to-peer learning protocol with the purpose of serving underwrite percentage groups we want to use self-sovereign identity as a reputation score and it looks like sorry like this for example any trustworthy issue will verify that the borrower has a rich reputation score of for example 70 and this information will be shared with the lender other information like the area code name Etc will not be shared the metrics of the reputation score is like this for example if you're a contributor to bankless style this will add value to your to your reputation score if your Community member like shifa or Colonel Etc as well as educational institution all this metric will serve as a high reputation score so we have two separate user flows that we're going to show the first one is showing the borrower's flow and the second one will be from the lender's perspective the main difference between the borrowers and the lenders is that the lenders will actually have to put in requests of what they would like to see from the borrower's end and then the bar will the borrowers will have to verify that they meet those set of requirements so let's get a little bit into the technicalities of the front end and the back end the blockchain part it is built with next JS and which we are going to make it Library while the blockchain part is made with Foundry this is basically a interface that lets the borrowers find some depth to take from the lenders and match them so there are some kind of requirements we have speak about them also before like one of the easiest one is the age someone must build 18 years old probably to get some debt so but there are many others that we can prove via zero knowledge proofs like participation to the AO also to some educational institution us to some public good so that's just a simple filter we choose how much do we want to take as a borrow um it could be five thousand and we choose which claim we want to prove so for example we want to prove that we are 18 years old and we want to prove that we participate in Adele that could be shifai kernel or Bank class everything so how does it work being based in zero knowledge proof there is an issuers of those identities that it must be trusted party and we will issue those claims via QR code those claims will be scanned into the polygon ID app that stores all the identity and self-service and identity of the user once the user scans it it can generate the zero knowledge proof that will be done signed by the wallet and will be fitted to a known chain contract that will take care to prove the validity of zero knowledge of the zero knowledge proof and that it has been released by a specified identifier that means a specified institution trustable Institution that is trusted by the lender itself so it will send this transaction however it wants with metamask Converse wallet wallet connect any of them just scan the QR code and send the transaction we and then continue and if he has the requirements to get the borrow in automatic it gets the money and that's it to you oh so with the little time we have I'm just gonna quickly go through what it would look like from a lender's perspective in a prototype stage so the like I mentioned the main difference is that they will have to set their own requirements first they'll put in the lending amount that they are comfortable lending as well as the interest rate and then they will add at least two of these requirements from what they would like the borrowers to have so we've added age endow contributor and finally same as from the borrower's perspective they just save these changes to the to their ethereum wallet okay oh thank you awesome thank you so much next up we have Team Super C please welcome team super seed on stage [Music] hi everybody so we're Team Super Scene my name is Jess my name is Naima I'm Azteca Anna Alessia and we're really excited to share with you what we built today um before we get started this is a wealth building app but we want you to know that our ethos is that wealth is about a lot more than just lining your pockets so we've built something that helps you get higher interest rates on things you wouldn't normally get interest on and there's also a giving element we believe that true wealth is also contributing back to your community so how does this work hey everyone my name is Anna and I'm going to show you how we're going to grow your D5 wealth and fund public goods so who did we build this for really we build this for anyone who wants to take advantage of the upside of crypto and also who believes that true wealth is meant to be shared so what is it supersede is a simple automated dollar cost averaging dab paired with a community impact to supercharge your D5 investment strategy we pull your Capital to work by streaming your money continuously into a dollar cost averaging asset like ethereum or a Bitcoin and the rest of the capital that normally would be sitting there collecting dust or losing value due to inflation we take it and we automatically invest it in the yield generating protocol and then you can take that yield and delegate it to public goods and so when someone logs in they choose how much Capital they want to commit say you want to commit a thousand dollars and so you would set it up to stream uh a hundred dollars per week and then the rest of the 900 dollars would be invested in a yield generating protocol and then once you receive your profits it auto contributes to public goods funds and then you can even do more by sharing your entire profit of the rewards now we're going to go into how it works hi I'm Naima so we really wanted to create a friendly user interface and allow anyone to get onboarded onto the platform and so if you go to the next slide we wanted it to be accessible so the minimum amount to deposit would be ten dollars and you could deposit a minimum over one month and you can dollar cost average and our minimum donation is two percent which we allow you to to basically select which fund you would like to donate to so there's retro public goods get coin grads and Community voted funds and then we implemented this growth summary so that you could see a total of like all the interest that you've earned uh and then even viewed like the funds that you've raised for your public goods and uh I'll hand it off to Alicia yes so we have three components that is invest grow and give so for the investing aspect that is where we do dollar cost averaging and we utilize swapping with one inch as well as super fluid for money streams the advantage of using super fluid is the fact that when the user allocates bunnies for dollar cost averaging they don't lock it up so they can decide to withdraw that ass at any time but the thing that is good for us is that when they do that we can also take a portion of that stream that is not in a DCA position and generate yield So currently we are generating leads with Ave and also we have a given component so we mentioned earlier the give back we also want to build community around this so we do have um two different types of nft tracks um the first one is more about the investment and engaging with the actual site itself so here at the top you see seeds um uh for supersede you would be getting seeds that you would be earning for different actions for investing for saving and then you could burn them for different versions and levels we also have on the next slide we have the special edition giving nfts this one is my favorite eternal optimist is public good uh growing is open source Community is choice so we want to give people an option to give back to the public good in general we also wanted people to give them the option to give back to the web 3 community so that would be Bitcoin grants for now and then we also wanted the community to be able to choose the cool thing about this thing is that depending on what level you have so say you decide you're going to just do the minimum two percent that's fine you'll get a badge there's different levels of badges so if you decide to give five percent ten percent 100 you're not giving the basic Revenue that you have you're giving the profit right so you're not losing anything you still have what you put in um we're going to have different uh levels of this and as a platform we're going to profit share back to the people who are giving the most so we're putting our money over a map this too yes and this is our full Tech stack we would love to see how these protocols can help us grow our project and this is our team we would we would like to give a thank you to Eve oh we want to give a shout out and thank you to Blue Dao and Heath Global for having us and thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amazing all right next up is kodia Network please welcome Kuwaiti Network team on stage [Applause] okay hello everyone I would like to present to Chloe is this dream belongs to all the dips uh the web tree developers that are here we we build a web tree platform for web tree devs to solve web3 issues uh we we are trying to uh unite all the web Tree devs in Latino America we started from Argentina we are going to Brazil and we are here in Colombia so welcome and this is the problems that we are finding in our our community in here in hackathon we validate it like web tree depths are burning out our Enterprise because they are the only ones on the Enterprise a lot of responsibilities and even in their own projects uh it's taken into our projects due to their beginning Pro a profile and even if you are trying to develop your skills you are facing very very Advanced code so you and some in some cases you need help and that is our solution related with because when you ask it for Solutions and solve it the leads maybe it's understandable it's pushing on for all the sites all the channels uh 100 1000 of GMS so at the end it's very difficult but I meet a lot of people here in hackathon and they are very very nice people and I I don't like it that they can be misunderstanded so our solution for this problem is uh decentralize Network Association Network with wet tree dips where they can interact between them to resolve high priority web tree issues and related with codes and for this we we propose a air help and sorry help and earn don't forget it because that is kind of incentive or permanent incentive in our in a non-protocol so the validator I explained here firstly like make a pose we call it a Kodi like with all requirements and conditions and some another developer experimented with knowledge he will participate to solve it if the the issuer wants to give some huge we call it like notes call it a bounty if you want but we prefer it say like a huge so I find the the answer I create an asset of value and nft that at the end is the problem solve it yeah check it but at the end this could be shared for the community for the all the web tree depth Community because the the restaurant another web tree adapts that can make the recall and also the incentives could be still working on with collectics with comments with likes at the end it's a social networks for depths and building with depths so also a global recommendation score is more than you participate Mario you give more the implementation you are leading to in a scoreboard so firstly I will show you how it works please like you can see here like you will stand you search for the pre for the for the troll that you are facing on you can see okay okay this is related as topics I can share like a there is two two kind of connections without with your wallet or without your wallet where are your wallet you can just uh taking off okay I want to sell the the categories which coming out which topics are you can categorize with each topic through protocols or categories or kind of interest that you need but if you want to get a complete experience you connect your your wallet metamask or whatever that you own and then it allows to you to participate in a collective way like more participate like getting like a incentive or creating more Dynamics societies between you like here is an example I found this this trouble I have the answer I write the code and at the end I submit it like okay I get the reward is if available and I can continue like for example here I can just just write the code also it's possible like uh putting a photograph on your code and solving the problem of the community because at the end solves one problem but solves a permanently a problem for all the community but can cause whatever that they want uh at the end we want to say that this is a public God like this is knowledge for all for develop more and more the the community of Victory depths in Latin America and at the end we are facing the same troubles I think that here we share a lot of the difficulties uh facing this change we love this we love this change but we need to help a bit with between us with the next please so yeah we will develop an app web and eventually also um application for the mobile if you want to get some that is our rom-up event too in hackathon we find a lot of features that we developed I I used to mention it here to you and we started from a piece of paper and we we build a dream and and thank you very much for your time and let's build uh why they are stronger a United wet tree depth community so thank you appreciate it awesome congratulations all right next up we have zip line but before they go on it's going to make a quick note that at the Super C demo we just uh ran into Wi-Fi issue so you couldn't see a real demo but if you go to the youth Global showcase you can see the whole website and try it out live on chain so with that let's welcome zipline foreign my name is Eric and I'm a research engineer at chainsafe my name is Willem I'm also a research engineer at chainsafe and my name is Cayman I write code at chainsafe [Music] yeah this weekend we built a project called zipline and it's a trustless eth2 to evm bridge that does not employ too much cryptography um so Bridges today they're mostly multi-sick based um they're which means it's a small permission set of relayers that detect and relay events between two different chains they're currently mostly like application specific so we see a lot of token Bridges like erc20s and they're high trust and low security I think we've heard a lot about you know all the hacks that are going on um and so we can spend all day talking ridges but um I think you know to build better Bridges we want to like lay down the exact properties that we want um oh well okay so we want trustless which means that information that's being passed between chains can be verified to be correct we want a permissionless which means anybody can be a relayer and that's really great because we can have more decentralized systems or more decentralized bridges which means we have better liveness and then we also want generic messaging um so like I said before they're mostly token Bridges nowadays but we want to build much more cool like cross-chain apps like games and all that so proof of consensus um the ability to verify consensus of another chain is very important um so it's a new idea from uh I think succinct Labs recently um so an example of being able to do this is to verify ethereum's Casper finality Gadget um but unfortunately the unfortunately this requires a lot of computation so verifying you know BLS signatures committee rotations Etc so and that's really hard to do on the evm or any other constraint environment except for substrate they can do it um luckily ethereum has a light client protocol which makes this a little bit easier to a protocol that limits the bandwidth and computation necessary to stay synced to the chain in a semi-trustless way or trustless way so basically at high level um we get we create subsets of validators called sync committees they sign over every single block and they're in this committee for a single period which is roughly a day and you have a one day look ahead so the sync protocol basically allows you to sync period to period which is basically day to day and it works by basically verifying a signature uh over this block block header in this period and then you get a proof all the way to the next committee which allows you to then verify the next periods um and even then it's probably still too much work to do on chain so people are now using snarks to basically prove that that this logic was computed um and then they submit the snark on chain and there are a few teams that are currently doing this all right so what we wanted to investigate in this hackathon is If instead of using stocks which kind of come with their own problems and can be expensive to execute on chain uh if we could use foolproofs uh to kind of get the same result and so like a foolproof um instead of like a validity proof like a snock which can like like prove that you did some computation uh a fold proof allows another actor to prove that you did not execute the computation correctly and if you set up the incentives right you can have it so that people are always watching you and looking out for your faults uh this is exactly how like optimistic roll ups work like um so we know that it works so what we came up with is uh zipline which is Fault proofs which we took from optimism Canon and the E3 light client and that allows us to do proof of consensus with the execution off chain and fault proof kind of verification of that execution on chain um so the way it works is relayers are submitting these like sync updates uh these just get put in call data so that they're like available later off-chain code verifies the transitions uh between sync updates is valid and a watch is constantly watching to make sure that the relays are honest and we get some cool properties if you make a bridge this way so in the like the Happy case uh there's no on-chain execution basically uh in the no fraud case all it's doing is like putting payloads into call data there's minimal storage like you just need like two hashes every 27 hours so it's steeping that way as well and um yeah it's missionless anyone can relate the updates and it stays synced to the finalized chain and that's exactly time cool um so this was a blast to work on and yeah if you're interested we've got a blog post coming out really soon and yeah check us out on Twitter and thanks for listening awesome next up we have Anonymous Vickery chain auctions on chain now Victory arches on chain so please welcome I think reactions teams on stage [Applause] thank you if you've heard of nft auctions or vault liquidations then surely you've seen a first price auction on chain in which bidders place bids on a certain asset that they want and people on chain just accept the highest one however this is not optimal at all in Market design and Game Theory it turns out that an auction called the victory cart Groves mechanism or the second price auction is actually the correct optimal way to do this type of auction and what happens is instead of the first place winner paying the first price the first place winner pays a second person's price and it turns out this small modification actually leaves this mechanism to be both truthful meaning that bidders are incentivized to bid what they actually value that item at and optimal price Discovery for the seller who will actually often discover higher prices than they would have otherwise because their bidders are acting more honestly and sort of conservatively now one would ask if this is a strictly more optimal mechanism why haven't we been using this all along why have why is the whole Space defaulted to First price auctions and the answer is that there are two slightly difficult things with these vcg auxins one is that it requires secret bids that is if all your bids are public like they are in nft auction or about liquidation um it defeats the whole purpose of the second price auction because people can game uh where they are in this in the list of prices and also coordinate off-chain with other people uh to manipulate these prices and so one way you can avoid secret bids and there are some constructions that do this is to use EK but this isn't sufficient because we also want a second property which is we don't even want to know who is participating in the auction if we know who's participating in the auction we can calculate the maximum eth in their account and we know the maximum eth uh that can be possibly bid by other people and we know the minimum amount that we would have to bid to win it and so we will be able to manipulate it if we even knew the people who were participating so is there a way to get both secret Biz and Anonymous participation and so we came up with victory.xyz private second price auctions on chain I'm ayush I'm out today and I'm Philip and uh Xerox ngmi helped us come up with a lot of this construction as well so big Kudos and uh we have it deployed on a bunch of test Nets here so how exactly do we do this one way that we do this is we exploit the create to opcode in eth the way to create two op code works is it allows you to deploy a deterministic contract at an address and the way this address is calculated is it's roughly a hash of your address assault which you can keep secret and the hash of the bytecode now the normal way people use create two is they plan to deploy their contract at some point in time they deploy their contract to that hack that they know in advance and they start using it but it turns out we can do a slightly different thing with this op code where instead we send the eth to this opcode ahead of time without deploying the contract so it looks like for instance auction one bitter a is just sending to an externally owned account um and then later on when they actually want to interact with the auction they can just reveal this create two hash and create that contract but from the perspective of everyone watching the chain it just seems like an account has sent some eth to another account this means that the person who is actually bidding on the auction in this case bitter a would blend in with every other eoa sending eth to any other empty eoa on chain also the other bidders in the auction like bitter B and also every bidder and every other option happening at the same time there's no way to tell these apart which option they are bidding on uh or how much they are bidding you'll notice that you actually send the amounts of eth um and you might think that this would leak the amount of eat that they're actually bidding however because the create2 hash includes assault we can actually put the real amount of heat that they are bidding inside this salt and then verify this later thus masking the actual amount they're bidding so then in the reveal phase all we have to do is actually generate these create two accounts so actually deploy the addresses and reveal the numbers that we use to generate those accounts at which point the eth will be withdrawable now you might ask why can't someone just game the system why can't they just send the eth and then if they actually decide they don't uh want to present in the auction they just take out their eats secretly and the reason is um the way create to opcode works is you generate the public key of the contract and the address of the contract but you don't know the private key of the contract so until you deploy this create two op code you actually have no way of getting your eth back meaning you have to reveal if you want to get your money back now this is almost correct but there's one key missing step which is that what happens if you bid after the reveal phase has started so everyone bids the reveal phase begins people are uh have to stop bidding but you decide that oh let me look at some of these bids and then I'll bid a little bit and then I'll reveal later so I have some extra information it turns out that the original create 2 protocol has no way of preventing this so what you have to do is when the reveal period begins your auction contract takes a snapshot of the block hash at that point in time then you do a Merkel Patricia try proof of the storage of that contract now the Merkel Patricia try is a storage that ethereum uses to store all the data you can imagine uh it's like a Merkle tree where you can just verify a path to some data and that'll verify that that data actually exists yeah um finally once the reveal finished period is finished you can withdraw the asset and the auction contract will pay out the correct amount as well as the assets that you'll notice the highest bidder paid the second highest amount uh so we have the flows here that there's the timers run out can I can I still go through yeah okay um so a user would create an auction like this they would select an nft and enter how long they want their auction to last then the auction gets displayed in in this list like this and then when somebody wants to bid on the auction they can place a hidden bid using the create two transfer and then after the bidding period ends they can choose to reveal their bids uh where a winner is calculated and then they can claim the nft if they won or they can withdraw the bid if they didn't thank you and then the auction Creator can withdraw uh the highest bid right now just a quick screenshot of all the code because obviously if it was everybody's going to read it so uh we have here some fancy assembly with it to like optimize the gas a little bit and use this new language called Huff but anyway there's no time so we won't go into that and then um here you can scan the QR code and get to the actual site and I quickly want to say thanks to the not fellows and uh all our sponsors who organize the hacker houseware and then we'll move to the quick uh live demo in the last few seconds we have all right turns out we can't exit the slide so we definitely have more than screenshots like absolutely it's not it's listening and uh to better nft prices in the future thanks all right thank you so much next up we have Team discreet please welcome discreet on stage [Applause] [Music] foreign hello everybody okay let me ask you a quick question right now have you ever been in this situation when you don't want anybody to know what you're doing right now even in the blockchain or in the real life we don't need people following our step all the time so if you ever felt like this then discrete is a perfect tool for you powered by Aztec CK rollops we ensure full privacy for nfts but you gotta be discreet okay so basically we're five guys that met on Friday and we all believe in the importance of privacy on nfts so with this project we are committed with hiding our privacy and yours too so what did we build we built a zero knowledge ZK privacy layer for nfts this allows you to privately purchase and hold your nfts how does it work all right so users log on to Aztec Network that user then would mint an nft that nft is being minted on each mainnet via our ZK Bridge the that nft is then sent to the Aztec ZK roll-up contract and then on on Aztec each user would receive a virtual asset representing that a ZK nft that user on Aztec can redeem that ZK nft onto mainnet whenever they want on ethereum you'll see that someone on Aztec network has minted that nft but you're not able to see who we're enabling private minting and owning of nfts to prove this out we actually built an entire nft drop obviously so uh yeah skunks skunks 500 skunks look at them look at them they all have the swag they're wearing the Aztec swag they have the the nouns glasses and yeah I mean we all know that skunks always leave stinky smells behind their their tails but thanks to Aztec uh they won't leave any Trail anymore laughs okay so yeah that's a demo video Yeah does this work okay cool not video so I'll walk you through a quick demo um this is actually going to deploy uh I mean mint an nft on Aztec uh first we connect to Aztec and give it a few seconds next we connect our wallet initialize create a spending key foreign Ty and this uh randomly selects an nft and it's minted privately [Applause] so how How It's Made there's three key pieces the most important is the zero knowledge bridge for the nfts which allows you to Shield the ownership of the nfts on the front end that Roy just demoed we used the Aztec zero knowledge SDK and we also have the skunk nft contract and I guess what's important about our project is we created the first nft and walk over here created the first nft bridge for Aztec Network which is also applicable for any nft ERC 721 contracts on ethereum so if you have any nfts on ethereum that are erc721 you can enable privacy using our protocol all right all right so privacy is important we know that um so you know full disclosure we're full we're all like very not well slept and probably pretty stinky like these skunks but we sat down and we ideated some of the potential use cases for private nfts the first one that comes to mind is smart money or art collectors that want to acquire nfts without this necessarily being public data they can do that preventing on-chain snooping you think about event or ticket nfts you can you can have this nft without associating your person with that particular location and then membership nfts is this broad category but uh we're kind of thinking about those membership nfts that you would prefer to keep private the key here is that you're only exposing nfts that you want to expose and you're keeping the rest private in the future so uh where do we want to go with this um the teasing out the idea of proof of users EK nfts without revealing the type or the amounts a Marketplace for the ZK and ft so you can transact completely on NASDAQ trading amongst each other and eventually an integration with openc or other popular nft marketplaces to allow ZK purchases of any ethereum-based nft just wanted to say thank you to eth Global look at this four seconds we freaking nailed it with five minutes but great hackathon we really enjoyed it and thank you so much from discrete amazing [Applause] all right two more demos to go and then we get two prizes so without further Ado let's welcome Club Space [Applause] all right Hello friends my name is Carlos my teammates are Lucas and Nathan this is Club Space a live listening experience for all lens friends if you want to have an image in mind just imagine Twitter spaces but with music nfts and instead of Twitter auth we're using lens so uh the core components of the of the project right so music nfts obviously uh we have real-time interactions between lens profiles we have uh P2P uh Pub sub uh integration for that and participation is kept private and rewarded so while you're at the party everyone knows you're at the party you're all having a great time you're bumping music but when you leave it's all ephemeral and for you to essentially have a reward you can submit as DK proof so just to go a little bit deeper right so uh we imagine this is a way for creators to Market their content so creators Host this party invite their friends and yeah reward anyone that shows up cool we worked hard on that all right so uh yeah gonna go ahead and log in with lens sweet gonna load a playlist from spin amp this is a decent contract that I deployed on their uh GUI and I'm gonna go ahead and create a post so uh join now fam as for the goodie it's something that's uh it's an nft that's going to be minted to anyone that shows up and can you know uh uh privately attest the fact that they were there oh boom yeah go ahead and create the party so yeah this is doing a couple things it's gonna submit the metadata to ipfs and then it's going to go ahead and submit the transaction to create the post on lens we'd love to integrate the lens API but short on time and uh yeah I mean it's going to have uh it's going to do a couple things um it also is going to create a group on our semaphore contract so that's how we attest to the you know to the proofs and uh yep submit a couple things we're going to index it and we'll be able to show you a Live party ah so there's going to be a URL shown uh pretty soon we suggest you go to the actual website right now if you want uh we suggest also metamask browser and connect your wallet then there will be a live URL that you can share with your friends it'll be automatically on Leinster right so if I go over here foreign socialize it have fun so a couple things are happening here under the hood we're uh connecting to the channel that we created at the stream technically uh we created through streamer Network um you know we're pulling the the historical events we emit like three types uh each with their own uh payload right so join leave reaction eventually it's going to load we've uh We've struggled a little bit I can see that some things are happening of course we've exceeded some rate limit but uh I can probably try to refresh try it again worst case I do have a screenshot for how it looks one last time we have a sick playlist lined up and we'd love to show you that's how we plug this thing in okay I have another browser there are times of charm I wonder if we just destroyed the stream if anyone else is trying to connect because we struggled with the three of us so uh we'll see what happens worst case we have a screenshot we're gonna move on bummer that's what it would have looked like imagine that music playing you can send reactions it's sick uh the music is really good we have uh we have Chaos on there they're dope band you should check them out um for the final part of the of the project once you've been to the party we collected impression that you were there and we save it off chain in a private store that only your wallet address can access when you go to the claims page after the party then we'll pull all of the group IDs off the contract match the ones that you went to and then we'll let you claim your reward this will generate a ZK proof client side and then you can send that and you'll get your goodie bag delivered to your address and this is Club Space this is a little buddy and thank you so much awesome all right and with that our 12th and last finalist demo of the day please welcome txn.xyz [Applause] well hello everyone I'm Dawson and today I'm going to tell you about transaction.xyz so this is a real URL that you can go visit and use after this and I'm about to change the way that you use web3 so what is transaction XYZ it's a dedicated transaction page for sending transactions but what this means is that as a front-end developer you never need to use ethers and you never need to use web3.js again because you can you can URL encode all of your transaction data and pop open the transaction XYZ link so let me show you an example I've got three examples here there's claiming an airdrop which is a very complex transaction with nested arrays we've got approving a die transaction and we've got transferring die so what happens here when you click claim airdrop it pops open this URL which I could send to all of you and you could open this exact same thing and you'd get the exact same experience which is an immediate transfer request or immediate transaction request for the claim function on the real production smart contract and like I said it's live and it works today at this URL um so this is an example of the most complex of the transactions out of the examples here but there's also like I said approving die and transferring die so I pitched you now like you could replace ethers but you know why would you right you're just going to replace it with a new API like the transaction XYZ API well there's some huge advantages which is that pulling ethers like rainbow kit uh like pulling in ethers and rainbow kit and some of these tools we all use to connect it takes about 250 kilobytes and I don't know if any of you had lightning fast internet this entire weekend like I did but having way faster page loads makes a huge difference a recent study found that one second slower page loads leads to 10 user drop off so why not delay the loading of these libraries until the moment you need to sign the transaction so that's one for like the Nerds who like to optimize their bundle but I've got even more for you if you're a back-end developer you can now open up and execute transactions without ever saving your private keys in your scripts because from your back end you can pop open the browser and just click the approve function it keeps your private keys in the place we already know is safe and secure that we love whether that be metamask or whatever browser wallet you use or desktop wallet that you use or mobile wallet that you use it's been tested as well on Rainbow mobile and everything else uh so I I told you two of the three examples just now the last one that I think could get super creative is recurring events let's say once a month you want to farm your defy yields you want to like gather your yields it's one claim uh or or a similar type of function call you can actually save on your Google calendar or save that in a Cron job and pop it open in your browser once a month and just click approve so it cuts down and saves time improves security improves page load speeds and for web 3 to go across the whole world we have to make our web pages faster so that was the original motivation here and I kind of stumbled upon these other use cases but originally the goal is just really fast page loads because in web 3 we should all be able to access it no matter where you are in the world thank you for your time [Applause] all right please give a big round of applause for all 12 of our finalists one more time [Applause] I know everybody's tired I'm gonna try to end this soon don't worry haha it's it's because it's switching between both internet from ethernet and Wi-Fi yay all right well these are R12 finalists and for all of you if you want to get more details on each of these teams or any of these teams or also the 200 plus teams that did not come on stage you can go to eat global.com showcase and see a list of everything that came out of this event all right now on to the stuff that I know a lot of you have been waiting for our partner prizes and before we do

tentative which means we will verify that you actually did everything this weekend and not something before so this is why we need time to make everything perfectly available on your dashboard and some pool prices may change which means that pool prices are split equally between the recipient so in case a recipient is added or removed the amount will fluctuate so what you see now on the pool price especially may not be the final amount everything will be distributed the next two weeks so October 21st is when you will receive all the prizes so before we wrap things off and let everybody sleep rest or party want to say some thank yous and really take a time to really appreciate everybody that's made this event possible there's a lot of people that are involved in making an event of

back to the finalists if this is your first ethical event uh you may not know this thing but we do not like these thing to be competitions these events are a way for you to learn and understand and explore what you can experiment with and as a result we don't have a notion of first second third we call these teams finalists because effectively they all are first place winners and as part of
