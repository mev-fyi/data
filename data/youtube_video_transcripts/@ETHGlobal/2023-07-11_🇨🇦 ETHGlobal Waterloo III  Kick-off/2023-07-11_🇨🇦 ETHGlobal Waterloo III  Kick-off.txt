foreign [Music] good afternoon everybody my name is kartik I'm one of the co-founders of Eve bubble and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to eat Global Waterloo this is not a conference this is a neat Global events and if you've been to any colon before you would know this but these events are about getting developers into the wet 3 ecosystem our goal is to onboard as many people as we can to build the future of weft 3 in the decentralized web and what makes this different is that this is a hackathon our focus is on Builders we care about learning giving you the opportunity to get help in building whatever you're excited about and this is a place for you to grow and develop your skills and most importantly we believe showing is way more important than telling which is why everything we're going to talk about and do today and this weekend is going to be showing what we did and not talking about what we built and we've been doing this since 2017. whether it's in Argentina South Africa New York London Amsterdam Mexico San Francisco India Japan Lisbon or Waterloo again all of this has been happening since 2017 and it all started right here in this city with each Waterloo and I'm super excited to say that we're back excited to be back here for the third time it's in the last seven years so with that let's get started there's over 900 attendees here this entire weekend of which 650 of them are hackers from 29 different countries and the best part is 47 of them are new developers to web 3. this is going to be one of our best events that brings in most amount of people in this space people are here from six different continents and it's just constantly incredible to me to see these Maps because it blows my mind when I see people all over the world trying to get into this ecosystem on top of all these hackers we have 136 econsistent Builders these are our amazing partners and Engineers from the companies and protocols that you're going to use and you like using and 16 dedicated mentors who are here going to help you with anything that you need we've already done a lot of these workshops we're going to do 19 workshops on what's actually happening how to use different protocols and because this is not a conference only five talks all of them happen earlier today to tell you how to think about the next few months to years and top it all off we're giving 250 000 in prizes and for Canadians here that's over 325 thousand dollars I want to thank 26 of our incredible partners for being the amazing people that make this events happen so please join me in clapping as loudly as we can for everybody that I'm going to talk about which is gnosis chain worldcoin air stack eight point polygon the graph follicle I knew my xcc assist Mill unlock hyperlane near Dell xmtp risk zeroes on cheap Quant stand compound maker litz quick note better Mass highlight chain safe thank you so much for being here they're talking they're giving away so many amazing prizes we're going to talk about all those things but before all of that let's cover some key quick Logistics the goal here is to make sure the next 10 minutes are jam-packed with all the information you need to now to be successful for the next 48 hours so I'm going to talk about all the stuff about this venue all the activities that we're doing how you can get help all the prizes of course you can win all the workshops and talks and how to catch up on all those things if you're still looking for a team we still have a lot of options for you and most importantly how judging and project submission is going to work so before all of that most important note do not use Wi-Fi hotspots why because we finally figured out the Internet situation and it's actually pretty good now and the second you draw down the hot spots you make the internet slow for everybody else so if something is not working on the Internet or if it's slow the right action is to tell us where it's slow so we can fix it but do not turn on hotspots keep that in mind let's talk about security all of you should have your wristbands and a lanyard make sure that you have both of those things on you at all times there will be security at the doors for exit and entry if you lose it we will not be issuing another wristband to you which means that you will not be allowed back in the building so keep just make sure you don't lose your wristband we may issue you a batch but definitely not the wristband do not cut it off make sure you have it on and of course do not leave your belongings unattended we are not liable for anything that gets stolen or lost please make sure that you are keeping your personal belongings especially any expensive stuff with you at all times and while there is security it does not mean that you can just leave your stuff and walk around or walk away from the venue and expect it again to to be there always we don't think this will happen but just just to notice and most importantly this is a University campus Building I want to also think Laura University for making this possible uh from 11 PM to 7 A.M the front entrance that you all came from will be locked so the back entrance which is just at the end of the hall is the way to exit and enter the building so just keep that in mind don't worry there'll be enough signs as well but that's the most important thing you need to know about security let's talk about the venue we have a lot of things happening on different floors but the most important of all is just this wall we're on right now this is the main Auditorium and the main stage there's a massive hacking area right outside this Hall and the three rooms that you already did workshops in will be potentially doing some activities there all the green spots on this map are where all of our partners are you can go find any of them that are giving prizes or building incredible Technologies talk to them understand what they're doing and this is where you can find all of them you can also at the my right top right uh bottom right where the food is you all probably saw dinner and that's where all the food will be for the entire Tire weekend and uh similarly the the venue also opens up to the second floor uh there's more hacking spots on the second floor there's also a chill room where you can just kind of lounge around they'll be also sleeping in areas there and you have access to the second floor those are the only two floors that will be open and will be monitored and matter on Sunday judging will take place on the third floor so you have to worry about it it's just that will redirect you to the third floor and we'll talk more about that in five minutes and also on Sunday on top of all of this there's a lot of things that we're doing so we already had dinner but we have a lot of late night snacks we're going to make sure you're all fat so at midnight tonight we'll be giving away poutine for one and a half hours for all of either sitting around and Saturday tomorrow night at midnight we'll be bringing Beaver Tails so make sure you enjoy all of that and tomorrow there'll be a massive ice cream truck for three hours a year right in the back parking lot and don't forget to take a selfie there's a lot of cool things that were going on you can get a digital photo email to you we want to make sure all the teams get to see each other and take a photo and have a memorabilia for them after the sackathon especially the before and after photo those are really always fun and also tomorrow we'll be bringing on some furry friends if you want to hold a hedgehog or a lot of other surprise animals you can find this out live tomorrow all this is also on the website and you can see where these things are going to be this one is in Workshop room one and that's what the rooms are going to be used for starting tomorrow all right most importantly let's talk about communication everything that we're going to be doing and talking about is going to be on Discord which means that if you are a hacker and you have not connected your Discord account to on our on our on your dashboard you will not see all the permissions to access all the channels Discord is where all of our partners are this is where all of our official announcements are going to be this is where we're going to give all the updates around judging project submission food all those things and this is also where you can talk to any company and ask them for help this means people who are here or you can find in the in the building or some people are joining remotely and helping out and taking shifts across the world to make sure that any of your questions get answered so keep an eye out there and make sure you monitor Discord will be only communicating with all official announcements there and all that is also on the website for a quick reminder the website is eth global.com Waterloo you can just head over there and you'll see the schedule and everything else that you need to know about this event the website will remain the source of Truth which means that if something is off track we'll update the website first and then tell you that things are changing or some things are behind or anything else and of course you're in person talk to each other if you're stuck and you can't get an answer on Discord walk up to the person or the company or the mentor and get your question answered we really want you to make sure that you take advantage of almost a thousand of you in this building and really talk and interact and get to see what others are excited about let's go into the hackathon how does the hackathon work officially hacking has already begun you can start working on your projects you can work on your projects with up to five members you don't have to have a team you can work individually if you'd like it's just always better if you have more support because of the time constraints you can work with them and have maximum Five People You have the next 36 hours to hack and submissions are due at 9am on Sunday the rules are simple anything that you're going to be submitting on Sunday must have been worked on during the hackathon which means everything you're doing should be done from scratch you cannot add features to some personal project they've been working on already and only people who have been rsvp'd and came in are allowed to submit and are eligible for any prizes which means that if you had somebody who couldn't make it and they're solicit on your team they'll be automatically removed in two hours from your page and if somebody was not listed on your team and you do win a prize but they did work together and they were also in the building that second person will not be receiving any prizes so make sure that everybody was on the project is listed on the team section on your dashboard and of course if you have any other questions please define me or anybody else on the youth Global team and ask away and we'll help resolve any edge cases the most common questions we get from this slide is can I use existing code from other projects do I can can I use border plates can use libraries yes you can Fork anything that's already open source but you cannot reuse your own personal project so if you want to use something like scaffold eat or 4K front-end interface for existing D5 app all that is allowed and okay but you cannot use your own project and work on it and add more features and there's a lot of stuff that adds happening for beginners and people of all skill sets so don't be afraid because half of you are already new to web3 and want to make sure that we make you feel welcome and we are help you with anything you need so don't be intimidated by anything there's a lot of resources we put together on the info center page on your dashboard you can see anywhere from recorded workshops and how to use different protocols to just copy and GitHub repos that already do half the things for you from existing border plates and of course everything that we did today which is all workshops and talks were recorded So if you missed anything or if you want to pause and you were there and you forgot what they wrote down on the CLI just go to eat global.tv click on any of those Workshop rooms and just go rewind and watch the video and pause it as you please you can catch up on all of that and thousands of other videos on how to use different protocols on global.tv and the global YouTube and the most important piece is if you are still looking for a workshop or team there is going to be another session right after I stop talking in an hour that's going to be a lot of talking in Workshop room one and we're gonna get all the people who are still looking for team or looking for somebody to join their team to kind of meet and will help all of you find your project or get an idea or meet others who can help you build the project for this weekend and the most important thing in terms of getting help is our mentors there's 16 of them here you can find them buy this jacket grab anybody wearing this jacket they're they're dedicated to help you with any of these questions technical or otherwise so if you need any help and you can get any answers find anybody wearing this jacket and ask them your questions they'll be able to answer anything for you whether it's about front-end back-end smart contracts security You Name It We have support for all this and this is also a 24 7 so you can expect the same thing at 4am and 4 pm now let's go into judging also I'm pretty super quiet so I might like is this making sense are you guys excited come on you gotta You Gotta Give me something there we go I know a lot of your students but uh it's unusual to pay this much attention okay if you can remember one thing from the last 15 minutes 9 A.M is the only deadline that matters Sunday 9 A.M is when we're gonna expect hundreds of projects coming in so please make sure that you are submitting your projects on time and when that happens and after that happens there's going to be two types of judging that's going to be important there's a main judging track and a partner judging track both of these things are happening in parallel and you will have to make a choice on which one you want to go for what's the difference between these two it's simple if you pick the main judging track and all this thing will be on the project submission form you choose to be part of the top 10 finalist teams and also our prizes for the partners if you only pick the partner judging track then you only are qualifying for the prizes if you only picked a partner judging you have to go up to each of the partners and demo what you built to each of them so if you want to qualify for four different prizes you have to do four demos if you do the main judging for the same four partner prizes you don't have to do four of those demos plus one other one on the third floor that means Choose Wisely on what you want to optimize for don't pick 20 projects and 20 prizes it's not going to work out well for you and we're going to cut off judging on the time that we have which is 12 30. but it's going to scale according to the number of prizes you want all of that is just on the parallelization the only thing that you want to keep in mind for all these pieces is you have to make sure that you don't forget to specify what prizes you want to qualify for because if you don't do that there's no way for us or anyone else to know what you wanted to do so make sure you select the right price and make sure you go to each of those tables for all of our partners and present it to them they will already know and will be expecting you and you can do this thing out of order just because both of these things are parallel does not mean there's an assigned spot it's going to be first come first serve so if you feel like there's a massive lineup on this side or on the main judging great just go down pick to anybody else and go join the line back again this doesn't have to be in order or assigned neither of them are one or more important than the other if you see a line optimized for your own time and just go to the next table that you have to demo on and one really really really really really really important thing the selection of your prize is going to be based off of the quality of what you submit not the demo which means that it's not just enough that you do a demo on the table that works really well you have to put all the details in on the submission form you have to describe how you did something what it does under the hood you have enough screenshots to explain what's going on and that is going to be the primary thing that I'll be looking at in addition to a whatever you demo to them so to make sure that you keep all of that in order and efficient for yourself we'll give you some guidelines you will have four minutes to demo for each partner and the main judges so if you have five projects or if you're Pi partners and you want to do main judging you have to do six times four that's how much time you're gonna have to spend on judging and we really recommend these record a video of your demo just in case something goes wrong so you can at least play it while you are trying to fix it live and really do not do this thing last minute we've seen it go wrong A lot of times we've seen people realize that they did way more time than they thought you will be able to see what the whole form looks like tomorrow morning just check out all the tabs and just be prepared for what you need to write up and the details that you need to give to really tell us what prizes you want to go for and all that is happening on your dashboard so it's as long as you're logged in you'll be able to see all these things and we're going to remind all of you a lot so I'm nearly done with all this before all of the logistics are wrapped up I want to talk about the code of conduct this is an in-person event we want to make sure that everybody follows the same rules and you can check out all the rules on eat global.com rules there's a couple of things that matter first of all in summary please be respectful for each other uh harassment will not be tolerant to any form if you feel like somebody's treating you or somebody else unfairly tell us about it we'll take immediate action and it's not just about harassment or respect in terms of the rules anything that you build here is solely owned by you you will own all the IP so no partners not us not anybody else no the university has any rights to anything that you create here each of the team members are equal owners of everything that you built and if you need any help if any other questions that we haven't answered ping us on Discord ping us here in person find us after 10 minutes after I'm done and we'll be able to answer all these things for you all right those are all the logistics let's get the rest of the show started so what I'm going to do now is bring on some amazing Partners up here on stage to tell you more about who they are what they're excited to do and why they are excited to talk to all of you and be at this event so without further Ado I'd like to bring on our very first partner which is Penryn to talk about world coin please give them a big round of applause hello everyone I'm Penryn or Ian I do developer relations at worldcoin so here to talk a little bit about world coin a little bit of information on our bounties things like that so world's going to start it out as a project that wanted to give everyone in the world a little bit of cryptocurrency to introduce them to the digital economy uh problem is how do you know who or what is a real and unique person basically a civil resistant problem we need to make sure that everyone who gets a little bit is a real person and that each real person only gets their fair share so to solve that we built World ID our privacy preserving proof of personhood protocol World ID make sure you're real when you get verified at the Orem it checks your unique Iris code a representation of the entropy of your iris and verifies your world ID your self-custodial identity stored on your mobile device this orb has gone through lots of different revisions since early 2021 or sorry early 2020 when it began development and within world at e you can have multiple proof of personhood credentials while the orb is sort of the gold standard highest certainty that you're a unique human we also support verifying with a phone number right simple way to prove that you at least have that although it's a much weaker proof of personhood credential and we'll be adding support for more and more proof of personal credentials over time and it will be a completely open protocol where anyone can make attestations to the fact that you are a real human World ID is privacy first it's decentralized and it's open source right we don't collect any personally identifying information we don't ask your name we don't ask for your email we never ask to see your ID or anything like that it's decentralized progressively and it's open source right now all the smart contracts are open source the developer portal our front end SDK everything like that is available on GitHub right now there's lots of different use cases for World ID right civil resistance is a problem that affects a broad variety of different things right so social media you want to know this account is a real person and not a bot customer incentives is one that I personally like a lot because if you can be very confident that someone's a unique human right maybe you give them a 25 discount on their first order whereas if they're just phone verified you know you can be a lot less certain but you want to give them something so you give them a five percent discount on their first order World Eddie is super easy to integrate I gave my workshop earlier but if any of you want to learn more I'm more than happy to talk to you at our booth we have template repositories available on GitHub right there's two main ways to use roll that e sign up with worldcoin and Anonymous actions sign in with worldcoin your identity is specific to the context of that app and they can know that you're a real human without needing to know anything else about you and Anonymous actions are really useful for civil resistance both on and off chain and as well have that proof of personhood so we have twenty thousand dollars worth of prizes 5K to the best overall two and a half thousand dollars each to best governance app most creative best AI use case best sign-in with worldcoin app I made a slight typo here we have two one thousand dollar honorable mentions and then a three thousand dollar prize School split among all of the submissions that Implement World ID correctly we have Early Access to our SDK for hackers you can also get access to this at our booth because right now we're still in beta and there's still a wait list for the SDK so you're getting a nice little reward for being here at the hackathon and you can continue to use this after the hackathon as well uh I'll leave that up for a little bit longer because I still see phones all right and then this link gets you access to a bunch of different resources our documentation our developer portal those template repositories I mentioned information on our bounties and how to contact us if you have any questions thank you amazing thank you all right next up I want to bring on Dosh to talk about no says Shane please give Dosh a big round of applause there we go all right hope you all can hear me ladies and gentlemen it's an honor to stand before you today and talk about a blockchain that is reshaping the frontier of decentralized applications gnosis chain imagine a world where transaction fees are no longer a barrier to entry where developers can build projects launch applications and design protocols without the fear of prohibitive costs or censorship that's the world that knows chain is helping to create a world that Champions decentralization credible neutrality and resilient Networks but gnosis is more than just a technology it's a community of pioneers explorers and innovators people like you who see beyond the present and into the possibilities of what it could be your creativity your vision and your dedication are what truly drive this revolution in our hands noses chain isn't just a tool it's an opportunity an opportunity to shape the future to redefine the boundaries of innovation and to create a world where the power of blockchain is accessible to all and today we have twenty thousand dollars in prizing for building on this chain the tracks for a hackathon include the best AI project Hashi the new standard for Native Bridges and safe everyone's favorite multi-sig as we venture into this exciting New Era remember our strength lies in our Unity our innovation in our diversity and our future in the apps we build today let's seize this opportunity let's shape the future see you on chain thank you thanks sash inspiring words all right those were two of our amazing partners and when we looked at all the information about who's coming here and what they're excited about we realize that there's a lot of you who are just getting into the space and wanted to understand what could be possible so to make sense all of that we decided to do a really interesting talk we're going to spend is I'm going to invite metallic here on stage to tell you about what are the possible ideas that you can think of not just yeah there you go we're going to focus the next 30 minutes on things that you should think about building in the space where we see there's a lot of progress that could be made a lot of things that could be made better and things that are just not getting the attention that we'd like to get and all of that should help you get some ideas for your hackathon projects and hopefully even other bigger projects that can turn into more than just side projects so without further Ado please welcome vitalik on stage okay braids hello everyone so today's um I wanted to um give um a talk about some things that I've you know talked about in the various contexts over the last year or so but basically the focus is on like what kinds of things really does it make sense to start working on right now and you know what kinds of things are actually really accessible to people that are like just getting into the space right now um so then the big picture to me is that ethereum is two decades basically the last 10 years are solving problems in theory right so a lot of discussion around switching for proof of work to proof of stake a lot of discussion around uh improving scalability a lot of discussion around look solving privacy problems around you know improving security various other things um but you know it was still fairly theoretical the number of people actually using middle of the blockchain is fairly small for most of this period but then the next decade is uh needs to be a much more of a focus on you know it's solving like very concrete problems that people in the real world have so there are many of you very many users of uh you know ethereum crypto all of these things already today right um but I think the way that it looks to be is that in many places very few people have found a use for ethereum or other blockchains aside from Trading digital monkeys in many places very many people have found uses for it but they're largely using centralized exchanges um so um just uh telling a story uh this is this picture um minus the anonymous masks to protect other people's privacy is from my trip to Argentina back in 2021 and I remember visiting and I remember just seeing the really huge ethereum Community you know crypto Community more General developer Community um just the sheer number of people using yeast in all kinds of cryptocurrencies to save money uh because which is actually a really big need for them because of the currency situation in the country and even people just accepting it for payments right like I just randomly walked into a coffee shop and it just happens the guy just happens to you know know a lot of things about cryptocurrency he happens to have a binance wallet and I asked like hey can we pay with Ethan he said sure um so what huge amounts of adoption but there's a catch and the catch is that even though there's a huge amount of crypto adoption a lot of it is like actually Finance wallet adoption right so basically yeah there are lots of people who are using no posts ethereum and other crypto things they're actually using it through a centralized intermediary now why are they doing this right so sexualized exchanges are cheap meaning if you want to adjust uh you know send someone money inside one of these a centralized system you have zero fees it's convenient um in particular payments are instant binance to minus transfers instant um when I paid Elders in ethereum wallet um it the transaction took I think something like two to five minutes to confirm um and no this is actually something where we have made some improvements right so who here has a used ethereum before 2001 me um core here is used ethereum in the last six months um possibly has noticed how like the it has become somehow much easier to get transactions reliably confirmed quickly this has happened because of two protocol changes one of them is something called eip1559 which is this uh very kind of weird economic technocratic thing that has a lot of interesting math behind it um but the basic thing that it does is it changes the fee market so that instead of requiring a fixed amount of transactions at every block I mean the blocks are allowed to be like bigger and smaller and to kind of adjusted to be very short-term changes in demand right and instead of keeping a constant block size the protocol keeps a at a constant transaction fee or What's called the base T within a block and that adjusts um over time right so because of this instead of a transaction taking some random amount of time that's after minutes a transaction can be encoded in you know about one or two blocks and then what the merge did is as a weird byproduct of statistics and the difference between personal distributions getting a block every 12 seconds it turns out that the average amount of time you have to wait until your transaction which gets included into a block is divided by divided by two it's only half as much so if everyone here is in math uh proof assignments prove it uh due date 72 hours from now go um but the point so look ethereum has made a lot of strides on this question already actually but when I was in um Argentina at the time EMP with the Boris had not yet happened ep-159 had happened but the wallet I was using did not yet support it and now that while it actually does support it right so the choice exchanges are cheap convenience protect the user from mistakes um you know if you screw up you can go to talk to the aircraft store service maybe kyc again and say you'll get your money back with ethereum wallets that's something that at least with the status quo you're not really able to do you know you have your 12 word seed phrase and if you lose your 12 word seed phrase you're screwed if someone else takes a photo of your tall word seed phrase congrats they have all your money right so centralized exchanges don't really have these issues now there's a darker side to centralize exchanges right um quickly recognizes some of the people with this photo yes right so centralized exchanges are you know also sometimes you know not very uh trustworthy uh so they you know do stuff and uh sometimes they decide that they're better at having fun with your money than you are thank you [Applause] okay so how do basically hm you know there's a where C that says it can be um you know a space that is all about decentralization what is decentralization it is we are Building Systems where you cannot be Rock fault right now there's many kinds of uh of of being a rock fault there is you know having all um all of your money is stolen from you there is being walked out of a PayPal accounts and and them holding your money for 180 days with no recourse there is being locked out of a social media platform without no recourse you know there's all kinds of rug pulling that um that happens right and you know in a desert centralized system you're supposed to have you know programmatic rules that are transparent that and have described the process as under which I mean like things happen in whatever application you're participating in right and it's a nice stream and it's a good and you know it's uh good to try to put more control and power back in the hands of you know users and communities as opposed to these I know far away centralized actors but there are challenges right so I've got I I think some of these challenges are kind of you know the fundamental philosophical challenges but some of these challenges I think people don't appreciate the extents to which they are technical problems so it can be technically solved they just haven't been properly technically solved yet right so one is scalability and fees right so when I get paid um at the that coffee shop in Buenos Aires the transaction fee was like something around three or four dollars right if it was a binance to finance transfer it would be zero dollars now back in 2013 I remember there was this movement um that was really trying hard to get people to accept Bitcoin as a consumer Merchants payment mechanism you know just for people to like pay for pay in restaurants pay at coffee shops in Berlin there was even this District at kreuzberg where people made this movements to convince a huge amount of restaurants in one region a two start accepting Bitcoin this was called the Bitcoin Keats I actually let's do a couple of uh of these places back in the day there was a a burger place there was this nice vegan restaurant there were a couple other ones and there was this like really lovely movement but then that died down over time why did it die down basically it's just transaction fees right back in 2013 the main pitch for why you're supposed to accept Bitcoin instead of accepting credit cards is like well minimum a credit cards charge what 2.9 percent on every transaction right actually PayPal charges 2.9 percent on every transaction for international payments PayPal actually charges 2.9 plus 3.9 percent plus more on uh no foreign exchange fees it might have changed it might have changed since then I actually don't know rainbow this was like be pitch back then and it was true back then and the problem is that like well you know the whole fees being low staying basically stops being true right um so that's a deal breaker right like lots of applications that are totally fine and that make a huge amount of sense if the transaction fee is negligible stop being true if the transaction fee is 8.43 um or here is interested in uh using alternative sweater sweaters or here would be interested in using alternatives to Twitter ifs registering your accounts on that alternative costs 8.43 um 69.12 um it's 384.41 cents okay so you know we got some True Believers which is good right but you know the points is that like these are kind of a boring topic but they will are like they are eight killer of things that otherwise would be extremely promising and I think the corollary of that which is really powerful is that people should not assume a category of applications has failed just because it has failed in an environment where setting everything anything up costs eight dollars and 31 cents uh problem number three um privacy um recruit here just allows the idea of broadcasting to all their friends and future friends and family and and the government's answer every company um what exactly who they're making what kinds of payments do okay we got some True Believers which is good but you know privacy is valuable right so the other challenge just kind of making all of these happen while keeping ethereum recognizable ethereum right so what I mean by this is that there's lots of different groups in ethereum that are building lots of different stuff and that's good that's beautiful we have an open ecosystem it's you know we have lots of groups operating independently and it's possible for new people to come in and start building independently without asking for permission without you know you don't have to apply for an API achieved um but um one of the challenges is that there's you know there is the possibility that like things end up branching off into totally separate systems that don't really yet kind of intersect with each other and that look very different and that have very different properties from what already exists right so good scaling is being able to do what you do now on but paying uh 10 or 100 times lower transaction fees bad scaling is when you know you have some totally new thing and people tell you tada this is ethereum this scales but it just looks like a totally different thing and if your friends turn out to have used a different way of scaling ethereum because you're not compatible with him and there's no way to like move between these things and it's like not clear what the properties of these these things are and it just turns into a massive confusion right so there's also a challenge here which is like more like a coordination challenge right which is that like actually yeah you know making sure that all of these uh different pieces the scalability pieces the account security pieces the Privacy pieces actually work together with each other right and this is difficult right but this is um something that I think we can start moving towards so one concrete example what's who here wants to build a wallet what would serve fund you know um so in the previous decade of ethereum it was enough for a wallet to just support sending people is um you know pause showing your QR codes so other people could send you eat it and you know possibly yeah you know logging into a a Mini web browser so you could go access some depths right in the future this is not going to be enough for a wallet right a wallet that make actually makes sense in a post-scalability world is a wallet that needs to support the ethereum lawyer one and also at least all of the major layer 2 protocols that are being built on top of ethereum crossover 2 transfers need to be built in if I have all of my money on optimism and you have an account that's uh uh or you want your money on arbitrum then like I should be able to click Send and that should automatically route my money through some kind of you know cross layer 2 exchange protocol so so that it gets to you good and like this is something that should happen automatically this is something that like you should not have to go and you know personally fumble yourself and like figure out what hopdod exchange is and how to use it it should all be middle behavior that just happens as part of the send button a way for recipients to express how he wants to get paid this is another thing right it seem it's the looking like Azure SS are not going to be at us right an address we know just 20 bytes but 20 but but you know your address where right or if you want to be paid on optimism do you want to be paid on oligon or maybe you're happy being paid on uh you know aziki sick and Kakarot and polygon but someone else has coins on Kakarot and scroll and arbitrum and you know it turns out the polygon is the intersection and then you just make a direct transfer there right like this is the sort of stuff that you just need to do right and this is the sort of stuff that what tradfy does under the uh a lot under the hood right like who he has used the credit card reader internationally right like there's a lot of DC like under the Holy Cross exchange protocols going live and you know realistically cross lawyer to ethereum has to do the same sort of stuff right now the nice thing about this kind of project is that you don't have to invent your own cryptography to do it right you don't have to like build your own fake thing from scratch all you have to do is just like hook together a couple of protocols that already exist right you just have to you know hook together existing tools for accessing Optimus of existing tools for accessing you know a CK sick and you you want to um you know okay in hop protocol possibly a couple of other routing protocols have the possibility of adding more route more routing protocols in the future and you know like have a sent button that kind of puts a bunch of actually yeah we know routes thanks correctly possibly create your own um you know format for how to provide the information of where you want to get paid and then if people like it then you go with that you know two months later you might end up making your own ERC so you know it's uh like actually I think within a range for a yeah for for a hackathon team I believe this is a like this type of stuff is the sort of thing that I think will do more of another while a challenge um social recovery and multi-sig so if you just actually if you just go to my blog vitalworks.ca and if you just like control F for social recovery you can find like this is incredibly long post I wrote on the topic but basically the kind of Subway of this idea is that an existing ways of doing wallets are just incredibly insecure right so you know most wallets are what's called eoas externally owned accounts there are accounts that are controlled by a private key right the reason they're called externally owned is because other types of accounts are controlled by a piece of code which is part of ethereum right so the problem with the OAS is they're controlled by a single key and if you lose that key you're screwed if someone else steals that key you're screwed if you make multiple backups of your key to reduce the chance that you're going to lose the key that increases the chance to someone's get a steer right so you know it's actually like it's actually not a very good design for a serious number or like a number of people right I mean honestly it's starting with sufficient for me right like I keep my body in diab you know multi-6 so what is a multi-sig it's a wallet where there's multiple keys and you need some portion of the keys to move the body um social recovery is a kind of a closely related concept basically you have a wallet that has one key but there is a set of backup keys that are going to be owned by other people and that set of backup keys has the ability to change the main key if you lose it right so social recovery protects only for us not ideal staffed multi-safe Cricket for attacks against the loss and theft the advantage of social recovery is just because they only need one um key it's a signed transactions normally it's easier right so social recovery is good for like a hot wallet um and uh multisig is good for like a cold wallet right like multisig is great for you know storing your life savings for example but you don't want to store your life savings in something where you know the stuff that's needed to to just drain all of your money away sits on one device right so making a wallet that's like actually good at supporting this and then privacy so privacy is also an important Challenge and uh don't want to get into this it's detail but there's a lot of like really fast privacy technology that's uh really that's really worth worrying so identity right so Eads on Layer Two was happening right um so yeah that's we're here has a DOT yay so it's like uh you know a big part of the the emerging ethereum identity layer right if you want to have a name and you want that name to be decentralized and so it really because you invite you and if not so to be dependent on some other entity then you know ens decentralized system on top of ethereum it is the way to do it now one of the problems was he had asked is that it's expensive right now there is the registration fees or easy eight dollars a month and that's about as large as you know regular DNS is but there is also transaction fees right so the last time I did sub-operate an operation uh to adjust uh do something with my ens I think the last thing I did was that when I published a new blog post and because my blog is appeared to itfs I am you know use it I need to like actually update the itfs record inside of the contract on ens which contains the ibfs hash and that's a transaction and I think that cost me about eight dollars right so now what if transaction fees go up play a factor of 10 so like what they were last year or two years ago right then that transaction fee of eight dollars is going to be a transaction fee of 80 right so ensem layer 1 is expensive and may get more expensive ens on layer 2 is the solution right we want people we're doing Layer Two is where it's users are scaling but we want ethereum to like what we want applications that people actually use to actually benefit from the scaling right and there's like lots of hidden assumptions throughout the ethereum ecosystem that kind of assume that you're only your one and if we want people to actually benefit from way or two scaling then we kind of really need to start breaking down those assumptions and we need to start looking at the important applications and basically seeing you know what how do we make the Warrior 2 fredly so this is a screenshot from something called on opsynames.xyz and this is Builds on a protocol called ccid what this does is basically you have a smart contract on layer one which owns the domain ecc.in and then that contract has a logistics that is paid based on the ccit protocol that basically says if you have a subduid of ecc.es and you're looking for that sub domain then you can go to this other phase so you can basically check what that subdomain actually is on the optimism without right so instead of doing everything on the layer 1 sub domains of ecc.it all get managed updated created destroyed on optimism and so if you were to have your domain.hc.e updating any records only requires being on optimal sum it does not require any layer 1 transaction and so from a gas D perspective everything is vastly cheaper now this is the Optimus one I uh I have asked a couple of other layer of twos if they have equivalents and like a couple of weeks ago the answer from the one or two that I asked was not yet but I imagine they will very soon and very possible some others already do which is great right but like this is one example I think of something that is good and that we need more of which is the ecosystem like really actually adapting to layer 2 scaling and making sure the layer 2 scaling actually translates into real benefits for users which is great now other things in ethereum identity right so this is an application called zoo pass um basically yeah you know it was uh developed at 0 which was the sort of experiment in the spring in Montenegro which I mean I would try to basically create a kind of pop-up so there's a mini City that combines you know ethereum and you know zero knowledge techno attack and and a couple of other themes um but one of the really interesting things was that of you know this year in knowledge aspects right so this QR code contains azkart it contains a0 knowledge proof right and that's what that zero knowledge proof says is it proves that I am one of the residents uh with the uh of uh obviously without revealing which one I am right so this is the in-person uh use case right um and that the inverse of use cases basically you have this thing on your phone and because he has a thing on your phone then uh you basically you could go and you can show it or like you could use this things like this as you know proof that you have the right to enter someplace and uh without actually yeah you know review revealing your identity and every time and like and letting yourself be tracked everywhere um it's uh the sort of thing that like really ties into kind of a lot of e-government stuff except it allows you to do it without you know compromising privacy which is uh unfortunately the default that a lot of these schemes end up running into um again there's also an online component right there is applications like Zoo full uh for example which were basically you log in with Zupas and so always there's a little more residents were able to log in and you're able to get one account so you or is you're able to make one vote right it's a polling system anyway to start a full any weighted vote on a poll you're able to make one vote without revealing who you are but at the same time proving that you are illegitimate folder and that you can't make more than one vote right so it's a privacy preserving voting system that is anonymous but at the same time it ensures that the Kremlin can't go and vote 58 200 times so this is um like basically I think there is like a big story here which is that with cryptography we actually do you know have the ability of giving people very high levels of privacy and and anonymity but at the same time you know for basic actually achieving the uh a lot of these you know security gains that you know the sort of pure uh try to achieve you know anonymity by doing no verification at all it's not is not able to achieve right so we can get like more privacy and more security at the same time and this is also a kind of we're like part of you know the growing ethereum identity stack um other adestation protocols this is the ethereum attestation service EAS so you can also make off-chain attestations about things and these are real like systems that are increasingly talking to each other right so we have these tools right we have names and names that are becoming cheap we have a growing list of really fascinating ZK tools and growing usability for those CK tools we have auction at the stations we have launching at the stations what can we do with all of this one example is uh you can use this technology and decentralized social media platforms right so lots of people want to use the Twitter alternative who here wants to make a Twitter alternative okay no that's good it's actually better not to have too many hands because we don't want to have like you know too many Twitter Alternatives where each one only has like you know 50 people on it and uh you know at some points people just get bored and go back to Elon land um but them you know forecaster exists so lens exist a couple of others exist too and you can like some of these are starting to you know like integrate more and more of these ethereum features right so with wireless I mean we can use your existing ens name forecaster I think is going in the direction of ensens and integration with ccip um and then the other thing you can do is instead of trying to copy Twitter you can try to do some totally new thing designed for new use cases right so one of the concerns that I have with kind of this old Twitter ID approach that everyone is taking is that like it's standard startup advice that if he wants to take make something that like really takes over from an incumbent you can't make something that's 1.1 x better you have to make something that's 10x better you have to like you can't just like appeal to you know sort of you know Niche ideological appeals you have to like create a whole new category of activity right like Facebook did not kill Myspace by copying Myspace um you know Twitter is a not copy Reddit and uh if we want if we think about like what is the biggest you know new social media thing that actually has taken over very recently well I mean realistically it might be Tick Tock right so that's like Tick Tock is not just a different way to put it to yell to a genetic here and so one other way to think about the social media problem is why okay let's create something that's web3 native that is decentralized that is that you know has these kind of open and transparent rules that are executed within the software but that is designed for some other use case one interesting Theory natural use case is kind of discussion and governance within communities right so existing CEOs are a good potential user of this and possibly even new communities that wants to kind of turn into middle communities that use or use various web3 tools to organize themselves could also be a nice use case um so why um alternatives to opaque centralized mechanisms for some aspects of moderation right so anti-spam proving that you're assuming and not a bot lots of ethereum based reputation stuff that can be used for this already like just having an existing address on chain requires you to have paid a transaction like that's a significant degree of anti-spam already right like okay if you look it so there's this website called buyax.com right it's probably worth just like making a transparents B what b u y accs.com you can go and just like buy Google accounts Twitter accounts and like all kinds of things right and they accept Bitcoin and ease for payments so you know it's uh all great right and the average cost of an accounts on these is like somewhere around six or seven dollars right so like this is what the spammers are paying right and I mean this realistically the spammers have like far better tools than any than this right um so if you're doing like having a new account on ethereum that is paid turns out should feel like right now that's like already you know like better anti-spam than what social media networks or as good against spam as what social media networks are providing right and then on top of that you can look at like do people have you know posts do people have approved some kind of proof of humanity stamp um you know if you want to integrate World coin you know have people scan their eyes like you know I mean my guess my opinion for that is like that should not be mandatory but you know an option why not um if people want to you know you could use some kind of function over all of the different identity things that people have you can use EAS attestations um with zoo pass you're able to make zero knowledge proofs that prove things about um what based what are called stamps which is kind of a pope or kind of an attestation system that exists within this within the zoo pass system like you can prove things you can prove some function over the stamp some what stamps you have um without revealing everything about yourselves right so there's like a lot of alternatives for like emc's fam that you can combine together that are like Theory what free native even today reputation like helping users identify you know which accounts are worth listening to and Witcher talents are not serious um you also just another benefit you know the user owning their identity and identity being portable and the connections you make within the system being something that's easily portable if you want to switch to another application better tools to protect against that actors while preserving privacy I wrote this um host on privacy preserving applications on xenius and arts about a year ago and one of the really fun ideas you have here is you could have a message board which is anonymous but at the same time enforces a rule that says that each user basically has a limited amount of reputation and if some moderation system which could be anything could be centralized could be decentralized could be down votes could be whatever uh maybe flakes some particular post then you know you lose one point and your accounts can only survive for us for as long as you still have points right so like you don't have to choose between being um you know a totally transparent and being four shot you can like literally explore every single point along the Spectrum right so a lot of like these very powerful new possibilities become available because of zero knowledge proofs and like eyes yeah you know highly encourage people to try to look at and explore these kinds of things DARS so well in deal governance is like a really hard problem right like we've had lots of daos but one of the challenges that I see it is uh there's like a lack of originality in terms of like you know thinking about what makes a Dao right like a lot of people have this mentality that like all you do is you create a thing you issue a token you give your friends some of the token they can start selling the Silicon around and then if you have tokens you can vote right and there's like a lot of people who think that this is a Dao right and I have to admit that like I that is totally not what I had in mind when I started thinking about the concepts back in 2013 right so zaos decentralized autonomous organizations like basically you know organizations that have like ways of ways of organizing people and communities that involve oh and you know using some kind you know blockchain and smart contract based technology right you know there's like a lot of really powerful things that you can do there but like he really wants to go beyond using coin voting because coin voting is broken in all kinds of ways now first advice of doing Dow governance is like governancy is hard and if you can avoid it then you should probably avoid it so creating Singletons right is hard and it invites political problems as soon as you create a Singleton like as soon as you create a single thing that is logically centralized like even if it's architecturally and politically decentralized if it's like a logically centralized single thing that act that looks like an actor then that invites political problems people are going to have expectations about how it's going to act fairly people are going to um you know have complaints about like was the thing set up fairly was it was this community pre-mined still like favor some group of people that I'm not part of right so creating Singleton's is hard invites political problems if he can go without a single set at all then that's a good idea but sometimes having a single sin is unavoidable right and so try to move Beyond uh token based governance as I've already mentioned token based governance just has all kinds of vulnerabilities all kinds of uh just problems in how it ends up actually working in practice um one I think question you should ask is uh are you decentralizing for robustness or are you decentralizing for efficiency right are you are you defending against internal threats are you defending against external threats and trying to solve for censorship resistance are you trying to decentralize because you want a mechanism that helps more people uh provide input into the decision and by doing that create decisions that are better for everyone are you trying to make a decentralized system because you see that that will be more efficient in some way or decentralization for interoperability right this is a third category you make a decentralized thing so that it can interface better with other decentralized things right if you're making a decentralized protocol you don't want to build it on top of centralized apis therefore if you want to serve other decentralized applications often you have to be decentralized too right so I think it's like always good to look at like which of these reasons for these four decentralizing things you're going for and depending on which one of these you're going for like the kind of governance that you're going to have is often going to look very different right so this is also something that's worth thinking about experimenting with new mechanisms right so quadratic funding is this interesting thing that Glenn Weil and I mostly I mean it was some involvement from me it came up with back in 2018 it was really nice um it's this uh kind of sort of democratic sort of market-based way of funding public goods the idea basically is that you have some Central Pool of funding and it serves as a matching fund and if and it allows other people in the community to donate to projects and the Central Pool of funding matches projects that get donations from other people now the matching Works in this interesting way where basically it uses this clever form we want to compute the matching where the Practical effects are that smaller contributions get a bigger matching ratios and bigger contributions and everyone's matching ratio is greater if a larger number of distinct people contribute to a project right so things that are actually public goods to a wide group of people get a larger matching ratio than things that only benefit a few people um so this is like a really nice idea and there are like various decentralized mechanisms that are actually building on top of this um or using this as their mechanism there is a CLR fund which it uses a zero knowledge proofs to implement this in a privacy preserving way so a lot of really nice nice things happening also retroactive funding so retroactive funding is this idea that like instead of giving grants to people because you think that they are promising and they will do good work you give great you give prizes to people after they've done good work and the idea is that um retroactive funding is uh easier to implement because it's easier to understand what already was good than to under than to try to agree on what will be good in the future and the general idea of this is that if you have a retroactive funding mechanism then you can combine that with an investment ecosystem right like you can basically you know have people actually you know give investments into projects and they too can get rewarded if a project ends up really succeeding against some and gets a very large retroactive payout right or you could have independent developers where if there are multiple different retroactive funding systems in the uh in the ecosystem then they can start working on projects and they know that if they succeed enough then they are going to get uh get some offer of reward so a lot of interesting stuff happening with retroactive funding optimism has done two rounds of uh retroactive funding so far um and they've done like these very big rounds like the last one I gave out I think about 20 million dollars and it just like gave funding to a whole bunch of projects that did really good and valuable things to the ecosystem like I think I believe even some amounts of uh funding ended up going to the people who created the ketchak hash function and like it ended up being a pretty substantial Grant right so a lot of like really good experiments happening with that too right so this is kind of this other side of really interesting stuff that you could do with crypto right like you can create these mechanisms to try to you know solve problems that have to do with like things that are actually good you know not like not being rewarded enough and not being able to compete with you know big exchanges offering people you know like two and a half million dollars so a lot of like really uh a lot of really amazing opportunities here too right so so I guess inclusions right there's lots of valuable stuff happening on ethereum both on the application layer and on infrastructure um there's some of the big themes cross Layer Two privacy continued work on mechanism design identity ZK things are also much more concrete than they were five years ago right like five years ago there was a lot of like more abstract discussion of like oh this will solve Financial inclusion this will solve Supply chains this will solve fraud and I think the discourse has advanced a lot that is much more like specific applications where like you can't just go you know it's saying random words around and like oh this will make the Asia you know the medical vaccine ecosystem more trusted because we put QR codes on things and like you know you know you have to like actually think and like have things that make sense in the real world and not just like you know the gbt4 world or whatever right um another I think thing is that this is an era where it's probably easier to come in and help and participate than it was five years ago and the reason is precisely the fact that there is more of this focus on concrete stuff that's closer to the user basically that a lot of the deep Tech has been solved right or it exists and is being constantly improved the problems that I talked about today they're not really problems that involve building deep Tech they're problems that involve taking existing technology and just applying it in the right way putting it together in the right way and like packaging it any way that actually yet makes sense to users right and this is the sort of stuff that the ecosystem you know really needs right now and so you know if people wants to work on any of this then you know I'd be Asia very you know happy to see the results so thank you give the microphone amazing well hope you enjoyed that giant brain dump of ideas you can work on and uh there's a lot of people that actually already talked about doing some of these projects as you were filling out and signing up for the sakathon so you can get a lot more feedback here from our mentors
