okay everybody good afternoon good morning good evening and uh welcome to another Ethan line Summit um so today we're very excited to do a summit on the impact that ethereum is having on our world and different aspects of of what a theory has been able to achieve over the last few years I'm your host for today my name is Jacob I'm part of the youth Global team and yeah really excited to be here with all of you today so as I mentioned today's Summit is called the impact of ethereum we're going to dive deep into a bunch of different topics from even the climate to public goods to the future of work privacy all kinds of different aspects that ethereum has started kind of impacting as we kind of explore more of this kind of infinite Garden that we're building in together so really excited to have everybody joining us here on youth global.tv feel free to log in and take part in the conversation there if you have any questions for any of our speakers as well as the day goes on drop them there as well I'll be keeping track and I'm happy to kind of spend a little bit of time at the end of each talk to kind of surface those questions to our speakers so yeah welcome everybody for being here I want to go over the schedule real quick um so we're kicking off right now with the sky with a talk by Scott Moore um which I'm really excited about on ethereum as a public good uh after that we're going to have Bruno from the Aztec team uh joining us uh to chat about ethereum in the Privacy landscape um we're going to have Ben West also from get coin chatting at 2 30 p.m on beyond the merge blockchain enabled climate Solutions which I'm really excited about um in the later this afternoon uh we have Tina from the station team and coming to talk about the future of work um and that being on ethereum we have Wayne Chang from the spruce uh Spruce IDE sign in with ethereum Team I was going to be chatting about ethereum's identity layer um and then last but not least we're really excited to have uh Camila Russo from the defiant I'm here to chat about how ethereum is having impacts on creators and especially to chat about the new movie that she's working on um so that's what our schedule looks like for today and without further Ado I think we'll just jump right into it um and welcome Scott Moore onto the on the stage um Scott for free to unmute and share your video um and yeah really excited to hear a little bit more about how ethereum has been kind of building itself into a public good um and uh yeah just all the kind of crazy solar Punk crypto um outcomes of that so Scott when you're ready feel free to uh share your video and I'll get the screenshot out of here there you are hey Scott how's it going hey going well um can you see the screen here does this look okay yeah everything's great and I love the awesome so I'll get out of the way and uh look excited for your chat thanks yeah um we appreciate you having me on um I I actually have given in like a kind of similar version of this talk and I kind of yielded into this uh a little bit but I think the real kind of interesting thing that occurred to me to like kind of talk about in the last few months was you know we do have this whole conversation going on about like solar Punk and other X punks and I think there's something interesting to be said just about kind of abstracting away from that and just talking about ethereum itself as a public good and so what I wanted to do with this talk is give a bit of context on like what is this sort of like uh like Plato's Cave that we're in around like these different narratives around you know solar Punk and so forth how do we you know kind of go beyond that towards the core mission that ethereum is driving and then how do we talk about in particular the ways that ethereum is kind of allowing us to reimagine what we mean by public goods uh in the context of the web 3 but also just generally you know in the context of Open Source software um and so to start maybe the easiest thing to do is just to talk about like what are these different kind of narratives that we we've been seeing the space over the last probably six to 12 months and I think a lot of this stands actually from cyberpunk Roots like back from sort of the Neuromancer era in like the 1980s even like a little bit before that which was largely the starting point for cypherpunk which kind of advocates for strong cryptography very like intense privacy preserving Technologies uh John Perry Barlow is probably like one of the most famous members of this movement and really with the cyberpunk manifesto sort of like gave a probably the most compelling and most detailed case for this movement But ultimately what we've sort of landed on is an evolution of that which tries to take sort of the individualist notion of cyberpunk and frame it in more of a collective a collaborative way so the goal of this sort of solar Punk ethos which started back in sort of 2008 was originally really well how do we build environmentalism into our sort of like notion of like uh you know Tech is a Force for good and how do we find more ways to build a sort of open feature where a technology facilitates better Global sort of coordination and in web 3 that just seemed to make a lot of sense as a philosophy where you know everything we're doing is kind of revolving around coordination it's all coordination in some sense and you know creating sustainable convivial kind of like pro-social connection is something especially in the Dow space more recently in the last six months that's become very popular to sort of not just talk about but actually I think take action on so even Beyond Bitcoin which is mostly where I spend my time I've co-founded that back in 2017. um there's lots of projects in the data space that are really focused on trying to have more intentional conversations about you know the values that we're creating in web 3 in ethereum in particular uh and how we're basically trying to create this connection between people and their environments whether that's for sort of digital spaces where sometimes there's a lot of noise and we want to kind of create a sense of peace or actually just the physical environment we're in and how we make sure the technology is uh you know facilitating uh that connection and obviously most recently the merge has been a really big part of that uh conversation so I think those are like kind of two not opposing forces but like juxtaposed like ideas of what the space is trying to achieve and I think there's people on kind of both sides of those and that's what's led to sort of the emergence of lunar prank as a critique of principally the openness of solar panels kind of like optimism of solar Punk uh you know and and it's sort of like failure to really imagine a future in which privacy is front and center especially in the face of like a lot of real risks if you know there is too much openness and transparency which principally is the risk to a lot of more marginalized populations folks that you know we are trying to make a positive impact for and so really you know it kind of emphasizes privacy and Collective action and um you know still giving people individual agency rather than kind of like you know making everyone part of this aggregore that uh you know subsumes everything uh before it and so it kind of advocates for a more realist approach to the sort of like political landscape which really is like you know goes back to full circle the sort of Cypher Punk movement John Perry Barlow's ideas and I think we've kind of gotten to this point where the reason I kind of started with the idea that you know these are really interesting ideas but like maybe not the most useful framing since I think what we've sort of realized is that we're all kind of to some degree although this term is a bit controversial in other circles like techno Optimist I think everyone here believes the technology can have a fundamentally positive impact on the way that we work together in the long run and I think that you know regardless of approach if we can build technology that you know leads to some collective human thriving and we should try and do that and we can do that in a way that kind of I think fulfills each of these like narratives without actually creating any sense of conflict and so I think what's really important for us is to think about then you know why is ethereum part of this techno-optimist movement and how do we think about these sorts of framings as you know kind of like a relevant part of the ethereum ecosystem a relevant part of The Ether and I think kind of the the juxtaposition right now in a lot of broader Tech is between the kind of accelerationist AI sort of like growth at all costs um relatively algorithmic way of thinking about growth and about technology and about techno optimism and I think ethereum fundamentally presents a little bit more of like an agentic like agent-based form of that in which we can think more deeply about the way that you know we push back on existing social structures or political structures as the only means of coordination the way in which we kind of push back on large like companies are you know kind of large kind of capital like based actors for economic coordination and then the way that we sort of can reverse these Trends towards institutional power all these are social things they're you know based on us as agents as people not necessarily algorithmic things and I think that's like what's really kind of fascinating about ethereum and what's really interesting about this sort of particular flavor of techno optimism that we can try and Achieve regardless of the particular implementation details so I think the fundamental part of ethereum being a sort of public good comes back to this sort of technical optimism the notion that you know by building better technology together we can create this kind of future that we want to see and move Beyond this baggage of like previous institutions and I think you know there's actually some really interesting stuff that I'll talk about in a minute about like how that actually reframes some notion of public goods altogether so you know I kind of talked about this but basically we're Skilling coordination that's what we're doing we're doing that in a sort of person by person relationship based way we're trying to figure out ways to coordinate as people at scale even you know regardless of our own sort of like opinions about the world or our own belief systems or even our own uh you know kind of broader uh objectives things we're trying to achieve in the world we can kind of work together in a pluralistic way to achieve what we want to achieve and I think what's interesting about the traditional ways of looking at scaling systems is that you kind of as you build a really massive like dunbar's number kind of talks about this 150 numbers so like scale but really we're talking about systems of like tens of thousands of people probably hundreds of thousands or Millions even when you get to that scale it's very hard for people to relate to each other to feel a sense of solidarity to like build in a values aligned way but it is very possible for us to build systems to allow those relationships to grow large enough uh to grow sort of sort of like story um uh kind of like uh carefully enough that and with enough kind of background technology that we don't lose um the sort of underlying structure of the agreements that we've created together these sort of like shared agreements with each other and I think this is sort of like the fundamental conceit of like the coordination meme is that what we mean by coordination is coming to Shared agreements with each other and kind of a scaled up way and do doing that towards like effectively sometimes very different different ends But ultimately I think finding ways to basically scale coordination is a part of ethereum and kind of to me at the heart of this like um what ethereum has to offer in a techno Optimist uh like context it's you know not going and building kind of like you know uh exponentially increasing AI that kind of like subsumes similar to the sort of your example like everything around it it's about building and whether that's true is a whole conversation in itself but it's about building kind of systems that allow us to work with each other um over time um I think it's very hard to over empathize how hard a problem that is um and I I won't go into like a lot of depth here but I think this is like really the fundamental piece of what we're trying to achieve and why I think you know it's going to be so important for us to kind of like think think carefully about the narratives that we're putting forward and basically um how even across narratives we like are able to build systems that allow us to you know work together um and in that sense it's kind of like you know ethereum this is the other sort of techno Optimist angle this is our alternative to doomers and we we sort of have this pervasive notion and uh a broader Society at web3 I think to some extent maybe in the last few months as well where we think oh like you know everything's gonna fail it's like we're we're doomed to the systems that we've created for ourselves into like the problems we face as people I think that's fundamentally misguided and I think that it kind of um fails to recognize what we've already achieved with sort of the ethereum as a technology in the ways that we've taken Agency energy back over sort of existing institutions uh still other fights to come obviously with for example the Tomato cash situation that emerged and many others and that sort of thing but we can sort of also you know use these coordination tools to fight for those causes and to fight for other causes we believe in we can mentor on Cooperative currencies in order to kind of work within the constraints we have and find Capital needed to fund those efforts and then we can design incentive mechanisms to key people working on those things long term and I think this is very much the heart of coordination all these things is what we sort of mean by coordination at scale but it's also fundamentally what makes this whole Enterprise like techno Optimist and I think it's it's sort of the sense that you know we are together in a sort of Bottoms Up Collective way not top down Collective or Bottoms Up individual way going to take back agency and sort of control over the systems that we have kind of like let run loose in the world and so okay like the whole point of this talk is is Republicans why is it during a public good what do we mean when we talk about public goods what are we actually talking about so a lot of the narratives before are kind of around the idea that we have a we have sort of a um a lot of confusion about what it is that we're trying to achieve at the narrative level um we have a lot of sort of um you know progress we made in terms of like tangible ways to improve coordination techno optimism helps us kind of like promote that as like a very good thing to do in an agentic sort of like person-to-person way and in turn we actually now have these like funding mechanisms and so forth that we can use which I'll get to and leave with Bitcoin try to do this as a core part of our mission um but what are these things that we're actually funding and you know when we're funding things in ethereum and funding this coordination tool why is that the public good so traditionally the notion of public goods comes back to this sort of policy annual sin uh 1954 sort of paper around non-excludability non-rivalry things that are public goods are things that can't be excluded no one can be excluded from them or their non-ravel risks you know one person's access to this good does not restrict another person's access and one of the interesting things about that framing is that it kind of was born out of almost a the sort of idea that these public goods of sorts were sort of um aspirational they were sort of pipe dreams and if they could be funded they could be funded in mostly a top-down Collective fashion by traditional States or state actors and I think the major kind of uh problem with that is being that like it didn't allow us to think big enough about what we actually wanted to achieve and it kind of was partly I think how we ended up with institutions that random mock in ways that we didn't necessarily you know intend them to to do and so you know there's a lot of nuance to the way that we reframe public goods but I think one very simple frame is the things that we want to see in the world are things that produce positive externalities for a broader group than the initial people involved in the process of maintaining that good and the traditional example of this like an electrical Grid in like a city uh Transportation Network they have lots of really interesting kind of positive externalities that we can think about so one in the transportation case property value goes up every time a new subway station is created in say New York City there's lots of people that want to like kind of go towards that and there's now an externality for other people around that specific local area same with Electric electrical grids if you have an electrical grid you have like people that can now be part of the community part of the city and that's very good for everyone the probably less like um local example which we've started to see really emerge in uh conversation in web 3 with learning communities is the notion of like a university and that's sort of where I think things like kernel or things like um emerging sort of like groups like forefronts or at like meta-label and so forth are really starting to explore some interesting territory with the work that they're doing C Club there's a lot of communities like clubs that are basically technically private like technically you can't just go and learn at the University but clear and they cost money to be part of you can't just access it with zero Capital through but like you can actually still produce massive social gains via these institutions and of course that's why you know traditional world like universities are funded by the state funded as Republican in that sense but I think what we're sort of forgetting in this in this way of thinking about um so so right now we've kind of created like you've got like you know electrical grids Transportation universities these are all things that are fundamentally like for most people's conception public goods despite this kind of dissonance around we'll wait to pay for this what are we like how are we really considering that non-exclubal non-riverism you can see how that might create issues in the definition but there's more interesting examples that I think start to create even more confusion for us uh than those and I think open source software is sort of uh like one of these where I think there's certain things like say you know the library that we all use to build web free applications something like like ethersjs and something like unit swap which we I think recoil at the idea of as a public good and I think that's because there's this distinction between the token holder and the broader community and we sort of have this notion that there's an Indian group in an out group and if you're not in the token over the community or suddenly you know at odds with the the rest of the the community or there at odds with you and I think fundamentally this is where the notion of positive externalities becomes very useful um the greater the network grows the more not only only the token holders benefit but anyone who just happens to use in day-to-day interaction the protocol itself also benefits and so in this sense there's a little bit of a difference between the sort of traditional way of thinking about public goods and the way that ethereum kind of redefines those to be about these products of externalities especially in the face of existing fees possible restrictions to to use and especially in the face of like different classes of members um people that are or not spoken holders people that are or are not delegates people that are we're not poor team members and I think this is something that is still fundamentally important for us to wrestle with and explore as we think about what we're building on ethereum and we're thinking about the theory and making impact we need to be thinking about basically you know what is that boundary point that we think is acceptable and I guess my case here today is that we're actually a lot of these things that we are debating about sometimes you know on twitter.com or whatever it might be as being oh they're not really public they're not really you know uh they don't meet this criteria they don't meet this like strict definition I would argue that in many cases those are things that we fundamentally all benefit from in a way that approximates something that we would like to call a public good um even if it's not the traditional way that we Define it and so in that sense you know I think funding more of those things I think building more of those things I think finding ways to help people understand and educate people about more of those things is itself a public good and it is something that actually is fundamentally in line with the sort of a genetic techno-optimist Vision that I think we all want to start to push forward um you know as as sort of ethereums in this in this network and so fundamentally we have a few examples of this that I think we're all sort of familiar with but that I think are are worth looking at that we should be supporting in some form or another um admittedly I may be biased towards some of these I think that you know portable especially private identity like ens something like seismo which which allows for that sort of privacy I think that sort of form of identity is a really cool like an important primitive for us to be able to for example solve support systems ensure that we have some pseudonymous identities that we can all sort of interact with each other through um so that we can kind of move Beyond this amorphous sort of like dark forest and something that's a little bit more um visible while still giving people the option to keep privacy especially when they are at risk of you know serious retaliation from for example State actors I think this is where solar Punk ultimately kind of like in the extreme gets it wrong which is that like yes we want techno optimism but we need tech and optimism in a way that allows for people to consider privacy good and to consider privacy as a fundamental human right and that's like you know I think just a really cool application that obviously ens has done an amazing job with and many others are starting to really explore deeply and I think there's a reason to be like a really important topic before ethereum just because we I think haven't had a sort of portable layer for our own like lives on the internet despite the fact that we use the internet probably more than probably more than once a day I think it'd be very unlikely to find a lot of people who use it exactly once or less than once a day um I think that like there's a lot of these examples and I could go through them for a long time but I also recognize that I have a limited amount of time so I'll kind of just go through these pretty pretty quickly uh for the remainder but basically we've got the centralized storage um the d-web principles are kind of like part of what uh filecoin and ipfs have contributed to in terms of how are we thinking about creating systems that um really prioritize user agency into centralization and so forth in general I just think having potentialized storage kind of fits in with this need um that we're talking about to have fundamentally like uh distributed kind of global coordination systems and I think that like more centralized you get the more you run this risk of basically capture the network in a way that um isn't you know shared with the users shared with the broader community and I think that's one of the reasons this sort of positive externalities framing for public its Works in web 3 much better than it did in previous iterations which is that like for each of the is actually um but especially for like these kind of core identity stories Primitives having the infrastructure that you're building be shared even if not everyone is owning that like a portion of that infrastructure um you know equally as in a co-op for example I think it's very important for the long term uh sort of like sustainability of of web 3 for ethereum and is like kind of the the core you know part of what we're doing here the other two kind of components I think are a little bit higher off the stack but it's basically you know things like optimisms retroactive public goods funding quadratic funding those are ways to help us in a Grassroots way signal and basically fun things that we care about I think this is really important because traditionally again like what is the reason that this sort of like State funding as like the only mechanism for Republicans became so prominent well because it's very easy to kind of like collect and like aggregate value and then kind of put that out into the world in a sustainable way if you're a government but it's very hard to do that at a Grassroots level and especially hard to do it in a way where you feel like your voice is being heard um so having some ability for people to locally sort of signal what they care about and then to be able to aggregate those things into a kind of preference map is really important and I'll get to that a little bit more in a second and then modular government's doing which I think is just very important for any of these structures these staffs these tools that like basically are allowing for kind of the creation of public is on ethereum um this modular tooling is important for that to uh to take shape so basically the thing that I'm focused on uh what day to day is thing like this idea of collective sort of intelligence collective decision making via things like quadratic funding but quadratic funding basically means I think everyone kind of knows at this point it's just that you're trying to essentially fund um a large group of projects in a given area based on local um individual preferences um and then basically philanthropic funds are matched according uh to that preference map and the reason this is important is again in a state case you don't really have the ability to um really have a lot of say there's not really actually despite kind of a lot of academic conversations on this a lot of prior to story budgeting that happens in practice but this is kind of a web free forum of that participatory budgeting where we can actually take the action that we want to see uh in the world and know that it will be listened to by a broader group of philanthropists or folks that are helping to fund the system at large and I think this is a really important kind of like example of what will be a much broader design space around the coordination of funding in in the future and I think that like again there's this really interesting conversation about like to what degree do we kind of rely on my collective intelligence to what degree do we rely on Experts to what degree do we rely on like AI is the ultimate experts it's like this like kind of meta expert and I think there's a real conversation to be had about like how uh you know much should be uh let go of our own sort of like capacity for uh decision making and there's the trade-offs there of course like certainly experts are better for some decisions than others but I think it's really that's like a fundamental question that we're gonna have to Grapple with and I think ethereum is like a really great kind of selling point for having conversations around those tools uh in context so in the end I hope that by creating all these kinds of doubts by creating all these uh sort of like different uh ecosystems that are you know creating their own local impact creating positive externalities in the process we're able to basically create a kind of impact Network and David ehrlichmann has talked a lot about this he wrote a book on it and uh called impact networks I believe and it's very um it's a very interesting idea in the sense that I think there wasn't really you know The Cypher punks have this notion of we're all going to independently build our own tooling work independently and solve for you know we're going to fight the state through our own like kind of a heroic action I think the Solar Products have the notion that we can do this like collectively and work with the state and be kind of like you know a happy family I think the lunar punks are kind of like trying to uh trying to be more realistic about those things but I think regardless of those different narratives the idea that we can actually form impact networks locally together uh with some kind of broader um you know uh and coordination that's achieved again like as a result I think that's that's ultimately where a lot of this um is going where that the benefit of ethereum the impact of ethereum comes in so uh hopefully that kind of got most of the points across here um I think I'm out of time so um all I'll say is ethereum I think is a public good I think the notion of public goods needs to evolve from where it is today um and I think that if we find ways to evolve that definition uh we can coordinate towards a more techno-optimist future so thank you very much thank you Scott that's awesome um maybe a quick question um just just before you go like if anybody wants to start like actively participating in you know being a part of this kind of public goods movement using ethereum like where's a good place for them to start doing that right now I'm definitely biased towards you know get going as a place to do it um I think you know going to the coin Discord and just getting involved um optimism as well is just starting up and they have lots of initial grants I think honestly there's at this point there's no real shortage of places to make an impact I think it's a question just what kind of impact do you want to make find the thing this is like the really everyone gives us advice but like find the thing that you're passionate about right and leverage that passion and find ways to you know basically work with a group that needs that skill set and kind of you know a lot of the original challenges of this with Daz was you kind of tried to do that and I think there wasn't really a good process for onboarding and getting people involved but I think that as people have started to realize hey you need structured leadership endows I think that started to change and so I think that people going to the house now certainly relative to like a year ago we'll have like a better experience kind of like finding the path end finding the way to get involved and I would say like you know any of those organizations I mentioned are really good starting points DNS as well filecoin protocol Labs as well it's doing really good work in this area um feel free to reach out um if you have questions about Works through to get involved in and I'm sure I can find one amazing yeah thank you so much uh really great having you here Scott and uh I mean congratulations also on you know you're chatting about coordination and how hard that is uh all those 40 000 people donating in the last Bitcoin round that just closed yesterday that's like a crazy amount of people so congrats on the success on gay coin round 15. thank you awesome thanks for being here Scott and uh yeah we're gonna kind of shout out to our next uh upcoming talks here so thanks again Scott for ethereum is a public good um Scott also mentioned a lot about how you know privacy is a critical um uh an important part of this whole infrastructure layer so I mean really excited to have Bruno um didn't even mean to have this back to back but I mean it's possibly a perfect uh segue um to have Bruno come here and chat about uh both the work of that Aztec is doing in this domain and and just in general that kind of crypto privacy landscape uh that ethereum has been able to impact over the last couple of years uh so Bruno when you're ready feel free to uh share your video share your audio good to see you um and yeah thanks for having me of course and yeah whenever you're ready happy to uh to turn it over to you yeah let's do it cool can you see that uh yep that looks good cool hey everyone uh my name is Bruno volinski and I'm here to talk about ethereum and the crypto privacy landscape um so real quickly um the agenda I'll run through one is a little bit about me and Aztec the project I work for I'll talk briefly about some of the other privacy Solutions uh being built in crypto today I'll briefly touch on zero knowledge generally and how ethereum makes privacy possible today and I'll also take a second to talk through some of the logical fallacies that um usually come up in conversations about privacy that I think are important to address uh so first about me a lot of what I'm going to be saying today is oversimplified for the sake of brevity of course under his financial advice I encourage everyone to do their own research and I also encourage everyone to reach out if they have any questions I'm always happy to talk offline um so about me I uh run ecosystem Partnerships for Aztec that means I lead the Aztecs grants program we are launching version two of the Aztecs program soon uh if private D5 is something you want to work on or you're really just passionate about privacy and uh wanted to discuss it just reach out and let's find a project for you to be working on in the space um about Aztec Aztec is what I like to call a ZK ZK roll-up um I like to say one of those zks is for scaling ethereum and increasing the throughput of transactions that can settle on ethereum the other ZK is for privacy uh the way it works is that we batch transactions on our rollup we interact with L1 D5 protocols via solidity interfaces what that means um is that there's no need for L1 D5 protocols like uniswap or Ave or curve or Lido or element uh there's no need to redeploy your L1 contracts there's no need to fragment your liquidity across a variety of ecosystems uh you can just users that come onto the Aztec Network can interact with your l1d5 contracts privately um without needing you to fragment your liquidity which is a real benefit uh we expose a software development kit for people to build private dapps on Aztec and we've also built our own consumer front end called zk.money as a working example so today if you go on ZK money you can buy Lido steak teeth you can interact with element Finance you can interact with the L1 V5 protocols you know and love privately via Aztec so I encourage you to go check out ck.money and see what it's all about um in terms of the other privacy Solutions in the space uh I think it's important to highlight uh a non-exhaustive list of them there are so many cool projects being built in the space uh there's so much awesome research and development being done in the space I think uh people sometimes ignore the fact that the cryptographers the researchers The Operators the the people working at Aztec and these companies are pushing forward not only the crypto system but also mathematics cryptography theoretical computer science they're doing really incredible Cutting Edge research across a variety of spaces and uh here's like a a very non-exhaustive list of some of the other projects in the space um but I think it's important to talk through um more than specifics about each of our projects a little bit about like the general features that you see today in crypto privacy projects so big caveat I'm going to caveat the whole presentation again brevity leaving stuff out trying to make it uh quick and dirty all these projects are multi-dimensional a lot of them have different use cases different user bases they are trying to appeal to um different leaders different perspectives uh here are a couple of the features that I tend to see in crypto privacy projects one cryptography being used as a solution for scaling and privacy um many of the Privacy Solutions are building in altel one many are interacting with ethereum L1 directly really it's not only privacy that people are trying to solve but also privacy at the same time is solving uh scaling and throughput of the theory in general uh many of these projects have some form of shielded transactions where users can selectively disclose information they can uh selectively share the information that they choose to share they are private by default but there's some form of shielding or unshielding that is in the user's hands uh all this is secured by Cutting Edge cryptography and Mathematics um there's ecosystems of daps being built on a lot of these private projects for additional user functionality uh like defy payments um there are projects on Aztec building private multi-cigs for Dows um there's really it's it's a lot broader than just privacy with payments there are private payments but there's also private defy and a whole sleuth of various uh privacy focused ecosystems of decentralized applications um and finally a lot of these projects either expose a software development kit and or a in-house built programming language that allows developers to build in programmable privacy uh to the to their decentralized applications um yeah and so really the summary here is these projects are incredibly multi-dimensional but these are some of the features that I tend to see in a lot of these projects uh really quickly I want to talk about the zero knowledge stuff that that underpins these whole systems um people a lot a lot smarter than me are working on the math and cryptography that are underpinning these systems and there is uh a ton of resources and explainers and 101s on the internet for learning more about zero knowledge I'm going to keep it really high level um I do recommend either the zero knowledge podcast or a16z's crypto research series or really there's just an absolute plethora of resources out there to learn more about zero knowledge I encourage you to go do that or to reach out to me and I'm happy to point you in their direction to dive deeper um but for my 101 high level overview the cryptography that underpins these these systems um most of it is via this primitive called a zero knowledge snark snark stands for succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge but really the point of them is that you can prove the validity of some statement without exposing any of the inputs that go to that statement um so I like to give one example which is I want to go out to a bar and there's three main parts of this interaction of me entering a bar one I need to prove that I am 21 plus I can drink alcohol legally in the United States Etc two I don't want to expose my name my birthday my address my picture I really don't want to expose anything about myself except for the fact that I am 21 plus and can enter the bar on the other side there's a security guard whose job or bartender or whatever at the bar whose entire job is verifying that I am of legal drinking age to enter that bar and drink uh this seems kind of like a dumb example trivial like why why would we be optimizing for something like me entering a bar and I understand that but what I'm trying to explain uh via this example is is zero like zero knowledge snarks give us the possibility of me proving that I am 21 plus and can drink legally without exposing any private information for me and that's a good mental model to apply to a variety of different interactions that have been on ethereum today or or may happen in our lives in the future and and um we're working on building out these derivatives so that they can be used uh for you know trivial stuff like going to a bar um I think a mental model that um the speaker performing Scott touched on briefly is there's a there's a dark force of Bad actors out in the Wilds of ethereum um and right now our two options are basically expose information to a centralized intermediary like a trusted centralized intermediary which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the space that we're building um or two just putting your information out in the Wilds for any of these uh these Bad actors in The Dark Forest to come grab abuse take advantage of uh find a way to steal your information or or take advantage of the fact that your information is non-private um by using zero knowledge snarks and some of the other cryptography and advanced mathematics being built in this space we can remove the need to trust a centralized intermediary or not trust anyone at all what we can do is trust math or trust etherea or and Trust ethereum instead um so we can if there's questions on zero knowledge stuff uh we can talk a little bit more about it after but this is like a general framework to think about this as um so how does ethereum itself actually make privacy possible today um these Roll-Ups at least an assets case specifically uh you generate these proofs proofs that I am 21 plus uh without exposing any of my information but you need to post your proof somewhere you need you need a trusted layer uh to post these proofs onto and and the ideal situation is that you can post these proofs somewhere where no single institution can restrict my posting of these fruits uh to anyone without my permission or without any uh intermediaries dictating who can and cannot view the proofs that have been posted and we want these proofs to be there um indefinitely so that you can use those proofs to to reconstruct the state of the of the roll-up the the transactions that you're doing on Aztec um ethereum as the trustless global settlement layer uh that is the place where Roll-Ups can post their proofs today because it uh ethereum satisfies like some of these qualities that that um are desirable for constructing like proof systems so specifically ethereum is censorship resistance uh censorship resistant excuse me you can be confident that the ethereum base layer uh the validators in our proofed stake model or the miners in the proof of work model uh won't censor blocks that contain proofs uh and so that makes it a great place for us to trustlessly uh batch and and post our proofs there's also finality so the ethereum-based layer processes the proofs from these zero knowledge Roll-Ups once those transactions are confirmed and finalized on the ethereum um on the ethereum layer one those those aren't reversible even if you are a malicious roll-up operator and and three is data availability you know posting proofs to ethereum is permission permissionless and you are able to check those permissionlessly which lets you independently verify the state of the Aztec roll up or generally Roll-Ups um I actually saw this like an hour ago yeah from from 12 p.m earlier today is Tim Baker one of the lead coordinators of the incredibly complex and awesome move to to proof of stake uh Tim says that the number one problem he'd love to see uh be someone come up with a solution to on ethereum is private each transfers by default now not to speak for Tim but I think he assumed I think what he's trying to say here is that the base layer ethereum have private youth transfers by default on on L1 um but Aztec is is a stepping stone to this you can do private ease transfers on Aztec via ZK money um today right now if you want to while I'm doing this talk so feel free to go check out ZK money and see how this works uh but just to demonstrate how important it is for uh privacy to be the default on ethereum rather than um like a secondary option that users need to opt into uh when I'm talking about privacy in the space there are a variety of logical fallacies that um come up in these conversations and so I think it's it's really important to to address logical fallacies up front um and and Twitter just 280 characters don't give you enough space to do it so I thought it was valuable to talk through them right now um especially with the sanctions to tornado cash recently by uh the United States ofac um one thing I hear is that every privacy project is just a mixer now on on one end um the complexity of privacy projects today is still very high and so I I understand that not everyone can put in the time to understanding uh the nuances and the differences between our systems but uh hopefully I've been able to demonstrate that you know privacy projects are doing a wide array of different things there's a lot of projects tackling uh privacy differently um a lot of them are building open source tools included open source tools for decentralized programmable privacy um so I think it's a little bit reductive to refer to every privacy project that's just a mixer when there's there's a clear delineation between um like a bunch of our privacy projects generally and it seems like a logical fallacy to bunches uh all into you know one classification uh secondary is um I hear this a lot is is you know the technology is interesting but but Bad actors uh that might abuse technology make adoption or or even research and development in this sector a non-starter uh on day one the reason this is a fallacy is um you know you merely have to look at basically all technological development that's happened over the last four or five decades or really since you know all technological advancement that's ever happened in humanity and you notice how Bad actors potentially abusing a system has never stopped us from developing technology that could be net beneficial to um the world to ethereum to to humanity uh you can imagine artificial intelligence which is a debate that's coming up uh more and more frequently artificial intelligence or Gene editing via crispr or social media a lot of these Technologies um could be abused by Bad actors but but that doesn't make the research and development and um really the community building and commercialization of these softwares it doesn't make them a non-starter it never has and so it's a logical fallacy to to follow that argument as you know because a bad actor can use it that makes adoption a non-starter um frankly I think this is a little bit of a cop-out um Bad actors use our traditional Financial system that actors use basically every software tool that's ever been created uh just because a bad actor may use it does not mean that the technology itself is for Bad actors or built by Bad actors and frankly it's a fallacy that is far too common in in crypto uh specifically but the world generally and I think it's important to face that policy head-on and really you know call people out when they're when they're abusing that um when they're abusing that argument and finally finally the third logical fallacy I see really frequently is you don't need privacy if you have nothing to hide um that that just that statement just doesn't follow right like um you may not need privacy if you you don't need privacy if you have nothing to hide that nothing to hide just just doesn't really relate to your desire for privacy um as my colleague John Wu loves to say if you don't care about privacy like why do you shower with a curtain on um we we all want and value and respect our privacy to differing degrees but to conflate the desire for privacy to criminal activity I.E nothing to hide is is just frankly absurd and unfair to a lot of people that that want privacy for a variety of reasons I mean you could be a political dissident in a country like Ukraine um that that wants privacy for their safety and for their family safety or you might just not want your family members colleagues co-workers to see what you're spending your money on on you on the weekends um and frankly the the argument that you if you have nothing to hide you don't need privacy is is completely a non-sequitur illogical and it should be called out when when it's used so in summary um I believe privacy is a human right and until the last few decades basically not basically all monetary transactions we're private by default cash is private by default and until the last couple of decades we we haven't really um needed privacy in a financial perspective because it hasn't been an issue in the last two or three decades are our technical our technological advancement has been so rapid and so incredible uh that we've let a couple of uh big topics fall to the Wayside number one is like our personal privacy and number two is like our informational privacy our data privacy specifically in the context of social media um and so this is our opportunity to like rebuild these systems um with privacy as the defaults uh second I just want to highlight there's a broad diverse ecosystem of projects that are doing critical critical research and development in a variety of fields outside of ethereum or blockchain specifically uh like mathematics and cryptography and theoretical computer science and a lot of them are just exposing programmable privacy tools for others to build um using our open source software um we at Aztec believe that building privacy Solutions excuse me building privacy Solutions on top of ethereum makes the most sense because of ethereum's credible neutrality excuse me ethereum censorship resistance and ethereum's immutability um and there's a lot of logical fallacies that try to muddy the water around privacy Tech and I think it's important to call them out when you see them and I think um in our space we we may be noticing in the last month month and a half um we need to be United around a cause like privacy we need the entire space to demand privacy to demand the right to determining your own level of comfort around your privacy um and and really pushing for that across the space um on that note I want to leave everyone with with a quote from Phil Zimmerman the creator of pgp the a very widely used encryption software that we all use today whether you know it we're not in email or a variety of other places um Phil said oh sorry about that so throughout the 1990s I figured that if we wanted to resist this unsettling Trend in the government of outlawing cryptography one measure we can apply is to use cryptography as much as we can now while it is still legal when the use of strong cryptography becomes popular it's harder for the government to criminalize it therefore using pgp is good for preserving democracy if privacy is outlawed then only Outlaws can have privacy and I just want to tweak that quote a little bit pgp has been great for preserving democracy but we've got a next wave of privacy solutions that are here um to help preserve democracy and preserve personal freedoms uh so therefore using Aztec and other privacy Solutions out there today is good for preserving democracy if privacy is outlawed only Outlaws will have privacy and I think that's the message I want to I want to leave this on so thank you all for your time I can't even see how much time I've taken so I hope I haven't run late or run short but I'm happy to answer any questions um from the audience from from Jacob uh yeah awesome thanks Bruno and yeah what a great quote to to wrap that up on um yeah I mean we still have a little bit of time so if anybody has any questions feel free to drop them in the chat and I'll relay them uh over to Bruno here but maybe just to like kind of kick off a little bit of a conversation like uh you know we kind of touching on this at the end of your presentation like it does seem that maybe a little bit weirdly like privacy is is very political um in a lot of ways and I think also like you can almost see that like in your presentation when you're saying you're like caveats like you know not Financial like you know you're kind of prepped for this already in a way because I think you've probably been spending so much time in the space like you just from like a developer perspective I can definitely see that as being maybe a bit of a turn off for some people and I'm kind of curious like what your thoughts are about for people who are you know thinking about maybe building in the space or are very curious about kind of privacy like you know what either should they read what should they kind of pull their inspiration for being in the space from like you know really just kind of highlight anything that that comes to mind as uh that you know as being like why this is like an important space to work in even if maybe there's a little bit of a you know political kind of action happening in that space yeah yeah I I think um I think you should everyone should look up the quote that I just ended with if if privacy is outlawed that only Outlaws will have privacy uh Phil Zimmerman's I guess I don't know if he goes by fail Phillip Zimmerman's uh paper on this is phenomenal it's just an incredibly uh concise succinct write-up on on why privacy is important and and he wrote this in the I guess I I don't know the exact date but early 2000s far far before this has been a discussion in recent months and it's it's incredible to see how that uh is applicable today I think a lot of people in crypto or I guess Building Technology in general we we I can't speak for everyone but we may not me for example I've not been old enough to even understand what was happening in the 90s when the discussion about weaponizing encryption tools um was important and I think it's important to get that historical context um I think the argument about crypto in general about uh decentralization about credible neutrality about a global settlement layer outside of one that's maintained by federal governments or um world governments uh as as a unit um it's it's become politicized because everything has become politicized but I think myself Aztec I would imagine all the Privacy Solutions in the space would feel similar um we don't do this because we have a political ideology we believe that it's a human right to have your own privacy and make your own decisions about what you spend your funds on where your money is deployed without um you know exposing that to the the broad not only to your inner circle but to the broad world of Bad actors that are out there and so we're just trying to build Solutions where consumers can make their own choices about what uh where they want to sit on that spectrum of privacy um and so I would encourage everyone to to try and get out of like a political lens when thinking about this and just think about like your fundamental human rights what you believe in what you how you want to live your life and whether whether privacy is a part of that and I I imagine that that almost everyone cares about privacy to some regard and so just think uh think about where you sit on that scale and to try to understand uh your neighbor or someone you don't know when they say that they sit in a separate part of that scale they're not bad people for wanting more privacy that's just their preference of sitting on a different part of the scale so one read Phil Zimmerman's work on this uh two feel free to reach out after and I can send you some more resources and three just try and and view the situation uh non-politically and with empathy and I think we'll understand that everyone here is just trying to advance humanity and and really defend our personal Liberties um as everything gets more digitized and those uh Liberties start to erode um I think that's that's all we're here for is is to fight for personal liberties amazing uh I'll definitely take a look at the Philosopher's post after this um and then I mean you actually brought up like what I was going to ask about as well um I also saw Tim's post earlier today on Twitter about you know sort of like ethereum L1 transfers being um you know private by default um as you mentioned in your talk like this is the case for Aztec right now and um Tim at the end like uh of his statement said you know it could completely change what the end state of the space looks like um I read that and I was like oh like what could that mean and I haven't like had enough time to think about that yet given that you've been thinking about the space and Aztec already has this as an outcome like what do you think like what could be some of those kind of like end State outcomes that he's sort of hinting at here yeah and to clarify uh again I think I think what what Tim is saying that is that uh privacy at the base layer on the L1 protocol um which is not what Aztec is right we're an L2 roll-up um but you have that functionality of being able to interact on L1 privately send transfers privately to uh other addresses on Now One today um what what is the use case that that for me at least the biggest use case for crypto like the end goal end State use case here um is payments right like we use payments uh we don't take we don't get two and a half percent taken away from the credit card cartels out there and we transact trustlessly and permissionlessly privately now if you want to do anything any sort of payment where you may not want everyone to see what you are paying you just can't do that on L1 today right like I am running.if you can just go look at my address and you will be able to see all the things I've paid into and unfortunately like that's that's just the status quo today but um you know payments uh fine I'll go on a short tangent here um Aztec was actually started several years ago um with the premise of bringing corporate debt onto ethereum layer one um that's right yeah but unfortunately that's that's not possible because corporations value their privacy and so if we want to uh enter into these two sectors like payments generally and really widespread adoption in the financial markets whether like defy or just like D5 payments global settlement layer exchanges really anything that you can imagine uh financially crypto being used for like it requires privacy on the parts of everyone outside of the current crypto ecosystem that is like okay with with the public Nature by default so I think like uh if you want to look at it from a market sizing thing uh like Global Payments Market Global Financial Market uh just take like a small percentage of that and and this is the biggest industry uh this is like 10x what crypto is today um and it's impossible without privacy and so I think that's hopefully that answered your question Jacob of like how how important it is this is this how transformational is this how big is it how big is privacy for uh achieving this like end state of ethereum and like Global adoption of ethereum as our Trust settlement layer yeah absolutely no I I think you know that you nailed the you hit the nail on the head there we go um on that one I mean the payments being such a big part of everything we do all all the time and you know really not being able to uh really tap into being a large percentage of that as a as a protocol as an ecosystem if not for privacy right so you know enabling that um you know really absolutely critical so and and just one last note like the the point here I'm sorry I know I'm going a couple minutes over I um you probably could be privately transacting on a theory of L1 today like you could you know open up a fresh wallet you could figure out a way to to basically get privacy but but we don't need that for Global adoption we need completely easy uh adoption of privacy Solutions on ethereum for that to really reach the mainstream right like people are not going to go in and play this wallet roulette of like hiding funds and like that's just not the way that we're going to reach Global adoption so we really need simple consumer uh simple consumer interfaces for adoption of privacy on on L1 ethereum and I think zk.money is like a great step in that direction I encourage everyone to check it out and just like fund a little bit of money into ZK money send a private payment and see like how awesome it is to see that ether scan transaction as like not brony.eath but you know Aztec role of contract no one can see actually who is funding the other side of that so I encourage you all to to go to ZK money and check that out awesome that website says ZK Dot money right CK Dot Money exactly awesome okay great thank you so much for being here Bruno and then for your chat really appreciated it and yeah dovetailed so nicely with uh with with Scott's chat earlier so that was that was just perfect so um thank you so much for your time and uh and for being a part of this with us yeah thanks for having me everyone awesome okay thank you so much again Bruno and we're going to move on to uh our next chat here um which is going to be with Ben west from the Bitcoin team um of course uh this chat's gonna be called beyond the merge blockchain's enabled climate Solutions um I think everybody obviously uh should hopefully know in this chat that you know in the last couple uh I guess the last week actually it's only been a week um you know ethereum has received a massive upgrade uh called the merge uh which is dramatically changed uh it's kind of climate footprint obviously we're all you know really excited about that and I think it Bears repeating um ad nauseum until people really kind of realize how amazingly impactful that moment was for um ethereum as a climate perspective I think Ben's probably going to talk about more of it so I'm not going to jump in all over it but uh yeah without further Ado maybe I'll invite Ben up to the stage here to unmute and and share his uh his camera on his uh his screen and uh yeah welcome to the uh welcome to the stream then thank you very much nice to be here and uh yeah well I'll just turn over to you I mean we have uh I I don't want to talk too much about probably stuff you're already going to talk about so uh but I'm super excited to have you here and excited to learn more about uh what you're going to chat about well thank you sir I uh I definitely will talk about the merge and uh and we'll also talk about uh blockchain enabled climate Solutions um so uh why don't I just go ahead and share my screen so uh beyond the merge uh you know we uh have talked to a fair amount as a community about the significance of this moment I just want to start with this uh graphic from a piece that the economist did about the merge um which had the kind of bizarre title of uh farewell to the Netherlands but you know I think this uh this little chart that they integrated really tells the story of the reduction of energy consumption uh and related greenhouse gas emissions uh from from that moment uh where the merge happened um you know that line going straight down is not something you see very often uh it's pretty significant and the idea of farewell to the Netherlands is basically saying um you know that the amount of energy being consumed by the ethereum blockchain and by all of us using it uh you know has dropped by 99.95 or you know the equivalent of something like the Netherlands uh or Sweden or Chile uh would be another uh sort of comparable example of course there's a range of different estimates about what that energy consumption looks like um but sort of the high end or more most conservative I guess you could call it estimate um somewhere in the neighborhood of uh 40 million tons a year which would be the equivalent of the Netherlands of Chile or Sweden um so you know really significant uh and and I think it's important that we kind of recognize uh the significance of that and I'll talk a little bit more about it in a sec uh but first just for the sake of introducing sort of myself and and kind of how I fit into this conversation um my name is Ben I as you heard I work for git coin I've also been doing a little bit of research on behalf of the ethereum foundation around blockchain enabled climate Solutions so I'm kind of wearing a couple of different hats here but I'm going to focus a lot of the sort of use cases that I'm going to talk about today on projects that have actually come through the get coin climate rounds in the last four rounds and I know uh Scott was here earlier uh talking and probably talked a bit about Bitcoin so I'm not going to spend too much time talking about what Bitcoin is but you know for anybody who isn't familiar you can definitely go check out getcoin.co and you'll find lots of information there for the last four rounds of our quarterly grants rounds we've run a climate Solutions around we've now got over 250 projects in that round which is just mind-boggling we had 26 in the first round we ran it's definitely The Cutting Edge of climate Solutions projects uh you know I've worked in the climate space for over 20 years uh you know mostly in the environmental nonprofit side but I've also done clean energy plans and public consultations at the city and provincial level in Canada um you know it's a space that I think is just really really exciting you know I haven't seen this many people this excited about anything to do with climate Solutions in many years um you know it's become really a testing ground for new ideas and you know actually a place where a lot of uh you know VCS and others kind of go to look at uh you know what has uh the interest in the sort of what harnesses the wisdom of the crowds to really sort of you know show that its value in in this space so uh you know I'll kind of walk you through a variety of different uh sort of use cases and approaches that are enabled by blockchain technology um and you know I think we're at a pretty interesting moment now where a lot of people are going to start paying attention uh to what's possible with blockchain technology who may have you know hesitated or taken a small sort of step back um you know just because of concerns around energy consumption uh as it related to sort of you know using blockchain for climate Solutions you know perhaps uh you know they won't be as concerned now um you know I I also want to just recognize the contribution of our matching fund Partners uh you know it really is our partners who make it possible for Bitcoin Grand strands to be a reality um and you know we've had a lot of different uh really exciting Partners come on board in the last little while um and it's really a mix of you know web 3 uh projects you know many of them graduates of Bitcoin funding you know folks who got their start uh you know inside of uh uh get coin and also you know some increasingly some folks who are kind of a step removed from web3 but are sort of Dipping a toe in the space folks like Kimball musk and uh Schmidt Futures uh Eric Schmitz Foundation uh and others who are starting to get actively involved so really cool to see how uh you know this kind of mixture of Partners from across the web 3 ecosystems as well as uh you know increasingly folks who have an interest in climate Solutions more broadly or in web 3 specifically uh starting to get involved um so you know really the first thing that we end up talking about when we talk about uh you know these use cases is the idea of getting rid of middlemen uh you know putting money directly in the hands of people um when I talk to people that are building on web3 technology uh on blockchains you know it's really this kind of fundamental principle of blockchains that is the first thing that brings people to the table it's this idea of um you know reducing uh the need to sort of pay rent-seeking individuals in the middle of transactions um that just opens the door to a whole world of uh potential Innovation um you know and I would say that that is kind of the first piece and then often you know we end up talking about composability and interoperability uh and I'll talk a little bit more about that later but you know just as a starting point one of the really beautiful things to see happen uh you know has been kind of both on the side of helping when there's problems uh you know and this has been the case for uh you know funding going to folks in Pakistan with the say Pakistan crypto Collective but also you know we've seen it in terms of uh you know things like support for uh folks in the Ukraine and of course millions of dollars has gone directly to you know both the government uh in the Ukraine but also to a lot of different groups on the ground doing good work and just being able to you know put money directly in the hands of people where it's needed um you know is is I would say kind of the the starting point for this conversation kind of beyond the merge um you know now that we've seen this massive reduction in energy consumption and by the way I think it's worth pointing out that the merge is probably the biggest reduction in energy consumption from any industry in the modern uh era of of human history uh you know I really am I I've tried to think of anything comparable uh in terms of sort of the amount of energy reduction uh and had a hard time thinking of another example uh really the closest thing would actually be the actions of countries not the actions of Industries or companies um you know that reduction in annual energy consumption is super significant and you know as ethereum continues to grow um of course that uh you know the emissions would have continued to grow along with it so uh you know it's not only a reduction in in potential energy consumption right now but if we look at that um you know if uh ethereum gets 10x or 100x uh in terms of the amount of use the uh the amount of value that's being derived to you know the associated emissions are not going to go up with it which is uh really uh an admirable thing and I want to just you know for any uh each core devs that are out there listening uh I just want to give my personal thank you for for that contribution it really is significant and historic um you know so both in terms of direct funding to projects where there's a problem that we're trying to solve where we're like looking at climate adaptation but also uh you know on the mitigation side just getting money directly in the hands of people trying to do good things uh like for example this group Iowa Uganda who's been a grantee on the get coin platform uh they've said that you know really without gitcoin it would have been very hard for them to do what they're doing uh it's given them the ability to plant trees install solar panels um you know in schools and health centers uh you know all throughout uh you know the area that they're doing their work um and this is just a couple of examples but you know it's it's kind of the the first use case of what the implications of removing middlemen can look like on the ground um the next use case that I'm going to point to is one that I think is uh you know really exciting actually and probably uh one of the Lesser known and understood and one of the areas where I think there may actually be the most uh opportunity or significant amounts of opportunity so first of all using the composability and interoperability of you know various different uh tools that are built in the sort of defy space has opened up this door to direct financing of solar energy projects or other clean energy projects and I'm just highlighting a couple of them on the screen here uh who are grantees from the get coin grants round uh projects like Village grid uh or zero Labs or make change possible all at different scales and different locations um you know are actually using these D5 protocols uh you know these kind of uh lending platforms borrowing platforms uh you know different forms of uh um you know decentralized financing so that people can directly contribute to funding solar projects on the ground and uh in particular I want to give a shout out to the solar Foundation which is a group that's trying to harness these mechanisms to directly fund uh projects actually for Iowa Uganda as well as for people in Puerto Rico more recently and basically an attempt to try to bring more resilience and the ability to uh you know basically have your own microgrids at the local level uh you know with the help of you know these kind of funding mechanisms and what they're doing also ties into uh the folks at zero Labs who are using renewable energy credits as a way to go about doing this kind of work um you know this is kind of the equivalent of carbon offsets but for renewable energy so you know where you can actually buy uh you know credits for a certain amount of electricity consumption um and I think these are really interesting and sort of Novel approaches to Bringing more liquidity uh directly into these markets and to make these kinds of projects a reality and it's worth pointing out that uh you know that these are investments that can generate a stable return over a period of time uh you know and it's really beautiful to see how that Capital can sort of find a home and more efficiently just actually make these projects a reality on the ground so some really interesting work happening in that regard I also put up this group seven energy which is a company uh in Norway or I should say it's an organization in Norway that's using what I would call a sort of forward-thinking policy to facilitate uh Community energy like they're actually using blockchain technology for decentralized grid management and that's similar to what village grid does as well to basically make it possible for people to buy and sell electricity directly from each other um and you know I think that this is one of those things where the potential for it is exponential but it also has barriers in the so-called meat space um you know so luckily in Norway there's policies that really make it difficult for uh electricity providers the folks that own the uh the grid infrastructure um you know it makes it hard for them to limit the ability of communities to do this so and in some cases where people would like to see things like this happen they run into obstacles with Regulators there are some examples though uh that are are not at the community level even but even just at the individual building level uh in the process of the research I've been doing actually found a company based right here in Toronto where I am in the birthplace of ethereum uh showed it to Toronto uh you know who uh have actually been using uh blockchain technology to facilitate microgrids at the condominium level uh you know so the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles um usually is kind of a one-way process you're pulling electricity off of that uh that charger you're paying a fee um but what is uh being made possible by this company in Toronto is that they're actually making it possible to uh actually sell your electricity back into the condominium complex so uh you know the electricity that you've got stored in your battery you know for most people their automobile isn't being used over 90 of the time um that can now become a backup battery uh and if you imagine that it's scale in a condo complex imagine you know the entire underground parking being filled with vehicles that have electric batteries uh uh in them and I think increasingly in the years ahead we're going to see more and more vehicles uh where that's the case especially as uh you know people are seeing costs rise around the world for uh for gas uh you know it just becomes increasingly an opportunity for you know that uh parking garage to now become basically like a backup battery Bank um and that can be useful in the case of blackouts but it can also really help with uh moments of peak demand in a lot of jurisdictions when you are kind of peak parts of the day people are charged more for electricity because there's such a demand on the gray grid and that can also result in using you know natural gas or coal-fired power plants that may not run all the time but are sort of used as a backup source of electricity now if you can sort of manage that more efficiently and actually draw power from batteries that are within a building not only are you creating a new Revenue stream for those automobile owners but you're also potentially creating uh you know the ability to reduce that sort of additional Demand on the grid itself during those kind of peak moments so yeah I think the financing of clean energy and the facilitating of decentralized grids is a totally fascinating uh and very rich right opportunity for Innovation um you know I see I think in some locations we're seeing kind of the equivalent of what happened in the global South when uh you know people uh just jumped right over landlines and went right to cell phones I think we may see the same thing happen with these micro grids and distributed grids facilitated by blockchain technology where you know we'll actually see Solutions popping up that were financed perhaps by you know uh you know micro loans from a whole bunch of different people on the other side of the world um who are all getting a little bit of return from the money that's being generated by selling that electricity between Neighbors and also opportunities for you know whether it be local farmers or business owners and others uh you know who are renting out their rooftops or their land to facilitate these projects to generate some income uh that they may not have had otherwise so really a win-win scenario and something that just wouldn't be possible in the same sort of way with the same sort of uh transparency uh you know Clarity um and you know and all the stuff that comes with the interoperability of all these various different D5 protocols and tools plugging into to this space um probably the most commonly known use case for uh for blockchain technology in the kind of climate space is around the tokenization of carbon and other ecological assets um you know Carbon offsetting is you know very common uh approach taken by governments and companies to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint um you know basically you know the hope is that companies will do everything that they can to reduce their emissions or so will countries um but then if they're trying to reach a certain goal often they'll buy offsets to help sort of fill the gap and this is definitely the space where we see the biggest number of projects who are using blockchain technology again to bring additional liquidity to sort of build on top of these various different D5 protocols uh and to create what people are calling the refi space the regenerative Finance space um and you know that that takes a lot of different shapes and sizes uh I kind of showed a cross-section of a bunch of different interesting and Innovative projects uh senken in the middle of the screen here um has created a dashboard that is kind of a Clearinghouse for all kinds of different offsets that tells the stories of the projects that helps to draw attention um to the sort of different approaches that are being taken and the the projects that are being directly financed you know of course the beauty of doing these kinds of projects enabled by blockchain technology is that it just opens up a whole world of possibilities in terms of cutting out middlemen again um and you know one of the biggest costs of doing carbon offsets is actually the validation and verification and I'll talk about that in a second but but you know really even just at the surface level knowing how much is being paid knowing whether an offset has actually uh you know occurred um you know all of that is stuff that's uh especially enabled by blockchain technology and just because of the sort of ease of use of many of these protocols brings a lot more uh liquidity into the space which is really a big part of what's needed in the carbon offside offset space is to just bring in more demand uh which will then generate more and more of these projects actually occurring in the real world um so I also included a couple of other projects like endangered token or Neptune chain who are trying to look at other ecological assets like Forest preservation or um you know the sustainability of uh you know the the marine environment um regen foundation and the regen network is a really interesting project and really a set of projects being built on top of a protocol that I think is really worth checking out um doing some very interesting stuff in terms of uh you know looking at ecology value and also using their own standards to bring offsets directly on chain as opposed to some other projects that are using pre-existing offsets and tokenizing them which is uh you know basically can be very effective but also has some limiting uh you know barriers when you know say a group decides to not allow that activity to take place as is kind of the the ongoing conversation right now with Vera the biggest voluntary carbon offset market right now um also just want to give a quick shout out to return protocol a really cool project that just allows you to set and forget offsets directly in your wallet uh so you know you can just basically set up a certain percentage of every transaction to go towards uh carbon offsets and you know you can just make that happen uh very easily and of course uh you know as as I think everybody is well aware user experience is one of the most important things for us to be wrestling with in the years ahead um cool to see projects that are just trying to make it as easy as possible so I'm not going to mention all these projects Spirals and refi uh South also doing great stuff um but uh as as I am tend to do I I'm noticing I got a lot of slides and only you know not as much time as a I could I could talk endlessly about this um so you know the kind of the next piece of this that I think really uh is important and it connects to um the the conversation or an asset or offsets is the the world of uh monitoring reporting and verification or mrv uh you know tracking emissions uh you know is is definitely super important and verifying impact is super important um and oracles have become a big part of conversation around blockchain technology and the uh in recent years there's some great projects uh like astral and shamba uh who are trying to use oracles to help with the verification of offsets so like if somebody makes a claim that they're protecting a piece of forest how do you know uh and part of the way you can do that is using satellite data um you know weather data also becomes very important um and even in some cases even putting uh you know monitoring devices directly you know in the soil or at a farm um Can can bring that information on chain and be used as a sort of an additional layer uh in that stack of technology that can help actually verify the validity of emission reductions and uh shamba is already using this technology to help bring new Revenue to Farmers and various places in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa um really exciting to see what they're doing I also want to give a shout out to blockchain for climate Foundation they're big fans of ethereum so uh yeah you know if you don't know them already you should definitely check them out they've been around for many years run by a guy named Joseph uh who I've known for for many years in Vancouver um super lovely guy and uh you know they have been trying to bring the Paris agreement uh the the greenhouse gas reduction agreement onto the ethereum blockchain for many years and you know meeting with a lot of politicians and others um but really at its core I think it's important to understand that using blockchain to actually do the carbon Accounting in a transparent way uh is fundamentally a very important and useful attribute of what blockchain can bring to the climate space already the government of Canada British Columbia and many other places in the world are experimenting with this uh it's much needed there's a real lack of standardization of how greenhouse gas accounting is done in terms of how the information is shared you know there's a hodgepodge of databases and spreadsheets that are floating around out there in the world and it's very hard to wrap your head around exactly what's being done in that space um so I I'm actually very excited about that sort of overarching like how do we use blockchain technology just for the monitoring of greenhouse gases and climate impacts as well as that sort of more on the ground monitoring of specific uh projects that are making claims um you know and you know if we're going to pass our money to folks having that sort of level of verification um you know in short I think blockchain could actually basically solve some of the biggest problems with carbon offsets uh Logistics and supply chain efficiency is probably the least sexy and potentially one of the most important uh uses of blockchain technology in terms of reducing energy um you know a tremendous amount of energy use goes into uh the movement of goods around the world uh already big companies like Maersk and others are using uh blockchains in their case I think private blockchains but increasingly we're seeing you know how this can be super super important uh in this space and the the graphic that I included here is from the folks at the Rocky Mountain Institute who are doing some really interesting work in this regard uh also a shadow should go to the folks from filecoin Green who are doing some very important work uh in this space as well around sort of attestations uh uh and you know different ways of sort of monitoring impact um and you know folks who have had a lot of experience working directly uh in this space so um yeah each one of these pieces I could I could spend an hour talking about but let's just say that uh um Logistics supply chain efficiency super important and another really exciting opportunity in in the blockchain space to really have an impact finally the the last use case that I'm going to highlight uh is actually Community Arts and culture projects um you know culture does not change all by itself and this is one of the things that uh you know that we fund through Bitcoin grants rounds that I think is kind of underrated in its importance on this page there's a bunch of different interesting projects one of them is a video game uh one of them is a documentary Reef fideau who has the cutest name in all of crypto I I always just call them reefed out because I get confused but they're trying to protect the Great Barrier Reef by making a digital twin of the Great Barrier Reef um in sort of a metaversal space where you can buy uh portions of the reef and it'll Finance researchers who are making 3D models of the Great Barrier Reef uh using some Innovative new underwater cameras and really you know to be honest it was the first time that I really got excited about the metaverse as much as I'm into games and whatever else um you know I hadn't really seen the implications of a metaversal space as part of climate Solutions refined I was doing some really interesting stuff there's also a lot of different uh conferences uh and educational programs like open campus that are seeing funding coming in uh hibiscus Dao is a group that's looking at standardization for reducing energy consumption in the fashion industry using blockchain technology that's their logo up in the top right corner and some just amazing artists for anybody who pays attention to git coin you've probably heard us talk about solar Punk art um you know definitely one of the coolest uh things that I I see happening in the space is just kind of this visioning of how the world could be um and I think that you know the more that we have that conversation get people excited about the real world use cases that we talked about today but then sort of imagine what it looks like in our day-to-day lives I think that's what's what it's going to take to really start changing people's perception and understanding of of the value of this kind of Technology um so I just wanted to to sort of end off with this idea of uh you know just one last thing about git coin which is you know people say I I've got a friend named pranav from uh uh refi South who says people come to get coin for the funding but they stick around for the community and you know I I think that really is the secret sauce of the web 3 space in general and in Bitcoin in particular um you know the interoperability and composability of our tools really leads to this uh you know collaborative space where people support each other it's been very exciting to watch these projects over the last four grants rounds evolve and grow and collaborate learn in public you know sometimes things work sometimes things don't but we all uh you know kind of take big steps in the right direction as the result of of that kind of approach so I I just you know I I love seeing these kind of quotes from various different people in the community but the experiences that they had with uh with Git coin you know to me it's uh really just amazing to sort of watch this evolve and grow uh if you haven't checked out any of our Twitter spaces we've done a bunch of these shill spaces for folks in the climate space as well as just others on bitcoin and it's been really exciting to sort of see all these different projects come and share what they're working on and often make New relationships in real time and uh you know sometimes people find co-founders or they find developers or they find funders or they just learn about uh you know something interesting that's going on somewhere else in the world um so that's that's definitely a very cool part of what you see happening day to day I get coin and I'll just leave it there and say uh you know I would love to talk to anybody who is interested in what could be done in this space or is curious to learn more about this space I threw my Twitter handle and my telegram up there uh feel free to come and uh you know find me and and talk more about you know what is possible in the web 3 climate solution space so thanks for the time to to chat about all this stuff thanks for being here Ben I really appreciate that and I think awesome overview of just like all the different kind of things that are happening in the space and and what what's been made possible um I know we're a little bit over but I I kind of want to ask a couple questions uh that come into mind um anybody has any other questions feel free to drop them in the chat as well um but yeah I mean now that we've kind of done this this this major Improvement as you mentioned to kind of like I guess wipe the Energy Efficiency or the energy usage with the Netherlands off the map um and ethereum's Usage Now is like you know I think more representative of like the volume of of you know what it should be like given that all these all other climate Solutions and things that are happening on chain exist like is there a way where we could like measure that impact in in a way where we maybe ethereum could almost be like carbon not even just carbon neutral but also like carbon negative is there a way we could kind of get to that point yeah absolutely I mean some things are easier to to um to count than others but definitely the offset protocols and the renewable energy credits um you know many of those projects actually have dashboards um a big shout out to uh the folks for eth for climate which is kind of a new Coalition that's just recently come together um that's actually talking about offsetting historic emissions uh from the ethereum blockchain which I think is uh you know a noble and worthwhile activity um you know for me the the bigger picture really is just like how do we make ethereum a you know massively positive contributor to climate Solutions you know regardless of just historic emissions but also like kind of Beyond uh you know the emissions calculations and you know things like carbon accounting for example it's kind of hard to quantify what the impact of that is you know just having better information in the hands of people more readily um you know or things like their arts and culture projects you know again sort of harder to quantify uh but definitely there are a lot of ways that we can use blockchain technology to monitor um you know the impact of all of these projects um and you know I'll give a shout out to the folks at zero labs and to the folks at clementow who both have uh some great dashboards already that they're experimenting with and anybody who wants to take a look can go find the Discord for uh for climate and you'll you'll see a lot of that conversation happening there amazing um and then yeah maybe one last like really quick thing that comes to mind for me like uh you mentioned yeah historical ethereum you know I think it's like like to your point about earlier in the presentation about how like you can't think of any like uh proxy or equivalent to like that much kind of energy usage being kind of like flipped off in a switch outside of maybe government policies and stuff like that like um it is a big change and I think like there is a large kind of consensus almost that had formed uh during the proof of work days of ethereum that like it is energy inefficient it's part of the kind of uh battle against climate change that like we need to go up against ethereum not work with it um I mean you probably spend a lot of time you know chatting with different people that maybe you know aren't as you know maybe kind of in the know as kind of the group of people that are probably watching this but like what have you seen as like a really good way to sort of reverse that narrative now that like we really truly have done that with technology how do we now do that with kind of the more social aspect of it that's a really good question um and honestly I think it's the storytelling around projects and use cases um you know the uh you know the that old saying sell the sizzle about the stake uh you know I think because we're we're such like a developer heavy space and and still quite early in the sort of building out of tools uh you know I think there's kind of an emphasis on talking about the how everything works instead of the sort of why it's useful um you know and I I think like for most people really all they understand is kind of the payments or the sort of investment components of this um you know so my hope is that just by like telling these stories of these Innovative projects and the really interesting things they're doing with this technology and showing why that couldn't just be done um you know with a set of Excel spreadsheets or you know some traditional database structure uh or how that you know the removal of middlemen uh you know takes a bunch of rent seeking activity out of the mix and put more puts more money directly in the hands of people um or even things like the uh electric charging station in the in buildings in the same City that I live in um you know to be that like you don't even need to know that there's blockchain under the hood there uh making that work but maybe when you do learn that then you'll have sort of a different view of of this technology um I can tell you I've talked to a lot of uh climate oriented organizations and individuals um you know over the years uh you know from working in the space for many years but since I've been working at git coin and even before as a you know person with an interesting crypto and I've been telling a lot of people like let's just keep having this conversation after the merge um you know because like people have been a little bit reticent but you know sort of interested in what was possible um and I think there you know there's going to be a big influx of people showing up who are sort of maybe now open to seeing what is possible in the space and and that's really exciting to me amazing well appreciate your time Ben I'm also a fellow torontonian uh funny enough and I had no idea that those Chargers in my Continental building are connected to a blockchain so maybe I'll message you after to try to figure out what's going on there but uh it's absolutely a pleasure to have you here Ben and um and thank you so much for your time thanks for having me that was a lot of fun Cheers Cheers okay great so uh we're kind of moving on to another topic that I think is you know really really interesting it's been a topic that's been obviously in the news during uh over the last couple years um as people are kind of adapting to new ways of working um kind of in parallel to that I think maybe you know a little bit quieter has been this kind of innovation of of kind of the future of work and people building and doing things in a permissionless fashion on ethereum um so I wanted to invite Tina from the station team uh to come and give a chat about kind of the the work that's being done both at station and just kind of broader in the ecosystem and just sort of like kind of what what is happening in the space and how ethereum is impacting it so um do you know without further Ado I'd love to kind of welcome you to the stage and feel free to share your or kind of share your video unmute um and yeah be awesome to go from here there you go hey Tina good to have you here great to see you awesome so yeah feel free to share your screen if you have something to share and I will get out of the way and I'm excited to hear what you uh hear your presentation we're excited about this awesome can you see my screen okay yeah it looks great awesome um thank you so much for having me um I'm Tina I'm one of the co-founders of station Labs um and we're building a set of decentralized tooling to help um contributors and DOW members coordinate and collaborate with each other more professionally um so this is a very very broad topic and I kind of put kind of air quotes future work because we all know that it's been kind of abused as kind of this buzzword um you know throwing around both in the VC sphere and also kind of in ethereum um and kind of wanting to start off as like you know what even is the future of work and we see that um definitions have evolved over time um some people believe that the future of work is remote work it's distributed work um there's this idea about you know new models of value attribution and distribution around Creator economy um around gig economy and then you know we had this open source ecosystem that is super super close to kind of ethereum's um foundation and um and Ethos and generally the larger crypto ecosystem as well um so I think that honestly It's a combination of a lot of these Concepts all in one and I think a lot of times when we look at what's happening in ethereum what's happening with Dows what's happening with this new class of Labor sometimes it's very easy to kind of see things in silos where you know these are um you know very groundbreaking things are happening in ethereum which you know oftentimes are true but also you know the same movement is also happening Beyond so I think the goal of the talk is really kind of put things more contextually and really look at the current stock of kind of global distributed work and you know the kind of existing infrastructure to support that and kind of like Envision and ideate like what the possibilities could be moving forward um so a big big move um you know around the future of work is really this idea of you know in the past we worked in offices and now we're working online um but also this idea of like relationships are now becoming much more digital in native where we meet people on Twitter we meet people on GitHub we meet people on these digital platforms and then we because of the proof of work um that you know it's it's both a you know very you know um crypto native concept but also it's it's a concept that um is prevalent in other digitally native platforms as well like GitHub where you have a provenance of the work that you've done um and because of these relationships you see this kind of reflection of you know the offline space um being reflective of these online relationships that are also very authentically built based on you know what you've done on the internet um and the reason why we're all here right now um you know at EF Global um is you know because of this distributed Network ethereum um and now people are gathering in real life and on like offline and offline um kind of discussing topics that you know unite us and really kind of one framework that I really like to think about is actually through the lens of Urban Design because why we need cities I really love this book called or order without design by Elaine Patron um and um he kind of talks about how cities are essentially labor markets um and one quote that you know resonates with both myself and also a lot of other Dao leaders um and you know Founders in this space are really kind of thinking about the you know ethereum and also generally Dao's as a labor market as a city so what does the city need um so we have you know a well-functioning labor market brings together people with varied but complementary Knowledge and Skills the preconditions for Innovation um and a well-functioning labor market also makes possible every other Urban attraction like Orchestra museums and art galleries so we are already seeing that you know kind of the early glimpses of that in crypto and in ethereum ecosystem we have protocols like urine and index Co-op there are you know very very well organized and like Cooperative dials um with you know a variety of different functions the same same way that we you know in a company we have all these different functions um but we also kind of see these Urban attractions that start to emerge from that Central economic activities of people producing valuable protocols um generating economic value for the ethereum ecosystem which you know kind of subsequently increases the value or demand of ethereum as a participant um just like how you know the value of kind of the U.S or the value of New York um it's kind of increasing the demand of people wanting to migrate into that City and ecosystem um so you know from Urban attraction perspective we see kind of fov which is you know a great social doubt I'm throwing events in real life and Idlewild um California um and which actually completely I think changes the the town's um perception of crypto and now I I am aware that recently they also received like a 13 000 donation um to kind of spin up another um like a more ongoing initiative on a local level to have kind of more crypto communities to gather and and meet in real life and in Idlewild which is kind of a crazy impact on the real world economy um if you think about it um and then there's you know dials like bright moments where they're hosting events exhibitions shows um inspired by their collections of nfts and really like their nfts are great and they're beautiful but it's very clear also that you know beyond our it's much more Beyond much more beyond the artwork itself where these artworks are just collections of identities where you know people who have a the same kind of artwork um from the same city could find and discover one another and then go to these events and actually see each other in person so if we look at ethereum at this new city that we already kind of saw this kind of early glimpse of you know we have complementary skill sets and we have some cultural events that are happening best we know like it's still super super early um and you know many people are complaining about how the space is generally inaccessible for most people and activities and economic kind of engine haven't really been started like before we really can onboard majority of the and more people into into the space and benefiting from this ecosystem um trying to go a little bit more philosophical and look at the dimensionality of org here um where um you know what what is actually work and what is work consists of and I will say that there's like a few Dimensions um that um that we want to kind of use as a framework to to look at where we are um you know in the digital labor space and where we are for specifically ethereum um so for work we have you know tasks we have mobilization which is a group of people completing tasks and doing things towards the same goal um and as you build this meaningful relationships with people that you work with you're developing this sense of belonging and the sense of identity um and you know as you slowly you know discover these places of belonging you also you know actualize and really find out kind of what you are called for and these are the concepts that should be familiar with anybody who has studied either Urban Design or just design in general um to understand you know these are the different um some some like you use the framework like Marcelo hierarchy of needs and others just like to kind of say a little bit more abstract but if we actually look at the intersections of a lot of these themes we start to see different shapes of work um that is happening both within crypto and outside of it um so you know we see git economy Bounty boards as sitting in the intersection of you know mobilizing tasks and gig workers and we see in the intersection between mobilization and belonging um you know ask corporations and Global Corporation startups distributed work and also of course we're very familiar with dials um and in the intersection of belonging and actualization you know we traditionally have this perception of nation states and churches but right now we see the rise of Maxis and rock me culture and um you know kind of believing belief systems and almost like close to kind of a religious type of state that is being formed by the formation of also token Networks and kind of on a spectrum we see kind of on the left side being you know labor that is much more mercenary like all the way to labor that is much more missionary that are driven to a shared by a share purpose um a mission and also like the value that's being created um and those values are much less monetary um but more so around you know your sense of identity and self and what it kind of means to be um a part of the network and I think in terms of ethereum like this is a more realistic look at what we where we are right now um we have you know Traders bounty hunters airdrop Farmers one token and actually players kind of representing labor that's more on the opposite like on the other left side of Spectrum which are tasks um you know more fungible tasks um and and labor and we have on the right side we have you know meaningful labor that's being produced which is storytelling and actually creating moves and around you know being a Bitcoin Maxi or ethereum Maxi and LARPing which is you know an ultimate form of belief which is you know role-playing as in a nine developer or um really kind of finding this new self on the internet and then we have everything in between which is kind of the real infrastructure to make this a viable path um to connect between the tasks and skills that can be practiced in ethereum network and also the meaning behind and the vision of decentralization and permissionless um and right now the reason why like I grade out the two circles in between is like these are still being built and being constructed and they're still super early in their formation nation and what are they they're the hackers they're the product designers they're the community stewards funders Educators mean perpetuators um they're the people that are actually right like kind of starting to realize the lack of infrastructure in the space um and how it's very very difficult to actually sustain their living or actually have a full-time job just you know strictly in this token Network and taking a step back to look at you know how the global digital labor infrastructure um kind of functions this is like super bra Strokes definitely a little bit reductionist um but really right like there's a few layers here um on the foundational layer and a base layer we have we need local laws and compliances to ensure that you know like if I'm a worker I'm compliant of the labor local labor law and also I'm getting paid in my own currency um so that I can consume you know local goods and then kind of in the middle there's this network that allow me to find work in the first place and those are the toolings in marketplaces um for example upwork and um recently brain trusts that emerge as this you know flattening of the global labor market where you know if we allies like cities at labor market we are now seeing that you know we don't really have to live in New York anymore to have access to a higher page job and that is the whole idea of you know Strife increasing the GDP of the internet as a payment Rail and I think a lot of the messages are also true here where you know with these marketplaces um now you know if you are someone like anywhere in the world you're able to find opportunities that otherwise you have not found in in your local market um and in you know in order to actually coordinate um you know people from different time zones we're now seeing you know productivity tools like GitHub notion telegram emails and you know very standard boilerplate tools now um both in crypto and outside of it being that coordination rail but we look at a decentralized digital labor infrastructure versus a centralized Global digital labor infrastructure what is different and what are the possibilities here which I think is the most fun to think about like if the now the topic is the future of work on ethereum um is that right now in absence of you know local laws and compliances in the absence of nation state as this enforcer and um this forcing function of any type of viability and like legitimacy and enforceability of agreements made between individuals like in absence of that can smart contracts can a lot of these crypto native Primitives actually play the role of you know providing the accountability and trustlessly trustlessness between individuals nodes individual nodes and and contributors in the network um and kind of looking being a little bit more practical here I think there's generally two approach um when it comes to constructing this base layer um the the crypto rails the payment rails um which is I think the most well understood which is you know embedded value distribution when you create some type of work so that's you know on a very practical level that is like when you perform a task when you you know finish you know a piece of work or a bounty you immediately get paid in crypto um or you know when you farm um I don't know Farm in the in a polygon based game you you get paid in in that token immediately that can be consumed later or be staked in another protocol like these are very familiar primitive for anybody who who is here um but then I think the more interesting part is really about like how can we actually start to radically think about the compatibility of smart contract and IRL law foreign and the um the other thing that's very interesting um but very very hard is about enforceability like in absence of legal infrastructure like can we actually enforce some type of outcome and consequences when you know agreements have been violated and this is like I think the least talked about um there are some few there are a few groups like lifestyle and worked out that have emerged um that are kind of solving that problem um but really I think we're still super early in that development of like finding the right um kind of legal Frameworks um that both work on change who create that record and trustless feature of law but also being able to be backward compatibility so that it can still remain compliant um for local laws if that's the desire outcome which I believe it is for many crypto organizations um irregardless of their status around like um anonymization and sudanivity and then the more interesting and exciting part really lies in this idea of identity so you know when you are a labor and you're a contributor on ethereum and you know within this Webster ecosystem you have a wallet um you know what does that even mean as you know now you're you have a identity that's completely different um from the one that has been defined by traditional nation state and and laws um that have been constructed in the past uh we don't have no longer have a passport we don't have an ID um so your ID really is kind of the activities that have been associated with the wallet um so there's some ideas here that um I think this stack was made like in the past 48 hours and really it was like a quick just very very early thinking around like the ideas around you know the possibilities I can enable by the multi-centric feature um so we have protocol driven marketplaces here meaning that you know with the presence of something like uniswab or pseudo swab um the idea of having you know a set interface in a centralized platform is less attractive like in reality if you were to think about a more liquid labor Marketplace it could potentially be more decentralized and really be driven and incentives really be driven by the protocol uh with kind of players incentivized players helping verify the quality of Labor um and the referrers helping you know curate the network of talent as well um where you know it's less so about the platform but more about the individuals that are actually curating a telemarketplace which is a very exciting future um and then we have the idea of when you participate actively in the protocol and you know when you actively participate in a dow how that on-chain action actually broadcast to the entire network and that becomes your reputation that we've you know traditionally been outsourced to a lot of web tool platforms like LinkedIn or upwork um and then the other interesting things are like blurring lines between cells and groups so as an individual um and as an individual who possesses wallet like you can actually sometimes also represent a Dao um and um the idea of being wall eccentric you know kind of create the possibility of one person creating six and seven wallets and representing different solves in different groups um group identity if you also have a multi-signature wallet um and of course like it's this kind of absolute upset like kind of ownership over your work history and provenance um which is a lot of times not true right now but the possibility of it is immense when like what does it mean philosophically when you actually have true ownership of you know a lot of the things that you've done on chain and the last piece which is very interesting is like when you know in the traditional Corporation you get onboarded you become you know a worker an employee of this company and that means that you have the permissions and assets to its set of tools benefits and all the implications of someone becoming an employee but what does that mean when someone becomes a member of many dolls and many communities and how does that status translate between tools and tools as we you know are moving into this more multi-client future and with protocol kind of at the center um and then of course with the coordination rails also will look different when the lines between organizations start to blur like we see you know pots as a very popular concept like popularized by orca protocol now called um Metropolis where we see this idea of like your self-identity being represented by a pot that's registered on chain and that kind of gives you access to a bunch of different again like other tools or information otherwise um you do not have access to so looking at this whole stack we see actually a lot of fragmentation um across these um across the whole stack so you know right now we kind of see this fermentation of identity and reputation and knowledge because um a lot of the work is still being performed in web 2 platforms um so that you know after you write amazing posts on this course like that post would not be associated with your identity when you move to another platform um and you know the lack of data interoperability is a part of that issue we see a lack of accountability meaning that like if a bunch of pseudonymous people are working together there's really no way to enforce that something is going to happen and the consequences you know are also it's very hard to enforce and even if we have accountability mechanism right like when there's dispute um Aragon actually did a lot of innovation here where they have a dispute Court called clairols I think um actually claro is another project but um they basically create decentralized history resolution um kind of channels but right now those channels are not properly incentivized either so that that's there's still like I think a lot to be done there and we're still super early in this future but without these very core infrastructure I think we're still pretty far um from like kind of entering to this future but with that said some teams and some people are already living in the future um and then we have some examples here so on the base layer these are examples of escrow contract and backward compatibility compatible compatible contract um that are created by lifestyle um they're super dope like strongly recommend taking a look um we have identity layer um that you know is being designed by teams like Guild and um and some other teams being mentioned here um really the idea is that you know once you are part of the doubt like then you know that identity of yours can be carried um to any other applications that you interact with um on the blockchain on ethereum and then we have a coordination layer which really is about embedding incentives when you perform a piece of work and get coin it's a great example um there's already a talk on gig one um that was amazing that talked about how um you know the git coins vision is really building this open grants protocol um where you know there's the kind of number of reviewers of you know brands are kind of scaled linearly with the people that are applying for grants that are designing grants um so there's some very exciting feature there I know we have tools that are very tactical like Wonder verse which you know is building a bounty board where after you perform a task you automatically get paid as well um by the work you do with like very granular um with the very vulnerability you should get like attributed build credit and also rewards and putting a lot of things together and kind of share a little bit towards the end of what we've been building a station really kind of how we've been thinking about this um is protocol at the center and really think about you know what are the universal data structures that can be leveraged both by us but also by others um you know to build different type of creative clients um to establish these trust trustful relationship on chain um and you know on the client side we have a very friendly app that allows anybody to propose to another person to work together um on in web3 so if I know your ens address I can send it to you and be like hey like do you want to work on this together and Define the terms of how the payment will be issued like Milestones splits vice versa and then sign it um to prove that you know there's this public verifiable record on ipfs that you know people can refer to if you know we're a agreement were to be breached and then when those activities start to emerge when people work together um you know in the use cases of let's say greater economy like someone wants to engage you know a community of fans or in the case of a Dao where they're looking to sponsor you know 100 developers to go on top of their protocol and also involving the community in the decision-making process we're seeing this emergent network of projects protocols contributors voters that are all participants of this network that actually built a more decentralized reputation system that ideally in the future can replace um you know kyc which crypto has a very ambiguous relationship with so that's the end um thank you so much for having me I had a blast just talking through the very philosophical lens of the future of work on ethereum um we can jump into any questions or ideas yeah sure awesome thank you thank you so much Tina I appreciate uh you jumping through everything with us and yeah that was awesome I think you touched on so many of the different uh I think opportunities for like where like this could be headed and I think it's still very early and I think at the end they're kind of tied it up with like what is some of the current work that's being done in the space and and even that work frankly is very early like I think there's like opportunity for like new things to happen in this space um and yeah if anybody has any questions feel free to drop them in the chat and um in the meantime I'll jump into some of the ones that I had going through this um I guess like you know from my perspective when um with those in particular one of the main things that I've seen as requests from Dows is basically you know for lack of a better way of putting it like Talent you know people that are smart uh that are capable of joining those Dows and being able to execute things on behalf of the Dow I know you talked a little bit about like how we're kind of adding more structure into Taos which will also kind of help run those more efficiently and I think also Scott mentioned that as well as part of his presentation earlier today um on the public good side I guess like um the early it seems like to me the early experimentation there is more on that if you had that kind of four Venn diagram image that you had more on the kind of tasks and like very early piece um what would you recommend right now to Dows that are kind of like what should they basically change structurally so that they can move like up a rank on that list of of Venn diagrams that's a great question um I also touch very very briefly about um on this um in the talk where we start to see pots being a very popular structure among Dallas as like a subgroup sub-working group there's different names to it but really it's just a group of people working together within the Dow and kind of give them the autonomy to make decisions kind of more in a more centralized way without compromising on the decentralized nature of the entire organization so it's almost like there's some level of centralization on a local level but keep the global level of the organization more decentralized to ensure that you know there's diversity of thoughts and opinions and no power is actually being over concentrated it on the top but in terms of day-to-day operations we all know that like if it's truly decentralized nothing gets done and not all decisions needs consensus um so it's it's much more frequent now we see very very centralized almost like many startups that operate within the Dow um that kind of resemble this pot like um or working group like structure awesome yeah I definitely noticed that that's been sort of a a pretty like consistent theme um even just through like the work that I was doing um as being like an optimism delegate like moving from just like everybody reviews all proposals to now they have working groups as of this iteration recently um I know bitcoin's done a lot of work in here you know he's done a lot of work here too um and and yeah it's been it's been really exciting to see um I have like a bit of a prop but I'm not going to like force you to speak on it because uh but I just saw this really interesting tweet this morning um not during the presentation I swear I was paying attention um a tweet from treas uh who uh helps ramalama um that like hundreds of people today some synonymous are earning a full-time income working for open source protocols um getting paid in open source money often gaining over ownership over governance decisions in these protocols this is actually wild and underrated I think this is also very wild and underrated I agree with him um here I'm not going to ask if you agree or not I know I'm putting you on the spot there but um I I mean I think like that's you know part of the opportunity is that outcome right for everybody whether are able to kind of participate in such a way and get access to permissionless money permissionless work and just be able to like be you know part of this ecosystem um you could speak to that if you want to speak to it but if not then then kind of my main question was to sort of like he said hundreds of people you know for that to be thousands of people or tens of thousands of people they need access to kind of resources and and things to kind of understand the space a lot better what are some of the kind of resources that come to mind and places to start for for people who are interested in having that outcome totally um I think back to the city analogy I feel like we first need companies to be built into cities like create the economic create jobs um to actually have kind of people migrating to the city so I think we're still so early in that process of like just not enough protocols that are profitable exist um to generate enough value for for them to employ like kind of new talent but outside of that I think a lot of the things that we mentioned in the presentation still hold true where some of the base layer like the financial legal infrastructure um you know the financial is the easiest part in crypto um but the legal also is one of the hardest it's like how can we be bad or compatible um at the same time leveraging the power of smart contracts to automate a lot of these like traditional very like kind of costly processes that are really hindering you know a lot of these developing markets to tap into you know what America's legal system this despite having a lot of flaws still enable which is a very very powerful system for for capitalism to shine um to kind of enable that economic those economic opportunities for um for more countries as well amazing very cool well thank you so much for for answering my questions there um I I didn't see any new questions come in on the chat but I did see a lot of great presentations this is interesting you know excited about this so thank you so much for for being a part of this Tina and uh for for joining us for for this chat and um yeah if anybody else wants to uh to you know chat with you uh in a different place uh I feel feel free to drop your Twitter handle um or if you give like the shout outs so that people know where to find you go where do we find you um you can find me on Twitter I'm fkpxls fake pixels but with all the vowels so awesome okay cool thank you so much Tina really appreciate you thank you right okay great um awesome and then we have two more talks coming up uh so uh we heard Tina talk a little bit about um accruing all of this sort of work that you're doing in a decentralized way on ethereum um towards identities and and people having wallets being kind of the new primitive uh that worked out really well because the next talk that we're talking about um is by Wayne on the spruce team and Wayne's gonna be chatting about ethereum's identity layer exactly kind of what that what that's implying so uh maybe without further Ado I don't want to spoil anything so maybe I'll just invite Wayne up right away um and Wayne when you're ready feel free to uh to kind of share your video your bike there you are nice to see you um and yeah really excited about this I mean I think you know identity is one of those things that the ecosystem has been working on for a very long time um and I think especially over the last like couple years we've gained I think a tremendous amount of clarity on like what that can look like um and what are the kind of different outcomes and impacts of having a fully decentralized and then they can be um so maybe I will spoil anything but maybe just kind of hyping up this conversation a little bit it'll turn around for that yeah and I think from if you've been listening to Tina's talk uh she does refer to this identity layer that stretches across on chain activity also stretches across offshine activity so I hope to just add to the discussion with what that identity layer can be how wide and encompassing it can be and how we start thinking about it awesome I'll let you share your screen when you're ready yep here it is so ethereum's identity layer let's start with a pretty high level what is identity uh this this you know it potentially could be a discussion that is for hours uh right but um as developers and also um people we want to have a working definition so when we say identity at least it refers to something of the same semblance so they're very technical definitions for what identity is from ISO the international standards organization they'd formally Define uh digital identity as a set of attributes related to an entity I don't think it's false I think it's true but also it doesn't help us that much because then anything could kind of be identity so at a place called the internet identity Workshop highly recommend this conference if you're interested in identity decentralized identity I think oauth 2 was invented there or at least standardized by a lot of the folks who go there um what's happening next with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials a lot of the same people show up there so you're very interested in identity highly recommend it it's in I think Mountain View every twice a year and they came up with a definition that identity is the way we recognize remember and respond to people and things and it kind of adds an operative context to that so it's not just a set of attributes related to an entity but it's kind of what do you do with those attributes maybe some of those help with authentication maybe some of those help you you know retrieve who you're talking about and make decisions on how you're going to respond right so with this context I think it helps make a lot more sense um brief history of identity through let's call it web 2 and web one web zero uh that can open that and whatnot but uh typically when you look at the traditional identity markets they're divided for enterprising for people and interestingly it's kind of converging so if you've ever seen like open ID connect or oauth 2 or ldap or active directory any of these things this is kind of what the Enterprise identity management and also some end user identities are talking about so in the 80s people needed to have accounts to log into time sharing systems or computer networks for their work so we started to do identity management sending emails around corporately and that evolved into more complexity people needed to also manage access and then most recently the trends have been why do people have those access what's their title in that organization or credentials what are their certifications that give them that access that's a lot of what the let's call it web 2 identity landscape is looking at and it's really related to compliance and insurance and all that so for more organically people using identities on the internet they had aliases and emails right and then you had all these Services emerge in the 90s um you could go on BBS systems and have a certain Alias there or IRC Etc 2000s we saw the rise of social media and more data linked to people's identifiers and of course it's used for advertising which funds a lot of the you know free platforms and in the 2010s we saw the emergence of sign in with your you know favorite internet Giant and as a convenient way to not have to remember a username and password right so that's kind of how the story is to date and we're very excited about decentralized identity a lot of those other structures are kind of top-down command and control either a company sets up everything or maybe a large tech company decides how it's going to work with everyone basically you can use open protocols and Open Standards towards that but just like how we saw with SMTP and email even though these are open protocols they kind of converge to just a few entities who are the main influencers and you can't even run your own email server you know unless you go to unless you really understand how email servers work and how not to get blocked so we think that decentralized identity has to do with statements about reality by anyone and that can include stuff that happens on chain or off chain statements about reality are things as you know basic as I live in this town or you know so and so went to a certain School and this ethereum address has a certain balance right these are all statements about reality some of them can just live on chain every time someone creates an ethereum transaction there's a signature involved right and something happens the ethereum blockchain can attest to the state of itself you can look it up through an indexer or you know crawl the transactions and understand the state of the system and that's a statement about reality by ethereum that is fully verifiable if you look at the signatures in the previous state of ethereum Etc there are also statements about reality that are off chain that can be represented as Json with a signature over it or other formats so things like there's a certain email Associated to an ethereum account or there's a certain Twitter handle associated with an ethereum account Discord candles Etc you can link these data together but maybe you know it's a statement about reality we say nothing about if it's true or not right so it really matters uh who's saying it so if ethereum's saying it and you have cryptographic evidence about an ethereum address for a ethereum addresses balance maybe that's a very convincing statement however if someone says you know this ethereum address is corresponding to this person and it's a rando who says that maybe you don't want to trust it right so it really depends on who's making the statement and what kind of evidence they can present towards that and how you interpret that is commonly called a trust framework in the world of identity so like we said with the second definition it's used to recognize remember and respond so if you're building a Dap that is uh you know trying to assemble a bunch of Dao hack victims into a support group if they're not super wealthy from uh eth you might have kind of a rule set that uses uh their digital identity assembled across on chain and potentially off-chain activity right so Wayne chain.eth we check if they're hack victim that's something that you can just look up on the blockchain based on their activity previously there was mentioned you know your behavior endows your behavior and trading nfts or anything else staking assets those are all claims those are all statements that can be verified by the blockchain same with eat balance and you might have the user bring in their Discord handle maybe there's a witness that is able to attest that someone you know made the identity proof there was a project called keybase that did this and there are more open source ways to do this now but basically someone can prove that they have a certain Discord to handle you might have used Discord and one of the many plugins for Discord to demonstrate your ethereum address ownership right and then all of a sudden you're able to make that Association well what it could also take that fact and it's signed and you can present it wherever you want so with this set of details you're able to recognize remember and respond from a combination of on-chain and off-chain data so ultimately the model we want to move to to enable decentralized identity so it's truly emergent and not just top down we want instead of the user logging into the platform or application and then the application accesses its proprietary database instead of that we want the user to make the application log into their database and have all discretion over what's in there and how it's accessed even revoking access or you know changing the scope of it as they want this can contain those digital statements that are off chain and also the application can look up additional statements on chain and form a comprehensive identity but in a way that the user controls it's like you start with a poker hand and you pick which cards you actually want to reveal right you don't need to just show everything all at once if you put everything on chain it's bad for a lot of reasons but that's one of them because you don't get that level of control about what you want to reveal to the world versus not whereas if you're securely connected to an application and you you have some degree of trust for the application you may decide to disclose more data and how the off-chain approach Works commonly a popular data model uses called verifiable credentials which is a global data standard from w3c and we have this so-called issuer holder verifier model and this is if you enter the world of decentralized identity and bids and whatnot you'll see this a lot but the issuer such as a school will issue credentials saying that perhaps this person has a Bachelor's of Science degree the holder will be able to present it to a verifier who wants to know if that's true or not who said it maybe their employer and they can be convinced that this this person actually went to a school and got a degree right the really important thing that we care about in this model for decentralized identity is basically that the holder is isolated from all these other components that is um we're moving towards user centricity or wallet centricity in that these statements are held in the wallet in a way under the user's discretion we don't want issuers holding all the credentials for people and we don't want verifiers holding all the credentials for people we want this idea of sovereignty where the holder has discretion about where those credentials live how they're secured and how they're processed this is what gives us uh you know more ability to choose what gets disclosed to whom and finally all this is coordinated with what's called a verifiable data registry how do you know what our like accredited institutions to accept things from right what stops someone from just spinning up a public private key pair and starting to issue credentials well there are these things called trust Frameworks that can live in verifiable data Registries that you can choose to accept so you can say okay I like the trust framework that has all the credit institutions by whatever body or maybe for Dows there's a token curated registry of dows and you're like yeah that's the trust framework any of those Dows issuing statements we can Federate and accept statements from them right so these statements can be signed by ethereum addresses and stored off chain they can also be represented as ethereum transactions too but you wouldn't need something like verifiable credentials for that you can just write a smart contract and conform to certain EIP and you know that's it so this allows us to have interoperability between claims made on chain but also off chain all rooted in ethereum addresses or even a dow issuing them right so this gets us the spectrum of it it increases user control and as a result we get privacy too so as a result not your keys not your crypto evolves into not your keys not your identifier whether your refers to someone who has a private key for something or a collective with a multi-sig that controls a Dao based identifier such as a noses safe address and I think that the keys uh users having keys is one of the really critical junctures a lot of people have thought about this model where you can sign things off digitally in your keys and you have a lot more digital rights as a result well seeing this critical mass adoption of metamask and other ethereum wallets into the tens of millions we are able to lean on a lot of what they've done including Key Management which is one of the toughest problems in decentralized identity what if you lose your keys you know what's at stake here that's a tough problem and many wallets are working on this some other interesting approaches use Smart contract wallets eip1271 such as Argent becomes a really nice ux and most of the time wallets stay or used to sign blockchain transactions but we think that there's a lot more possible if you squint you look at this as the most successful public key infrastructure adoption event ever what else can you do well one thing that we can do with keys as authentication you can sign something to prove that you're the account holder right and that's exactly what we've done with sign in with ethereum we collaborated with the ethereum foundation and defined a standard message format for how someone will use ethereum to account to sign into a website that's off chain this way if you already have an ethereum account why collect an email and do that whole verification flow when already you can use that to sign into something right and instantly all your on-chain activity Associated that particular account is available for the site to you know look at um because you can have multiple wallets and multiple accounts you're able to pick your different profiles and with things like zero knowledge you're able to add additional um you're able to add additional privacy measures you might be able to spawn a new ethereum address just for a website and use is there a knowledge proofs to show that you indeed did have certain transactions you're not going to say what the other ethereum address was but indeed you did that before so this is uh the direction for basically new classes of dapps that will give you a richer experience because they know a bit more about they're actually talking to the ethereum account holder this is different than connect wallet because with connect wallet all you're doing is um just telling the server uh this is my theory mattress but you have no proof for it anyone can spoof that but with sign in with ethereum the server definitely knows they're talking to someone who holds the key because they were able to present a challenge and get a correct response from the account holder so how it works is that we just standardize the message format this has been going on for like three four years already people have been using authentication flows but we just standardized what the message format was going to be and it's heavily inspired by Json web tokens which is you know live in production across like billions of users probably but we made it uh palatable to be displayed in wallets so it's a rigid grammar um very little opportunity to you know inject malicious statements or anything we intentionally made it that way and basically we add security features too once we standardize and also ux improvements so if a wallet is able to recognize this rigid message format it can actually be smart enough to show a login dialog so it really feels like you're logging in as opposed to just trying to sign a personal message additionally we get important security properties the most important one that we care about is called domain binding so when it says domain wants to sign in with your ethereum account let's say it's example.org right the wallet actually has an opportunity to check that it's coming from example.org over a TLS connection right and eventually you know maybe as we move to peer-to-peer encrypted systems I can check domain binding for that but since most stuff is served over TLS today we can check that and you can know that you're not getting man in the middle attack with pretty high confidence right and this is a big problem for wallets and adapts that use this approach where you make someone sign a message and all of a sudden it can be forwarded to an attacker can forward that message make the user sign it on the phishing site and then pretend to be the user right this is really scary I think when you're trying to use that signature outcome to create new key material to encrypt stuff for example or generate new keys right because without the domain binding being any fishing site could just recover your encryption keys but if the wallet refuses to let like or gives a big scary warning if it notices it's the wrong domain then that actually really improves security properties so if your wallet or working on one or know someone working on one I would really love if you mentioned hey it'd be great if you supported sign in with ethereum because it's going to increase protections for your users and we are collaborating with the metamask team on adding this protection for all metamask users for example and what happens after signing with ethereum well we think we start simple and make something that just works for people and you know we've seen it take off with a lot of dapps using signing with ethereum and after that we think that there's a really strong link to decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials decentralized identifiers have a whole ecosystem of use cases there are a lot of companies Building open source software to work with decentralized identifiers you can look into that spec if you're curious and verifiable credentials or statements about reality our work with decentralized identifiers and ethereum addresses is defining a did method called did public key hash because most blockchain accounts including ethereum addresses are hashes of public keys so I call this Oprah Winfrey approach to distribution in which look under your seat you already have a did if you have an ethereum address we just defined a way to make all ethereum addresses valid dids and you can further Define signing methods so that you can issue credentials with them so you can imagine a decentralized social media Network that every time you click follow you're actually in the background signing a verifiable credential issuing the fact that you followed someone and they get a copy and you get a copy right and maybe there's a revocation list in there too in case you decide to unfollow them but with this you have a portable social media a collection of signed Json every sign Json represents a follower you have or someone you followed and you can take this with you to anywhere else and if you follow those verifiable credentials down to who signed it it's the actual end users right it's not the platform that you're entrusting as ultimate Authority so that's how we get to decentralize social media for followers for blog posts for you know likes these things can be represented off tune as verifiable credentials or on chain as transactions when you represent them off chain you can have much better control over your privacy and we can Define canonical ways to put them on chain as you want to disclose them to everyone another exciting use case with after signing with ethereum is letting the user's smart contract govern the user's Cloud infrastructure meaning that if you have a smart contract that defines a list of hosts that you say are okay to do something for you then off chain those hosts can recognize that list and maybe that's where your data storage is right maybe that's your storage locker look in the smart contract or my EMS name in the records I'm going to have the hosts that are authorized to be my data vaults and you might even be able to sign um permission slips for people to take over 20 your hosts signed by your ethereum account and maybe they can do something like upload a file or download a file this is the architecture used in our project called Kepler at Spruce and another thing that we're really excited about is we think that you're going to use keys for a lot of things I think sessions we might see uh we might see fewer cookie based sessions being used if we can have session Keys we can interpret a signing with ethereum message as a delegation to a femoral key in the Dom just as a session key that can be used to create transactions that can be used to issue verifiable credentials that can be used to access data anything that you would do with cookie checking now we could just have these transactions that work off chain right to services that can receive them so when we shift when we assume that the world is built on pki and everyone has a public has a key there's a lot that can shift in the infrastructure and also it's a huge opportunity to empower the user instead of trusting a central intermediary one Innovation that we've created at Spruce towards this is called Caprock which stands for capability rock rock is a kind of a nerdy term for understanding something as we understand signing with ethereum to be a delegation to privileges to a key to do stuff we've we think it's really important that the user has an opportunity to understand exactly what permissions they're delegating it's kind of like when you're linking your social media account to a different site and uh basically it's asking you what's okay to share and what's not well this interface is going to get more and more complex if you imagine that we live in the world where most of your stuff is stored in your own data fault that you have discretion over how do we make sure that a user has informed consent and they're actually able to um you know understand what they're actually sharing this is a huge problem like most people who read privacy policies or who like read the word privacy policy they think it means that you know the company is going to keep their data private but instead it talks about exactly how they're going to share their data right so how do we make sure that there is this holistic bridge between what's in the technical capability the real access control the permission slip that you're writing and a user's opportunity to understand what's going to be shared and what can't be right so this way you can use your ethereum account for a whole Suite of off-change services and designate access to other services but it only makes it it only works if the user can understand exactly what they're doing and that is going to be one of the toughest ux challenges to handle but one of the most important ones too So based on this I think we're going to sign in with ethereum to the key controlled Revolution if you're trying to get started login.xyz has documentation on how to integrate things you can follow Spruce on Twitter at Spruce ID and follow me on Twitter at wycd DD's my favorite Unix tool or connect with me on the coolest social media Network LinkedIn but that's kind of it I'm ready to talk about anything you want to answer questions Etc awesome thank you so much Wayne I appreciate the the chat here and and yeah I mean as I kind of mentioned at the beginning like we are on like the cusp of like this like really unique time where you know I think we like to your point like everybody has a did you look under your seats like it's all there um and it's time to finally use these in like really interesting ways um so I I think it's a really exciting time if anybody has any questions for Wayne as well feel free to drop them in the chat and I'll relay them here but maybe just kind of get kicked off here like um I think like commonly like when we think about like especially like verifiable credentials and things like that um basically at some point like when you go far enough down the stack uh you need to have trust somewhere right so like you know if I'm you know a student of Harvard or something and I want to like verify that like and have a credential on my my did that proves that you know I got a degree from Harvard which maybe is something people would want to have um at some point like down the list like you have to trust like Alice at Harvard who's issuing degrees to Bob um and and you know at some point there's there's something there so um you know given that's the case like like how do you think about like establishing those trusts like what should that be look like to be like as trust minimized as possible and like for those like actual credential people like those people who should be giving like actual credentials like Harvard like that's a really useful use case they should think about doing that like what are some of the best practices that they can uh employ to like be as trust minimized as possible uh in that stack yeah great questions um two separate ones that I'm going to tease out but the first one is um you're talking about trust anchors how do we know who to trust to begin with right like what what does bootstrapping this look like very timely I think on Monday There's a conference called rebooting the web of trust uh that is starting kicked off really interesting papers everything's open source and on GitHub there but basically a web of trust was kind of the traditional way to do this before we all Consolidated on um certificate authorities right there was something called spooky spki simple pki which worked like you shared a bunch of public keys and you didn't need a central Authority so it kind of if you squinted it it was kind of like web of trust right and I think that a really important point is that um it depends on what you're verifying like maybe you care about what a doctor says about your disease but you don't care about you know what your what Your chef says about your disease uh and uh so you have to care about like um you know who's issuing the statement well if it's an accredited institution like Harvard and there are existing trust Frameworks in place so for um for universities in particular there's a group called IMS Global and it's a Consortium of all the you know degradation agencies and they decide what a transcript looks like together so right now a lot of it's just paper world but if you move that digital to a trust framework you know you could rely on that to get started and in web 3 that's one critical role I see for uh centralized companies that have built a pretty strong brand if you trust that brand to make statements um for example um coinbase says this person has over you know two eth in their account right maybe you trust that from coinbase and then Dows I think are also really important for this too if raid Guild says they did a project then like maybe we you know trust that they completed it because they have a great reputation in the space for completing certain kinds of projects right and as other Dows specialize they might State claims over certain kinds of statements that they can make and I think that the brand for the issue sewer is really important to consider as part of it and that kind of leads into the other question you know as an issuer of these things what and trying to implement these credential Frameworks what should you think about well I think you I think it's really useful to think about it through this issue or holder and verify our model and usually the hardest part to bootstrap is uh the issuer but what makes the model work is that someone wants it to verify something right so if liquor store wants to verify your age so that or like that you're over 21 so you can buy liquor well that's the demand and who's going to say that who does the liquor store trust right so if you start from an issuer's perspective you can think about the data that you have that people would trust you to say as Harvard and that's probably a really broad scope of things and uh because Harvard is a strong brand maybe they can even reach outside of Academia a bit but that's probably you know where their bread and butter would be so if you're Dow working on like future of work stuff and you have like a collection of completed projects as anointed by the multi-sig well you can issue certificates of completion to people in fact you can even help preserve their privacy because you can cut a new credential to an uncorrelated ethereum address you can say yeah this person did a medium-sized job and it was successful and we're not going to tell you the address is involved there's like thousands of medium-sized jobs accomplished but you know that person can use that credential and access something else without necessarily revealing too much gotcha okay very cool yeah and I think that you're very very interesting to think about this because yeah I mean you have this sort of I never actually heard this term trust anchor before but it works really well for this concept and I'll take a look at some of the other stuff you mentioned there too um yeah I mean I mean you have this existing even in like the traditional paper world like if you think about it like your birth certificate is basically the trust anchor that sets up everything else right um and you know there's like a lot of like kind of interesting parallels there so it makes sense that there's already been some kind of work done in this space um even in the existing systems that we have yeah and what we're really excited about as we transition to the digital world for it um and there there are things to avoid too but um what could be the case is that um there was some mention in the previous talk about there's an interesting relationship between crypto and kyc right and potentially replacing kyc with something else that also reduces fraud and other things that we don't want and um well when you represent things digital it's a lot more inexpensive to do that so if you have a bunch of other facts about yourself that together have this same level of assurance as like a passport or something you know you don't even have to identify who you are then that could be very interesting to preserve privacy to increase user autonomy increase Equity some people have issues getting passports for example and if they need to access Services right what are other pieces of data that could convince someone to give them access to Services if it's digital it's a lot cheaper to think about those data how to represent them and how to present them yeah and more efficient more easily establish these things gotcha very cool um awesome okay well I don't want to take too much of your time I know we're already over a bit but yeah really appreciate you being here Wayne and thank you for watching us through that um and like I said yeah very very exciting time to be thinking about this tonight I guess there's even even more stuff to to watch next week uh in this regard as well so thanks so much for having me thank you for being here okay great um okay thank you and we are going to move on to our last stop in just a minute uh we're gonna go for a quick five minute break um and we're gonna be back at 4 15 PM Eastern which is in about five minutes as I mentioned um and we're going to be joined by uh Camilo Russo um from the defiant uh who's going to be talking about how ethereum is impacting creators and especially um how that's been affecting her life um as a as a producer of a new documentary that's coming up on the theories foundation so uh stick around with us uh we'll be back in about five minutes um and we're really excited to have Cami speaking at this event hey everybody uh excited to be back I hope you enjoyed some Lo-Fi beats during that break um and yeah really excited to say that uh we have Camille Russo with us uh who's going to be joining us in just a second um when I was thinking about putting together the summit you know one of the creek ways in which ethereum has had a huge impact and the key people that they have as creators and you know Camilla has been a Creator not only as a journalist but also in her work at the Defiance and also now as a producer of an exciting new documentary that's coming up or actually full exciting feature-like film that's coming up actually about the uh the creation of ethereum so um instead of making myself uh look like an idiot on stage I'll probably enjoy it I'll just invite Camilla up right away um to chat about this and and her work both of the documentary and how ethereum has been able to impact um the creation of it um so come on when you're ready feel free to share your videos share your audio and really excited to have you join us on stage all right uh hi is that this is working okay yeah everything's great okay cool um super excited to be here thank you thank you for inviting me uh thanks for the intro um yeah and uh it's it's really crazy that uh I'm seeing my book being turned into a movie so yeah excited to to chat about that awesome yeah I mean I think on on my side I was you know really inspired to hear uh you know a bit about um just the process of turning um you know from you know journalists to you know basically company startup Creator to then you know um no no book writer um and and now movie producer I think this like been a crazy Journey uh maybe it'd be great to kind of walk through a little bit on the the timelines of kind of how you just started out and just kind of getting into it um and then would love to kind of dive a little bit more into kind of the new the new stuff that you've been working on but I think it'd be great to just for everybody to recognize how quick that Journey was for you um to go and just kind of get a sense of those uh those milestones for you yeah sure um so my my background you know I uh I'm a I'm a journalist I started my career well in a news we bring Chile but then they came to the US and was at Bloomberg news for for eight years covering all sorts of markets um it was based in in Argentina and Spain and in New York where I'm at now and my final two years at Bloomberg were focused on crypto I actually kind of wrote my first crypto story in 2013 in Argentina about kind of this growing Bitcoin Community there but was able to really focus day to day in kind of the crypto beat starting in 2017 and then covering kind of uh all the craziness of that time everything was really boring in comparison and decided you know I would just stay in crypto and and that's where kind of the idea of the book came about so this was like end of 2017 I had always wanted to write a book and I you know covering crypto it was like there has to be a book idea here somewhere and um I started thinking about what the biggest stories in the space were and it was pretty clear that that was ethereum that there was uh there was a gap there in that there were no books on ethereum at the time or at least notebooks kind of telling the story of how ethereum had come to be how it was founded and created and so I decided to take that on and and that's kind of how the book idea came about and luckily I found a publisher um harpercollins interested in seeing it come to life and um and then you know started working uh on on the book all through 2018 and and left Bloomberg in January of 2019 to finish writing the infinite machine and because you know I had been kind of at the same spot for too long for eight years I decided I wanted to be an independent writer um and then you know that kind of evolved into just the idea of the defiant yeah so like the infinite machine and the defined are pretty kind of tied uh because it was researching for the infinite machine that you know I was like following the ethereum community around like all all the hackathons all the equivalent hackathons um conferences and just like was seeing all this uh Innovation coming from the ethereum community uh and especially D5 emerging and I realized like it was super undercover like to medify in 2018 was by far the most interesting thing happening in crypto and so I decided to start a T5 Focus newsletter with the defined in June of 2018 and yeah that that came that really stemmed from my research of of the infinite machine so that's kind of how you know everything uh came together amazing and I think you know the timing of that should be should be noted that like you know I think uh you know to recognize that D5 was you know such an important part of this ecosystem um I think in a lot of ways like you know early right like I think 2020 is like when D5 summer hit and it was you know absolutely chaos and you know a lot of people were you know it was just like an amazing period of like you know explosion of new things happening in D5 but you know to have noticed that a year early and then you know be I think in the right position and have built the brand over that that year in between to be able to like really report on everything that was happening in a really like measured way I think was you know something that the ecosystem really needed uh in in summer 2020 and of course Beyond um but yeah I mean it was uh amazing to have you be a part of that and very helpful I think for these parts yeah I'm glad I I really hope so like my my goal with the defiant was to to bring the just like high quality objective on by highest reporting that I had learned at Bloomberg bring that into crypto and and just like just focus it on specifically Finance which you know I think there are some great crypto media and Publications out there you know coin desk the blog um they do great work but I I I I was seeing kind of this missing space of just like Finance focused uh information and D5 focused information uh that was really just like had really high standards um so yeah that's that's what we've been trying to do at the Define really well I think you've been very successful in doing so yeah very exciting to see that happen and then as you were sort of kind of you know in a way of doing both of these as you mentioned they're very kind of interrelated uh both the book and the Defiance like um I guess kind of curious like as you were going through and and chatting with people um and interviewing and meeting the community and as you mentioned um for for kind of working towards this book like I guess like what comes to mind is like maybe a story or an anecdote or something that you learned like as you were doing this that like you hadn't heard before that was like really unexpected that like um either was like really positive or really negative I don't know however you want to take it um but I guess like really curious like what was like a really cool story that you had heard um that you hadn't heard before um while you're kind of researching for for the book um uh that's that's that's so hard I I think you know I I did like over 100 interviews uh for for the book so um let's see um like to me like when I was researching uh for the infinite machine a lot of just like the ethereum founding story um I I had no idea like I I came into this uh pretty you know like uh knowing of course about about Vitality like knowing uh just like what an exceptional and just you know charismatic person he is and I I thought you know like there's this really great character that can drive the story um and I knew some about kind of the other uh co-founders at the time like I had interviewed Charles hoskinson for you know at Bloomberg um but I really didn't know about like all the the drama uh that happened in ethereum in in its early days um and you know as a writer that I was like really happy to to see that was the case um well Source material right yeah so I I guess like it you know these things are well known now but at the time you know 2018 when when I started researching for this I hadn't seen this written anywhere you know kind of this uh this tension between ethereum being a for-profit company and a non-profit a foundation The Fallout with kind of different factions between Founders kind of um you know this uh what what I call in in my book this kind of red wedding situation you know um all of that tension and yeah I I thought was so so interesting and kind of you know at the core it really spoke to just the values that later made ethereum what it is you know the the fact that uh this vision for a non-profit Foundation this you know open protocol uh that that um vision for ethereum was what finally kind of won out uh was of course what has uh driven um unshaped uh the network and the community to be what it is today it's a it's amazing to hear yeah and definitely like I imagine that that sort of um I guess kind of that you know pivotal thing at the at the foundation story at the beginning um it does make for a an interesting opportunity to like you know write and be able to like tell that story and that kind of foundation Journey a little bit of like a hero's quest in some way um yeah I I think like you know just to kind of pause and reflect a little bit on that like the community is you know largely built up of like at least at the beginning of you know kind of idealists but you know largely just people who you know really excited about technology and you know often like weren't writers I think right and I think like this in a way like is a testament to like the importance of like having writers in the space to be able to like go back and like tell those stories because like at some point like and that that feels like now a long time ago the kind of foundation story but like at some point like the story of like the merge for instance will need to be told in a much more cohesive like really easy way to read and it's so fresh and so new right now um but it you know of course that's going to be like a big kind of another big kind of pivotal moment in the ethereum story um so yeah I think just a you know I guess a shout out to to all writers not just to you in the space but just uh you know being able to to tell that story for uh people who I would say are not often too worried about telling that story themselves um and I think it's still you know an important story to be told um kind of maybe transitioning from the book to um to now your kind of new project that you're working on that you announced recently um which is the movie um or the adaptation of that book uh I guess maybe it'd be cool to actually kind of hear a little bit more about kind of just how did that even start like how do you uh like I have no idea how to turn I have no idea how to write a book I have no idea how to turn a book into a movie either um so I guess like how does that Journey even start for you and and where did that uh where did that begin yeah so um I mean it's been pretty crazy you know I didn't really expect a my book to be turned into a movie I mean I could like only dream of that happening and now that it is it's really crazy so uh basically you know I we published a book in July of 2020 and about you know a few months after that um I started getting some you know inquiries from a couple of um you know movie studios about the rights of of my blog so so how how it works is that um the the authors uh the author usually keeps owns the rights to sell their their books to uh uh producers who want to turn uh you know that that book into into a film and and so I I held those rights and so I was getting inquiries as to you know potentially selling them to different uh money movie studios and producers um so I had some initial conversations um and uh and you know it was fine but it was like I didn't get a sense of uh these uh groups having like a real understanding of you know what crypto was about or just didn't see kind of a a commitment to actually you know making it happen like my agent told me of like all the movies that get sold maybe like one percent actually get turned into a movie so it's like you know movie studios kind of like buy these uh this right as like an option so it's like okay maybe we will like one day take this and turn this into a movie but it's not a sure thing that if you sell your rights your your book will actually be shown on screen and so that was like really hard for me to decide it's like okay do I give this up and and maybe you know lose the an actual chance of seeing this on screen um and then there this uh spain-based Production Studio uh reached out to me um and through and it was through uh someone who uh was like actually in crypto like he has to this day like Francisco Gordillo has a a hedge fund that invests in the space and he's been kind of around since like 2014 like really kind of early on involved in crypto so that was a really good sign to me it's like okay they they get it they're like you know literally invested in in the space um and and they were also uh they also offered to make me a part of production so they offered me an executive producer role uh in in the movie so even though you know they weren't like like a Hollywood uh Studio I decided to go with them because I I saw just like a bigger chance of my book actually making it and to be to be a movie and because I would be more involved in in production so that's how how that happened um still you know I I was really clear with them like okay I'll go with you guys but I still want uh this movie to be like like a Hollywood movie uh like I want this to be shown like all over uh all over the world like it's it like I wrote this book for a mainstream audience and for this story to reach everyone and so I want the movie to have like that same kind of impact so like the the big like like the the vision for this movie is for it to be like the social network but for crypto so like you know I dramatized story that's that's meant to be like a blockbuster is is kind of the the big dream so that's that's what we're going for amazing and I I guess that has to be like a very like uh like I think like a very emotional journey I would imagine because like the book I'm guessing is like you know you put so much work into that that you know it must feel like in a way like you know a little bit of like a piece of you right into then kind of license that out to somebody else where maybe you're not totally sure exactly like how they'll respect that the amount of work that you put into it honestly um especially in the case where like you said I didn't know that like you know only one percent of of these things get uh get often turned into movies um these agreements so yeah I I imagine that must have been quite a an emotional journey to kind of go through and I I like really happy to hear that you found somebody that you can trust and also that you're you're part of the movie I think in a lot of ways too right as a producer um maybe we were speaking to like what kind of influence and maybe kind of impact you get to have as a producer because I'm I'm actually personally not too familiar either yeah um so so that's uh that's a good question because I didn't I had no idea about this about the film world and but executive producer sounds like like okay like that should be at the top but it really isn't it's like it sounds very fancy yeah yeah but it's um it's it's really kind of when you're the producer and then then you actually have like Hands-On influence on on how things are are made um executive producers are more like like an advisor kind of role um so executive producers usually kind of help with uh bringing in um investors or bringing in kind of their their Network you know it's like okay maybe they're they're really well connected with with with actors and they can get a good cast or maybe they're well connected with investors or you know it's really like more of an advisor roller or maybe they they can just like weigh in on on the script which of course like I want to do um but it's not like a like I don't get like um like a real say actually on on how the movie gets made but I do at least get a get a chance to kind of look behind the scenes at how it is getting made so I I I'd rather take that but nothing so um so yeah what it does is like I can be involved and I am involved in in in the funding uh of the movie and so we can get into that you know how yeah I yeah I I wanted to bring in nfts um and then I luckily get to at least look at the script and and kind of give my opinion although I am not kind of directly involved in in writing it yeah that makes sense gotcha so yeah everything every time I said producers so far I suppose I should have said executive producer because the fancier title means advisor instead of the actual yeah got it okay cool uh awesome learn something new every day um yeah I mean that's a perfect segue I mean I think you know one of the reasons why I in particular thought about having you on was um was was part of that that kind of fundraising process or um even mobilizing the community that you've been able to build over the years um to be a part of this movie so yeah maybe it makes uh I think totally makes sense to segue into uh yeah talking a little bit more about that like you know how as you mentioned did you use kind of nfts and and the community that you built over the years to to be a part of this this movie um and be part of that Journey with you yeah so when we started having kind of the first conversations about funding um you know I immediately thought we should uh we should do this with nfts uh you know like this is gonna be the first a feature film about ethereum um we should bring in the ethereum community and and bring in ethereum kind of Technology somehow into the production process and nfts seem like a good fit so um you know the the other producers agreed and we started to brainstorm on how this nft project would actually work so that's kind of the Genesis of that awesome and then yeah can you maybe speak more to like maybe even just the thought process about that I know that you know over the last couple of years like um a lot of creators like individual creators have have basically gone through this exact Mental Math of just sort of like thinking about how they can you know get their work into more of the hands of people that uh that support them and and do so in a more direct fashion using nfts using blockchain using different like um Primitives to kind of do that um yeah maybe even diving into a little bit more about the kind of the different kind of options or different ways that that people could help be a part of it through the the nfts that you were offering yeah um so so when we started thinking about um the nft side of of like the movie the first thing was like um we we want these nfts to be a way to involve the ethereum community into the production process so by giving these tokens some some sort of utility or kind of reward attached to them so what we decided is that we would treat these tokens as kind of backstage passes into production and so um there's like different Easter eggs attached to these nfts so you know some of them will give you um the ability to to be named in in the credits uh of the movie so you know your name appears at the end um some of them give you an invite to a to the premiere of the film others give you um make you an extra there's like 20 nfts that allow you to be an extra in the movie and yeah and and what else oh and there's also like an invitation to visit like a shooting location uh so that was kind of our way of just like involving contributors to to the like the funding process into production um I'll say that um ideally uh the kind of the obvious and right way I think to do this would have been to uh share kind of the royalties an actual kind of equity in the film with nft holders uh of course kind of discussing that uh with lawyers it was like impractical to do I am like yeah nobody wants to go to jail but um you know it's this situation we're in with kind of like lack of regulatory Clarity that we have to just like be careful uh how we do things and so you know we we found this way of of like adding value to to nfts and without having to just you know step into kind of murky regulatory waters you know um so that's kind of on on the on the Utility side and then on kind of the actual um you know just like visual aspect like the design aspect uh it's one of my favorite things about the project so um you know we we said we decided on kind of this is the utility and then and I I reached out to uh to one of the the the the people who had been involved in in the creation of the ethereum logo and I thought you know it'd be really cool if this guy also designs our nfts and then it happened that he is involved in a group of artists in Cuba and like he he organizes uh uh this uh this group of artists together with a professor at the University of Havana and they make sure that these artists are able to um to sell their work in kind of like a global market via nfts and I thought it was an amazing project so I said you know why not bring in this group of artists to to to make uh the visual kind of side of our project and then we just decided to open up uh that that process to any artist but but especially artists in emerging Nations um so you know you know this is just like very close to me like I'm originally from from Chile I lived a long time in Argentina and I really do believe that crypto has the the opportunity to actually change lives in in emerging Nations um you know at Mika a bigger impact like I I like of course like in in developed Nations uh crypto has the opportunity to like upend the financial system and make it much more efficient and and also be there be more inclusive but for countries where you know you really have a deeply devalued currency where you have currency controls where uh you have a a extremely corrupt government um that's where crypto can make an even bigger impact so I just wanted to bring in artists from from those areas and and regions of the world um and provide kind of a platform for them so so we opened up the the process for uh for any artists to to apply um and we ended up with a group of 36 artists from Cuba Argentina team Venezuela Kenya India and and a few other places and they designed the collection which is um each artist designed 10 versions of the ethereum logo and then we divided that into like mosaics and then like programmatically combined these tiles and so the result is like a really cool just like explosion of ethereum it's like really colorful and different textures and Styles um and it's just really cool so really happy with how that turned out so basically I I took a look at them after um I saw you chat about this the first time and ended together absolutely beautiful I think this mosaics of just explosions like you said of colors and shapes and everything it's they're really beautiful so that that's awesome and I think like one other thing that's like worth noting is that I just realized like I think you've been doing interesting stuff with nfts for for actually a while like I remember one of the first nfts I got aside from like a crypto Kitty way back when was when I pre-purchased uh your your book in 2020. and you did these kind of voice notes for everybody and minted those as nfps um and I wrote that was the first time I ever realized that an entity could be more than just like a picture I didn't realize it could be also yeah so that was like a really cool unlock for me back then too um and and yeah cool kind of like full circle there yeah you're right I I kind of like even forget that that I did that I did this kind of proof of pre-order it was awesome yeah yeah you're right it was really cool um awesome well I don't want to take up too much more of your time I know that we're at the kind of scheduled time here but um well thank you so much for for being a part of this I'd love to just give you a second if you can shout out where we can learn more about the movie if there's any questions that's uh that's like a resource for us to learn as we kind of wait for it to it's revealed but uh yeah where should we turn to to hear more about that movie yeah thanks for giving me the the opportunity to share um so we have like our website is uh the infinity machinemovie.com um and Twitter I guess is uh the other best place at eath movie and then you're you'll find links to the Discord as well amazing okay well thank you so much I cannot wait to watch the movie um and thank you so much for being a part of this um super excited and uh yeah thank you so much and I think that actually brings us to the end of our day today um so I'll just kind of quickly share thanks again Camilla for your time um and I just want to kind of give a quick overview for everybody else uh as a big thank you for being a part of this um of course if you're part of the hackathon that is going on right now I do want to note that submissions are due um on Sunday at 3 P.M so uh get your uh your pencils going and get your submissions in uh you can start now submissions are open um and yeah otherwise Happy hacking and thank you so much for everybody for being a part of this nice uh thanks uh and also good luck to everyone participating in the hackathon bye thanks Gary see you everybody
