okay hi everybody welcome to the back to the future of fixed interest rate workshop uh here we have guillaume and zephram from 88 mph and they're gonna be running this workshop today uh you guys can take it away thanks for the introduction so hey everyone uh thanks for joining my name is guillaume mcfly uh i'm a co-founder of attend ph and i'm leading everything related to community marketing design stuff project development and we have zephron also with us they're from if you want to introduce yourself yeah uh hello everyone i am zephrem i'm co-founder of mph and i'm also the developer so like if you have any technical questions feel free to ask me yep so guys we will make a quick product too of 88 mph what you currently have on mainnet so we are talking of mainnet uh we are referring to mainnet as v2 um but we are here to talk mainly about our upcoming v3 the smart contract are already ready into our github repo sub graph is ready so we will talk mainly about that but if you want to have a real product working on mynet we will go on the v2 and after i will show you quickly the v3 uh we will present you the price what you can build with 88 ph v3 so some product ids use cases and after the forum will uh present you like a deeper uh overview of new smart contracts i will share my screen and will go directly on my browser so as i was mentioning this is the v2 available on 88mph.app you can see on my screen that you have different tabs where you are you can find the product so we have the main product 88 mph is a fixed interest rate protocol so you are using 88 mph mainly to get a fixed yield on your stablecoin or crypto like a different rapid version of bitcoin from crv and other stuff like that we are supporting dye of course usdc and you get a fixed yield on this uh asset according to the maturity you want so we are supporting uh maturity between seven days and one year so it's up to you to find uh the correct duration you want and the yield we are offering is fixed terms uh so for example let's say right now you want to deposit die uh you can have 2.9 fixed interest rate on your diet for let's say one year and on top of that you get some mph api so mphpy is just a rewards that we offer you to use the platform on top of that what you can do with your mph you can stake them so we have a staking pool uh where we share 100 of protocol revenue with the stakeholders so basically you just take your mph and your cache dividend and the other parts i will present you directly that on the v3 so i will go to my local host and i will show you that so this is the new version of 808 mph we are not here to talk about front-end uh but just a quick tour of what you will find on mainnet in a few days um this is the part where i was mentioning you can get fixed interest rates so same thing you can deposit die or a different version of the bitcoin and you get a fixed interest rate on top of that and as always you get the mph keywords for using the platform so some novelties uh between v2 and v3 we wanted to improve the user experience for end users but also for developers so the core focus for the v3 was to be as easy to build on it as it is to build on rv or compounds so if you plan to use 88 mph for your for hackmon money it would be fairly easy to integrate so that was the core focus for us um that means for the end user that there is also some improvements mainly for the fixed interest rate users they will have more flexibility related to the way they manage their uh deposits so you will be able to top up your deposit you will be able to roll over your deposit um also withdraw early as it is on v2 um the the other main focus we wanted is removing of the the money flow if i can say like that regarding the mph rewards because we were requesting people to pay back a certain amount when they wanted to withdraw at maturity their deposit so for example you see here i have a die deposit it will be mature in approximately 300 days so when i will withdraw that uh i will if we were just staying on v2 i will need to pay back a certain amount of mph rewards with v3 we get ride of that so you don't need to pay back anything else you just give them ph rewards we you got initially when you deposited and with this mph rewards what you can do is uh basically stake your mph directly here to get x and ph so that's about so that's the novelty also with the vfr ph uh you take mph for having a representation of your stake mph with x and ph so it's auto compounding you can do other stuff with your x and ph you can there is different use cases you can have with other protocol but i won't go in these details right now just quickly rewarding the way we share the revenue with the protocol stakers get a hundred percent of the revenue we get from harvesting uh governance token uh for example the ave token the compound token of the harvest token farm token uh also we have a fee applied to the fixed interest we paid out to our depositors so we take ten percent of it so also that uh platform fee go directly in the pockets of the mph stakeholders and the last product so we went through the fixed interest rate products you deposit crypto you deposit stable coin you earn fixed interest rates and mph rewards with that mph reward you can stake them to get x and ph so basically it's a dividend you get protocol earnings and the last big part of big features of 88 mph v3 is the yield feature so the yield features allow us to de-risk 88 mph by allowing our users to speculate on future what does that mean um when someone deposits stablecoin into 88 and ph they are basically creating a deficit uh by we are promising them a fixed interest rate so this fixed interest rate need to be secured by someone somewhere so somewhere is 88 ph and this create a deficit in each pool where they are depositing so to be sure that at the end of the day when someone want to withdraw their principle plus the fixed interest earned so far they can do that we introduced the yield token and this yield token is basically a year c20 that you can buy and it allows you to um speculate and earn the interest of the deposits of 80 10 ph so at the end of the day for let's say you can basically speculate be long on the market right on compound or rv with a fraction of the capital needed to earn uh the interest on this amount of capital so let's say you have um you have like uh 10 die worth of uh yield token this yield can allow you to earn on a certain amount of deposits of 88 mph so let's say 100 die so you are speculating on the yield of this 100 die and you earn that amount of interest on this principle so at the end of the day you don't need much to an interest on a lot of capital so it's really a speculative tool but really interesting to in terms of capital efficiency and also in terms of opportunity so last thing i wanted to say before going into the price presentation uh you you can run this version directly on your computer by going directly on our github repo in the v3 branch so you will be able to see what i'm showing you right now so um quick overview of the bone the price uh we are offering on at hackmoney uh we have the first price is a 4000 usdc and the runner up the second place is with 1500 usdc plus we have a pool price of 2000 usdc so if you decide to don't build directly a product focused only on 88 mph but you want to use some components of 88 mph you can get a certain percentage of this pool price of 2 000 usdc if you decide to build something really cool on top of 80 10 ph and 88 mph is the car product under the hood you can earn up to 4000 usdc and if you have a runner up it's 1 500 usdc um and the things we are looking for with the price and what we want to incentivize people building is uh stuff that can at least simplify the user experience for people like retailers who want to um really easily fixed interest rates feeling secure doing it without the complexity you can have dealing with different components of what we currently have on v3 but something the other thing we are really looking for is and maybe it's the most important part is um leveraging 88 mph um fixed fixed interest rate bonds so what we have in um part and the mph rewards also and creating something that can generate yield for over protocol or a cool way to manage governance treasury uh generating some strategy in terms of investment asset management but can generate a fixed income for over protocol so that's also something interesting and there is a lot of discussion happening right now on twitter and on different communities for managing this kind of governance treasury so 8018 phk player can play a role there for sure um other cool stuff we are looking for is structured products so what is a structured product uh there is different frag flavor of it but the most obvious one is you are able to guarantee uh the capital the initial capital you are putting in a structured product and you are exposed to upside of some assets so for example you can mix a fixed product of 88 mph uh for example one of our bonds like let's say you are uh using a die bond uh with uh an option and so you are able to guarantee the capital with the bond and you expose the user of the structured product uh to the upside of something like an option of just a random asset like e4 something simple like a community that's really something cool uh it's a huge market in the traditional finance there is some development happening right now in d5 but it's still an early stage ecosystem so there is a lot of opportunity with that uh the other things we can do uh is uh using the bonds let's say right now you see on my account here i have a bond in die earning me fixed interest rate with nine thousand uh dollar worth of die in that deposits so imagine i'm able to take that deposit and put it somewhere into another another protocol and use that as a collateral for borrowing more dye and re-deposit directly in hph so you are improving a lot the capital efficiency of atgm ph by doing that it's really something that we are looking for also um there is good product to build on top of that for sure um and other things uh let's say a bit more uh less innovative but really useful is improving the way people are feeling about 8018 ph so basically you can think about 80 10 ph as a bank a defy bank where you deposit money you earn interest what people want but when they use this kind of product they want to trust it they want to be sure that at the end of the day they will get back their money place and try so we need to build trust we need to build their risking uh tool so currently there is the yield uh token that is the main purpose of it is they're risking the protocol by allowing someone else to buy the depth of the system and speculating on the floating race so that's one layer of their risking but there is other cool stuff to build to there is the protocol or like a safety module leveraging the stakers to uh generate the protocol a bit like ave is doing there's some stuff like that or over loss reserve or insurance fund directly belonging to 80 mph so feel free to to to brainstorm about that with your team uh and don't hesitate to ask us questions regarding oh all of that can can be built um i will end over the the the workshop to the front uh if you want to share your screen to show us uh some stuff related to the v3 yeah uh let me just go over uh the developer documentation we have and just a general overview of where to get started sure uh so this is uh our smart contract repo uh make sure you're on the v3 branch so that you're not working on our uh current version uh but yeah uh our readme should give you a good uh general overview of like the smart contract architecture and how uh how all the actions that users would make work so and we also have instructions for how to get started of on your local machine uh and uh here let me just show you the the interest smart contract which is uh the main smart contract that you will be uh interacting with uh this is where users uh can deposit their funds to get a fixed interest rate withdraw their money and where they where other users could buy yield tokens uh as you can see uh we have some uh documentation for all the functions and here at the top we have uh all of the like uh the state changing functions listed so you have you know deposit for instance you just specify the amount of tokens you want to deposit and uh when you want the deposit to be mature and that's basically it you just make one uh contract call as gammon said uh our focus in v3 is to make the developer experience really uh simple and you can similarly you can pop up your deposit you can roll over your deposit to a new maturation uh you can of course you know withdraw your funds or uh this is for buying the eo tokens and yeah and there are also a bunch of getter functions that you can use to uh fetch uh info about your deposits and uh finally let me just show you uh our uh sub graph so we we use our sub graph extensively in our front end to uh easily and efficiently fetch information about the user deposits about the pools and so on and this is uh our v3 branch again and uh this is the graphql schema for all of the objects and as you can see it's we have an entity for the pools where you can see the users and some general information you can fetch entities of users and their statistics and of course you can fetch information about individual deposits and so on and so forth and yeah i think that's that's all you need to know to get started developing on adm mph yep so just to confirm with you that from all of that is available publicly into our github repo just check the v3 branch on each ripple so we have a repo for the smart contracts and the repo for the draft right yeah it's all public yep cool so i i hope guys this is clear for you uh related to where to find things how things work like i suppose like you will have a lot of questions regarding like some specifics some details related to the sub graph of the different function of a smart contract so don't hesitate to jump directly into our discord or the if global discord we have a sponsored channel there where we'll be super active in the following days and weeks to answer all your questions um i just saw that we have some questions in the chat on zoom um do you want to take one that is uh maybe you would be happy to answer that one they're from uh uh yeah what is the difference uh the difference with element finance 88 mph vsus yeah i can i can answer that uh so as far as i understand element finance is all about separating the yield from the collateral uh so it's really uh simple like you just take funds stored in for instance wire and you tokenize the yield that's earned on your uh on your collateral from your collateral itself uh and one of the applications of element finance is to provide a fixed yield uh to let you earn a fixed yield on your funds uh the difference is in the architecture sorry in the architecture we have the risk models and the the implementation uh like we're two different products trying to do like similar things and the like the main difference of element finance is that they require the usage of a liquidity pool and an auto an automated market maker in order for them to be able to provide a fixed interest rate so basically like you would uh split your uh funds into your collateral and yield tokens and sell the yield tokens on an amm and the amount you sell for is basically going to be your fixed yield uh whereas in 80 mph uh we don't require the usage of an amn at all our focus is solely on providing a fixed interest rate and that gives us uh some advantages for instance uh uh on element if you uh are trying to get a fake field on a large sum of money uh then you would uh suffer slippage because they're using an amm to provide the fixed seal and you also need a really deep liquidity pool so that you know uh you can actually get like an okay rate from them uh whereas in admph well we use our interest rate oracle to determine uh how much of a fixed rate to offer to our users and we use a completely different approach to actually offer that uh fixed interest rate mainly through uh the pooled risk model and through selling uh the 80 mph uh yo tokens and yeah so i hope that answers your question yep um and the one uh from uh uh king of china uh do you return the dollar amount of original kind amount so if i understand correctly your question when you deposit let's say die you are earning the interest in die so you deposit btc or btc for example you will receive your interest plus the principal initial capital in obtc so each pool is uh you earn interest with the underlying assets and for the stakers they are on x and ph so we are distributing the the amount uh the yield in x and ph but we are not minting x and ph uh the from nothing we are just converting if i can say like that the protocol fee and whatever we are based on other protocol like comp farm the staked version of ave we buy back then ph on the market and we distribute it in x and ph um so i hope it clear your mind regarding that we are supporting as i said different assets we are we are planning to launch more pools with v3 uh with different protocols um mainly we are supporting right now compound ave harvest and wire under the hood but we plan to open more more pool uh in the coming weeks uh mainly with cream rb protocol also uh so stay tuned with that um [Music] yeah that is that from do you think we need to mention something else related to the price or some stuff related to the what can be built with it uh no i think we covered everything uh you mentioned the structure products right yep yep so tomorrow if if you want to have like a [Music] an overview of what we are currently cooking with v3 the way we are seeing the scaling solution the way we want to scale also 88 mph on layer 2 or different side chain tomorrow we have a community called with a phantom foundation and zk sync directly on our discord so if you want to jump directly in the community called tomorrow it's at 1 pm eastern time so feel free to join us and if you have questions related to hack money and the way you can build stuff don't hesitate to to join us tomorrow okay thank you guys so much uh thank you to 88 mph also for sponsoring hack money this year again if you guys have any questions hit them up in the discord and yeah thank you guys for coming to the workshop and we're hosting bye
