foreign [Music] hey everyone my name is Arnold and I'm a full-time research analyst at the Block so today I'll be giving a very short presentation about the overview of developed landscape so a quick introduction of myself right um I'm a full-time research analyst at the Block and I focus mainly on researching about blockchain scaling Solutions I have a background in chemical engineering at the Technological University in Singapore and for those of you who are interested you can reach me via email you know if you have any questions or you would just like to Simply connect so uh on today's agenda we are going to start with a recap on Roll-Ups which I think is something that you know most of you guys in the audience will already know uh but because of the Divergence in the roll-up landscape I think it is a great time to just go back to the definitions and how we classify them and then I'll move on to the current state of roll ups where I cover a handful of relevant metrics before ending off with the future of roll ups you know where I give my opinions on how I think Roll-Ups might develop in the future so without further Ado we can begin with recap on roll ups so I said earlier that we should Define what a roll up is because I think the idea of a ruler is starting to you know be used as a common password in the scaling domain but uh but you know a roll-up at its core right should at the very least be able to abstract computation from the base layer while simultaneously deriving the security from that very same layer and as we begin to see variations of Roll-Ups ranging from data availability modes to enshrine Roll-Ups and even you know Roll-Ups as a service software starting to appear I think it is important to remember the necessary features that rollouts are supposed to have there are two main types of Roll-Ups right optimistic and zero knowledge Roll-Ups which uses frog proofs and validity proofs uh respectively uh they are to submit to be submitted on the base layer for them to be counted as a Roll-Up right so with that you know aside this table here shows a quick overview of the existing Roll-Ups in the space today and how we can classify them so you know the top half we have what we Define as a traditional rollout right which are solutions that use on-chain data availability and then we also start to see more varieties more Alternatives such as validiums and plasma chains that uh you know can uh they are commonly referred together as layer tools together with rollups but validiums and plasma chains they actually use off-check data availability so you know with the whole concept of data availability abstraction coming in it has kind of blurred the lines for layer 2 Solutions but I think this table pretty much sums it up you know gives the clarity that we need on how we can Define and differentiate the different scaling Solutions today so moving on to the main part of the presentation we're gonna be looking at the current state of roll ups we start off first by looking at the total value lot or tvl overlaps today and I think one of the encouraging signs of growth in the rural of space is the fact that tvl has actually increased over 114 percent amidst the bear markets over the past six months where it actually grew from 4.1 billion in tvl to up to 8.8 billion however you know we should know that part of this search was actually due to the arbitrary airdrop as can be seen by the sharp uptick in March right after the arbitrum or after arbitrum airdropist token right another interesting fact about TV the TV out here is that 86 of all TV house across roll ups are actually found more optimistic Roll-Ups and this can actually be attributed you know namely to the ease of uh deployment as well as convenience of the user experience on optimistic rollups and that can onboard and retain users a lot more effectively than ZK rollups uh additionally we also know that you know the four domestic rollups as seen in the previous slide they actually have launched their own native tokens to incentivize liquidity in their own respective ecosystem so naturally this helps them you know capture a larger market share of the entire roll-up domain now if we were to look at the daily number of transactions on Roll-Ups because you know it provides a proxy for the adoption uh we notice it has actually grown by over 153 percent over the past six months uh comparatively to the number of transactions on ethereum which has only grown by 44 uh this means to say you know that Roll-Ups are actually starting to account for more on-chain activity than on ethereum and one of the really encouraging signs here is the fact that optimistic rollups are now processing more uh daily transactions combined and ethereum at least over the past three months ever since the arbitrum airdrop and although this figure has you know fallen off since the air drop height I would say that generally Roll-Ups are still showing signs of gaining significant Traction in terms of adoption because we can see that uh although the the hype has passed the overall transaction growth is still generally on a slight uptrend especially for uh both optimistic rollups and ZK roll ups so the next metric here that is uh highly relevant is the amount of gas right that Roll-Ups consume because essentially the gas that they consume is an indicator of how much block space that they are actually taking up on ethereum right so as adoption on Roll-Ups increase uh we should also see a corresponding increase in the gas consumption on ethereum and I think you know from the charts here we can see that you know both optimistic rollups and ZK rollups they consume comparable magnitudes of gas and that is a pretty peculiar namely because uh ZK Roll-Ups are you know touted to scale ethereum a lot more efficiently than optimistic Roll-Ups right so you know where is the advantage here uh it should be noted right that this advantage or the ZK Roll-Ups have over optimistic overlapse is only really significant at high transaction volumes which is not really present today right because uh ZK Roll-Ups only start to show that kind of scaling uh when uh there are more transactions being compressed into a single proof but at low transaction volumes the main bulk of the gas consumption actually comes from uh you know the transaction data right so uh in March we can see that there's actually a huge spike in the gas consumed by ZK relapse this is partly due to the Civil activity on Roll-Ups such as ZK roll ups such such as stapnet and suitcasing era which have yet to launch a token and a lot of these civil actors are you know go into these roll ups because uh they are transacting on them in expectation of a potential uh airtron in the future right uh and from the chat we can see that Valley games on the other hand consume far less gas than both types of Roll-Ups so Vanadium is a type of scaling solution that uses off-chain data availability and this also demonstrates right the impact of Hosting transaction data on chain uh on a Roll-Ups gas consumption and that I think is why you know they're starting we're starting to see a market for alternative Data Solutions and the next metric here that I think you know would interest some of the uh viewers is the revenue of uh optimistic rollups the reason why we're looking at revenue of Optimus develops here is because uh the revenue for them is public data so it's much easier to get an accurate count of this data and here we can see you know optimistic works are generating millions in Revenue every month right uh just so you know the this revenue is calculated by taking the amount of gas expenditure that is uh spent on the layer two right uh we see arbitrum and optimism generating over 4.6 and 2.7 million in average monthly revenue and these figures are continuing to Trend upwards even after the arbitrary air drop in March even after the recent optimism token unlock and even amidst you know the overall bearish crypto Market sentiment right so this actually indicates the relative like Independence for the demand of block space with respect to the general crypto markets uh something that is interesting here would be the fact that you know both Matthews and Boba they appear to have fallen off and diverging in terms of their growth Trends uh and this shows how you know optimistic Roll-Ups even though uh you know they offer similar user experience similar services but they are not all the same right and there are various factors that can account for this such as you know first movie advantage trade-offs and security as well as the depth of liquidity in the ecosystem which can significantly impact the adoption right basically launching a roll-up doesn't guarantee that you will find adoption right uh it's starting to seem like almost like uh it's like a winner takes all kind of situation but obviously uh this can change over time and it's like it's just accounting for the guest that is picked by uh Roll-Ups on ethereum right for posting batches of transaction and transaction data uh and we can see that you know most Roll-Ups are still profitable in including Boba and methods right uh we see optimism and arbitrary generating 2.7 and 4.5 million in average monthly profits right and uh mobile and methods are also relatively profitable uh obviously you know this analysis isn't perfect because it neglects the cost of running a sequencer node which uh you know may or may not be trivial uh but this profits are also calculated in US Dollars whereas you know the actual currency being used is ether which means to say that uh you know these profits uh can fluctuate depending on when they choose to sell The Ether for US dollars right and then we're gonna move to the third and final segment of the presentation where I give my opinion on uh where we might see the future of Roll-Ups gravitate towards adding the first notable development here would be data availability abstraction right it's a pretty hot topic that uh has been talked about uh we see Solutions such as Celestia Avail previously known as a polygon available right uh as well as Arbitron any trust starting to surface and see certain levels of adoption right these Solutions offer an alternative environment for transaction data to be posted right both Celestia and Avail they are data availability layers independent data availability layers and they use data availability sampling to guarantee that blocks data is you know posted on is made available right uh with just a fraction of the same data being posted on chain so effectively what they do is that they reduce the amount of data that has to be posted on chain and therefore it should reduce you know the amount of costs that are rolled up in curse for posting data on ethereum and now we have arbitrary many trust which basically uses a fallback mechanism you know where it stores data off-chain that is secured by uh data availability committee and if the committee fails the any trust chain will just resort to uh posting the transaction data on ethereum like a normal optimistic rollups would right so these are some of the solutions that we're starting to see to address you know the high cost of posting transaction data on ethereum and then the next uh unique development I think you know would be would would be the evolution of Roll-Ups as a service or res for shop right uh we have up there the host of uh today's event as well as Caldera and slash uh being you know their own Ras in their own terms uh they each of them have their own unique focus and their unique features so firstly we talk about oddly which I think one of the unique features that they have is The Flash layer feature right where a developer can easily spin up a roll up to perform one-off activities such as an nft mint before settling back on ethereum uh or another layer that you know called layer might support uh this is significant because it can reduce the stress of ad-hoc events right because we've seen how gas spikes when there's a popular nft mint on ethereum right and that can affect the experience for all other ethereum users not just the nft mentors so having a flash layer that takes away this ad hoc demand can certainly reduce the stress on the base layer then we have Caldera caldera's focus is mainly to you know spin up uh Roll-Ups with alternative VMS virtual machines before settling them on evm chains so this should improve the accessibility for developers to build on evm chains because they can spin up their own preferred VMS as a roll-up uh and then settle the outcome of the error on an underlying evm chain so this once again should you know bring about scalability for not only ethereum but other evm chains as well uh we also have slash SDK which actually allows uh developers to spin up layer trees or stop net and I should note that while this isn't exactly you know like a roll up uh the idea behind you know spinning up and additionally uh easily or conveniently does make it analogous to uh Ras software and I think the main point of all of these roll ups as a service is to abstract the complexity of launching a roll-up and they make it more accessible for both developers as well as users to assess you know roll up block space that is uh much cheaper than the blog space on ethereum so I think here is a certainty that like Roll-Ups as a service have a huge potential to scale ethereum in the future and the last notable development here would be uh Roll-Ups building on other blockchains right uh we have open Labs which is uh trying to build like ZK relapse on bitcoin uh we have uh Dimension which is uh roll up as a service platform as well that is building uh Roll-Ups on Cosmos and then we have Bezos with their own and try and roll ups right so uh we start off with the Bitcoin uh ZK Road Labs right one of the challenge that they face right now is uh you know the fact that Bitcoin lacks a lot of expressibility in terms of their programming language script uh also album is currently building in stealth so there isn't really much information on uh their progress but uh it is something to keep an eye out for that you know Bitcoin May when they see Roll-Ups of his own uh yeah then we have uh dimension on Cosmos which is as I said like uh Ras solution um but it's made Focus unlike the previous Ras that were covered is more on interoperability so it's meant to make like a roll up speak to each other more uh easily to facilitate that uh cross chain across roll up interactions right net Hazels have their own like and Shrine Roll-Ups which uh basically means that the rollouts are enshrined within tables itself so they don't actually need to have like uh additional like layer to scale it and this allows you know the engine roll up to skill the exhaust without needing to sacrifice a lot of security or yeah basically is inheriting all of the exhaust security and while these Solutions don't necessarily you know scale ethereum I think uh they are highly relevant to understand and keep an eye out for because they can provide a clue of valuable insights as to how the roll-up landscape can develop on ethereum so that is something that is uh worth you know keeping an eye out for right so just on to the closing remarks uh I'm not too sure if there's been too much content but like uh there are three main takeaways here right I think uh if you want to leave this presentation the three main takeaways firstly roll ups they are becoming an integral and inescapable aspect to scale ethereum right we see more transactions on Roll-Ups combined than on ethereum over the past five months and this trend is you know could continue especially if the bull market returns and ethereum becomes highly costly to use number two Roll-Ups can be very profitable right we see optimistic rollups alone generating over 8.5 in aggregate monthly revenue and this is just optimistic relapse much less to say if we talk about ZK Roll-Ups or even validiums which have very low cost uh I think scaling ethereum is not only in the interest of the ethereum community but like those who scale ethereum can stand to gain as well and the third and final point is that you know the landscape for you know improving and enhancing Roll-Ups is very vibrant and it's diverging right we're seeing a Maria of solutions starting to appear ranging from data availability uh Roll-Ups as a service and Roll-Ups on other blockchains uh becoming increasingly common and this will all add to you know the diversity of solutions that we will see uh that will scale blockchains in the future so with that I think you know the overview of the rollout landscape in short is just full of activity and this is amidst you know the Dow bear market so I think that when the bull market comes back it will be very interesting to see how all of these Roll-Ups continue to develop how the technology will continue to grow and you know more importantly for those people growing the technology uh what it means for yeah transaction costs as well as because running the roll ups what it means for them to be a profitable business so I do think that this is a very uh robust ecosystem that is uh ready for the bull market uh and with that I thank you for your time and uh if you have any questions you can reach me via my email or on Twitter and I hope that my presentation was insightful available to all of you out there thank you [Music]
