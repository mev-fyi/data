[Music] thank you [Music] hello everyone I'm Ed Felton I'm co-founder and chief scientist at off-chain Labs the company that developed arbitrim and I want to talk to you today about arbitrum orbit the next step in scaling ethereum orbit allows you to launch your own arbitrim chain and to customize it to meet your needs so that you can have the freedom and the scalability that comes from supporting your own chain so let me start by talking about Roll-Ups going back to the beginning of ethereum scaling Roll-Ups of which arbitrum 1 of course is a famous example are the leading approach to scaling ethereum and Roll-Ups have a bunch of advantages they have low-cost transactions by moving most of the cost of a transaction off of ethereum onto the roll-up itself you can reduce transaction cost by a lot when done right a roll up can be fully trustless with security rooted in ethereum and interactive fraud proofs the interactive fraud proofs are very important because they're the guarantee of security and the arbitrim stack is the only optimistic roll-up stack that has working interactive fraud proofs and then of course a roll-up properly done is also drop in compatible for ethereum with full support for evm equivalents arbitrim currently offers two chains that are managed by the arbitrum Dow arbitrum 1 and arbitrim Nova and there's and although they rely on the same core technology they have slightly different um slightly different technology and security models and therefore different costs arbitrum one is a general purpose optimistic roll up it runs on the nitro tech stack which is fully evm compatible has been live on mainnet for about a year and a half now uh for I'm sorry has been for about six months now call data in arbitrum one the call data of your transactions is posted directly onto the ethereum L1 which guarantees that it's available for everyone gas savings well depending on what you're doing it's often 20 to 50 times cheaper than L1 ethereum your transaction is is uh is result is provided to you in less than one second and it's used widely for applications like defy and nfts arbitrim Nova on the other hand is a gen chain using what we call the any trust technology also based on the core nitro tech stack full evm compatibility the difference from arbitrum one is that with Nova instead of posting the call data on ethereum it's instead sent to a special data availability committee the result is a big savings in cost even compared to arbitrum one depending again on use case 30 to 150 x cheaper than L1 ethereum uh the average transaction response time is still less than one second and it's often used for applications like gaming and social so let me talk a little bit more about arbitrim1 and again I'm deep diving into these Technologies to show you what's possible with the arbitrim technology because you as a user of arbitrum orbit will have the ability to launch the same technology that's powering arbitrum 1 and arbitrum Nova and have your own version of these sorts of Technologies so arbitrum one arbitrum one really was the initial arbitrum chain developed initially by off-chain labs and it's in alignment with vitalik's vision of a roll-up Centric ethereum roadmap basically arbitrim1 as I said your transaction call data is posted to ethereum um L1 to L2 bridging is done via a bridge contract that can self-enforce the validity of transactions the security mechanism uses fraud proof so that if malicious behavior takes place security is still guaranteed by the ethereum L1 and it's very it provides a very strong guarantee it's not subject to the kind of 51 attack or even 34 attack that some side chains have arbitrum one by its nature is able to withstand uh the corruption of a large number of validators in fact you need only one validator that is correct and behaving honestly and is available in order for arbitrum one to guarantee security that's the key advantage of optimistic roll-up technology if you have fraud proofs as arbitrum one does the arbitrum one ecosystem is very large more than 2 000 dap Integrations you can see a lot of logos here lots of different dapps especially in the D5 and nft space currently over a million eth reside in the arbitrum bridge that is more than the 10 than 10 other major chains combined you can see on the right hand side and uh an illustration of the dominance of arbitrim1 and the eth flows over on the left um and I'm showing you this not just to show you that arbitrum one has a huge market share although it does but just to show you that that the community of L2 application developers have voted with their feet for arbitrum one over Alternatives because the arbitrum technology provides a level of performance and reliability that they really like so if you look in terms of measures of value locked arbitrum one has depending which day you check 5.8 billion dollars worth of value locked and roughly 65 percent of the roll-up market share arbitrim1 and Nova arbitrum Nova because it offers because it uses external data availability service it's able to offer much lower cost per transaction even than arbitrum one uh and so it's it's been very attractive for for games and you see some of the games that are built um in in arbitrim here let me talk shift gears talk a little bit of our about arbitrim Nova arbitrum Nova as I said uses the any trust technology which is also available to you as an arbitrum orbit developer arbitrum the arbitrum any trust technology indeed is very attractive if you want to run your own chain because of its low cost so the way arbitrum novel works is uh the transaction life cycle is a little bit different from arbitrum one first the arbitrum sequencer will batch and compress the incoming transactions in order to be able to encode them as efficiently as possible the sequencer then submits that data batch whereas arbitrum one would have put the call data after batching and compressing it onto the L1 ethereum chain arbitrim Nova submits it to the data availability committee I'll call that the DAC and then requests a data availability certificate from the committee the certificate proves that the committee has collectively promised to store that data for you and if you have a valid data availability certificate that means that if even two of the committee members are honest that you know you can get your data back once it has the data availability certificate the sequencer posts that data availability certificate to ethereum thereby proving to ethereum that that data that backs the next set of transactions on the Nova chain will be available through the data availability committee now if for some reason it's not possible to generate a data availability certificate because who knows maybe some of the data availability committee members are down or not cooperating then the chain will smoothly and transparently fall back to roll up Post Its data on ethereum and continue to make progress so you get the advantage of having a very efficient data availability committee when it's available which on arbitrum Nova has been always in the history of the chain but if for some reason that's not available you don't give up the safety of being able to fall back to roll up okay so let me talk about reddit reddit has adopted arbitrim Nova arbitrum one Reddit scaling competition in 2021 this was fiercely contested among a bunch of different L2 scaling Technologies Reddit decided to go with arbitrum for this so Reddit Community points are migrated Unchained on arbitrim Nova with a wallet slash Vault that's built into the Reddit app when Reddit stood this up they migrated about a quarter of a million Reddit accounts onto arbitrum Nova with their state at a total cost of about Seventeen hundred dollars Community points are live in two subreddits and the Reddit Community is quite large 400 million users per month and one of the reasons why Reddit chose arbitrim Nova is the ability of arbitrum Nola to Nova to scale up in order to support the level that is the ability of arbitrum Nova in order to scale up to support the level of um of of scaling that Reddit needed in order to uh in order to know that they could bring all of those users into the arbitrim Nova ecosystem so the arbitrum Nova data availability committee has a set of well-known parties including Reddit Google Cloud consensus open C and of course uh we at off-chain Labs ourselves and again you need only two of these parties to behave honestly and provide data uh when when they promise to in order for uh the Nova data availability system to guarantee access to your data okay so what's new in arbitrum the biggest thing that's new in arbitrim is the evm plus concept and the stylus technology that implements it so the way we look at it is evm equivalents the ability to run any program that could run on ethereum any contract or application is crucial for for arbitrum and we've supported that from the beginning now but that's just a starting point the stylus technology which is uh which is currently in advanced development expands arbitrum 1 and Nova and can expand your your orbit chain to run smart contracts that are not written in evm but are written in other languages it's compatible Stylus is compatible with rust C C plus plus for writing your contracts in fact any language any tool chain that can compile to wasm web assembly you can use that tool chain to write a smart contract that will run on an arbitrim chain using stylus so that opens up a vast set of languages and just as importantly tools for writing smart contracts now I want to emphasize this is not a separate chain this is not a separate Silo within an arbitrim chain this is fully interoperable fully composable with smart contracts that are developed using the classic evm and solidity development stack so what you get is that full interoperability users can interact with these stylus these stylus supported contracts they can call back and forth with evm solidity contracts indeed if you develop with stylus your users don't even need to know that you are using stylus they'll just get the benefit of your use of an advanced software development stack also significantly we expect contracts that you stylus to get a significant performance gain compared to evm and the reason for that is simply that wasm is designed for efficient execution and it's possible to execute wasm much faster than you can execute evm so significant performance gain again with full compatibilities so this is additive to the evm ecosystem hence the name evm Plus okay now let me talk about arbitrum orbit having talked about the main arbitrum chains and the technology let me talk about orbit arbitrim1 and Nova currently serve many thousands of applications millions of users they secure billions of dollars of assets yet some applications perhaps yours want to go a step further orbit lets you launch your own chain which you can customize however you like while retaining the time-tested security and scalability everything that people love you and others love about arbitrim you get to keep but you get to have your own chain and uh and customize it orbit is permissively licensed so that you can customize and launch your chain on top of arbitrim1 or arbitrim Nova without needing to ask permission from anybody so what does Orbit give you well it gives you Nitro the arbitrum Nitro stack which is time tested and extensibility not only will you benefit from updates that arbitrim1 and arbitrum Nova deploy as they become available but you can also Implement updates that the arbitrum Dow for whatever reason has not adopted for arbitrum 1 or Nova so you get not only the advantage of the current arbitrum note Nitro stack you get the advantage of further developments in the stack whether they're done by off-chain Labs or by others in the community so this gives you more flexibility than the public chains uh you get increased gas price reliability many types of dapps rely on having predictable transaction costs because the orbit chains are somewhat isolated from a gas cost point of view from the arbitrum L2 and ethereum L1 traffic using an orbit L3 chain means that you have more reliable gas prices which means that your dapp's users can rely on more reliable transaction costs you get account abstraction account abstraction as as popularly implemented these days on ethereum Via erc4337 that is supported on arbitrim that's available to you right away so you can use that predictable gas prices help make alternative cost models uh more feasible such as subsidizing fees or indeed replacing transaction fees entirely by say some kind of subscription model or whatever it is that you want to do for your application this helps you further abstract away the technical complexity of decentralization helps you deliver more familiar experiences to non-technical audiences all the flexibility of account abstraction is there it's on arbitrum one it's on Arboretum Nova and it'll be on your orbit chain there's also the ability to customize the protocol logic now many people won't need this but if you do need it or want it you might want to modify the logic of your chain settlement its execution or its governance protocols in either in order to meet whatever your specific requirements are and you're allowed to do that the license allows it and the software is flexible so that it so that you can make the customizations that you need orbit cell 3 chains let you do that while still deriving security from ethereum L1 through the arbitrim Dows governed L2 chains arbitrum 1 and Nova so you get the ability to customize and also the security Foundation of arbitrum under you there are a lot of decentralization options here arbitrim roll up derives at security from ethereum you can choose to use arbitrum any trust with the assumption that you can trust the data availability committee orbit L3 chains let you use either of those models you can also introduce additional trust assumptions if you want in order to to meet specific needs or you can go with that simply take the default off the shelf trust assumptions this again is up to you it's customizable and of course there's low upfront setup costs orbit L3 any trust and roll-up chains can be created quickly and cheaply because they're on top of arbitrim1 or arbitrum Nova which have much lower cost than uh than than launching on top of an L1 you're going to benefit already from the cost Savings of arbitrum 1 and arbitrum Nova your chain although almost everything that happens on your chain will be within your own chains uh resources and economics you do rely to a lesser extent on the Chain underline chain that you're built on and by building on arbitrum one or arbitrim Nova you get lower cost and more flexibility and you benefit from that as well security obviously orbit chains can be configured out of the box as either any trust or roll-up chains they can be further customized as well but you get the benefits of arbitrim security mechanism you get working fraud proofs not only working today but a fraud proof technology that has been live for a long time and has serviced many millions of transactions on arbitrunk um if you want you can permission access to your chain you have the option to enforce transaction submission or contract deployment restrictions whatever the goals of your chain or your business model is you have the option of doing that now I have to say there are some drawbacks to running your own chain these are drawbacks of running your own chain no matter what technology you use and I want to acknowledge them because um although orbit chains or running your own chain is attractive for many use cases it's not for everyone first of all there is some friction at the at the chain boundary you'll need to connect to a bridge in order to leverage existing defy infrastructure instead of natively having all of those teams build on your chain right so um on the layer 2 arbitrum one and arbitrum Nova there are many users there are many applications already there for synchronous composability if you build your own chain that won't be there and you'll have to get those people on board or else use cross chain Technologies which are uh which are good and improving but still that will not be without friction there's also more infrastructure complexity if you're running your own chain if you're using one of the uh one of the existing large chains then all that's provided for you but if you have your own chain you need to think about RPC providers Bridges block explorers exchanges uh Fiat on-ramps and so on all that's already taken care of if you're using existing public chains if you do it yourself of course you're going to need that although of course the whole idea of roll up as a service is to provide that for you as a service and to reduce this drawback okay so is arbitrim orbit right for you well many apps are better served by public chains due to the widespread infrastructure support as well as the synchronous composability with other applications but if you want the scale the flexibility the customizability the ability to control economics and governance that come from having your own chain orbit will do the job for you and will do it well now the the emergence of rollup as a service infrastructure is really important here because the rise of Ras infrastructure support is going to shift this trade-off to make it more attractive to launch your own chain via orbit um for more use cases so we're really excited about arbitrim orbit we think it provides huge opportunities by bringing together the time-tested arbitrum technology and the ability of the arbitrum community to deliver reliable and efficient software um making but making this available to people who it wasn't available to before we're excited about orbit we're excited about the growth of Ras infrastructure and the RAS economy and we'd love to see you be a part of it if you want to learn more about orbit you could go to this URL here arbitrim.foundation orbit there's plenty of documentation there including instructions for launching your own devnet chain to test it out yourself on top of the arbitrim Gourley test net with instructions in the future for launching on live on mainnet you're going to hear more exciting announcements about companies and teams using orbit we would love to have you join that community so please reach out if you're interested thank you very much thanks for your time and enjoy the conference thank you [Music]
