[Music] thank you hello everyone this is Amrit Kumar Chief Operating Officer of wallflare Welcome to a new episode of all three where we discuss layer ones roll ups app chains and other blockchain infrastructures today I'm delighted to have Ananda here Anand is the managing partner of an early stage blockchain infrastructure fund called canonical crypto and he's also a venture partner at Lightspeed hello Anand how are you hey I'm right I'm well how are you not too bad not too bad well welcome to all of you and thank you thank you very much for joining me let's let's start with a quick introduction for those who may not know you please tell us a bit about your background uh how you came to be at light speed and what brought you to the crypto land yeah um well I'll try to condense it because the the background's kind of long but uh yeah I was just reflecting the other day that I'm kind of hitting year 23 in sort of like my professional domain as an operator as ex-founder but um yeah briefly I'll kind of run through it you know back in 2001 I graduated degree and complete from Purdue um started my career as a developer building very low level embedded systems protocols into uh this operating system known as iOS not the iOS they're working labor today but the one that goes into Cisco routers and switches so that's kind of how I started my career but then you know started to move up stack I ended up uh leading developer platforms at Microsoft for a while so very close to sort of the world of developers I've always kind of this is my comfort zone is where I grew up uh the second chapter I created the second decade was mostly focused on starting companies and being the CEO um and but somewhere along the way in 2013 uh I got uh I got introduced to bitcoin through a very close friend of mine and we started mining Bitcoin it was sort of the first exposure but it felt sort of like a you know there was a lot of novelty on starting to mine Bitcoin out of the gate but then you know the novelty sort of wore off because you know it was kind of an autopilot Plateau the learning wasn't really there per se it was sort of like many optimizations here or there but uh so I think I kind of fell off the crypto bandwagon for a while heard about Cosmos coming up and then ethereum and then finally with smart contracts programmability that made a lot more sense to me because just having grown up in that world I was like okay I I this this computes now and so you know my wife and I made an um an investment early on in this company called Stacks which was uh you know sort of like bringing programmability to bitcoin because again I was like okay I know Bitcoin I get programmability this is this makes perfect sense so that was sort of like I'd say where the robbers start to meet the road as far as like crypto exposure investing in companies Etc uh our company we exited in 2018 and then at that point I decided to go deeper into crypto because I always had this thread never really explored it as much um started building a few things here and there but and then started teaching class on D5 and eventually decided that I think I want to support a lot of early stage Founders having been one myself having been through the Journey having been a developer product person Etc so that's how canonical was born and along the way I met light speed to have been an incredible partner to me and um yeah so I have this role where I do really early stage Investments are canonical you know and can can participate in an invest in later stage companies at a light speed and uh yeah that's the that's the makeup and that's kind of what brings me here in terms of Stack you know you mentioned you move from down to top as well so in terms of Stack today um of course and even crypto you have infrastructure but then you also have you mentioned about D5 applications what what part of the stack interests you the most yeah I'd say like the lowest layers are still very interesting to me and uh and you know everything from like layer ones uh on up to middleware or even sort of orthogonal or tangential services to the stack itself so they may not live in the blockchain sandwich so to speak but they live in the periphery uh you know companies like invest in a company called Centier for example which is like a monitoring observability service which isn't really running on chain but is harnessing on chain data to provide insights into what's happening uh on chain so I'd say that uh where I've been honing in my thesis is to really support companies that are basically selling to developers I feel like that's where where the developers the end user or the customer I feel like that's where I'd like to get involved uh the second is also I feel like the further down the stack you go um I think and maybe the crypto world this is sort of defying this thesis that I think for the down the stack you go the more defensible your your offering can get although like that's been that's been you know I think we're seeing a lot of very interesting good teams build products that um uh even though they may be you know very technically complex in nature uh which you know in sort of like in the web non-web three world like that's typically been challenging to do right or like you have one incumbent sort of platform like the implementation of TCP for example is like you know a foregone conclusion um but that's different in the world of crypto so uh yeah I but that's sort of short obviously question is that that's typically where I tend to focus is lowered on the stack infrastructure or where you know the end user is a developer that's where I get most excited got it let's talk a little bit about the investment space and you know of course they have been very I would say you know light speed for example is is one of the new entrants I suppose in the in the crypto investment space I'm not sure we've been exactly Lightspeed started uh investing in the crypto um but could you tell us you know how and when VC firm decides to invest in a new space like crypto it could be here now yeah of course AI is a big thing of course it was big for quite a while but now it's becoming a bit hotter what is the cost to do at what point a VC firm decides okay now this is something that we can't pick up we can't ignore yeah that's a really good question um the one you know quick point is that uh lightspeed's actually been investing in crypto for like for over for about a decade now and it's been sort of under the radar it's like surprising but they've got some Investments that date way back um and so you know the earliest days they've been sort of active in this space so I think it's been an ongoing theme and even you know if you talk to Ravi mattre who's one of the founding Partners in the firm uh he's just a fascinating person who's always had uh you know just been able to read the tea leaves and see what's coming up ahead and ensure that the firm is looking at opportunities um that you know again the question really is like what does it look like to live in the future and like what what becomes steady state in the future and how do we help accelerate companies who are helping us get to that point so they're kind of using that vantage point I think the firm has always had a leg up and thinking about okay let's support these initiatives and in all honesty some of these may not be the right thing for now but we should we should start thinking about these so and that's like the other question about like how does a firm start thinking about some of these things yeah you know we look at these in forms of you know I think as uh as one of uh as bajel who's one of the also one of the leading partners of the firm has mentioned which is you know think about them in sort of s-curves right so you kind of want to time these and think about like okay these for example something may be looking interesting right now and um or the technology is fascinating but what are some of the things that we need to see to make sure that this becomes mainstream or becomes interesting right so great examples like AI you brought up right so I'm sure you or me like I remember yeah is not new I I took an AI class in school in 1999 right like it was a long time ago and I I used you know lisp uh to to you know to like pretend like I knew what I was doing with AI that was my only exposure to AI but um I think it took like it took this amount of time for us to get to this point that we needed the proliferation of data on the internet to then train models and then get to you know a end user product like chat GPT to be like whoa this is this is now happening right like everything we talked about you know and similar I think we need to have certain catalysts or Tailwinds for technology to become um interesting and so I'd say uh a few things kind of need to come together and I think for a firm like likes me to get excited it really is about the novelty of the technology and how it sort of um accelerates or or how that technology component helps us become more efficient or uh becomes just proliferates and helps us in our day-to-day life and just sort of reading that number one but also second looking at what the right timing for this needs to be is another thing that's an interesting cat or like looking at catalysts and those could be anything right it could be just um you know Technology Innovation timing regulation any one of these any one of these things could be Catalyst for that um and uh yeah just also like I think we just need to have depth and understanding the space right so it's not like hey by the way this is fascinating let's go invest in that area like I don't think that's quite good enough right like we need to have people can be good thought partners and supporters for for the CEOs and Founders are going to be building things in the space so building up our internal uh you know I come in and know-how and also the vernacular to make sure that we can support these companies really well so those are some of the things that need to come together so yeah we start to build conviction you know we talk about this you know within I'm very fortunate to be uh you know sort of uh in the mix when when they talk about these things at light speed and get a get a feel for how someone like Ravi who's been doing this for over two decades you know thinks about this and um how would brass attacks when it comes together to form like let's be like hey you know we need to it's it's not about like you know building conviction here this is going to happen let's let's go out and make sure that we're ready to support Founders when they're building the space so yeah it's um you're right like there's a there's a big concerted effort and focus on AI which I think is is incredible and it's going to be such an amazing salary for so many things also also scary but uh yeah I think we're generally excited it's a good scary thing you know it's it's something that you I think I'm excited about indeed I agree I agree talking about you know web 3 itself so could you I mean of course you started long time back but could you could you tell a little bit more about your you know web 3 thesis and has it evolved over time do you feel like okay what you believed in I don't know five six years ago is very different today and you know your face is moving forward uh it's probably different from what you had in mind let's say five six years ago yeah um the one uh you know I think and I shared this with you earlier right which is the the focus on infrastructure the focus on developers and and getting more tooling for developers in the ecosystem is like continues to be sort of an area of focus and I think um when you look at the report the Electric Capital Publishers right which talks about the number of active developers in this space I think we're still several orders of magnitude behind you know if you look at sort of the non-web three space I think it's like what I don't know similar to 25 and 30 million developers or something like that um and if you look at our space it's like in the tens of thousands of developers right that know how to code or build things in the world of crypto uh and that's across the stock right so um I think we have a long ways to to catch up so I I continue to think about what can what do we need and not just from like an educational standpoint because that is that is necessary as well but also from a tooling standpoint to help accelerate the the um yeah just the growth and prolification of developers in in our ecosystem so that's that's like the high level thesis I I really love that world and I I I I I believe could you believe that getting more developers into this space is what's going to help us move forward and help move crypto in general move forward because I think the fundamentals of what the blockchain has to offer pretty sound and um uh I think we sometimes the outside narrative I think it's a little bit confusing because sometimes there's this confusion around um you know crypto prices crypto assets and pricing versus underlying technology right there's a big disconnect there uh when it comes to people or not in in the in the know like you and me are so uh but I think getting more developers here to support other developers coming on board building foundational use cases for the blockchain that are going to be really interesting as we look forward because I think we've got um we go through cycles and phases right of of like of infrastructure so let me let me zoom out for a second uh you know I think there's maybe uh Union Square Ventures that have done a really good job of documenting this which is you know there was uh there was Bitcoin itself right has a white paper and then there was BTC right which was the token right so it was like the infrastructure piece and the actual like consumer piece right and then we've gone through sort of waves of this over time we've got infrastructure applications infrastructure applications and I think we've got a lot of infrastructure that's been built and so yeah I think that's long story short like I I focus on sort of like the bottom layers that's that's continues to be the thesis um the only outlier you touched upon this earlier tends to be D5 for me because although I'm I don't have a finance Background by any stretch my sort of concerted view when I came into this like it was very top down and it happened to be through D5 and uh I was just fascinated by this because every uh you know it started to challenge a lot of assumptions we have around traditional Finance today right like how are you gonna operate if I wanted to send you money like you know the four the things that we have all taken for granted yet we still do um in the traditional Finance world just got completely you know uh disarmed and like turned on his head thanks to thanks to uh decentralized finance and I I think it is the of all the product Suites we've seen today D5 nfts gaming um social and maybe nft is pretty far ahead I think D5 is also D5 to me has shown product Market fit although albeit it's been with a group of people a group of deacons like you and me like us um but I think there's you know it's shown that it works right so for us to then like cross the chasm and make it more mainstream there needs to be some Tailwinds that need to come into come into play so yeah I'd say B5 infrastructure or the thesis it hasn't it hasn't changed too much and um I'll this is my last point and I promise I'll stop rambling about this specific question which is um you know with the ins with these sort of incidents that have happened over the last year whether it's FTX or uh other other things um the question always comes up on like are you changing anything like what's going to change right and I for me personally like nothing has changed dramatically because the the technology still sound there were bad actors in the space who who misused the way the platform should be run and obviously used customer deposit and malicious ways you know like one specific instance but aside from that yeah you know it's not it's not a situation where dramatically suddenly the the focus for what the blockchain is is changing right or like you know suddenly like hey like let's there's a there's a new movement here let's kind of latch on to that like that's not the goal so yeah I'd say largely it's been the same and you know it's going to stay Central uh looking forward if anything I'm personally quite excited about some of the use cases that I'm seeing now that I hadn't seen before that are actually being catalyzed by things like AI so uh yeah that's the that's that's what keeps me jazzed and excited mentioned Electric Capital and there and for those who don't know they publish annual reports on developer activity across different uh chains by the way entire blockchain space in general and one interesting well I think point that they they found in this in the last report that they published was that new wallets I mean it depends on how you define it but the world that did first transaction basically if it was if you had a fresh wallet and if you look at the history of that wallet the first transaction that that wallet did was uh in most cases was actually NFP transaction as opposed to D5 transaction right yeah do you do were you surprised by this result you felt like that's that's actually normal for president yeah I'm not surprised at all like I think it it makes you know I think if you look at the um I mean there's so many ways to unpack this right so I was I was riffing with another investor the other day that I think the if you look at the trend lines and what has been a big Catalyst for crypto over the last few years right let's say like between the 2019 to 2022 era that vintage um it really but the Catalyst were really like it started with D5 in a lot of ways but there was also you know the nft movement really picked up in a huge way and it became a form of uh again just like as as humans right like and for those especially who are looking at assets or looking at artwork in a speculative way and people who appreciate that this is like a natural entry point for them right so um I I'm not surprised at all like that's the case it's actually a little bit more perhaps less nuanced and easier to grok than something like D5 because I mean let's let's be honest right I think for the average user uh an interface like openc is a little bit more acceptable than something like um you know I don't know uh curve right so I'd say that it is uh it's just more reasonable and that doesn't mean that like the buck stops there like you know I you you may start there and if you're sophisticated and you feel like you want to take some more risk or want to learn a little bit more then you enter the world or D5 but yeah it just depends on appetite right so and and sort of where again you feel most comfortable so not not surprised at all um and I I hope that Trend actually kind of continues because you know you you start to nfts again like to to us we think vanities we think of artwork but like that that doesn't have to be where the buck stops right there could be other form of non-fungible set that get introduced on chain and I think there's a lot there's a there's a way to before we get there but that could be an interesting way in which people still get on board into the world of crypto but may not even know uh you know that they're doing so which I hope is where we end up in a sort of steady state format I have one more question on on sort of VCS and that landscape and how VS kind of kind of see projects in the crypto space um and I haven't spoken to some of them and you know it feels like there's probably a different way in which crypto native VCS operate and there's a different way in which let's say traditional VCS operate um and by what I mean is traditional situation VCS who are actually investing crypto as well so not like those who want to stay away from crypto from your perspective um do you feel like the the actually do operate differently and the other question would be that um around valuations do you feel like the valuations that uh evaluation that are let's say a traditional VC fund would give a crypto project would be very different from valuation that or let's say a crypto native project uh VC would get did you feel the difference from where you stand yeah um on the first one like in terms of um how we think about deals I think it really comes down to one thing right which is Focus right so when you when you enter a space like this um which is so nuanced and there's so much depth right like in tip of the iceberg from outside in like SMS we talked about looking at uh crypto assets and and pricing right as one or people look at nfts maybe some subsection have heard of those I'd say D5 maybe a distant third in terms of like just general awareness of what crypto has to offer but underneath this is like this is giant like Iceberg underneath of like uh beautiful Tech right so it makes a ton of sense for there to be focused and I think a lot of the crypto native funds bring by just being able to focus and eliminating all the other noise that's or I mean noise is not the right word but like everything else is happening in this world this is able to go deep right so I think that's what a crypto native fund can bring so I think when a movement like this begins I think the investment in going into um into starting a fund that's heavily focused makes a ton of sense I think that's the difference I think larger platforms like a light speed you know we have we can have multiple Focus areas because the size and the AUM uh and so we can have crypto focusing on the healthcare Focus we can have an Enterprise AI Focus it's consumer Focus Etc but if you're a smaller fund just getting started with you know you know whatever the font size might be and you want to be hyper focused here that makes a ton of sense and you can you know as as time goes on and as you show signs of success and you raise more capital and you're you continue to double down because the depth of what you want to see here starts to grow and your conviction starts to grow as well so that's the primary sort of difference I hear I'd say um in terms of valuation I um that's a tough one for me like I don't uh I don't see a discrepancy here per se um I'd say that you know we we all sort of collectively work together on understanding like hey where are things where do things need to be at this point in time on the market um and yeah you know like for I'd say maybe the one Nuance is that when it comes to a multi-stage multi-disciplinary fund you're sort of weighing an opportunity to invest in this specific company at a specific valuation compared to some other companies and other valuations right so like you may be looking at this versus maybe an investment Ai and how do you sort of like you know how do you gauge or how do you compare the two and um you know every fund operates differently some you know some funds have like specific Focus areas but like that that sort of like thought process doesn't need to come in to compare one opportunity in crypto versus another one in another sub-sector uh but when you're a crypto native fund that's all you're looking at right like you're not comparing it to anything else that's happening in the market so but across the board there is a general calibration that tends to happen so I don't I don't think this is necessarily something that's you know um that needs to happen in like a crypto native versus you know a more broader fund so to speak but that's been my experience in in the time that I've been investing is that yeah I think we tend to sort of calibrate in lock stuff there there doesn't tend to be any Nuance when it comes to sort of a broader fund versus a native fund so to speak got it got it okay let's move a little bit away from now Investments and sort of focus more on the infra for a lot of things uh let's start with controversial or uh edgy question uh and so basically uh I think vitalik put out a blog post talking about the end game for ethereum you know yeah which is around scalability and how ethereum would actually scale and he kind of position the whole thing as you know ZK Roll-Ups are basically the end game so you would have Zeke Roll-Ups that could have been as an L2 form or it could be l3s and whatnot and it would scale the underlying ethereum using by execution off of the chain and so um the first question would be do you believe ZK Roll-Ups are the end game of training from because you know some of the l1's out there I mean I will name them but basically they would say look we have a very competing platform and and so what's your perspective on this so first of all do you feel like ZK is already damn game or even alternator once actually have have a place of Their Own yeah I'd say that um so I'll say roll ups in general have shown uh have shown promise right like I think we've gotten to that point now if you look at sort of where we are today compared to where we were about a year ago um I'd say the progress has been sort of immense right like we wanted to get to this point with arbitrum with optimism uh out there as a few ZK EVMS now also coming to life um so it's it feels like a very good spot in terms of just roll-up technology I think obviously one role of Technology at optimistic versus ZK and I think we made that progress obviously super impressed with how the Arboretum team is you know has been just executing and you know full in full transparency they're you know their light speed portfolio companies have been a little bit more close to them and very impressed with sort of like how they've hit all the Milestones that uh they promised to hit over time and just you know just general understanding of what the community needs so it's been interesting to watch that so I think specifically to answer your question is it ZK or ZK roll up to the end State that's I'd say there's a few more things that we need to see to get there and I think today we're starting to see these come to life I think everything from the hardware stack to the software layer I think we're starting to see a lot more things that need to come together for that to happen but I think it is it is happening um and uh you know whether it's uh whether it's scroll whether it's polygon ZK evm I think there's I think we're kind of getting we're kind of trending in that direction so I don't I think the short answer is like I think Roll-Ups are end State I don't know if it's ZK or not because I think we're starting to see that you know the you know arbitrum is just like doing an incredible job and you know would love to see progress happen there and so much of ethereum or even layer twos like Arboretum there's like Network effects really dictate where the where the pendulum sort of swings and settles right so you talk about like alternate l1s and you also asked earlier like what have been what are the trends or what are some things you've seen and we have seen this uh over the years which is you know I think it is definitely exciting when you have um when you have an L1 that's like hey you know we're we're going to solve for the trilemma in a in an elegant Way by doing these things and um and there may be some other compromises along the way but here's how we'll get there uh but we're I think we've just seen that let me put it this way I think 10 years if you and I were to be having this chat we'll still be talking about ethereum uh and we'll be talking about you know uh settlement maybe happening down at L1 at that point but will we be I I struggle to think about like what that means in the context of another L1 at that point in time you know so that's uh so that's a that's a tough one for me to answer because I think just Just Having learned lessons over the last five six years I think you can start to see that you know just because of the Africa facts cut the comfort zone kind of brings us back into ethereum and we're we're happy with where you know with what that offers to developers now that being said there is there there are some novel things being built in other l1's right so I think we need to it'd be great to learn from them and try to figure out like how um and for example like specifically the programmability model right like bringing like the move like framework I think that's really novel um and it uh the way I think about it is that it sort of reduces the surface area for you know for things to go wrong whereas I think you know maybe the analog like I use in my head as a old school programmers that I remember you know uh the only way you could have built an IOS app in the day was using Swift right and then I'm sorry using objective Suite object to C and then you had um almost an objective Suite uh Objective C and then you had like some like Swift come along which was you know a lot more terrible for uh and acceptable by developers and so I think we'll see progressions like that which may which could draw developer mind share and could have an interesting and you know then you have then you have to marry that would go to market but I'd say the comfort zone is very strong today when it comes to ethereum and uh role of Technology at large so we'll uh yeah it's a weight and watch kind of situation at least the good thing about you know you know this this roll-up is not just about the roll-up itself but also that you know you're moving execution out of the chain right of the main chain and now since you mentioned move now you can have an execution layer that actually runs runs move as it's VM you know move VM and then that's from you know you can have a sovereign but you still have a VM that is that is moved so you could still process transactions and this you know could still be attached with him in in many ways yeah I I completely agree with you I think it's uh that's a that's a great point and and uh I think we've seen some examples of this with other Frameworks as well I think move is move is definitely an interesting one that's like definitely catered to what what we want to see on a blockchain right so yeah that'll be that'll be fascinating a couple of months ago probably more than that um you know we spoke and we discussed about uh about app chains and I think around the same time you also tweeted uh if I remember correctly that options will be inevitable for most apps now what is your thesis on options in general and the follow-up question would be how does that thesis differ from App rollups yeah yeah I uh I think the progression that we will likely see is and again I'll use sort of an old school analog and sort of like this is how I at least like think about things in my head because we've seen this progression over the years right so um creating a smart contract and deploying it on uh a layer one or a layer two today it feels like what you might do with a proof of concept on Heroku right if you kind of get up and running and it's the verify entry is actually very very low and uh yeah you could test such a hypothesis very quickly and and see you know all right I might turn in the right direction as things start to as your product starts to get bigger your protocol starts to get bigger and we haven't seen we've seen some of these start to kind of push the limits right like some of these Protocols are like yeah you know every basis point matters and um you know maybe and like this was the story or narrative like last year like Gatsby's are too expensive so we need better scaling Solutions if not like will Plateau where we are this is like untenable for us to perform certain transactions on chain so we'll need to you know we need to think about what comes next right so is it another L1 there's no l2s around today right that was the narrative about a year ago um but again going back to the progression you know you have something like I want to deploy something and test on Heroku Croco becomes unsustainable untenable at some point you migrate off and you use something like you know ec2 and at some point you get so big right like you know and there's some outliers here they're not it's not for everyone but then you're like hey you know I need to manage my own data center right like that's kind of the progression that tends to happen so I think we're kind of seeing similar things you start off on an L1 and you're like wait a second like I need to go to an L2 for for various reasons for scalability reasons and then the end game might be that like hey I'm just so big right now that every every everything here matters to me right like every single basis point matters to me and I need to spin up you know I need to think about an app chain here um and we I mean obviously like you know I think dydx is probably the leading example of this um and maybe there may be more to come and I get this trade-offs here right like I think when you get as big as a dydx uh you know of using something like tenurement Cosmos like what you need to think about how you spin up uh your own Marketplace uh of validators Etc like it's a lot of work it's not it's all for the faint of heart um so in that sense I think you know roll-up technology makes a little bit more sense because you get sort of like that bootstrap Network out of the gate which is a little bit you know harder to do when you're starting to use an app chain that is sort of you know customized uh or it needs to be customized for your purposes so yeah I'd say that it it seems inevitable that Protocols are gonna get bigger because they will get bigger because there's going to be more traction and as they start to get bigger they're going to need every single one of these things are going to start to matter to them uh like you know optimizing for you know what their sort of take rate is and when that starts to happen you know there's you still want the novelty of the blockchain without compromising um decentralization other sort of native things that the blockchain has to offer and you just can't do that with uh you know at some point you'll hit a limit and you want to you want to be able to spin up your own chain so and this you know I guess the maybe a more uh crass analog is that you know like yeah that's you know you want to start off by learning to swim in in like the same pool that everyone else is swimming in but at some point you're like you know I just I don't want to be swimming here right like that's I think you you want to sort of mind it off and you're like you're a high performance swimmer right you want your own lane and you want to swim really fast and how do you do that without everyone's crowding up the pool so yeah I think it feels like where we will head and we start to see some breakouts here maybe we'll see some more in in the coming years and I think that's uh that's where we'll roll updated uh and options as two different I guess infrastructure or technology yeah do you feel like there are or they could be applications that are better off on a row on a roll-up or better off an app chain but not on not on Roll-Ups do you feel like there's there are certain types of applications that are well suited for one type of infrastructure and not for the other uh that's a good question I'd say it depends on sort of like how much uh how much work the the app sort of wants to underwrite and take on and um how much you want to leverage the technology of the underlying chain itself right so again you look at something like Cosmos tournament or or substrate on one end of the spectrum and then you look at you know what you can get with l3s on on another ecosystem altogether there's definitely trade-offs there right and um uh honestly like I think it's a we've seen we've seen some success there like with osmosis or others uh and I think it's a matter of time like when we start to see some uh some folks sort of leveraging what l3s have to offer so I think um yeah it is truly a trade-off situation right like what do you try to optimize it for how much bandwidth you have how much do you want to compromise or how much do you want to forego when you look at one offering versus another and I think that's I don't think folks are going to take that lightly like you have to do a lot of research and diligence to make sure that you you're getting truly what you're expecting there go ahead I mean one one thing they know again I don't have a form answer to this but I was I felt always like I always felt like this the good thing about you know Roll-Ups is that at least you have an L1 to to to fall back to so there could be interesting application scenarios where I don't know you want to tap into L to L1 in some way and and it gives you that that way to fold back in some way while right in case of um aptitude you simply cannot do that unless let's say for example the cosmos Hub in some way allows allows some of these things uh you know in the center again I don't have a good example of what what what actually makes sense in you know in an app chain World in a role of world which doesn't make sense in a in an upchain World anyway I mean you mentioned that is yeah I'm just gonna say sorry that I think it's an important distinction right like you're right I mean when you look at sort of like what you want to get codified on ethereum as an L1 right at the end of the day because that's what you get with some of these you know l3s that are that we're starting to see proliferate now um whereas you know not to say that any one of these other blockchains you know because they are going to live live forever and and not dissipate but yeah what you know I think you can really take advantage of of an L1 um like ethereum if that's where things get settled and again when we talk about like where do you where do you see this in 10 years right like I just I think you have this great confidence that you know we'll still be talking about ethereum in that point in time and not to say that your own Standalone chain is you know will not survive the test of time but you're yeah you have that Comfort like you said which I think is an interesting point to consider and it might it's something that folks should take into a rubric you know that rubric when you think about which direction you want to go in indeed uh you know you mentioned and you believe that you know most kind of gaps that will become big enough they would want to go go their own route and so um in that world where some of the biggest apps are actually sitting on their own chain or sitting on their own roll-ups in that World um do you disagree with the fat protocol thesis that you know unit Square Ventures uh you know talked about many years ago and what what is your take on that in in that world where you know some of these big daps like dydfs uni Swap and let's say Ave for example move move to their own chain yeah um I I mean I think this is a great question for them right like which is um because I think when you think about where we were at that point in time when that was written um I think these Concepts were uh somewhat novel right like it was you know the the notion of an app specific chain might have been a little premature to consider at that point in time and so um it but the analog is not drastically dissimilar right like you know you're still going to get the chain is like the most the most the bottommost layer is going to accrue value in this case like the app and the chain are like exactly the same right so I think the stack and the way it's Envision makes makes perfect sense it's just that the chain in this case may not necessarily be ethereum right like it might be your own chain which I think is again this novelty associated with that and it's a um also like I think that's one way to think about like I think the framework but if I were zoom on for a second my sort of like I I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this as well but like my vision of this end State uh NC is wrong like the steady state is that we are as let's say consumers uh or retail investors or Gamers or nft Traders we're interacting with a product a protocol an app yet we are oblivious maybe or like this notion of what's Happening underneath is largely obfuscated from us you know so I think the question really is like I think Bottoms Up we care about like where these things lie right is ethereum is its own app chain how does how is secure how does security work how is how does interop work all these things matter to us at that point but I think where I'm hoping things will settle is that to the end user this is largely obfuscated right because today the user has to go through this mental model of like wait a second what is this protocol like oh it's it's on it's on this other L1 I need to get a wallet for that I want I don't even know how to get the native token for that specific L1 so I need to go get it from somewhere transfer to this like it's such a mess right so anyhow I'm curious if you share that notion that at some point I mean my feeling is that you know if if you do go in that world where some biggest apps on there in the market they have their own option or app roll up in that model I still feel like the the infrastructure itself is actually a part of the app even though yeah you know it's it's not you're not exposed to it directly but at least it's it's part of the same stack in my perspective so if value because you know in most cases uh let's say the app has a token that token will be used for gas fees and things like that on the app chain itself as well so the value will still still keep going on the you know you can call it the because the same token is being used both at the application layer as well as the infrastructure layer it kind of captures the same thing it's kind of like one master fusioned uh you know rather than you know separate storage from my view yeah yeah it's a good real look at it yeah and then and let's talk about a similar thesis that you know it's it's it's doing rounds in the last couple of months which is around the fat uh wallet faces because people believe that now wallets are become and people do not thinking about wallets that much you know five six years ago right people say oh your words are just just something that you simply cannot capture value at you know let's say something that which is completely uh free open source and you know it's very difficult um and that has changed that has changed because now wallets have become entry points and you can you can put indexes and whatnot you can integrate dexes and exchanges and whatnot you can create you know integrate Fiat on-ramps and you can actually actually capture a lot of value there so what is your thoughts on that we feel like um wallets are going to be the big a place to capture values a value for for investors as well as uses yeah this is It's a good question I think I think this is there's a place for wallets where for retail activity right so I mean if I were to ask I don't want to put you on the spot and because I think it might be sharing something that's that's personal but to me I think within our community or like our group of Builders or folks who are sort of in the know we don't use the native we don't use the Dex functionality that comes with the wallet because that's just you know we for many different reasons right um level of customization or parametrization or slippage or um you know the fees that we may have to pay the wallet we don't know exactly what's happening there right so we will go to our decks and we'll use the wallet to do that now if you look at that exact same product but in the hands of a retail investor or consumer that's like you know coinbase is a quintessential example right I don't know it's a centralized change but um that's what it is right it's a wallet at the end of the day where you're trading assets right so I think there's definitely use case for that I I think the demographic is is one that really gonna clearly discern right so I think that's the fat wallet that we see today it's like overloaded with features and you know the to trade assets stake Etc right so all these functionality all these functions will be provided when it comes yeah the super app that's exactly what it is right and I think there's a there's a place for that whether it's rainbow and I've seen a few other entrants in the space where they're like geographically focused as well right so they're trying to create the equivalent again I think the angle is not that this is a centralized exchange but this is a you know this is a wallet for you where you can custody your assets right um by the way again like this the other layer of nuance here is that like you know where the custody is happening right is it self-custodial or is it is it custody somewhere so um now when it comes to being sort of the Gateway for dapps that's where I think as as like a browser extension primarily right I I think that's a barrier for entry and I feel like the direction will start to go and I think thanks to a con abstraction and other announcements happening in the space is that I think we'll start to see these embedded wallets start to appear um and become start to become a little more popular and the idea that because again you know there's just various entry here for the average user like you know let's say again steady state we have games that are leveraging the blockchain for various different things I just don't see a world in which we're expecting a user to download a browser extension first and then go through all the steps that we do today just to be able to play the game right um so I think at steady state we have these games that have wallets embedded in them and uh where I see technology really playing a part is that I think the idea of a wallet doesn't really change but they're really embedded in nature like we're you know coinbase is released our water as a service we have many we have such providers out there today we have a canonical throughout a portfolio company called portal uh wherever it's like NPC wallets as a service and so I think these are going to start to become more mainstream um over the over the course of time it just I think it's a uh it almost seems inevitable because I think this it's beautiful to see that okay we tested this hypothesis out and it really works as a browser extension that gives you an unlocked into this application today and that became you know that became like the most interesting application is that that browser extension right but I think slowly we're going to start to see these become more embedded because the applications themselves are more interesting right so to your point um I think we'll start to move away from browser extension because honestly those are kind of scary uh in in many ways for the average user to think about and uh hopefully that'll also dissipate some of the security exploits and hacks and things like that we've seen over time as well by the way since we last spoke um you know about Roll-Ups and you know app specific rollups in particular um several companies by the way including you know optimism which launched optimism SDK uh recently announced uh orbit for example and now you also have some of these higher level abstractions on top of that that you know people often call them now a roll-up as a service products you know eclipse and bunch of other body also is also building uh one of those yeah um yeah what are your thoughts on these uh these Ras offerings in particular so roll up as a service offerings in particular which are kind of like
