[Music] thank you with you I feel like once we have multiple like sort of approv or dedicated low Labs right the the good thing and I definitely we can skill the throughput like sort of at least a linear or proportional to the number of rollers right like for example each level you can have a thousand sort of TPS but in that case once you have a hundred then you can have like hundred thousand TPS right at the same time but but the issue is like sort of when we talk about liquidity like software we divide the liquidity into multiple Rolex at the same time probably we didn't realize you mentioned we can have various like mitigation ways against me but at the same time I believe it can also create a bunch of these Arbitrage or different ways across different like low labs to extract values sort of create more difficulty for these boards or like sort of the people want to extract values across different roll ups yeah yeah exactly like um so on the GPS point I think is so increasing the number of block space you sell is not a direct mitigation to Mev it's more like uh like like solving the time preference of family you guys think like yeah yeah yeah it's sort of like just uh create a little bit more like difficulty for for you to run the mevm because the thing like if everything within a single chain right like ethereum probably as you mentioned right all the algorithms on the Mev side they can be directly applied on these sort of smart contracts but right now once you have multiple relapse and you just create more difficulties for you to cross different low lives uh-huh uh yeah and and then the next question would be something like uh as you know right that kind of feel announced that it is a plan to build this single unifying option for Value expression right um yeah at that time like we we only know the name and I also know some of the descriptions um and right now I think uh it's already sometime after the announcement right can you share a little bit more about it and like sort of how it will be helpful to address the Mev issues yeah yeah um so uh yeah I I think I will be mostly talking about like the technical side how we think the problem with current time in the industry lies and uh about like several ways that you can approach this so for example uh okay so so the thing you mentioned is uh like shown into the Suave single unifying auction for Value expression not extraction but expression expression system yeah okay so so if you think about uh you know the problem with current memory Solutions so one of the like major thing is that it's not expressive enough right so we know that there is a common value and then moving to app change World we're gonna see more common value in existence right however like crypto as a whole what we really want is to encourage more diverse preferences right what is the world we're living if everybody wants the same thing reaction like everybody actually wants different things as a we need to encourage diversity not to eliminate it okay so then there's a deadlock funny deadlock scenario here if you you know you can notice enough so we have a common value and the common value encourages people to not have diverse encourage people to not have expressive mechanisms right so you have a simple mechanism but then once you have a simple mechanism then people who want diverse preferences cannot build applications that encourage or Express those diverse preferences on top right because even if they express those things cannot be aggregated efficiently because you have a simple mechanism right so then like they can only be aggregated or efficiently allocated if you have an expressive mechanism and only by having expressive mechanism you can encourage more people to actually move from common values to diverse preferences and such recover you know what we initially want to achieve using crypto or like what we initially wanted to you know increase our social welfare which can directly be you know and Welfare can directly be reflected by um you know everybody gets a better execution uh or like everybody gains more games less slippage from their trade right so this is a net wing for everybody okay um so one of the path forward is to build this more expressive mechanism than how to build it right we know that uh having more things to say actually in creates a significant mental burden to users right so if so now I like it's time is tarsome enough for me to say oh like I want to execute this trade now maybe you know if I can encode more since maybe I need to say I want to ask you this trade and this trade has to be like you know executed by some kind of this you know this counter priorities that satisfy this property X and like the execution satisfies another property X2 so this raised significant band of burden and also favorite sophisticated users more right so then we want to eliminate this how you know we can still do this by increasing expressiveness so for example uh we know that if we give them a a quantifier say my execution is the best execution that I can ever get out of all of the possible executions in this block then I commit to you know having my transaction being executed okay so you can so this is kind of a template that is universal that is generic right everybody can use this and then once everybody uses this you can uh you know Elite basically eliminate the uh a symmetry between the unsophisticated users and sophisticated users so you both prove the fairness point and also increase the efficiency right because you guarantee that whatever fixed points solution or like whatever like equilibrium you find is in this game it is always going to be providing the best social welfare okay so this is this part um and then concretely what kind of diverse preferences are there are there what kind of monologue if credible value are there uh so moving to an African world we know that cross domain is just you know it's a as I arguably for cross domains where all of the monologue is rather value leaves right so then for sure one of the major things to solve is crosstalking execution across so yeah maybe where where the solution will be everybody you know on everybody can um Can publish the users can publish a credible commitment uh saying that if this predicate gets satisfied then I commit to my transaction getting executed so notice this is similar to the more expressive language we talked about before right and then this commitment leaves in a cross-stoming execution world so on chain a I could say that my transaction uh uh well maybe so on both on chain a and chain B so then I can publish a smart a commitment saying that if uh both you know you might I don't know like Arbitrage guess executed both of my lab both legs of my Arbitrage that get executed then I will pay this much to whatever Searcher on each domain the list is uh you know a an expression and then I further constrained that the both executions that I get on each domain is the best execution that is possible right so you can do something like this um okay so these are the express expressing this part and also the cross domain part so those things are aimed at eliminating the uh eliminating the monarchy thread value and improved finish so what about mafia's travel value and Mafia is basically like agent has informational symmetry so uh typically people have been talking about other flow auctions a lot so so uh so we know even in try to find we see payment for others right like so I buy some like retail orders from you and since I know it's retail so I know I can give them a you know a better a tighter slippage and however we I know that it's more noisy trades so then I can trade against those people answering can't you know generate profit right so this is how Robin include or opinion for other floating in traffic fireworks and then you know people have been talking about other flow auctions open other flow options which is I express basically option of my order flow to another bidders and then I take the highest speed and then that person gets to execute or trade against this uh this piece of other flow okay so this is how people usually think about those so we have also thought about this a lot and uh so I think the current conclusion or like uh yeah so the current conclusion uh I have is that the most ideal way to solve this is to calculate uh what I to calculate each agent's transaction's contribution to the satisfaction of another agent's transactions preference and then have this value be added together which we call like the agent's contribution or and then like have this contribution to be an implicit option so um so there was this notion in coffee Game Theory called chapter value which basically quantifies how much contribution that your transaction will like your supply has to set the satisfaction of this whole Coalition or like a coalitions of Agents uh preferences satisfaction right so if you think about this what what the user's order is doing is that uh having my other Supply satisfies the demand of uh another Searcher right that Searcher wants to fail against me and then I satisfied but I need to get compensated so previously I didn't get compensated now if I get compensated then it's fine right because you know I make sure I get strictly more money from you know any kind of you know like random execution or like any other execution okay um so the the way a pro we approach this is to calculate each agent's contribution with something and with some all of them together as in this thing if we assume there is only a automatic market makers in uh for example like in after lab then this approach is uh equivalent to doing an explicit other flow option but without all of the externalities right so you can see like this is a more generic solution and also you can reuse the same auction for any kind of uh well at this point it's less like an auction but more like a generic mechanism right allocation mechanism so then we can reuse the same mechanism for any kind of at least for any kind of Roll-Ups you know whatever application it is and also for the cross domain thing right we don't need to devise a specific mechanism for every wrap which you know we know that generic having generality is good right ethereum one because of generality yeah yeah but at the same time do you think we need some like sort of Hardware to help to enforce like sort of the encrypted manifold and to help like like sort of achieve some of the goals as you mentioned yeah yeah oh yeah yeah exactly great question uh so incredibly Memphis is for sure something needed at the current stage at least so I uh yeah so theoretically I believe it is possible to uh you know not have four or take privacy and still eliminate me or achieve social wealth but at the current stage due to you know the limitations of uh you know we can't Implement elaborate mechanism we need some kind of privacy so uh so for example the simplest thing is that you want faithful execution of the mechanism by the coordinator right you don't want the blob Builder to be able to still sandwich you and not pay you the right amount right you actually want the guy to execute the allocation mechanism that I mentioned before so then this comes down to verifiability of computation so it is not exactly privacy so we can call this like something like programmable privacy which means it's like a fair execution and yeah yeah Fair like like yeah you verifiable execution right so we can implement this through things like uh uh I don't know I I I'm PC or sgx they both work right they verify that you're executing is Facebook or like you know fully homomorphic encryption if you are talking about the future right yeah yeah yeah yeah so so we can see like uh where my privacy is needed and uh like the private part is not only for probability but more for but also for like there's no exogenous or like out of system way that the person can act previously based on it right because that that is what pretty much why I want privacy yeah yeah sounds great and uh and at the same time right as you know like uh I know flash ball has been done a lot of like this kind of uh Mev sort of uh mitigation stuff since day one right um but as the researcher or developer so what kind of uh stuff we can help you guys or collaborate on like in our opinion yeah yeah great question because uh we were previously talking about Apple's app specific Roll-Ups right so um so that is something that sits between the infrastructure layer and the application layer so moving forward my take is that it is vital for not only the survey not only for solving I mean we not only for like uh you know creating uh you know some future of no Mafia and no monologue but also for the survival of this whole industry in like a recent you know developments right yeah yeah it's be like we really need good applications that justify the survival of crypto to say you know uh governments or Regulators right because uh otherwise all the applications people are gonna say are gonna see is that oh oh it's being like I don't know 10 years of crypto and the only thing you guys have got is artists like Ponzi casinos and you know that doesn't look good yeah some Fallout of the exchanges yeah yeah some Fallout of these changes that doesn't look good so we need like real applications so I think that is some something we should work on uh working together right as the community and you know um so so basically think about uh what kind of application that is specific to the unlock of this more expressive mechanism right because uh previously as I argued right if you assume you can only operate in common value settings um uh then you don't have much mechanism to explore right you don't have much application to explore because you are restricted to only being able to aggregate common values and this is made sure by us previously not having an expressing mechanism us only having a very primitive version of the mechanism AKA like block space auction or like even before that like random ordering or like Fair ordering right so then like after the unlock of those mechanisms people are really able to express those diverse preferences and I would really love to see like applications that utilize those diverse preferences right like you can imagine like the set of mechanisms you can explore is like vastly more and there's like probably our arbitrary amount of welfare that you can or economic efficiency that you can gain from those new mechanisms uh right and uh I mean that is pretty much why we initially wanted crypto so you know it's time to get back to it yeah that's true and then back to our last question and that I also think that's the most fun question like as you know right we are doing these alternative views like do you have any new um non-moon stream advice you want to leave our listeners with yeah yeah uh so this one I don't know if it's uh yeah it's certainly not mainstream but uh uh I don't know if it's controversial it's uh so so my personal take is that so uh scaling is like so so we know that the community of crypto has focused extensively on skating in the past right we as Justified or yeah yeah more years right like so scaling if you think about it it's saying that oh people can operate within this common value scenario but then I make them I I make the division the allocation of those common value scenarios faster right so if you imagine the set of mechanisms is like a hundred percent this is the the applications that you can build so uh the value of the mechanism that you can do in common value scenario is like one percent and the scaling is saying we solve those one percent better okay uh okay so then what you the contrarian view or like the uh non mainstream review is in that oh like so unlocking the 99 of the pie and researching on how to cut the pipe fairly is better than only focusing on one percent of the pie and throwing the 99 of the payout you know uh and you know cut this one percent of the pie faster right because that is like you know scaling Solutions too right you can't multiply faster not not even necessarily fairly okay so then like you know what we should do is first not through the 99 of the pi out as a secondly uh you research on how to cut the pipe fairly yeah yeah it's a great opinion like like regarding the 99 percent of the pie right what do you think we can do with 99 percent of Pi what's that yeah yeah I mean that that is like you know the vital you know the survival bit of our industry in the next few years that is what we all need to work on so so I've asked a lot of people on this so uh I've heard some promise interactions although uh so for example I like why didn't supply chain take off right like why didn't you know all those like International contracts um right they are all applications it is there it's because like previously we didn't solve this monologue Extra Value problem we didn't solve the expression aggregation problem um right we didn't justify how much value we could provide and so in future we probably uh need to see more you know diverse preferences enabled applications yeah yeah that's amazing my opinion yeah yeah for the past few years I sort of personal time with her ball like this kind of opinion it's amazing yeah yeah thanks a lot like so basically uh it's it's a sort of a great like time to basically we discuss about the Meb and the various like ideas around the Mev and uh and also a great thanks to our listeners to listen and as you know right we really appreciate your time at the same time if you really want to know more about the industry especially the technical parts around these sort of Layer Two scalability And also the crypto industry and just um like uh can post it and we will just have more content for you and uh yeah we will just uh sign off into the next time yeah thanks everyone yeah thanks thanks a lot [Music] thank you
