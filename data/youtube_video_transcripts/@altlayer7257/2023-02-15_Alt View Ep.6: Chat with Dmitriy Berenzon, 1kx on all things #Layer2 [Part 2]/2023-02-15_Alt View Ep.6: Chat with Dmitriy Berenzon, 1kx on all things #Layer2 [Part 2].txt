[Music] yeah that's amazing as you mentioned right so it's uh uh yeah right now cross roll up messaging or or basically data transfer protocol right it's uh it's a really sort of the crucial part um once we have multiple roll ups especially we discuss about it also the applications specifically wrote up right so um yeah in the worst case they can uh sort of go where ethereum okay I want to do the message sort of passing but the cost is just too high it'll be great like as you mentioned right we can do some native um like sort of cross um roll up message passing especially in protocol level so the security guard guarantee can be much better otherwise we already have so many bridges systems right most of them are relayer based even somehow sometimes we call them optimism sorry optimistic library but yeah it's optimistic but the these still have uh sort of attacks from the malicious users so that that's not something we want in the long run once we have so many real apps yeah and then like like I would like to um like jump deep into some of the uh factors we discussed around this um application chainsaw application roll ups um as you just discussed right the composibility is uh big I mean probably one of the most crucial uh factors when we think about whether we should move the application from a general purpose to L1 or L2 into a dedicated action right so and and do you firmly believe that we have to have it I mean for uh application chain or application your lab um because like sort of some users like who argue that for for a lot of uh scenarios like basically uh defy it even for D5 right it's it's not that um highly automatically associated with the composability um and the the beauty of the device is really about the non-kyc nature as we all know right so we just use metamask and do all the swap or even do the trading or dividendx or some other like Perpetual exchanger right and the people enjoy the most enjoying part is is really about the non-qis in nature I do think we can um like sort of uh have the uh 10 possibility uh like like sort of offer some different application without comparability in the near future or how do you feel about the composibility in the kyc the D5 uh you know post tornado cash word yeah yeah I think it's an important um question I I would clarify from like my view I think like sure not in kyc is is really great like you could uh reframe that in a more positive light around like having access to like Global Capital flows um uh at the speed of the internet and just like not um waiting for some like t plus X settlement time yeah so so like it it opens up like it democratizes the the supply side of capital provisioning and it gives people around the world um an opportunity to partake in um uh these like Financial activities that were previously like gatekeeped um that's the word um by um like private institutions uh anything like that's a really important um uh benefit um uh but as D5 becomes more mainstream for a lot of those institutions they simply can't trade with um an unknown counterparty um so yeah a lot of them probably need some some notion of kyc um uh I don't know how this is gonna look like like with Ave Arc I don't know what attraction they've had um with like these institutions um uh I I think it would be nice to like move like stay on public blockchains public ethereum I don't think we need to recreate private blockchains um uh but if you have a way to um yeah like kyc um uh users within your protocol I think you could still have a way to do composability within an app change just like worse it's like friction to get on there um like I mentioned before if you have a way to like token gate um based on some like uh sawbound token non-transferable token um that has let's see credentials um and you have a way to do that for like protocol Founders you could probably have some like um permissioning where like users could trade developers could write on some app chain given that they have this like credential that um shows that they're kyc um uh so like within that space like you just got to get over there once you're over there you have all the benefits of like composability and uh and stuff like that um in general like I think it's it's nice because it does um uh promote this notion of like permissionless Innovation um I think it is also um it's it's used in practice like you know like a maker I mean like uh liquidation you know like like you're using uni swap or or like a compound liquidation you know like you're you're doing some Atomic transaction um uh uh using like uni swap um and if you did not do that then the result is the like the Liquidators take credit risk I guess um yeah yeah so like like to what extent does a liquidator want to take uh credit risk because the nice part about it now is you need like zero dollars in capital because it's all flash flooding you have unlimited dollars in the same block um so you could probably have some trade-off there between composability atomicity and just like credit risk but it does introduce like systemic risk into the system um and and and so like ideally you preserve it um uh but there will probably be teams that explore that design space and corporates that explore that design space and and say like we want to launch a polygon supernet with three validators that we control and and it's going to be a payments use case and and we um that's all we want it for and and and maybe for their end users like like that'll be enough um but I would hope that uh we find a way to like move to um a more like fluid system I think that'll just be better for innovation yeah you just mentioned about it's a payment system right actually another um like uh big example is a dydx the Perpetual exchange we all know that lastly all right dydx move out of uh ethereum ecosystem to build its own by application chain using customer service IDK right probably to provide better user experience and also to make it more decentralized and to have better value capture as you mentioned right so they can use CDR token as probably the underlying gas token or for the by sort of the gas fees and also for the transaction fees right um but it's just one use case in the ethereum ecosystem so we all know that we still have like unit swap compound RV and also uh synthetics right so in how many why like sort of what's the factor stopping the other major application to move to a dedicated chain right so we all know that there's so many benefits especially for the token value uh capture right for if they move from the uh a dab ethereum to a dedicated action right why like sort of they didn't move to a dedicated app chain but instead they are having multiple clones on different evm chains right so like the chains are either itself even for audio tools like optimism and RB trauma and sometimes also on polygon Avalanche they just have multiple clones and as you mentioned right it's basically we have the fragmentation of the liquidity if you just deploy multiple clones on different chains and the bridge to be honest is it's not great I would say it will have like probably tons of bridges but the security guarantee is not that good so but but if they can just have a dedicated chain right they don't have all the issue right they can just aggregate all the liquidity and also aggregate all the users right into a dedicated engine like divided X so so in opening um actually I'm also thinking about why they they just have all the Clones instead of having a dedicated like sort of app chain so what what's your thoughts on these yeah yeah I mean for dydx their word to my understanding I've been spoken with anyone from the team they're they're there were also some technology choices they had to make um I struggled with uh developing with Cairo um yeah I mean I think like a shared like um order book um uh that was um propagated like P2P amongst um like a network of validators um that is like a very specific Choice um uh that probably made sense for them um the reason why I think other teams aren't doing it is probably a couple of reasons um it's interesting to look at the other side of the trade-off around um uh performance like as a benefit um I mean I'd like you do introduce um end user friction like it changes the like the end user ux um uh most people uh like even the even the UI today you need to go to separate UI to bridge some app chain and so if you want to like I don't know have like a game um on like one um like roll up or subnet um uh uh to have that experience where a user um like goes to a different UI Bridges funds um uh jumps back in the game like it removes you from the game you know like it's not a very nice experience especially for like a retail user um ideally the bridging itself is baked directly in the UI um that's probably like a better way to do it um but I think that's just like really scary um for D5 protocols like the benefit that you get from ethereum is a very secure settlement layer and if you have like billions in tvl like do you want to take that risk to um have recursive security that's based on your token because like if the edge case your token goes to zero your app chain has zero security the validators it's like there's incentivize you just like Take the Money and Run um yeah that's a good point yeah if you grow to like 10 trillion TBL you know or or do you prefer to be on a very very secure battle-tested settlement layer that has 400 000 pockets um so like four D5 protocols I think they have like a little bit of a higher um barrier or like like a lower tolerance for low securityating Securities like a particularly um important pain point for like um so again like that is less of an issue with a roll-up um worst case with a single sequencer you have a liveness failure if that sequencer goes Rogue and it's not like posting um uh uh like State routes to like a day layer or like the proofs yeah and then it's like some awful like experience to like have your end users like I don't know manually like recover fundaments um but they're not going to lose funds just like kind of stuck um uh so like you could partly solve that but like it still does introduce some risk to uh like the user um and then the last part is the notion of like inventory or liquidity um where uh if you are like a nft Marketplace like if you take the thought experiment of saying like you are building your own app chain as a nft Marketplace you build it you're like all right great we have it like now what like we have to get nfts how are we going to get the NFL we have to like convince all the like the the like artists and uh and and and musicians on I don't know like polygon uh it's like Bridge their nfts to my uh app chain so users buy them but most users are on open C right now anyway so like how are you um so so it's uh it's a really tough like Network effect to to get away from that and you have to have like a really good reason or like a very valuable reason to take users um away from an ecosystem that already has a lot of like inventory and liquidity like you probably need to have a way to have your own and like that's I think what uh axi did with Ronin um uh saying the role it's like a side chain but they were able to get users on there because they had IP that content that again that was like fun enough for users to say like I'm gonna like do that and and like bridge over um uh so I think like it it needs to be um uh like a very good reason um otherwise like you're not going to hold on icic yeah I got a point it's actually the security part as you mentioned right for me it's like uh the ethereum plus defect protocols right they are building another we don't say it's a replacement we we can say it's a alternative to Swift system right it's faster and uh cheaper I would say yeah typically like when we transfer across countries or borders uh T2 plus is a minimum I I typically I tried like over one week and sometimes I have to answer the phone calls from the bank otherwise I just couldn't receive my phone yeah it's uh it is when we say that we have to wait for like 15 blocks for information right but it's so faster like two minutes right two minutes we can get our like fund conformed and uh and basically we can also withdraw with various channels yeah it is very very convenient yeah yeah and ethereum isn't closed on Saturdays and Sundays it's like yeah yeah it's a 24 7. it's 24 7 and it's always working um yeah so I I think the security guarantee probably the most important part especially as you mentioned right once the TBR is beyond like sort of uh uh a number and then it's better that your system itself at least the system itself the sort of the fdv is higher than the TBR right otherwise it doesn't make sense like to rerun the defy protocol on this system as you mentioned right because TBL is hair then the attacker has enough incentives like basically to purchase enough tokens and to attack your system and basically just just try to take it over and then probably just grab all the money into his own pocket into his own token at that time like in design basically it's uh it's fun it should be fun because in design it's sort of indesigned that way you cannot treat it as an attack it's just like it is like the system is is a is held by the sort of uh probably uh two-thirds or even the super majority of the stakes of the token holders right like once they control product I actually they have the sort of voting power to decide like how to handle the protocol itself especially uh the tokens on the protocol it's like they can throw the ball that they can make the decision of of the future of the protocol um yeah and and yeah as you mentioned right we discussed a lot around like sort of the actions and your labs and we also share about a bunch of the concerns and uh um and also the necessity of the bridges I know like you you did a blog post even earlier right back in 201 right so talking about bridges I believe for the past two years there are a lot of like sort of uh achievements and also improvements on the bridges side right so what do you think about our current Bridge space um like like what are the remaining issues of the existing bridges yeah yeah I mean I think there is still this fundamental struggle between security and extensibility uh I think the gold standard of like secure Bridges is probably like a Lifeline bridge where you're able to um verify that the consensus of some destination chain and you have the data of the state route uh state tree storage tree um and and you're able to do like a lot of like very interesting things like with the richness of that data um but the issue has been you know it's very gas intensive to verify um say like signatures of like uh like a tenurement validator set and uh to uh uh verify like a miracle proof on chain because hashing is um uh quite gas in terms of if you have like the Merkel tree was like like several layers of depth um I think it's been like a lot of cool innovations that set a or do you just like stuff it in a snark um uh you could either so so then you verify the snark instead of like the remote um um so so you could do that um or in like the gold standard you um put both the uh like the proof and um uh like the like the signatures um uh in uh zkp solving um and we've seen that in like select cases from like one channel this is like usually like teams that are just working on like bilateral Bridges um but then when you think about like the number of um roll apps and sudden deaths here's like that we can do the permutation right like the permutation explodes so how are you going to catch up and do like all of those connections with like the safest flavor of bridging um that's like a really hard problem um so so I don't quite know like what the best way to like to solve it is um like the tension is that um developers prefer security but users prefer sensibility oftentimes like users don't really know or care unfortunately um uh and so like that's been a really tough uh thing to uh to Grapple with um so yeah I think we're we're at like a very interesting um development Point um where where we're we're trying to build like safer Bridges but we're also trying to do it in a way where it gives like some bare minimum like extensibility where you're like you're connecting at least like the biggest ecosystems and and um yeah I think we're we're not quite there yet um but there's still a lot of very interesting teams built on this space icic I I think you are the first like sort of guest I'm mentioning about the gas cost actually it's uh to be honest we all know that I treat uh for teams Building Bridges we know that the gas limit is a huge like basic headache for all the teams you know um yeah because like even we have the implementation ready but if the block gets limit like cannot execute the contract or connect cannot execute the uh like sort of the logic right then basically the implementation doesn't work um for most of the things as you mentioned right actually there are like clients if we really want to do the like client verification the logic I mean verification is huge uh probably um ziki can be a good way but we can do the ZK proof like sort of off chain right and the only do the verification of the proof in that case like we make uh sort of the logic change and also gas cost uh to the minimum yeah but at the same time it's also about the cause itself I said no because some of my friends are working on the ZK Bridge the number they told me that the off-ching computation itself is the cost is very high like sometimes it's even higher than the transaction they want to bridge yeah it's uh that the cost is not on the gas card it's on the hardware like basically you have to rent a lot of AWS GPU machines and that part if you just you need to handle like less than 10 transactions uh it's it's not not like cost efficient but basically we they have to wait probably 400 or like thousand transaction to aggregate enough for transaction fees to cover the cost otherwise like sort of it's a it's not worth it yeah but anyway as you mentioned right I think we are at the stage like we already have a lot of bridges right but there's still a big room for us to basically improve the existing bridging uh system or the bridging uh protocols yeah and the the times that I sort of fly so fast and uh they are still the uh the last question I want to um like to ask you now you know right we are doing these alternative views uh do you have any like sort of new or non-man stream like advice you want to lead to our listeners with like any like sort of alternative views alternative like advice um to the people in this space yeah you know I don't know how non-mainstream it is but I guess not like not everything needs a blockchain and not everything needs a token so like please don't like build another blockchain or launch another token unless you have like a very good reason for it and that you've actually like done your like diligence on it and and um not to say I'm like bearish on both like we are primarily like token Network investors and we believe that like tokens are a business model Innovation and and and public blockchains give you like this decentralized like Global Market for trust as a service uh and and it's like very valuable um but I think uh teams should like really think critically like why a blockchain why in app chain why or roll up um why a token uh and and I think that shouldn't be the first thing you should ask I think the first thing you should ask is like what is a pain point or a user problem that I need to solve and then like like you can work your way from there yeah that's so true I mean it's uh yeah even like we all know right the project probably you talk to a lot you talk much more like sort of projectier than me right when you talk to them you probably always ask the question why you need a token right um but in crypto space I mean for most of the teams actually don't have the like concrete answer for it yeah it's like you know in crypto you have to have a token otherwise how can we survive but they don't really like think about like why we need a token in the first place but I think um as you mentioned I think it's it's both like uh mainstream advice but also number three because right now not many people to really think about the token design token stuff yeah I think it's it's really really uh great conversation uh with you Dimitri and uh yeah thanks a lot thanks a lot for your sharing and also thanks a lot for for your time um and I mean we're all right um to everyone like here who took the time to listen and uh and thank you so much for your time and we really appreciate and I hope you found like this episode very useful in the coming months we are basically uh taking more experts and uh talking about this industry and also L2 Solutions and uh Bridges uh feel free to subscribe this Channel and for some future episodes and uh yeah thanks for your time we are signing off um for the next time [Music] thank you
