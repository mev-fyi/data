okay hello Stephanie um nice to meet you and uh thank you for for coming to all of you thanks so much for having me I'm super looking forward to talk about you know Roll-Ups and roles as a service today so let's start with a quick intro so uh why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself um what brought you to the so-called crypto land uh and we'll touch a little bit on your journey at Masari and what you basically what excites you these days at Missouri yeah sure um so I got into crypto about uh three four years ago um I started out as a technical writer um and I used to just write uh grants about you know all types of different Technologies um mostly grant writing also as a documentation um and I just kind of got in through the back door writing about you know blockchain was one of the technologies that I covered um and then in about 20 2019 um I became aware of public blockchains uh so not just you know permission ones and learned about ethereum um and you know really fell in love and uh decided to go you know go all in on the public sector um and I started to you know ghost write white papers and documentation and things like that for different teens um and about two years ago I joined Masari um as an intern um I I really wanted to get a better understanding of both um the you know economic side of crypto as opposed to just the technology and how it works um and so started my journey was it real internship was an internship as in the crypto internship it was like a it was like a contract internship um so we used to have this program called the Hub uh where we have I'm sorry there's these asset profiles uh that you know there's free you can go and read all about um a token and the project and how it works and so you could just pick up um just a different asset profiles you could write about uh so I think the first one I wrote about uh was Radical um as well as space chain um and just there's a ton of questions there that were you know not just you know how does this blockchain function and how many nodes are there but also you know what are all the crypto economic things around it uh so pick that up um and then eventually was invited full-time and I spent my first uh year year and a bit at massari in our professional asset due diligence team um and became you know really focused on uh you know legal and Regulatory kind of concerns and you know decentralization or lack thereof in a lot of cases um and about six months ago I finally turned to being public facing on the Enterprise team um where my interests mostly lied again on blockchain infrastructure so you know back to the kind of tech technicals but also I really like to think about how to measure decentralization and see where we're at industry-wide in terms of you know some of our goals with decentralization but what we really are today um and one of those things is you know obviously um one of my interests is obviously scalability um within the infrastructure section so you know really for me L1 L2 doesn't really matter I'm just really curious about how blockchains work and you know how we can scale to reach as many users as possible and do you also look on the app side as well or mostly on the at the infra level um sometimes I look at the outside um I I cover live peer uh as well as that's an an app that I cover frequently I've been calling them for about a year with quarterly reports um it was super interesting to see them you know move from uh ethereum to to arbitrum with some of their scaling woes um and in the future you might see me covering other apps as well um but but mostly infrastructure for the time being well today's sessions will be mostly about Roll-Ups and particularly your piece on the Rolex service ecosystem I think that you published a few days ago probably a week ago I think um but before we dig into it could you please tell our audience what Roll-Ups are and what makes them interesting sure um so so Roll-Ups um you know are a scalability solution um you you know you have you know at this point in time we have a lot of you know general purpose l1's so things like you know ethereum um where you know most uh applications are built as smart contracts on top of that um so a problem with that is that all of these applications are now competing uh for Block space so for completing competing uh to get their transactions processed um you know when there's only fine out fine item out of block space and so with that uh you get congestion issues you know fees Rise um and you know we have to think of alternative Solutions you know how can we you know fit more um transactions into our finite amount of blocks uh so Roll-Ups represent a scaling solution where we're scaling vertically um so you're effectively you know you're you're kind of ripping apart uh one piece of the blockchain stack uh so well sometimes two but for Simplicity execution so the execution of transactions uh you know Rises to a different layer um and within that um you know you the the this could be you know general purpose uh so something like an arbitrum or an optimism where other app um sorry where other applications can launch uh smart contracts on top um or it could be you know app specific uh where it's only a specific one app uh and and one execution environment but what's interesting is that it's just the execution is at this level whereas you know consensus and data availability is handled uh by a level below so so in the example we just mentioned ethereum um so with that um you it makes it um you know you're only focusing on one part of the stack so you can really optimize your resources for that and also you don't need to necessarily have you know a validator set um to process those transactions you have something called sequencers and we'll get into that a little bit later as well um but at the end of the day um these sequencers then go and compress those transactions into you know a smaller piece of data and report it back to the underlying layer so they're you know less competition for black space on L1 and you know and no composition for blocks or less competition for Block space on L2 as well sorry that was it's kind of hard to make it into you know a short uh explanation for some reason you have you have a sort of external network uh which is composed of sequencers that basically process your transactions and um you have the underlying chain that kind of secures those transactions some way essentially so you're kind of moving off the traffic from L1 to the L2 side exactly but you know some people argue that you know you know Roll-Ups are Roll-Ups only if they are secured by ethereum uh especially the da part side of things so if you're using da like let's say like Celestia as a UDA or some other external DA's you know availability uh you know Network would you still consider that as a Roll-Up yes absolutely sorry my example was just ethereum specific um but you know Roll-Ups can be um in pretty much any ecosystem so today uh you'll have things like Celestia you know rule kit um as well as you know Dimension um uh Sega and Eclipse I believe are all building Roll-Ups uh within um more so of like the Celestia family or you know that can communicate with IBC so in kind of the cosmos family as well um so really roll ups are are any way to process or execute transactions you know in a different layer and Port back um to a different layer for consensus and data availability and it doesn't just have to be ethereum for sure okay so um now this is a kind of a controversial question and I'm going to drop names here because I was interesting to a c from dragonfly his uh I think founding partner or managed partner dragonfly um and he recently commented I think he was doing an interview with someone and he during that podcast commented the ethereum foundation took the roll-up route for scalability after years of research on charting only because sharding was deemed too difficult to implement or something along those lines so basically that was the the essence of what he was saying uh so I'm not trying to paraphrase here but basically he said that you know it's because it was you know you had a running system running L1 minute and trying to kind of implement sharding you know was quite difficult and I completely understand is where he's coming from and therefore he argues that roll-up kind of came as a way to kind of circumvent that problem what are your thoughts on this do you feel like there could be a better L1 that you could design maybe not now but in future that could somehow compete uh with Roll-Ups uh for scalability or do you think that there's something else or both have you know places in this world um so yeah I'm pretty neutral um on that view I think in general I'm you know I'm pretty I'm pretty neutral I I believe that there's space you know for all um I think for now uh Roll-Ups are you know our best shot at scalability uh for most networks and for for more most use cases but that doesn't mean that in the future you know or there's our other existing l1s that can um you know compete uh but there's always that challenge of you know how do you fit how do you fit more transactions into finite block space right um so I think that I don't think that the I I just don't see it as kind of a war of you know is it you know an alternative uh one or is it Roll-Ups I think that in the large large scheme of things you're probably going to see uh kind of what you know optimism refers to as the super chain um you know they're more so referring um to a collection um you know of of uh Roll-Ups that are connected with a shared sequencer set you know being the super you know the super chain in the optimism world but I imagine you know a super chain of you know a bunch of different L ones a bunch of different Roll-Ups and we're going to find a find ways to you know communicate between them uh varying levels of you know security among those bridges depending on you know where you're connecting to um and they're lost different trust assumptions involved but I think that when you're when you're a developer building in this space you need to think about you know what are the exact requirements of your app or of your network and then make this that decision from there but I don't think it's going to be you know Winner Takes all in the L1 world or in the world up world and do you feel like I mean it's a follow-up question do you feel like in the next five years or so there'd be enough demand for all the block space that being created through different l1s l2s or l3s do you feel like there would be enough demand or do you feel like we are preparing for something that might come in let's say 10 years time it's a good question I mean well certainly demand you know it comes uh sometimes with Market cycles and as we've seen you know demand was super high about you know a year year and a half ago um and you know ethereum was largely unusable or like a lot of networks are kind of reaching their limits and so we needed to think about you know how do we scale beyond that but you know time's quieted down and you know um but the time's quieted down and so you know it Ebbs and flows but I really do believe that you know the ethos of crypto being too you know um decentralize everything for all people is a powerful narrative and I don't think it's going to go away so will there be enough demand in five years to service you know all the block space that's being created from you know all of these you know Roll-Ups and roles of service providers I think you know only time will tell but what's interesting about Roll-Ups you know for something like Altair for example is that you know it doesn't have to be you know when you're deploying a roll up you don't have to just deploy a general purpose one and say oh you know where where's all my users you can have a very specific need like an nft mint um you know or a specific game that you know that you have the demand for you know within your um you know within your community and then you can build the role up specifically for that um so I think that that's what's really interesting about Roll-Ups is that because an app specific rollup is because you're not you know you're because it doesn't need to be a shared execution of our environment with others you know you're not like necessarily looking for demand you can already kind of create something almost out of thin air that will service the demand that you already need and also you know this this demand as you said you know it comes in EPs and cycles and we have seen that you know no one would have imagined D5 before D5 summer people are experimenting with things but suddenly you know within a matter of months or weeks you know your liquidy mining came in and everything started to blow off quite quickly yeah I think I agree with you that you know this could change quite rapidly you know especially when you're dealing with a with a you know Tech space that is rapidly moving you know that can change any literally now uh moving to kind of you know there are different kinds of Roll-Ups you know you kind of mentioned that in your in your post as well uh you call them smart contract uh Roll-Ups apps specific Roll-Ups and server and roll-ups um but there's one of these Roll-Ups that actually create a lot of conflicts with people building app chains right for example which is the app specific rollups so one can you give a first give a sense of what is the difference or let's say pros and cons between of let's say uh an app specific roll up and an app chain first so uh could you could you tell us a little bit more about that what's the difference between the two and the pros and cons of them sure um so so an app chain um is so what what similar about them is that they're you know app specific um so for for a particular application um an app chain um though it's its own full blockchain so meaning you know all parts of the stack so that would be um you know a chain in the cosmos ecosystem or in the polka dot ecosystem whereas an app specific roll-up um is you know it's uh generally you know an execution or an execution and settlement roll up um that you know is connected to an ecosystem um as roll-up as opposed to you know have handling all of um the different layers of the stack so what that means is that for an app chain you need to you know find source validators so as a developer you need to think you know who's going to operate my chain um you know what are the incentives going to be around that um you know what is the staking mechanism going to look like um all within you know a certain framework um so you know app teams are often two very common type of app chains are you know within the cosmos SDK or you know sub substrate for polka dot um but some so the pros of both is that you are not worrying about um you know sharing block space with other types of applications because it's app specific um but the cons about something you know like an app chain is that you know you have to find those validators um and it it's a little it's at the end of the day less customizable than a roll-up um so even though Roll-Ups are still kind of in theory uh you'll be able to customize you know all different parts of the stack right so you could use um you know Solana VM for execution for example which is something that eclipse is targeting um or you could you know use really anything for execution and then rely on um any other networks of you know ethereum or Celestia or polygon Avail for consensus and data availability and you can really kind of figure out what works within your particular use case um so they both serve specific needs um but I think that you know the the reason why Roll-Ups um are the most versatile are strictly because you know you can just do so much more with them um and you are so burdened with having to you know handle all parts of development and operation including a validator set so I was uh you know trying to I was I was on Twitter some couple of days back and then I noticed that someone asked a question I think found I found very interesting which was and his question was um that what is one thing that you can do with app I don't know Roll-Ups app specific Roll-Ups or generally Roll-Ups that you can't do within an app chain and I felt like because an app app specific Roll-Ups or general Roll-Ups are tied to an L1 in some way you have this possibility to basically destroy your roll up whenever you want if you wanted to right and when that destruction happens or you dispose your chain all the assets that were there on that roll up can actually be moved back to the L1 right this this one thing that I felt you can't do with an app chain because there's nothing to go to essentially right it's like you know you are kind of a sovereign chain you know you you if you destroy you basically have to somehow get rid of all the assets it can't go anywhere so I think there's there's also this benefit that um you're not just deriving security from an L1 but you also have this base chain of some sort where you can go to at some point if you wanted to so in some way app change an app you know apps scroll up also gives you one thing that potentially I feel uh you know app chains can't offer you in technical terms um but in terms of how would you position subnets do you feel like these are these are app teams or or because you know one point that you mentioned that you know you have to figure about figure out you know you validated said you know how to worry about stakers and whatnot somehow subnets try to simplify that and say you know you can basically tap into into the existing uh you know network of nodes that are running let's say the C chain I think it's called uh you know somehow Cosmos is trying to kind of get some of that bit as well but would you see would you say that that probably would still persist if you can have a shared security model coming to app change from some base chain so a full disclosure I'm not super familiar with Avalanche subnets um but I do think it's interesting that they kind of have um you know that option of having the shared validator set um if I recall correctly I read through the documentation it was it was a while ago uh the bridging was interesting to me um I remember reading in their docs somewhere that bridging was through um some kind of you know just like a regular bridge which kind of doesn't make sense because you think that if there's a shared validator sets that you could have that optimicity but I I do remember reading that this was like you know six months or a year ago so I'm not sure if it changed so if you have um if you know the Avalanche subnets you know do have that Atomic composability somewhat similar to um you know a roll-up ecosystem with shared uh shared sequencers I think that that's really interesting but as far as I remember from before um bridging was the biggest question for me because I think that it doesn't really make sense you know to have the shared security but then rely on you know Bridges or traditional bridges that could run into problems um but again don't quote me on that um so it's a good point because I mean they do have shared values set um but the bridge uh again as far as remember it's uh you know Hardware based uh security module you know that secures the bridge but it's a very important you know if you have a shared security model you can actually tap into a much better Bridge other than relying on our you know a classical multi-sex Style Style Bridge a very good point now there's there's one more thing that you know I kind of feel very strongly about and you know I want to get your thoughts on this as well so uh if you look at app chain sdks you know such as sticky or pole kind of SDK substrate they were kind of supposed to make launching of new chains easier right by abstracting away you know the consensus protocol the peer-to-peer networking components and so on and I remember you know Gavin would have this video where you could actually go and build a substrate based team within I don't know 10 minutes or 20 minutes something like that it was it was very fast and that was very moving in some way when we actually go and see that video so you feel like it was very powerful and yet you know um I think it was D5 sum of income compound you know the lending protocol application that decided that they should go and build they would go and build an app chain using substrate but that got abandoned about a year later and now very recently I think not really very recently now it's about a year ago d by D X about six months ago d by DX announced that they're building their app chain uh The dyd Exchange but that feels like it's going to still take about a year and a half so maybe sometime end of this year it will it will be launched now um how do you think if app chains that were that came up with all these sdks if they were not able to deliver a fast and good developer experience and if it still takes about a year and a half to build a build an L2 or a app chain like what's missing like how can app specific rollups be better uh from a developer perspective than than app genes an app chain sdks so I think what we know what's really interesting about you know roles as a service or you know the sector in general is that you know you're going to have you know your sdks there's a number of projects that are focusing on roll-up sdks um but at the same time you know there is a little bit uh less complexity involved um you know as you mentioned it's not the sdks are covering you know only a certain part of the stack so you know execution um sometimes settlement as opposed to also having to think about um you know the underlying layers as well um but what the way that you know roll up as a service uh providers can really provide value in addition to that um is through you know no code deployment and making it even easier um so I think that um for something like um and also just like you know composability within an ecosystem that's you know the atomic composability that might not be attainable in something like like polka dot um or or Cosmos although they do have you know great messaging capabilities um with IBC for example um I think that you know particularly if I recall correctly for compound um they they abandoned the the initiative uh because it was too technically complicated um or it was you know some of the bridging between um you know polka dot as you know to ethereum or something like that they realized that that might be uh you know they the technology was in its infancy um so that you know kind of got abandoned and instead they decided to you know launch compound you know on different evm compatible chains for now um and then something like the aodx um you know it feels like they um they were always a first mover right so they you know joined the ethereum ecosystem in 2018 and launched the first margin trading protocol um and then with you know scalability considerations I think in D5 summer they realize oh my gosh you know like we're processing so so much volume and the the delays and all this is just not really working for us like you know they were one of the first people to jump to L2 um but at the time you know the the out to the roll-up ecosystem or the role of development ecosystem wasn't really mature um it wasn't really about there you know Stark X is what they you know landed upon um and you know that's really helped them you know scale and you know Port users you know off of a main chain ethereum to operate their the platform but you know it came with centralization um you know trade-offs right you know there's the infrastructure is you know operated uh by you know starkware um as well as dydx um so I think that I think that you know had they and so now you know they're moving off to become an app chain and you know they're you want they want to get rid of some of those decentralization trade-offs so so their solution which I believe they decided about a year ago like I think a year ago is when they was announced moving off of L2 um I think that decision came at a time when the you know roll-up development ecosystem just wasn't uh strong enough or wasn't mature enough for them to you know choose an act specific roll-up instead of an app chain at that time um so it made more sense to move to an app chain but you know as we've seen it's now been a year it'll be maybe a year and a half before they launch we don't necessarily know what's going on in the background especially I believe the development is all closed sourced you know for example so we don't know but but I do have a feeling that you know had the decision made been made let's say now um as opposed to a year year and a half ago they may have gone um the app specific roll-up route uh because the tooling and services are now there or are going to be there soon with some of the role of sdks and you know moving into you know a few more months or years in the future these no cold no code roll-up deployments that are going to make it even easier so sorry long story short I think that you know what some of these um roll-up uh you know development kits as well as you know other raft providers bring to the table that make it easier than building an app chain um is that you know we continue to iterate on those and just make it easier and easier over time and there's less pieces to consider as part of the stack as well I mean that's true I mean even though consensus was kind of abstracted away in polka dot or even even in Cosmos a roll-up is even easier in that sense right you know you basically I mean if you're let's say you're running one sequence so let's say uh then you basically have to run a get client essentially right I mean or modified version of that and fraud proofs right now at least in most implementation they don't have you know like op optimistic doesn't have optimism doesn't have a proof it Arboretum has it but in in sort of a permission way I suppose um so some of these things could still be kind of simplified so yes it does become a little bit easier from a tech perspective to build a role up given all the tech side that's already there you know with optimism and arbitrary than than let's say building using a you know full kind of substrate the other I guess the other benefit probably is you if let's say if you're just thinking about evm right so you kind of you know with you know let's say your your you know it's already you know code base and you can just basically Port that quite easily if you are if you're you know let's say your execution engine is essentially VM well if let's if you're building let's say even using Cosmos you still have to kind of make the entire business logic in in the SDK which can be a comparison process or you know time consuming process so yeah hopefully hopefully these things will change uh with some of the work that I guess uh people in the in the roll-up space are doing now um moving to this uh kind of app specific roll-up space right um what sort of applications and use cases do you think would benefit or greatly benefit from launching on an app specific role up from the get-go like from day Zero if they you know like what are the Apple in use which which will really benefit from getting on on the app specific role up from day Zero and the kind of follow-up question would be in what scenarios in what use cases it's just a bad idea like you should really go and build on a general purpose and should not go and even think about an app specific chain um so I think you know the most obvious one that comes to mind uh for something that would make sense right away um from the get-go is something like a gaming um roll up or a gaming app um you know especially with you know a lot of micro transactions and you know a lot going on it doesn't make sense to have to share the block space you know with uh with with anybody else really um and also launching on a roll up um you can the developer can really customize that experience so you don't have to worry about using Gatsby's of the underlying Network you can make an even program having um you know valueless tokens as that gas token and finding different ways to monetize you know where that could be the sale of nfts as skins or something like that um so I think you know right away you know gaming app makes a lot of sense as well as you know what alt layer is doing with the idea of you know and you know elastic um elastic Roll-Ups so something like an nft meant makes sense right like why would you something like you know we've seen it time and time again with you know large nfts it doesn't make sense to do it on L1 ethereum everything gets clogged um and you know people are fighting for that block space just to you know mention nft and it's a very momentary uh period of time where everything just kind of breaks you know so those are the first two that really really come to mind um because they are you know quite resource intensive um I mean gaming over a longer period of time and his teammates kind of right away um but something that might so this is a really interesting question I think about you know some of the downsides or you know what may not work and the first thing that comes to mind and I you know I really it'll be really interesting to see what happens actually with shared sequencer sets um but it's something like a DX right so so in my mind you the one thing you really have to consider um in a role of ecosystem is the potential for for fragmentation um and for the liquidity fragmentation so let's say you have you know a settlement layer here um and then you know a bunch of app specific Roll-Ups here and there's a DX you know up here um does it make sense to have the DX up here um if the communication like you know what if you want to use the tokens over here over here over here right so maybe it makes more sense to have the DX on the settlement layer um and then they could you know the tokens can just be ported up or things change when you have you know the shared sequencers so when you have that you know Atomic uh composability so if there's shared sequencers will the user experience um you know will it be abstracted away for the end user and be so uh easy for them to make a trade and and not know that you know even though the DX is technically here it's you know trading liquidity with apps over here you know so I think it'll be again really interesting to see how it plays out um but first thing comes to mind is you'll have to kind of solve um some of that fragmentation before you go on to some of those D5 use cases um as an app specific Roll-Up yeah definitely I mean I also feel like I mean by definition if you're if it's an app specific rule up it has to be somewhat Standalone right the more Standalone your application is the better it is to to be on an app specific role you know to give an example you know we we host a dark Forest on one of our in-apps like roll-ups and this was about I think September last year and during so we hosted that for two days it's a for those who don't know dark Forces of is a fully on chain game so every single move that you make in the game is actually launching transaction and so during those two days we had about 200 000 transactions came in and that came in and to give yourself that number at that time this was about 90 of the volume that optimism used to do on a daily basis so now imagine like you know you host a game like this on a general purpose team like uh you know arbitrome optimism you know even general purpose L2 like Optimus and arbitrome and if you have this stupid transaction you can call them stupid because you know they don't carry value these are not like D5 transactions they're just simple moves being made in the game and yet that kind of takes a little push of your block space and then you know you would see your you know negative externalities popping up you know gas prices will go up and you somehow you have to figure out you know how to stop this application or somehow you have to kind of modify the game logic in some way so that you would send less transactions somewhere you have to bash and things like that right and so you know transactions you know applicants that drive a lot of small micro transactions whether of value or you know just transactions for record keeping or when you have a on-chain database of some sort which you know I guess dark force does it kind of makes sense to have it you know outside of a base layer of some sort and you know go and build in on your app chain but as you said if you have you know building an application that requires huge compo or there's huge dependency on other other applications then it's best to kind of have in a shared model unless you have a way to kind of take the benefit of you know shared sequences set and then somehow have easy and transparent composability across those uh those chains yeah I completely agree with you it's it's but yeah we'll have yet to see some of these things the benefits of a shared success hopefully in a year's time you'll see that I I think it'll be you know I think today um you know a lot of games um in my time I'm working on um you know professional asset due diligence I saw a lot of games um and within that a lot of the games decide uh well almost all blockchain games now they realize that you know we can't like deal with this block space problem so oftentimes they'll be you know bridging to it to another Network that's you know just you know permission network uh so you know you lose that crypto ethos or just you know it all happens completely off chain and there's no you just kind of have to trust the operator that oh yeah those transactions happen as they should and you know this for a game developer if you want to like that's kind of you always kind of run into that same problem of having to think about taking it off chain but with the roll up you know you get the benefits of Both Worlds you don't have to worry about the constraints of the block space but also it's still you know verifiably happening um and you know each transaction is really accounted for um in a way that is you know I think fair to all users or that you know we can kind of you know at least track and see I think that's a really really great thing to to see in the future I'm really excited to see how many games we'll go that route indeed indeed well I think the next question was something that we kind of touched upon already but I'm going to ask you in case you have some other thoughts on this so um you know when dydx announced their departure I think it was in June last year um there's of course there was a huge debate because you know D by DX is one of the largest you know application on ethereum you know probably next Pros would be uni swap but when they announced this you know of course there was a whole lot of debate around this is a bad idea you know they are ditching the table and what not um but I mean yes they were on kind of an app specific roll up already you know like you know with star you know stock quiz uh you know solution and yes Roll-Ups were not quite there and yes arbitrum and optimism were still building I think they probably lie about it I think if a country called maybe they would have made it already but you didn't have SDK is there if you didn't have sdks to to launch roll ups quite yet and now but you know you have all these you know optimism launched its own SDK a little stack and all that do you feel like and you kind of mentioned this but let's dig a little bit more on this do you feel like the some of the biggest application of ethereum you know will have will kind of move towards towards app Roll-Ups or have specifications in the future or do you feel like no they will probably stick on ethereum because of composable here what not you know that's a really great question I think you know we've already seen um apps in the last couple years have to think about you know how how do we scale and how do we reach more users and how do we you know not you know deal with some of the congestion issues of ethereum and so what we've seen the last couple years is you know a ton of um you know applications will just launch on you a bunch of different chains and just like you know they'll be on you know optimism objective and polygon and I think that's you know that's that's that's one way to do it now um but I think that once it gets easier and easier to deploy Roll-Ups um I think we will just see a lot more experimentation um so that could mean you could have uh something you know like a DX like something like a uni Swap and it'll still be you know on ethereum or on polygon or on all the places that it is but you know eventually in the next couple years and they're like oh hey I could deploy a roll up in a couple clicks I mean I don't want to simplify it I'm sure it'll be a lot more complicated especially with such like you know a large a large system like that but when they realize that the technology is there and you know it's something that they they can do I I don't see why these projects wouldn't also experiment with that so it might not be that right away everybody you know ditches the old model or you know ditches the app chains and ditches you know the liquid fragmented liquidity on different uh on different networks um but I do think we'll just start to see you know a lot of um all of the you know apps we already know and love experimenting with this as well and see if it works for them um and then in the future you know have to make some decisions do we want to move entirely to something like a roll-up or do we want to keep it like this but I think that the more time goes on like far future like you know 5 10 15 years I think that you know the communities will find a way to the I think we're going to kind of solve some of these challenges of fragmentation for liquidity fragmentation with Roll-Ups and share sequencer sets and things like that um and we might see a day where you know everybody moves off of you know layer 1 ethereum and just goes to a roll-up or we might not but I think that sorry that the moral of the story is that I think that everyone is going to experiment with it um I would be surprised if teams were not to or to choose completely against it and you know if you look at dydx in particular right they again you know Roll-Ups were not there quite you know in the form they are today right but you feel like even if dydx tried today to go to go the app specific you know app roller program rather than let's say the app specific route you don't have at least at the moment you don't have decentralized sequences right so uh at least in neither for arbits from nor for optimism and so if you have if you're Dy DX you have a token that you have to somehow you know you have to somehow get it get that token involved in some way right for security and if you don't have a you know decentralized sequence it you know your token kind of gets Limited in some way you can probably only use it for gas token or something of that kind right you feel like until you know you have a decentralized sequencing set sequences that the the tokens that these applicants have will have hard time to find a real utility or you feel like somehow that will that will work out so no I actually don't think so at all um I think that you know with Roll-Ups right you have the the flexibility so you don't need to have you know that validator set and have that staking mechanism like you abstract security away um but that doesn't mean that you kind of lose you know the the use case or the value or uh you know value generation mechanisms of the token um so something I like to think of about like you could you could have let's let's pretend DUI DX example dydx moves to an app specific roll-up um so right now what they are choosing is to you know go to the app chain route and they're going to have validators and they're going to have staking for the dydx token um but within an app specific roll up you know you still have you know tons of you know different mechanisms so you know a you have governance um but B you could have some type of staking mechanism um that might not be for security but that could be to it could be like a security backstop for let's say um something to do with you know a specific pool or you know like an Insurance Fund for loans or you know something like that like it doesn't necessarily have to only be about staking for security um so I think that it just frees up um the possibilities for for different use cases and something like do idx you know it might not need to have you know that you know separate validator sentence taking mechanism like they can derive value in different ways um so I don't think that they're losing out that way I think that they probably moved um you know to Cosmos uh or to an app chain at the time because that is what made the most sense and you know they were always kind of jumping to the you know the best scalability solution at the time um I I don't feel that they were moving to it probably for the staking mechanism itself got it so here's a million dollar question that comes out after this which is sure uh what do you think of the feasibility of of Yuri chain you know dydx has kind of moved out already and I guess the second biggest or the the one of the other biggest application term is in a uni swap um though they kind of operate in different ways you know one is requires a lot more composibility than the other one uh what how do you assess the feasibility of a uni chain whether it be an app chain or an app specific roller what do you think about that so I think it certainly is feasible um obviously uh having to deal with um making sure that liquidity can make it to a bunch of different ecosystems and not just be kind of like you know trapped uh by itself um so you know the shared sequencer set for something like an app specific roll-up would be would be really important there um but I think the value of something like a uni chain um would be mostly you know in in the fees and then the savings for end users right so so right now um as a user of uni swap you know I'm paying the transaction fees um so if I'm paying a fee into the LPS um in some cases I'm gonna be paying a fee to the protocol um and then you know I'm also paying gas fees as well right so I I it's kind of layered on me there and so when you if you're deployed on ethereum obviously you have that problem where you know fees go up with Rising demand also that will happen on you know other networks as well and even you know other uh you know general purpose Roll-Ups as well um so you're always going to kind of run into that problem so with something like uni chain like I think that's a huge value would be that you know you wouldn't have to worry about those fees especially you know if someone wants to trade they don't want to think about like a you know huge percent going to something like fees um and and also for things like Mev right um you know mbv can be it won't necessarily be it won't be reduced but it can certainly be more so controlled and you know beneficial you know for the protocol and its users as opposed to kind of being um you know victim to what's going on kind of around you with a shared execution environment um so certainly I believe that there will be if it were to happen there would certainly be technical hurdles and there's probably a bunch that we haven't you know thought of yet because it hasn't been implemented in practice um but I I'm really excited to see you know where experimentation leads and um it wouldn't be prudent just to necessarily move everything off into you know a specific chain right away um but it'll be really curious to see you know how they how they go about trying that if they are to do so um I think the feasibility is there and you know the details will kind of work itself out in experimentation and okay another follow-up question would be do you think which one of these is more likely from your perspective a unique chain or a dedicated D5 shape I mean in terms of Roll-Ups perspective it's a uni chain roll up or a app or a D5 specific a sector specific roller oh that's interesting um you know that's a really good question um because I mean my point of view is yes you know maybe if you talk about uni swap it's so ingrained you know you know from liquidity you know you want if Unity takes all the liquidity somehow it creates problems for everyone in some way right so the question is maybe the better way is to kind of build a build a roll-up that is purely for defy and uh this way you can actually tap into the liquidity of other protocols uh and so you could have yeah I think are we sitting on the same roll up and driving you know value from that it could be interesting I I'm just something that came to my mind right away was kind of like imagine if there was like a defy um uh like a D5 specific uh you know settlement layer right so you know there are you know some general purpose applications on that settlement layer um as well you know as as well as you know Roll-Ups that attach to it um and so you could have you know your D5 Blue Chips like you could have you know your Ave or your uni swap or you know all the you know the basic services that you need um and then you know on top of that you know Roll-Ups can be you know more Super specific um on top of that um that could be really cool um but you know what at the end of the day it it's all going to come down to experimentation because most if not all of these things are feasible um it's just about kind of figuring out you know whether that be in testnet or a mainnet does this really work for us like is this something that we can do long term are we willing to you know not pay as much attention to our um you know our instances on other chains and move to like this full of fully roll-up centered future or are we not right um and I think you know only time will tell okay now let's go a little bit more on educational side so you know I'm digging into your report that you published recently um I think we discussed that already but in case you have to add something else uh for our listeners and us so you do mention about three types of Roll-Ups and we discussed that kind of a smart contract Roll-Ups which I personally call general purpose l2s or general purpose Roll-Ups and then you have apps specific Roll-Ups and The Sovereign Roll-Ups could you just give you you give an example of the first one I think um could you give examples of the second one and the third one so Sovereign Roll-Ups and and the apps respect Roll-Ups that you think are live today sure um so I'll also add in their uh settlement Roll-Ups um that's another one I think I think you should note as well but yeah so so app specific Roll-Ups you know kind of will be talking we've been talking about something right now like dydx is technically it's an absolific role level though it does you know rely on that centralized infrastructure um and uh something like a settlement Roll Up is uh something like uh yes Dimension um Sega as well as Eclipse um they're building you know settlement rollups upon which and also knows some of them are building sdks and others are building no code roll up deployment Solutions on which um app specific rollups can build on top of and can benefit from kind of that you know shared settlement layer um for you know trust minimized bridging up down on that layer um and and then Sovereign roll up but what that really means is that um the roll-up uh you know it handles both um execution um and and settlements so that they they don't have um you know that settlement layer in between so something like Eclipse um in between they'll they're just going to you know Port directly back uh to a base consensus and data availability like layer like like Celestia so something built with the roll kit SDK which is Celestia's STK uh would be by definition a sovereign roll-up so the the application Define clients you know all all of their parameters that they're not relying in any way um on a layer in between them and the consensus and data availability layer um to Define any of their logic they're just going right directly uh to the consensus and data availability layer got it and and now let's let's get to this the stone that we have not mentioned yet except the title so what's the roll up as a service um we understand Roll-Ups now we understand the different types of Roll-Ups but what's the roll-up as a service sure so relative service is pretty broad so starting with you know sdks so similar to kind of like you know the cosmos um and you know or sorry the um in the cosmos ecosystem and in the polka dot ecosystem how they had sdks um uh to to help you know build build chains and so you kind of have that for Roll-Ups as well um and then you have so that's like kind of the first layer um and the second layer is uh no code roll-up deployment um so there's a bunch of teams that you know some of them are actually building upon these sdks uh to build interfaces so you know dashboards um so anyone you know a developer can keep your community can come along and say you know I want to build a roll-up and they just have like a graphical user interface and they're able to you know do that you know pretty quickly um other teams are also doing more of a white glove service so um and I I'm sure probably we'll continue to do so in the future for more complicated Roll-Ups um so that you know they'll work with teams directly and assess their needs and kind of consult and understand hey what do you need and how can we build this for you um and then on on top of that um there's another you know subset of teams that are also working you know on these shared sequencers that we keep talking about um so how how do we um sequencers effective what they do is they you know they produce blocks on the execution layer and in a compressed form which then get you know sent back to the underlying layers to be confirmed so when you have right now the majority of um the majority of all the Roll-Ups sorry that they're on may not really or the majority of them anyway are using you know centralized sequencers so something like garbage remember optimism it's you know it's upright it's operated centrally um until they have a decentralized sequencer set which have to be you know incentivized with crypto economic incentives to keep it honest and to make sure that they're you know processing those transactions appropriately um and so until then it's centralized but there are teams building sequencer sets to decentralize that function um that can be applied to you know one roll up or across many which gets really interesting okay I think we're running out of time now so I'll try to try to speak sorry I'm long-winded it's my uh so um no now some projects uh some rule of our services are building sdks While others are building these no code Roll-Ups I mean as the case we understand right you know we are targeting developers and people who are used to Cosmos sdkv and better giving them a better and faster way to implement or you know use or deploy roll-ups but who are we targeting today with uh no code Frameworks from your perspective and what what is who are these people who we are going to sell these uh local Frameworks to so I think like the best thing the best use case that I can think of is like a community um that might not be super technically focused you know they might not have the resources to you know hire like you know a full in-house team of developers or something like that um and imagine a dow you know like a simple dad that wants to kind of congregate around like an idea but they might not it's more of an idea and less of kind of like you know how are we going to build this technical infrastructure so I can you know come to a no code roll-up deployment solution and and build my build my Dow a home effectively um so I think I I think you're gonna see you know it's pretty broad you know as I understand correctly like making a pretty simple roll up with some of these no code roll-up deployment interfaces is actually like quite easy and can be done quite quickly so I think that if it's you know just a general purpose um you know douse congregated around a simple idea I think that we'll see that you know happening much more frequently than something that's you know more complicated so something like a dydx you know again that that has a lot of logic and it's you know but lots of volume it's a lot more complicated so I think that that would be if they are to ever move back to L2 that would probably be something where they'd have to use an SDK and you know build it themself more so from scratch um so I think that the there's a place for for both um but it's easier it will be easier um and more accessible for for communities and not just developers to use these no code role of deployment interfaces the other thing that I realized is you know if you look at um you know axi Infinity for example I don't know sort of bash them but you know building a chain on your own it it requires a certain expertise right and yeah for example you're you're and for in case of x infinity I don't know they had a bug in their bridge and it like no one knew about this big this bug for like I don't know 10 days or something right yeah and so you it's kind of like AWS in somewhere you kind of go to AWS and Amazon you say Okay I want T2 medium instance I want this much of computing power and can you please provide it to me and you don't have to manage any of that yourself right so it kind of makes your life easier and as we all know everyone uses the AWS right 90 of probably the blocks in space uses one in one month or the other so I think it's it's also important that even for developers it it's actually allows you to focus on your core expertise while you move things outside for others to manage in some way so I think that's the other angle the other thing that I feel that you mentioned about people who are not necessarily Developers for example nft projects right uh if you look at nmp projects they're mostly let's say marketing people design people and business people who are basically running them of course I'm not saying they don't have developers they of course have developers but their core expertise is around that right is around non-technical and business and marketing expertise and if they had let's say no code flavor it becomes much easier for them to kind of go live quite easily in the same way today you have these website Builders right that you know anyone literally I mean even technical teams these days actually go and use WordPress right which is and they don't want to go and build an actual web app you know even Facebook I remember the day when Facebook was lost their Libra project their entire website was actually using was using a a web Builder you know website builder so I think it's not just for I mean even if you're a developer it actually makes your life much easier uh which is kind of I guess what I'm saying um it's kind of interesting um now uh this is a question that um I think many VCS would like an answer to which is how how could they feel like you know like what wrong man like do you think that they'll be huge enough market for these Ras providers or ask providers to to survive or do you think that it's it's it's it's a Hot Topic right now but maybe it will fizzle out in in a year or so so how can they feel like what could be what could be their reason of failure sure so I think there's probably you know you know two modes of failure that I can think of you know one is more like the monetary side and the other is on like the decentralization ethos kind of sides so on a monetary kind of side like perhaps you know if if too many rasp providers are focusing let's say on the same ecosystem um because you know some some are already focusing um like directly to um you know ethereum and evm compatible chains some are you know uh uh you know more so in the cosmos ecosystem others are just like totally chain agnostic um I think at the end game for most is to be chain agnostic um but I think in order to get there it's going to require you know starting off most people are really just starting off kind of in one place and so if let's say there's you know a number of projects building exactly on the same you know ecosystem and the exactly the same solution um I think you you know run into a situation where it might be crowded like if if the demand to deploy Roll-Ups right now especially in a bear market for example like isn't really there you know perhaps they could fizzle out you know run out help of you know run out of funding or run out of kind of Interest before they're able to kind of expand to other chains so that's one one possibility um and then also you know once once it does become once you know once more of them do become chain agnostic and everybody's chain agnostic what's going to differentiate you like why is your service easier to use or better than others like what what is going to attract people how do you you know if everybody's eventually kind of building the same thing then why would you know a user choose you over somebody else um so just you know just basic kind of competition woes I guess you could say um but and then I guess in terms of you know failure the other side is about in my mind is you know centralization and Progressive decentralization is a thing and it's important um so I don't I don't mean to say like you know be decentralized from the beginning because in some cases you can't and you know although I would like it to be that way it sometimes it can't so what I worry about is that perhaps you know I don't want to be unfortunate to see a case where um Okay so we've built you know these great Ras Solutions but decentralizing the sequencer is hard so we're just going to keep it a centralized implementation you know I'm not saying that anyone is thinking about doing this I have no one particular in mind but I can see how you know if you start making money and you know doing things like decentralizing you know certain parts of infrastructure are quite intensive people could become lazy and say oh you know what I'm just gonna like stick to this it works for me um and at the end of the day everybody has their different you know preferences for for decentralized infrastructure but but I really do hope that we don't get lost along the way and we really do focus on making sure that you know all of our Solutions are as you know decentralized and trust minimized as possible well this is this the last question and uh we often ask our guests to kind of give us a contradient view something that you feel very strongly about but everyone kind of like disagrees with you uh is there is there anything that uh you know you feel very strongly about and you feel like people around you they they keep banging their head and say why why is Stephanie not listening to me well I mean we kind of touched on this before you even and I but I think for me it's like the ecosystem is oftentimes incredibly uh polarized right so you have people on this Camp people in that camp but they're always fighting on Twitter always saying this is best that's best this is bad and it's oftentimes about like theoretical Concepts and things like that that aren't even you know proven yet and for me I I if I see myself as much more of a generalist like I don't think that you know one ecosystem is going to win or you know just one scaling solution is going to win like I think that there is you know if we are going to if crypto is going to become you know what we really want it to be which is a decentralized alternative to basically every kind of service whether that be Financial or otherwise there's going to be tons of winners and there's going to be you know so I think that um I think that we oftentimes are you know far too polarized and we get too too worried about our bags and we're not thinking about you know long term in the end game that that you know every as long as I mean there's a lot of reasons why things can fail but I do truly support you know a lot of different ideas and I'm just purely curious about seeing like if you have a really cool idea and you care about decentralization and you care about you know bringing that to the masses then um I'm just rooting for you and not so just saying no you know you because of you know external reasons if that makes sense um so yeah it's not super contrary in view but but I do like to be kind of in the middle of a lot of these arguments nothing in the world where everyone has a bad bias I think having a neutral view is actually very important it's hard in some way so thank you very much Stephanie for your time it was lovely speaking with you um and I personally enjoyed what you wrote in the ecosystem in the roll-up report and so hopefully to see more articles from you in the topic uh so thank you very much for for you know for for coming over awesome thank you so much for having me um it was really awesome to chat with you today and yeah I'm looking forward to covering um you know the roll-up and you know modular ecosystem more moving forward um and yeah really thanks again so much definitely thank you okay
