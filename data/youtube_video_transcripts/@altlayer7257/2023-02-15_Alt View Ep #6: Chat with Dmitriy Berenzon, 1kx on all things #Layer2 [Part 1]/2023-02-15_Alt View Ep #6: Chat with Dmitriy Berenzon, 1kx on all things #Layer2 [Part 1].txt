[Music] so hello everyone welcome to Alternative view or simply alt view I obviously we chat with the industry leaders get to know them their opinions and the insights and also hear their views may they be popular and popular brand new alternative or anything in between I'm your host theology from earlier elastic execution layer on ethereum for web3 today I'm super glad to have uh Dimitri Verizon research partner at 1kx where he focuses on crypto research and Investments um it's our great pleasure to have him to talk about l2s and options and yeah Dimitri thanks so much for being here and talking to us and our listeners uh can you share a little bit um about your self-inter addiction and also what are you working on at the moment yeah for sure thanks for having me um background is in nutritional Finance um work for a bank for six years um the first four were doing a variety of strategy roles often building out internal fintech products uh uh around real-time payments big data analytics and then my last two years they're building out their Innovation Labs opened up by around the world New York Palo Alto Berlin London Singapore um so kind of like entered the space of more of a D5 lens and have been investing in crypto since 2017 um uh spent a year with a fund called point out in New York doing research ndd and then two years reading research in Investments that are appropriate filming office called Bollinger Investment Group and I've been with one kex for the last two years I'm generally focused on general research writing the space across a number of topics app chains across chain Bridges nft findings amms the second is portfolio support uh helping with token design go to market strategies being in Partnerships following fundraising kind of whatever is burning for a project at the moment and the third is general like investment uh DD from first calls to investment committees so very grateful to be doing all those things at once yeah yeah experiments like Photo sounds amazing I I mean like all uh sort of aligned with like sort of as you mentioned right Bridges like app chains and the meanwhile a lot of things are critical to the crypto industry as you mentioned right token design and also various designs around the cryptos and the meanwhile right as we all know like back in October 2022 you release a blog post like sort of application specific blockchains the past the present and future and they got a lot of attractions to these actions and people discussed well like sort of WhatsApp change and why we need the app genes so since you are here right I really want to know your opinion so what's your definition for action and why it's so important yeah yeah for sure I mean I broadly Define it as any chain with its own dedicated block space I think there have been examples of this for a long time uh Bitcoin uh are we uh these are like examples of app chains I think when people generally think of these things what comes up is usually Cosmos um but I also want to clarify that you could also bucket or eye bucket Roll-Ups as app chains as well because I also think Roll-Ups are blockchains they are trust minimized blockchains with two-way trust minimized Bridges so I was thinking should I you know introduce a new term um one was app space I think roll apps are also floating around um I do like the latter more um but I think when we talk about app chains I also want um like The Listener the viewer to remember that we're talking about Roll-Ups as well um so this could be optimistic Roll-Ups uh ZK rocks Avalanche stuff that's polygons supernets um uh polka dot pair of chains Cosmos chains um it's a pretty wide like menu of things you could have um and in general I think it's very important because it is uh important design choice for a team when they're thinking about how to scale and that's across both infrastructure and applications um and I think it has a lot of deep implications for projects ux and go to market and that decision shouldn't be taken lightly um I actually don't think that app chains are the best solution for everyone I mean it's very easy to jump into like a new trend because we think it's cool um more because your teams are doing it that's what a lot of token projects did or project with tokens with like ve models like we still don't know if that's like a good thing long term you know and and and so I think we just need a lot of like critical thinking around like whether this makes sense for your project today yeah that's true that's true um as you mentioned right um so uh probably um when we call them like options actually we include a lot of other uh like terms in uh they are sort of a contact so for example as you mentioned right customers typically call their app change the zones and uh polka dot called parachutes right and then uh avalanchi some Knights polygon super night and then to the Ethereal space we have the optimistic real life and also the ZK row lab right so um based on your like sort of experience and also observations from the different like sort of factors right you list a bunch of these we don't call it Matrix but it's really like different factors when people want to choose which by sort of uh action to use right you you have a big table so in your opinion what are the most important like sort of benefits um we can get from these actions or roll ups or what are the drawbacks we can foresee in the future if some teams choose like sort of this action approach for sure um I bucketed it on the benefit side into three things um before men's customizability and value capture um I think on the performance side um you don't need to share um a block space you know I think like that alone um uh allows you to just have a very dedicated like resources you're you're likely just using one or like a few machines um uh and and you have like that bare metal to yourself um so you're able to really like crank up um uh like the transaction speed like lower the latency lower the costs be able to keep costs both like low and and predictable um and from that perspective um you could argue it's it's better ux and we can get into some of the downsides of that um on the customizability side you could modify your your like EDM client if you need to change the way your transactions are ordered um uh on uh on your chain um uh you could have um uh changes to the way you're like P2P layer works and how like transactions are propagated um there's like a ton of customizability that you um uh could have and I think for a specific um class of applications um that customizability around your like finality your security the permissioning um is very important um and on the value capture side it's a more crypto native um way of capturing value um you don't particularly need a token you could have a way to do it um if you have your own protocol token in like a like a subnet or a cosmos chain it does serve as like some um like medium of exchange um but if you wanted to have in ethereum roll up with e as a gas token you could probably create some like EIP like 1559 mechanic and stuff like uh play on that where a portion of the gas fee goes to like a protocol treasury as well or if you run your own sequencer you could probably um uh capture like uh Revenue through uh Med um so there's like a lot of interesting like crypto native like value captured opportunities and then you don't even need to turn on a fee switch um uh as well if you're doing that um so those are a lot of like interesting um benefits um I think there's actually quite a number of drawbacks um I think one like I'll I can name three one important one is the in the friction that you introduce around composability and atomicity um I think you could still have composability um uh what makes you know hardest to reason about um Atomic transactions when you start to to think about chains like some teams are are looking at doing this I think like the cosmos like interchange scheduler is an interesting um idea there um I think on the ethereum uh in uh in the ethereum world you could potentially do cross roll up out of the city with the shared sequencer um uh and I think attimacy is important for um D5 in particular because you effectively get um like unlimited like uh Capital efficiency when it comes to things like flash loans and I think that's actually pretty important for like system safety um uh you introduce like additional friction around like having to bridge uh like funds and state from like one um app chain to another um I think it also introduces um additional developer lift um like there are ways to solve that but it's not just as simple as deploying contract um you do need to think about um uh a lot more um like devops related stuff like if you want to your own like validator set or like sequencer um that might be out of the area of expertise for like a solidity developer um and on at an ecosystem level there is this sad dystopia that could happen uh if you introduce um too many wall Guardians um part of the uh thing you can do with customizability is to control who has right access to your chain um and this might work for like actually like Enterprise use cases where where maybe like some company they they want to control who um is able to to deploy contracts or maybe they want some process by which to um Bridge funds onto the app chain you need to have like a sold-bound token issued by a kyc provider if you take that to its logical conclusion if everyone has permissioned access you're you've recreated the wall Gardens at cryptos trying to break down in the first place so it's it's a really sensitive um path dependency that I don't know like how that's going to play out um but it's definitely like an ecosystem-wide um concern that we should just be like mindful of yeah that's so true um especially on the first part right um I believe like sort of right now um like for crypto space right most of the applications I mean the crypto native applications are still defy um Associated applications right so um so basically in that case if we really really want to have sort of the capital efficiency uh the best way that we have all the software liquidity or application on the same chain um even without Bridges right so either we can do flash loan or we can call protocols across the protocols uh much easier right so they're the same chain um of course as you mentioned right we can definitely also have some bridges um if we can make the bridge like into the atomicity like consideration like for example either as you mentioned right some share the sequencer across differential Labs or probably we can also have some scheduler like in these Cosmos of pocket or equal like like this kind of a framework right so we can just make it more convenient for developers to call different lines of applications called different type of chains actually the another thing uh you just mentioned like I feel like it's quite interesting it's about like sort of the um the advantages of of the app chain right I think because right now uh most of the application crypto native application they don't have a lot of users I would say probably only have less than thousand user right then we can see the application chain or application roll up right and not the necessary components for the application at the moment because they don't really need so much blood space uh at the moment but in the future for example if we really have some modifications with a meaning of users right like games or social application in that case I I don't think we have a lot of choices um if they just want to sort of sit a single uh general purpose hour or general purpose L2 because the traffic and users just to many and you have to find ways to provide better user experience but yeah but anyway we also have some follow-up questions regarding that point so we can discuss later yeah so um uh the another cool things like uh in your proposed or in your research like you mentioned that um they also uh have different um like big categories for these application chains or Roll-Ups right one we call uh monolithic and the other one we call Modular and sort of actions um like in your opinion like which way do you think is better to skill the application in the near future yeah yeah I think um for the majority of cases I think modular is better um uh for the reason that you need to pay less for uh security uh when you think about the uh the capital requirements um to have a monolithic chain it's a lot um you look at like like the polka dot parachain auctions I think they started out it was like Millions to hundreds of thousands of dollars for perishing and you don't even like own that block space like you rented for two years that's like really expensive you know and then when you're trying to have like uh some like sufficient uh uh sufficiently decentralized and incentivized validator set um on a cosmos chain you're probably giving away a chunky amount of like token incentives um like uh to pay for the security uh of your chain um I I forget the number is around like a Avalanche subnet it was something around like 150k per year in like dollars in dollar of lint of avax that you um had to see uh and so for a lot of teams starting out they don't have that kind of money um uh and like the really nice part about Roll-Ups is like you don't need to do that um what you do need to pay for is uh settlement costs 78 uh data availability costs um but I think that's like much cheaper um so I think if you're starting out um I think you're probably fine with a roller um uh once you start to to your point like have like scale in like the hundreds of thousands to millions of users um maybe you need more stuff um and then you could think about you know whether it makes sense to to uh to effectively like move to your own Island I guess like kind of like outside of like a roll-up or like yeah your own country effectively um uh but I think I think that will make more sense for more teams over time that's like the industry scales and applications get more mature um but it feels for like a lot of use cases like Overkill for the moment yes but in the future like like if we really have a lot of users right for the application probably as you mentioned we need some sort of uh economic efficient Solutions like as you mentioned right if for your lab is it's really like sort of much cheaper than the other like stand-along I've changed probably we need to make it like there's a lot of service right so if you need to scale and then you can spin off model apps and uh if for example the market condition is not good you can scale down yeah with the lights like sort of roll up to handle the users yeah so yeah that that's a really good point I would say yeah um and then like as we all know right so um right now ethereum is um all right uh already like um moving to a proof of stake and basically um if you look at the roadmap of ethereum it's really like uh absentric scaling approach and the ethereum itself is trying to position itself as a settlement and the data availability layer and this is also also the execution to l2s like Azure Labs right um yeah and how do you feel about the current roller space around its ethereum and do you think in the near future right um as we all discussed like sort of the applications first scheduler can be a good way to try some sort of the scaling issues for the dabs around the ethereum yeah because we all know right since the beginning like in 2015 fatality always trying to find ways to skill ethereum stage charting plasma optimism and right now like all new erps which are trying to scale ethereum but like like what do you think about the current roller space in the future if we really have like uh like tons of thousands application running in this space right how we can handle so many applications yeah I mean I love Rolex you know I think like it's like it just makes a lot of economic sense it like it has taken a while to figure out to your point like the model that works and like the scariest part is the unknown unknowns and that's kind of what we found with plasma uh like with the mass exit problem it was kind of like oh you know like we've this doesn't work you know and But like everyone was like super excited about it um I think with with Roll-Ups we finally got into a place where it's like much more like production ready um I think there is very interesting um applications that even now I'm seeing a reversal in the order of operations um on which teams launch and I think initially we saw them launch on eth L1 first and then we actually moved to nl2 um I'm seeing increasingly teams just like launch natively on uh nltic um so I think it's actually like very organic um traction and and and demand um and I think you know we're going to continue to see more um uh developers um uh choose a roll-up especially once you have more like Fiat on and off ramps um and or like wallet Integrations uh and and things like that um I could see hundreds of Roll-Ups thousands of Roll-Ups um the issue that I don't think is being addressed is a good way to do message passing across these rollers that's very like ethereum specific um like Cosmos has had this for a while with interchain accounts um uh and uh Avalanche has shipped their own like homegrown like messaging system thing so like those two ecosystems are very much like thinking about how you do um cross-chain communication and and polka dot had this with um xcmp uh yeah xcm yeah um uh xcm so so they've had this for for a while um with ethereum Roll-Ups we don't really see that and um it's kind of like being solved with like I don't know third-party Bridges um uh in in certain cases it could be solved within Roll-Ups um like particularly with like ZK Roll-Ups um could have the concept of like an L3 um that uses like recursive groups uh and you could have two l3s that use an L2 as a settlement layer um so you could validate um uh the proof of 1l3 from another L3 and that's one way to do uh uh bridging so I can imagine um ways to do that within like like the ZK sync world and uh and like the Stark net World um uh but it still begs the question of like how do you have like efficient um communication between like optimistic Roll-Ups and ZK Roll-Ups in a way that is like native to the protocol and that's probably where like the ethereum community like hasn't really put too much thought into it um uh and I guess I understand why um because just like getting Roll-Ups live alone is such a Herculean task in general um but I think we'll probably need to get to a point where we we tried to figure out kind of like some standard um for like safe cross roll up messages [Music] foreign
