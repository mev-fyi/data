[Music] thank you [Music] hello everyone I'm Julia Ma I'm a research at the robust incentive group within the ethereum foundation we usually looked at mechanism design for the ethereum protocol so think of problems like erp1559 and proposer bill of separation and today I'd like to talk about the appearance Rule and across domain world first of all I'd also like to thank outlayer for hosting this session and I hope it will be very informative so if I'm thinking about ethereum's role in across the main world the first thing that pops up to me is how proposal Builder separation is really the design philosophy and not necessarily what we think of it in its current form so many of you will probably know his current form of Mev boost um which is the outer productive software the flashbulse developed and is clearly used by large sets of the validator sets and it allows proposers to connect to builders who built the entire blocks and then proposers read the benefits of this so it allows everyone to get the same benefits of sophistication however proposal buildership creation is actually way broader than this in general it allows any Outsourcing of protocol juices that proposers may have to third parties in order to fulfill these duties so in essence uh PBS or proposal separation means that a proposer who's tasked to perform shirts and do excuse by ethereum possible may have a desire to Outsource some of these these duties for whatever reason this may be so in the case of um blood construction this might be because constructing a good block is very intensive work and it requires a high degree sophistication so what the proposal could do is they could draft the Baton tracks that outsources this job to a builder and there where we see a builder as an out of Proto agent that's sophisticated and rational and has the ability um to to fulfill this job well and then PBS really refers to the formation of this contract so in nav boost it may be that the contract has to form that the Builder makes the entire block but as we'll see throughout this presentation and there we've seen in the literature there could actually be different forms of this contract so as a quick recap to get everyone on the same floor so where are we now Nev boost is a current out of Proto instantiation of PBS and so it's not actually proposed to build a separation uh because Builder separation or enshrine PBS is something that we're working towards um that boost allows proposed Outsource blocked construction to builders as we've just seen through these contracts and thereby gives all of the proposers the same access to sophistication so this ensures that there's still decentralization of the validator sets because there's no incentive to co-locate with Searchers or with Builders as we would have probably seen otherwise uh however it does come with a few challenges for example there are lots of trusted components now in Mev boost and meaning that there could be some liveness issues um or unbunding attacks like we've seen um and in the process of Mev boost they Define a very rigid contract which is the blood Orchard so as I just stated the Mev boost says that the a builder can make an entire block for a proposer so they don't give you the option for example um to build half a block to build blocks in different ways they they Define a very solid footing for what the form of this contract must be and then a logical question to ask is if this is the optimal form of the contract this is something that will explore further in this tool and the idea about whether this is the perfect form for the formats or not comes from Brandon Bay he's the team lead at the robustion centers group and I've linked his post in the bottom left corner of the slides here I also share the slides um afterwards and these are actually clickable so if you're interested in any of the links here you can click on the slides and go through the links yourself so the idea that there may be a different format of the of the contract that might be more ideal for certain situations uh is referred to as the allocation mechanism of of PBS um so the allocation mechanism means is that the the pro skill facilitates certain proposal commitments so for example in the case of um nav boost MF boost facilitates that proposers commit that a builder can build the entire block if we were to enshrine PBS uh the ethereum protocol would facilitate this commitment um but there could be other commitments and then there's the market structure which means that the proposed Proto provides as safety guarantees around this commitment so for example uh that the proposer um will only raise commitment and also that the payments from for example the Builder are enforced um some some other firms that could be interesting for PBS are actually related to close the main Mev so what form of The Proposal Builder separation contract would be the best for across domain world this is what we'll be looking at as a political designer so first of all we need to consider whether this is even the protocol's concern putting stuff into the pro school is quite a heavy cheesy task it will take a lot of time and once it's in it's very difficult to change so the protocols are very rigid mechanism and it's not it's not easy to to change and also it doesn't have a view of a lot of things for example currently it doesn't see what the block production process is like this is also the reason why um with Boost exists and because the ethereum protocol currently doesn't see how Bloods are constructed it's possible that proposers outsources task tool um into Builders and the protocol isn't aware of many other things for example protocol isn't aware of what the state is of on other domains or whether there's even coordination between these kind of domains and the question is whether the protocols should be aware of all of these things or not an advantage of being aware means that is less likely to be a principal agent problem for example in the case of where the the principle in this case the the Proto and there's another line with the incentives of the agents so let's say that the agents are not aligned with decentralization or other factors like this um but an advantage of the approach to not being aware is that there could be out of protocol software spanned up that would allow for coordination mechanism so we see a lot of experimentation in this field and this is probably where other torch will be centered around today um another question that we're concerned with in uh within the EF is whether these kind of solutions should be enshrined or not and also what the options are so this is something that we'll go through so why would um trust domain coordination mechanisms be a concern for the ethereum port at all I'd like to Define three things that I see as important first of which is allocative efficiency and with this I mean that is block space used to reach the social welfare maximizing States for example we could see that if we're not aware of any coordination met of or of any coordination between domains it could be that we use States in a way that doesn't optimize um for for what could have happened if we had the right screen Nation mechanisms which brings me to 0.2 are there actually applications that you benefit from close to main coordination mechanisms that we currently do not have and my third point is informational efficiency informational efficiency refers to whether all available information is incorporated into the protocol Reynolds this is a somewhat um softer point so for example you can see um in Arbitrage between a centralized exchange like binance and addition selections change like uniswap um we could ask the question whether all of the information about price movements uh or or about um tokens in general is incorporated into the into the decentralized exchange um or not and this would probably mean some more um effective use for users because they would be trading at the price where all information is incorporated and all that some more outdated price oh yeah and then a side question for this is can we achieve the same level of allocated positioning of coordination and informational efficiency if the solutions are out of protocol and if they're in protocol we'll start with a soft preconformations which is an out of protocol solution and you can see again that this is a this is a hyperlink so you can click on it and it will redirect you to a slideshow by Alex stoics who has falls about this results so soft pre-conformations are example of Builder Services which means that a builder provides adjusted servers to users and to guarantee certain things so in the case of pre-conformations they could either guarantee that your transaction will be included uh maybe in a certain range of blocks maybe in the next blood that they win um or whatever inclusion guarantee that they are willing to sell and it usually bring to buy of course um and moreover a stronger form of software commitments could be that they would give you a confirmation on the post dates of your transaction so they could give you for example exactly how much balance you have of if and of some other tokens after this transaction and these could be very helpful things because it would allow you to act on this information act on the fact that you know something is going to happen on um the only problem though is that these sort of pre-conformations are based on the effect of given that the Builder wins the PBS option they will only their commitments so it could very well be the case that the Builder doesn't win the PBS option um and to prevent this uh usually would actually want um a guarantee would need to go through multiple Builders um and buy these sort of pre-confirmations uh to get guarantees and this may be a coordinate this might need a coordination mechanism in itself and could be very centralizing actually um so we need um so we might need something that goes beyond this um the advantage of of having such a pre-confirmation though is that it allows users to act with this guarantee on other domains and we'll see this power with an example this one and then something that I'm very excited about is slots auctions uh which is an enshrined version which could also um yield some pre-conformations basically and again this is a clickable link so we've seen that the Mev boost mechanism determines your contract for form where you can sell the entire block and people bid um based on their blood so this is what we see on the left hand side we see a blow torch in uh and Builders they bid and their bid is for this specific block so the the Builder has built the block already and if they win this plot will be included a slow solution is is a slightly different from this in the sense that Builders bid um but they don't they don't necessarily build the Block in advance they will probably make some estimates of the value and base a bit based on this but it could be the case that they would actually um only build their block after they know they won um so this is a different form of the the tone track that we've seen which is the essence of PBS and this is also why PBS is really a design philosophy uh fall into the the allocation mechanism of PBS and so they're quite different from um blood options again for more depth I'd recommend you to click on the the link here and some of the consequences of slow talking sorry that uh the difference between the commitment time and the execution time which is the commitment time refers to the time at uh at which you made the your blog so for example in the blood torches part we saw that the block was already made at the time of the bid and the execution time refers to the time when they're when the block is published um so now because the the auction has to happen between the time of commitment and a time of execution in the blood auction there is a large gap between this and if the auction happens before this and your commitment time and education time are then very very close and the obvious benefits of this is latency reductions so we see now that in Arbitrage between centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges latency becomes very important all right and we've observed this in the high frequency trading in traditional Finance as well obviously um so this is one of the obvious advantages of slot auctions but another maybe more accessible Advantage is that blood contains can now be made conditional and guarantee of inclusion so in terms of the this doesn't seem to make very much sense so um in principle you always make uh your blood contents um conditional on inclusion because if you're not included the blood contents are irrelevant and so they yeah they wouldn't be educated anyway so you would make the international language on inclusion and this is something that um some people have uh dived into and there was a paper written on Mev invariance Satan Advocate doesn't grow so the Mev Pi doesn't grow um in if ethereum would Implement um conditional blood building basically um relative to centralized changes and the the caveats here is that centralized exchanges would also have guaranteed inclusion and they you could basically always commit to them so they're in instead of there being a blockchain whether it's a street commitment times and there would be continuous equipment times so an open question still is what's the what would happen to the overall cake um of Mev if um you're dealing with two blockchains that have both have discrete times and also both have probabilistic inclusion so this is still an open question so if anyone is working on this I would love to hear about that um and then a separate question is whether we should ensure noodles So currently there's been a debate about whether we should enshrine PBS or not and there's there's an article written by Mike Noida with some arguments in favor and some arguments against so Martin's in favor that's out of protocol software like math book quite bristle and there could be some dangers um factors in this for the for the protocol so for example he refers to the equivocation attacks that we've seen from the low carb Crusader and potential liveness issues with relays um if if their software isn't implemented correctly and however a very important factor here that he also points out is that if if we implement the Rhone Market net or Market management and allocation mechanism we could be sort of stuck with this because it would be very difficult to change so if we Implement their own contract form of the PBS design philosophy into ethereum so we we move from a philosophy into one specific field and for example we use the contract form.m Boost um impose it could be that this isn't optimal for for our future and so it could be that if we use the contract form that both imposed uh there's less coordination possible for um across the main commitments um because we don't for example have slow Solutions or other forms of PBS that would allow for more coordination and so points this hours I'd like to use one example um so here I've taken a trust domain Arbitrage from the paper Unity strengths and formalization of trust domain maximum retractable value um and we see that um we need to do both on ethereum and on polygon we need to do a Swap and this will netters some profit so let's take this to a more an easier setting let's say that the total profit from this swap in this case it says something like 111 000 US Dollars let's say for a very simple case it's just a hundred and we need to pay fees on both um chains so in this case we're first working on ethereum and then we're working polygon let's say that we need to pay um 30 US dollars so that's 30 of our profits um to to ethereum to get our transaction included we need to do this first and then we can only move to polygon where we will see a fair transaction get it can get included there so now we paid 30 and then we moved to Polo Dome and there we don't want to pay more than 70. however the problem is that a rational arbitious would actually be willing to pay up to 100 because um because the the 30 before our sun cost so the best that you could do um if someone is if the polygon um validators are not willing to accept 70 is to bid up to 100 and this could actually be a difficult problem because in this case you're actually running a loss if your profit is only a hundred so um the fact that you could potentially be running a loss even though um there should be some Arbitrage opportunity means that it could potentially not be exploited what if someone is actually setting up these kinds of traps in order to get people to pay more um and and similar problems you could imagine that people just don't want to uh deal with this kind of stuff um so this is really where you see the power of pre-conformations or slot auctions what it could do um is for example if you have um the power to determine what's going to happen in the next day transition you could um you you have the like the the pre-conformation basically and you could act on polygon first um living there and only if this part goes well you can um do your transaction on ethereum meaning that so you don't have this this problem anymore where potentially someone could hold out from setting an Arbitrage opportunity to you on the second domain because they know that you're willing to bid more and they know that you're willing to run a loss so this would prevent um loss and it would allow for some sorts of trust domain atomicity and because of this we see that there's a um again in informational efficiency if this Arbitrage opportunity does become possible because suddenly there's more information incorporated into prices on both domains we see that there's an increase in allocative efficiency um because um the Mev that's represents some sort of contention is now actually extracted and blood space is used to to drive up discontention and gets us to a more socially welfare maximizing State and this is possible because of the trust domain coordination mechanism so these are the three point things that are that I pointed out before so um yeah please keep that in mind if you think about close to main coordination so should we wait and research this more well there are some reasons to wait um to prevent uh to immediately go ahead and prevent some of these these attacks but implementing Your Own Thing means that we could be stuck with the the incorrect contract formats and Pepsi which is a post from Barnaby again proposer and a postdoing force proposal commitments really dives into this allocation mechanism and Market my and and Market design so I'd recommend everyone to read that and then finally some interesting ideas that are there is the the nuclear button idea that I've heard Phil dyin thought about which decreases the investment efficiency of certain potential extraction techniques basically what it does is it says that since we could always Implement some mechanism like PBS um it would be unwise for people to invest in so it's in very extracting um techniques because um if so it's in very extractive techniques become very profitable um we would use this nuclear button and insert uh PBS so this is a these are some of the ideas that I'd like to leave you off with and there's a conclusion we need to be very careful about considering whether ethereum should be aware of what's the main coronation and this remains an open question um the out of protocol Solutions may affect some things um like the whole out problem that I showed you before which is also saw very in product or Solutions but they require some trusted role and maybe some extra coordination mechanisms but in general allowing for cross manage action might increase allocative efficiency of blood space informational efficiency of prices and expand the possible mechanisms that we can use for our applications so the open research question that we'll be working on is what the value of slows options are in the case of overlapping commitment times of blockchains and they'll not overlapping commitment times for blockchains um House of prequel informations could actually work and whether if you're interested in trying these crossed main coordination mechanisms or not so thank you very much for listening um if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me and again thank you for outlayer for hosting this session I do thank you bye [Music] thank you
