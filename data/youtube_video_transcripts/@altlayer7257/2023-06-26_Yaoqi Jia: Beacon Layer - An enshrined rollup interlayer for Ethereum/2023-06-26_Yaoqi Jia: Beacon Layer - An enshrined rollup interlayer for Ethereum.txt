[Music] foreign [Music] today I'm glad to share a little bit about what we've done for the past and one and a half years to really help to connect multiple relax and try to build something I would say brand new for this roll-up space we call Beacon layer basically it's an enshrine your lab interlier for ethereum and other chains um so as we go into this uh insurance right we need to talk about like sort of what are the existing your lab categories we have so why is we call smart contraryola or classical Rolex right like I Will trump optimism and the various Ezekiel Labs like polygon zkevm and ziki sync so for these roll ups right we have a sort of a sequencer now right now mostly single sequencer but at the same time since we say it's a roller basically we derive the security from the L1 typically ethereum right so we also place the smart contracts like validity proof or broadproof contracts and also Bridge contracts on error to allow user deposit and withdrawal assets and meanwhile as we can see right most of these Road Labs we also post the data typically the comprise transaction data to the L1 to make sure this data available on L1 so later with some users or people want to challenge the existing sequencers right so they can just download data and just do the verification on it and beyond that recently we also got a lot of progress from Celestia and this is Sovereign so compared to this classic low light right basically we derive security from the ethereum or the Airlines and also uh do very uh do all the da and verification on the L1 for software in your lab typically like this long mint and submarine layers so what they do is like they have a separate sequence on that one and all the sequencing and the verification are done by the sequencer Network and beyond that they also puts the data to a typical D layer like let's get a d or the eigen DN and in contrast to doing all the proof on ethereum and on the L1 and also the bridge contract on the R1 for the software roll up basically you have more sovereignty so you can have your own sequencer network but at the same time you don't really derive the security from a dedicated L1 so basically you have the sovereignty to really handle all the staking and sequencing by your sequencer Network meanwhile you can also rely on different Bridge providers probably some of them will give talks later this conference and as you can see right classic ruler mainly depends on security from the air once and for Sovereign we have more freedom to run the nodes and sequencers and posting the data to a dedicated DNA and compared to the existing these kind of two types of rollout right there's another new type recently uh being discussed a lot by ethereum Community it's about instrument roller uh compared to all the two types of roller right we for the instrument roll up it's to another like social Extreme as we all know for ethereum right the future for interior skating is really about these Zoloft Centric scaling approach so in that case as we can imagine for the next few years once these relapse become more and more mature so we can see ethereum because the main settlement layer for all different routes and applications so that means or you can ensure tokens and transfer assets on ethereum and at the same time ethereum will also become the total of the go to Da platform so for all the rollers you post the data on the idiom and ethereum you hold the data so right now for most of the existing rule Labs like The Classy rollup we still place a smart contract for fraud proof and the validity proof and bridges on ethereum the United States we all know right since it's a smart contract animals can be controlled by modesty wallet right so in that case it's a superiority really derived from the multi-c wallet um operated by the developers of different rural teams um to enhance or improve the situation as I just mentioned right for The Classy Lola and some researchers proposed the insurance Yola way so in that case uh as we just mentioned right for the verification logic like for approved for the ability proof and also Bridge logic previously they are in this smart contract but it is showing no lab we embed this logic into protocol the next is um as you can see right in the future for ethereum scene if we have hundreds of rulers right for this rule up we can still have the execution uh in different sequencers but regarding the proof verification and the settlement and also bridging logic it can be in the ethereum protocol in that case for any major upgrade for each other right probably we require the ethereum to do some soft or hard Fork so the the benefits we can have as I just mentioned right basically we can further enhance the security uh from like this smart contract security to the protocol security for the attacker if you want to compromise what you try and roll up right you have to compromise the protocol level like this ethereum protocol level so it's super super difficult compared to journey to target attack a bunch of modesty wallet holders right on the other side right since we can move sort of the logic from the smart contract to the protocol sometimes we can use pre-compel or even we implement the protocol level with rust or go code in that case we can massively enhance the performance for handling this verification or bridging Logic for the existing or the future real apps in our case as you can see from this diagram right user can send the transaction to the execution client the client can be run either by ethereum existing validators or by some other validators but for the Jolla block and the consensual clients they will be handled by the ethereum validation so in that case we can really improve the security guarantee for all the rollers and also improve the performance for verification of these roll ups and meanwhile for upgrade right previously technically we we do in something like we use Snapshot or the option voting or governance mechanism right people do this option voting and if the proposal passes and we can upgrade the version for example from 0.1 to version 0.2 but in the end it's still a developer need to execute the proposal right by upgrade the smart my contract chin with his own at the main key are basically signed by some Odyssey wallet um without insurance approach as you can see right it's a little bit dangerous it seems in the end the result can show by the modesty wallet but once we put into protocol level and then we can light the protocol I mean all the users can directly vote they are their sort of ethereum level on governance right so we can have a better security guarantee for the upgrade um but as we can see right there's so many benefits and advantages for insurance your lab but why it's not that popular I think the Moon sort of a reason it died it's requiring the protocol changes as I just mentioned right either for the uh sort of the logic implementation for the verification or for the uh for the bridging or even for the upgrading right right now mostly at the Smart contract level but once we move it into protocol level right it requires a lot of changes on the uh on the validators and also the uh sometimes a consensus protocol so it's sort of like a major reflection of the existing L1 protocol and meanwhile it's sort of like we push these l2s responsibility to the L1 so if someone remember vitalik previously posted this uh poster right so he's saying that I don't overload ethereum consensus so sometimes like if we push too much logic into profitable right then the protocol I mean the hour and protocol itself has to make the decision for your L2 or roller protocols United is sort of like we need to find uh three spots or balance to really sort of have the good position between these rollers and Iowans it will put a lot of logic back to the L1 protocol level and then it becomes a big burden but at the same time if we can offload some of the logic to the L1 without sort of uh challenging too much on the performance of ethereum particle then it's also good right because we can achieve better security and performance compared to the existing smart contract implementation um so since it's a little bit tough to modify the existing R1 but as I just mentioned right there are so many benefits to adopt this kind of in front roll up approach um since our earlier as you guys all know right we're not a lot of Rolex and the users can directly via our dashboard to launch your lab yourself so we need to manage this roller and uh on the back end we have this automation tools and infrastructure to automate the Enterprise but at the same time we want to provide the best security and also the best performance for all these rollers uh since the L1 like doesn't really provide the info lab implementation at the moment so we come up with the beacon layer so as you can see right Beacon layer you can really add the interlier basically between the L1 and also the zolabs so Beacon layer will help to provide all the benefits we just mentioned right the decentralized sequencing verification upgrade and also further with some social governance across roll up messaging uh there are these begin layers so so you can treat it as a really uh orchestration layer for the rollers and uh and the rules will be all enshrined to begin layer but at the same time it still derives security from interior um because all the fraud proof bridging and all things are still be deployed on the ethereum is that like a big layer is sort of the way for you to do a double check and as an augmentation or instrumentation layer to provide further security guarantee and also further decentralization for different yolab systems and uh we just know why we need this sort of begin layer right it's sort of like we want to have all the benefits provided by the insurance roll up by the same time since I was not already also we can have this inter layer to provide these benefits for the collapse at this moment so what are the parts the only or Beacon layer can provide at the moment the third thing is about a decentralized sequencing as we all know right right now um for all the optimistic relapse or ZK relapse especially EVMS we are still adopting the single sequencer approach to really provide better performance and the first Improvement on the exact existing development in that case we may have a bunch of drawbacks right as some people posted the comments on various forums like uh if it's still a single sequencer it can sensor user transactions and sometimes like you know right due to the massive participants from from the community for airdrops or or sort of these uh claims sometimes we overwhelm the single sequencer and uh there will be downtime for the l2s or low life so then the sequencer becomes a single point failure and beyond that um even we can say that right now most of the sequences are run by the team right the team doesn't really have the incentives to basically run user transactions but there is still a potential like in the future like these sequencers can have the ability to from run or create match a bad Mev against the users so what we provide where the beacon layer the first thing is about decentral sequencing so we already have the multi sequencers for the roll up so that means either dashboard and you can quickly spin off a number of sequencers of your Lola so in that case we can immediately avoid the single point failure right so since you have a lot of uh like uh we don't see backup notes but is there like you have a lot of alternative sequencers like once done you still have a bunch of them can really help you to produce the blogs and the verify the transactions and beyond that I since you have multiple uh sequencers and for the users they have more choices to send the transactions and in that case somehow we can mitigate these kind of Mev issues uh beyond that right we as as we all know like for Roll-Ups we have a sequencer also have the verification um that basically before posting data to the underlying L1 uh with a beacon layer right since a lot of application actually rely on some soft finality from the sequencer for example for most of the rollout right we finalize uh blocks within two seconds for software cannability basically the sequencer generates the block within two seconds but beyond that we also have another Financial called higher finality the nodes a typical verifier or the program need to post these uh comprise the data to the L1 and then at that time in software we say heart financial and some application can confirm the transaction on the L2 side but for a lot of bridges application right also some new wear they want to have a soft finality but at the same time with a better confidence in that case they need to run sequencer verifiers themselves to quickly verify whether the transaction blocks are correct or not in that case as you can see right a lot of bridges to provide this fast liquidity across different Road Labs so they have to run a lot of infrastructure nodes and uh in the meanwhile right uh for a lot of exchanging we also need to make sure the transaction blocks are correct before the confirm the user transfer across different Road Labs or across the visual log to The Exchange Server um on our side right as you can see with the beginner It's relatively decentralized layer to do this verification uh before the uh the basically the red fire posted this data back to the L1 so you can really get a more uh confirmed uh finality from the beacon layer instead of running dedicated like sort of a node to do the verification yourself so in that case with this decentralized verification feature provided by uh Beacon layer right so the applications or some middlewares we can they can further reduce the cost of running dedicated nodes for a dedicated rollout and beyond that since uh um since all the rollers are opted in for the insurance to begin there so as you can see right with uh with the decentralized uh decentralized sequencing and verification all the rollers actually can have some finality on the beacon VR before we have the family on the uh L1 so in that case for some application the required is across roller messaging across roll up like this asset transfer uh they can also rely on the beginner to give them some soft commitment before the really finalize their transactional data on the L1 so in that case as you can see right the big layer can be used as a low to really help to interoperate across different Road Labs so in that case we can say it's sort of like we make sure the message across a different route can be a term Atomic which means like when your lab is the message Lola B if the B can be or pass the message and confirm the very beginning so in that case you can really sort of like finalized across these rollers so it further help different roller to do quick messaging across each other foreign with a bunch of these nice features and benefits we can achieve very beginner as it is enshrined the rollout interlayer what kind of Zola architecture we have uh for the current earlier um as you can see from this uh diagram right we have a well structured like sort of structure compared to other relapse or because we sort of provide this rule of a lot of applications like games empty and social applications so they really need this structure as robust as possible so as you can see right before the sequencer we have this aggregator actually behaves like a load balancer to handle massive traffic previously we did some empty means we got like over 30 or even 50 000 participants we need to scale this aggregator or low balance or elastically to really handle these users before they crash down our sequencer so in that case the aggregator is a must and after that it's a normal producer sequencer to precise a transaction right and after that as I just mentioned we also have the survive fire system but the cool part that uh the verifier is um sort of like in the wasn't block so people can run it either in a PC laptop or server and sometimes you can rewrite in your browser as a like client the United States of a lot of applications if you really want to make sure your transaction to be verified as as early as Paul right you can just embed this verifier into your application on the website so when users in transaction it can quickly verify all the transactions from the user side and beyond that I just mentioned right all the things uh approving systems are still on the air one but at the same time we also have the extra security guarantee from the beacon layer so regarding the typical precise to set up for Lola and the user can just send the request either at our dashboard or in the future where our public API um to the backend of course you don't really interact directly with the beacon layer and Technical with some RPC import and you send the request to be clear beginner will set up this dedicated your lab for you it's quite customized like you can specify Your da you can specify your L1 you can also specify a bunch of prime interest you want like block time and also the gas limit per block by the beginning as a decent price infrastructure it will select some of the top right view top reputation like the nodes and sequencers for the your lab as the um as sort of the first set of sequencers to service the user and uh um all these things will happen in the background users or developers Won't See Asia like the entire protocol is a decentralized and possible and typically I just show you right for the finality side um for most of the show Labs right we have this software analogy and also this heart finality so finally uh for the fun uh when when the sort of uh sequencers finalize the block on the sequencer Network itself and the half analogy basically finalized when the uh when the verifier or this submitter approvers submit the comprise the transaction data to the L1 and with the augmented uh with being augmented by the beacon layer right uh we have this picking layer to do extra verification for all the rollers uh as you can see the uh apart from this software energy and also half analogy the beginning I will do another verification called approved for validity verification uh you can treat it as this um One-Shot fraud proof because as we all know right right now for most of the proof it's uh it's a one it's a step-by-step proof with the bisection but here at the beginning is strong enough to directly precise the proof for the inter um period of time uh period or challenge time like basically uh for the verification so United case you can treat it as a canary detection when the sequencer generates blocks and before these blocks submitted to the L1 and the beacon layer will do the extra verification at the time whether this blocks are correct or not so that's why we call it Cannery detection and once the pick and layer fans die okay your block is in our Valley and the beginning will signal um the Challenger to do the challenge to the L1 uh much earlier than like this seven day trading period or it can just happen within a few seconds the United States as a canary detection right the beginner can quickly do the verification and the further uh secure these security guarantee for the L2 by the same time signal The Challengers to do the challenges as early as possible as a summary right compared to the existing how to draw Love Solutions right uh there are these big layer as you can see we have uh like sort of two more uh lines of difference for the security guarantee the first one as you all know right uh if it's a single sequencer then the softer fantasy will be a little bit weak but since we run multiple sequencers blends of the penalty at least uh much stronger than a single sequencer that's called stage one the execution level software finality beyond that I suggest show you right we have the picking layer to do this uh Canary detection for all the uh your Labs there are these uh proof of validity checks so in that case if all the tracks pass that means as the verification level we are sort of quite secure I have a lot of application and bridges exchange the sort of contrast this level because a decent price verification layer for them and of course on the stage three it's a typical hard finality we also have basically how we we implemented all the gratification in solidity for the wazam instructions so all the proof and execution for the blogs and transactions can be verified on the L1 if there's a challenge happens and beyond that Beyond this uh decentralized sequencing replication and we and also this message passing right we also have this uh sticky and the sliding for the sequencers and graphers as you know right once we have multiple sequencer verifiers and also the proof sometimes we need to know who behaves a good uh who gives on a good manner and who behaves uh wrongly in that case we need to apply this penalty mechanism it's called thinking of selection so you can easily you can either do the staking slashing on the picking layer which is you know in Shrine away and you don't need to deploy smart contract it's have a highly sort of secure with uh Beacon layer or you can also do it on the L1 side where the smart contract we already deployed for these different Road labs and beyond that right as we just mentioned at the beginning the upgrading is very important because we don't want the smart contract uh like to be upgraded by a single admin address right so in that case begin layer we also handle the upgrade for you so one you you can you can lie to the community do the unchain rolling on Beacon layer and if the proposal is passed and then we can sort of pass over the wazen binary basically for the next upgrade very the beacon layer push two different rollers that's how we really handle and manage multiple rulers and for their security batteries and also these um uh this upgrade for some major features so everything is automatic we are the beginner and pushed to different uh your Labs I mean well you can also arrange like some unchain governance to be honest accurate and since there is a fully answering you can just get all the traces for the votes and everything is transparent so as I share so much about this uh picking layer right is the insurance for ethereum and in the future probably for body chains the uh the end goal is really to provide the best security guarantee and also decentralization for the roll apps as much as possible for a lot of these customers and the projects who embrace the web 3 as the future um so right now what are the stuff you can do um on in the community so you can participate in our beginning or speaking and also this is your last staking as I just mentioned right these features are quite Advanced you can just try it out right now I mean well you can also interact with this decentralized sequence in your lab and um we already run a bunch of these sequencers for the Zola and with uh proper proof and beyond that is what you can expect to come soon uh one is like uh so you you can start to use the docker and some other two to join our picking layer we are the no joining like page and later on you can also try out to do some challenge um to this uh Pro uh to these like social Labs set up by us or by some community members I mean well the Russ dashboard will also support this persistent flash layer and uh and as uh Android and advertisement right the average from orbit is also integrated into our rust platform very soon I mean well there's another very big partnership announcement coming soon and just stay tuned um yeah thank you for your time and uh I hope you really enjoy this new concept of bikini and the meanwhile I hope you really enjoy your future sessions in today's conference thank you [Music] thank you
