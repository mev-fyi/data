elastic execution grid is a network provided by Cloud technology it is widely known for its speed of data processing and reliability of its results no matter how complex your test is let's learn about the combination of this framework with ethereum on webstery along with Mr Jun Hao tan head of product engineering department good afternoon everyone so I'm Qin Hao from the odd layer team at all layer we are actually helping with ethereum and other evm chain skills elastically using uh L2 rubs foreign today in 2022 and not 2018. so earlier this year we have the nft mean by yugas Labs which is uh uh a nft project by uh I mean which is under this and at that point there was a crazy massive congestion on ethereum and people are losing like thousands of dollars in gas fee and not getting that transaction being confirmed and what about this side chain uh earlier this year also on polygon uh there is also a very popular game and he also a significant chunk of the block space on polygon and also finally on the L2 space whereby we have the arbitrary which is uh they launched the Odyssey campaign and that and they have deposit uh along the way because of a massive congestion again so you can see that this congestion issue stealing issue is still a major problem in 2022 and we have been complaining about scaling issues since 2017-2018 and we have been building all kinds of solutions but we still can't cater to this kind of congestion issue and one of the major issues is because a lot of dabs nowadays are just require some capacity for a very short time like a sudden Spike right and there's teaming and so on so what we are doing at odd layer so all there we are not just building L2 we are actually building a platform for you to launch Alto On Demand on the fly so we can easily uh actually uh launch L2 within uh let's say 30 minutes or so and the alto has a quite efficient uh TPS of about 2000 and above uh block latency that is configurable and uh that's under two seconds and also uh you support uh different VMS such as evm wasn't and also um you can actually one great unique point about our route is that you can actually determine the lifetime of your rock let's say if you're near for one day then you just spin it out for one day if you need it for one month just spin it out for one month and so on and also this is uh all optimistic Rob and um we built it in a modular way and in terms of our product line we have two different uh tier they are building uh they are basically optimistic Rock one is Flash layer and the other one is what we call a persistent Rock So flash layer are simply uh grow ups that you do need it for very long let's say if you need it for a few hours or I need it for a few days a few months then you can come and use this solution basically you just use it and once you donate it then you can dispose it off and whereas for a persistent layer then that is something that like what the name say persistent and that's you can you just launch it and use it forever so let's take a look at the first uh travel Rob which is uh the flash layer that we are offering so for firstly let's take an example of an nft so nft mean is uh basically uh there is a lot of uh transaction going through in a very short amount of time let's say a few minutes or a few days like up to 40 hours or so so in this case you can actually come use our platform to launch a application specific roll-up that is delegated for your nft win before your smart contract using your normal tooling then after that watch your campaign launch an nft Min with your dedicated block space without anyone anything to worry you do need to worry about whether it's anyone actually having a similar event as you at that point of time and once you are done with the nft mean what we can do is that you can do what we call automatic uh roll up back to ethereum so this rock is a bit uh unique is that we grew up with contracts States so imagine that you can actually migrate your data from L2 back to ethereum isn't that wonderful so this is basically you are burning away the nft on auto and minting it on L1 and this is a automatic step so what are the main benefit for using this kind of solution a flash layer is that really the minting experience is very similar for our most user um there's no congestion so congestion is the main complaint for nft means without congestion you already solve like let's say 70 80 of the problem and the next thing is we are because this is a layer that is for you you can actually create a flash layer that has a gas token but the gas token has zero value so you catch it and drop all this gas token to all your user and once you are drop it and they can use it for uh this maintain and this entire token when we roll out back to L1 so in this case they are paying zero dollar for gas so first you have no contraction second you don't even need to pay for gas but at the end of the day someone still need to pay for gas right and that's where the project team has to uh incur a bit on the gas fee that's where they need to actually roll them up roll up the contract back onto uh L1 and uh of course uh the Rob in this case won't be so expensive as compared to what user is paying because users are like paying thousands of dollars to get their transaction in first but in this case uh and for us is you can actually grow up at any point on time that when when the let's say gas cost is low and what about the other kind of uh Rob the persistent one so the persistent one has one um additional function which is a basic fraud proof that it's very common uh across optimistic Rock like arbitrum and I think uh optimism is also working on the Frog proof with the Frog proof then you can derive your security from your L1 and what about diverse diversification and decentralization so uh we will be able uh for our robs we can run more people uh producer or what is currently known as sequencer and with that you eliminate uh let's say Singapore failure and also uh censorship mitigation also and for verifier we allow you to actually uh run in various mode let's say if you wanted to run a like client if you want to run it in a hardware Enclave like the sgx or if you want to run it on a standalone desktop machine or crop uh infrastructure you also can do it so in terms of security wise we have a tier security level so the first level is whereby the moment the transaction is confirmed on the L2 you can just basically treat it as confirmed if you are controller with that that the uh the block latency is about two minutes but if you are not comfortable that you can actually run your own like right on your browser this is basically trust bar verify so you verify it yourself verify that nothing is wrong then you you are confirm it and this probably will take a few minutes and if you don't even really trust this step then you can wait for it to be dropped back to L1 and that's where you just need to trust uh L1 basically and on top of that we know that there's a lot of some implementation for EVMS you might want to constant a function that's not available starting from next year we are also gearing out for our midnight candidate our release and we will be very very busy working very hard towards our minute like right we are not just going to end with just launching a minute we know that uh we want to make life easy for developer we want to make it very easy and that's why we have can have certain toolings to help them one example is for example a Rob creation template for example for nft project right they may not actually they want a application specific network but they don't want to configure it themselves they don't have the capability or they just don't have the bandwidth so in this case they are um sorry anyway yeah so in this case they can actually just busy um yeah so I'll use the default template with the parameters uh default all the defaults I think if they need to be off settings deploy a raw within let's say 30 seconds or so all the other uh and same for let's say gaming and so on and on top of that we know that application specific has one main issue uh which is a diversity of the ecosystem you might like access of uh all the taxes nft Marketplace and so on so we are also building additional tooling uh additional add-on we also invite our ecosystem partner to come and build on top of us and provide them as powerful add-ons for these ROMs so when you launch a royal prize you can actually deploy all this application together with your rock immediately so in this case right from day Zero you already have all these uh diverse ecosystem and you don't need to worry about having to source for partners and so on and we did a few Showcase of our Tech so far the first one is nft mean so we did uh our OG batch we call it ob2 batch basically we we use our logo change some color and make it very beautiful and we did an nft maintain of uh 100 uh nft and um the NFD actually got minted fully minted within 18 seconds and uh after that uh we wrote them out back onto uh ethereum at one and it's actually available on openc and at about time the Rob cost for us is only 0.25 if and there is energy rate of about 12 G1 so it really is a very efficient uh Manner and um the user actually don't need to pay for gas fee and so on and we did a second round showcase the second round also case it basically we host uh dark flowers on our gaming flash layer and we ran it for we ran a community around for two days and during these two days we have almost about 200k transaction recorder on chain and there's uh everything is very similar and because it's using a gas token that has no value people can just claim the gas token from the faucet and play Dark Forest game without incurring a single set so our next showcase will be our mascot um in this showcase is coming soon we will be showcasing the execution layer which is our Auto settlement layer which is uh ethereum and also multi-chain so you'll be able to bridge except from various uh evm children to our uh L2 and use it to mean the nft yeah and uh that's it and uh if you want to know more about us you
