[Music] thank you hello everyone welcome to Alternative view icing play art view I've been thinking about doing this for a while and I'm glad it's finally happening I obviously chat with the industry leaders and to get to know about them and also their opinions insights to hear about their views uh maybe popular and popular brand new alternative or anything in return I'm your host yaochi from earlier and elastic execution layer on ethereum for web3 and today I'm super glad to have uh no from ethereum Foundation his research expertise finds Game Theory like large systems crypto economics and also decentralized systems that's a quite impressive range there and hi I'm gonna be and how are you doing and can you do a quick self intro yeah yes hi elg thanks for having me first and finally I work at the ethereum foundation in a research team called the robust incentives group or rig for short the scope of our research team as you said is to look at Game Theory mechanism design the crypto economics of the ethereum protocol pretty much so anytime there's something to analyze but we need to understand better of the economic Properties or you know whether that's actually something that works we typically spend time looking at it and trying to to model it yeah that's that's what we do yeah sounds amazing and I believe like we might in depth con right I believe he's one of the greatest like defcons in the history and in a recent talk I don't come right you talk about the progress on the PBS basically proposal Builder separation right um can you explain a little bit more like what's PBS and why we need PBS and how we can achieve PBS yes yes as you say it's something I discussed also as Defcon and I would say it's one of the topic that is very actively discussed not just by us at EF but also in the community uh marginally um so what's PBS I would say first it's it's not a specific mechanism but it's more a design Philosophy for protocol um the idea that block construction so the the roles that validators today have in the system of making blocks there are parts of that construction that can be very specialized and potentially can be done by people over and the validators themselves so we can Outsource parts of block construction to to players or to entities that are not necessarily part of the protocol and the rationale behind this is that do you have these field parties that intervene in blood construction you always ensure that block verification so the fact that the data or even full nodes that are not participating in the consensus they are still able to verify the work that was done by these third parties and verification remains cheap and so what you can do with this is you can have very specialized parts of block construction that are done by actors who have maybe better resources or better knowledge of how to do it but still the network as a whole is is secure because you can always check that the work was done so that's it's a kind of PBS in a nutshell then I guess the next question was why do we read PDS and I would say need is a bit of a it's it's strange to frame it in this way because I feel from my perspective is almost that PBS was imposed to us as a as a constraint uh on the protocol in a way and now we're kind of leaning into it that well at first what we observed is that the part of the block construction that was outsourced is making the execution block payload so basically when you make a block you have to write stuff about all the consensus Etc but at the execution layer what you do is your packing user transactions and and that packing can be done much more efficiently by maybe third parties and so the first appearance of PBS in the OR PBS as a design philosophy is part of this execution payload being made by people who are very very specialized and we can talk I guess a bit later about why that happened but but the idea is that yeah already we've seen proposals kind of get go out of the protocol and get these payloads from the from the outside and so noticing that this is the thing that happens we think okay well why not leverage the fact that it's already a thing and maybe use it to our benefit as the as the protocol and uh and and make that a bit more formal and so then getting to how do we achieve it uh like how do we formalize it actually there's many ways and I think that's what's exciting to me as a as a resource question is what is the best way to to do it and and when you think about this what you're really thinking about is where does the protocol concerns stop so for today most of PBS is done out of protocol so you might have a lot of boost points tends to to get this execution payload uh it it works I mean people are using it it it's it's a live system and it's making blocks for for our protocol but when you see that the protocol starts depending so heavily on a third party Network that the protocol doesn't necessarily have a view into it I think it's legitimate to start thinking well can we maybe bring some of that back into the into the protocol so that's I would say one side of the of the equation and the other side is you also don't want to bring too much into a protocol first because it's complicated like making changes to protocol like you don't want to keep doing that every time there's something new that happens outside of it and and second you also need to make sure that when you do that when you bring it back to the protocol you do it correctly because when you when you do it once like you don't necessarily have also the opportunity to to update it and so yeah so we can again maybe even discuss a bit more but there are several approaches to to doing PBA in protocol uh some of them I discussed are Defcon some of them and still thinking about for instance you could partially have a protocol backstop with auto protocol markets but without the protocol detail mining what the market exactly is that's a more recent proposal of mine that is on each research or you could on the other hand really specify every type of Market that the proposals are able to to to enter into yeah it sounds it sounds great and and I know right so one of the reasons we want the PBS is basically want to like sort of um match gate or like the Mev and uh can you talk about like you know right right now in ethereum not just in ethereum also in general in the blockchain space we have a lot of the mevs or sort of like some transactions can be front-runed by the either the validators or some Bots right uh what do you think about the Mev and do you think Mev will apply to the design of the PBS yeah yes so yeah in the previous answer I kind of said it was imposed to us PBS as a as a constraint but I didn't really exactly say why that happened and really and maybe it's kind of a deep reason why um we are getting to PBS in a more formalized way and the idea that so first me view what is it it's it's when you send a transaction as a user sometimes your transaction exposes more value that can be captured for instance you do a trade there might be a possible Arbitrage after your trade so people who see your transaction they really want to be the next transaction so that they can capture that arbitration so to to extract nav you you need kind of two things you need first uh knowledge so information that this is a strategy that I can deploy and capture the value and the second thing which is I would say not necessary but it's kind of the ultimate power is to be the proposal because as a proposal you have a final word of which transaction getting to your block in what order that's true you can even insert the transactions yourself so there are ways to extract Mev where you're not the proposal for instance with priority gas auctions you just try to be the first person in the block so that you front run everyone else but ultimately what the the place where the Mev power really lies is in the in the in the hands of the proposal and so this second power of being the proposal that's given to you by the protocol so in proof of work you have to nine and then you would get the right to make a block in proof of stake you picked randomly from the set of validators so that power is kind of protocol given but the information and the knowledge it's not something that is at hand for most proposals let's say the average proposal isn't capable of running very complex arbitrary strategies of knowing that there is value that can be extracted Etc and so typically in markets when there is information asymmetry and one side has more information than the other side you kind of try to get into an agreement to say well I'll pay you for all this information or I will or we enter into a deal where you know you can tell me what your proximity Is and and I can extract it for for you as a proposal and so that's I would say the first instantiation of PBS was a Blog proposals or blog producers reaching out to these specialized third parties so they were called Searchers in proof of work now we know them as Builders because they make the whole block and and trying to get from these third parties information about what the what the best opportunities uh ah and yeah and that information is is valuable so yeah it's it's costly to to obtain it but it doesn't mean that proposals actually pay for the information in fact the builders are competing to get the right to make the block because they know that they can extract uh value from it as well yeah I see and do you think like later on once we have the PBS right we have a separation between like software Builders and proposals do you think we can make ethereum more decentralized for example we can have more like sort of Builders distributed everywhere in that case we can have better like censorship resistance yeah so yes there's an argument so the argument for doing PBS is if you don't have this idea of Outsourcing parts of the blog production then the average blog proposal which let's say a solo speaker who's validating from whom they can access these very specialized markets and so they kind of lose out on the rewards that very sophisticated validators can accumulate and so over time in your system like if you let it play out for years or even decades you would notice that the sophisticated proposals which you kind of like to have in your system because we do backstop a lot of things we can talk about sensorship for instance so these these unsophisticated proposals they are going to be just there's going to be a wealth effect where they get smaller and smaller in proportion uh in your in your system so in a way it might have this positive impact if you are able to Outsource and provide a fair market for everyone um when everybody kind of has the same return there's no economies of scale but on the other hand the you have the flip side of that coin is you you're kind of pushing out the centralization pressures to to the Builder and so then you you might expect that if it's very competitive and you have to be very sophisticated to be a good builder then you might not have many builders in the in the market and now the problem which is I would say well known in economics has the principal agent problem is the idea that when you're Outsourcing things to someone that person might not share the same value function as yourself or they might not want to make the blog the way you would have made it so both good because you get more but also bad because your preferences as a proposal might not be shared by the diver Builder and part of his preferences is for instance you might want certain transactions to go in that the Builder doesn't want so censorship and in that case uh you have to think of mechanisms to to try and reassert the leap out of the proposals value function or preferences into the Builder's constraint and so yeah so then there are mechanisms that can allow us to to do this for instance inclusion list yeah the idea that before having the block made for them the proposal says okay you can make the blog but I really want these transactions to be in or you have to prove to me that you couldn't include them because for instance you you your blog was already full and these kinds of mechanisms we they work and they could even work I guess today without much changes to the to the trust model of these out of protocol uh markets but they kind of make clear that if even best Builders are builders that same Souls um in a way as a proposal when you make these lists when you say I need these transactions to be in if the Builder says well I don't want them to be in my block so I'm just not going to make a Blog for you so you have to make this trade-off between providing sensorship resistance to the network and getting the best value blog or using that's that's true when the best builder is is censoring and so yeah so when the question is how do you how do you make that cost instead of bonus proposals bearing only themselves the cost of censorship how do you maybe uh make that cost internalized by the by the network and so on and so it's it's kind of a direction of research that people are thinking about right now yeah I I think probably as you mentioned right the inclusion list of uh probably this commit and review or even like probably some Hardware enhancements and matters can help um like for example either the first cleansing or basically include the sort of the transaction like the header first before like sort of include the entire transaction later um as you mentioned right it includes like probably both economic uh considered regions at the same time we probably also need to have some modification on the protocol side yeah I I just feel like um as you mentioned right definitely PBIS I believe is a very new Direction and to address a lot of concerns we have uh in current crypto space um yeah and another point right uh in devca as we all know right the Zola is definitely another uh interesting topic right and uh I I read through y'all like basically your article back in February on the United States of all the relapse economics it is so it was a great article I I basically I I recommend all the audience to also read about that article um can you share a little bit like about like sort of your considered regions after your analysis and all the roller system right how this roller system capture the values either from the users or from the applications yeah um yes yes so I guess I started with analysis mostly because I was myself very confused about how uh Roll-Ups work like I couldn't figure out how their revenues were matched with the expenditures that it's it's a very I would say much more complicated piping than you have at the at the base layer and so but it felt like there was maybe some generative that could be extracted so I was seeing how each roll up was doing running their own operations and in my aim to to try and come up with a framework that would be helpful to to understand a bit better uh what is the design space and how do Roll-Ups show value or deal with their with their expenditures so for instance Roll-Ups definitely always need to publish the data to the to the base layer so whatever they do they have these constraints which we can't go around and so so anyway we organize the kind of Economics on their side like they have to make it in a way that eventually they can pay for uh the base layer data publication and so yeah so the idea what is value and how does it flow through that system uh it was something I had started thinking about back when I was working on eip1559 which is the gas market for for ethereum yeah at the time of the questions were well what does eip1559 price what how does it relate to to the supply of gas and so when I was looking at this question it focused my attention on thinking about okay when users come to the ethereum system the base layer like what do they want out of it what is the value that they that they get from from using it um and and that was helpful to understand eip1559 as let's say a congestion pricing device that tells you exactly what is the price that people would be willing to pay through to enter the block Etc and it's I would say for AP 1559 it's it's enough to to to to look at this but then when you start looking at user demand you have more wider things that start appearing like Mev so so it's a very different type of user demand because it's not exactly someone comes to a chain and they want to do something it's like they want to do something as a reaction to someone uh coming to the to the chain and then we use their value it becomes very complicated to to represent for instance I have a it's a huge value for buying an nft but if your nft is sold out then my transaction I I don't have any any value for it so so the state of ethereum and and the preference of users over that State uh it's like this incredibly complex huge space uh that that you're trying to to make sense of and as a protocol or as a market designer you're trying to to price that and so yeah and so then you have the same in rollups I would say the start of the pipeline is users wanting to produce something like that's really the the motive energy of your of your system and then you're trying to understand from this value inflow that's how I turned it in that post from this value in flow how does the roll up sort of uh capture or device or yeah how does it use that economic value to to run its operation so for instance they need to pay for the base layer cost the roll-up operators need to pay for their full nodes or they need to pay for when they have to make proofs either in optimistic relapse or in validity roll up so so yeah so there's a lot of ways that value kind of gets transformed in over that pipeline for instance if you're a user and you're waiting because your rollup is full and you're going to include your transaction then it's destruction of economic values you have to price that as well as the roll up as well you might say okay let's use the ap1559 so you have all these like different uh ways of thinking about value where it flows how to how to use it uh yeah and that's what I was trying to to get at with this was to more properly write what these flows were yeah I think we can together work on some spring work to do a proper analysis on the rule of Staff yeah beyond that as you know right recently um like apart from his general purpose Roll-Ups right like optimism or Arbitron um we we also see a bunch of these applications specifically roll ups right and do you think the value of proposition for these applications basically roll up will be different compared to the general purpose visual app and uh and uh like as these total dollar providers right they may subsidize the cost for the users as the provider itself is the application so they have the incentives to really to um that basically capture more users than sort of as a user to pay more right and what what's your thoughts on these yeah yes so yeah when let's say if you have this framework that kind of maps the design space for you I think it's my opinion it gets a bit easier than to Think Through alternative designs and especially okay what happens when if the user demands we we force it to be to be very specific so at specific grow up is to say okay we don't now allow like all these different types of user demands there's just like a very simple stream of user demands and simple is a big exaggeration because it can still be complicated but uh yeah so how do you how do you think through that well that roll up still has I would say sub constraints so paying for instance for the for the data availability but if you want to subsidize it uh there's maybe different tools that you have uh at your disposals for instance is rollups can meet their own token and that can be used as a way to yeah move the cost around innocence when the user sends a transaction you can say Okay show you you don't have to pay for it but on some other side I have as a roll up to to pay for my running costs and so maybe this costs I can in a sense tokenize it in the form of extra issuance and sort of rainbows people who are expanding costs to make these users use the subsidized app chain yeah to make these parties running these specialized app chain uh kind of hold like so that they have they're compensated for the for the cost that they expand that's one way another way is then also just um I don't know VC funding like you can say well if you're running a full node for my uh from my app specific chain I will just reimburse you for words and whatever you're publishing to the to the base layer also but you can still think of if you think of a rollup system as as like a more General entity uh this VC money funding that is typed like to be directly to the operators bank accounts you can even think of it as uh more value but just enters that that hold up system so maybe there's an argument here to to to redalence uh because so or like different ways that you can think about it yeah yeah sounds good and uh as we all know right a bunch of uh what has been done I eat during Foundation like basically um um to to uh to empower the L2 skating Solutions right um so in your opinion what are the missing parts for the layer two solutions like for example your lab Solutions yeah um yeah so I would say I haven't actively worked on a tools for a couple of months now mostly because I was active on PBS but I I do try to follow as much as possible kind of updates uh and the new things that are happening uh in that world uh I would say generally my impression is it feels like we are not exactly where we thought we would be maybe a year ago so people were saying okay L2 22 that's the year where everybody's moving through to Rolex it feels like maybe that has happened like definitely there's been a lot more adoption for rollers than uh previously and Royal apps are matured more Etc but I don't know maybe it's like it's a bear market and the gas prices on ethereum are not so high so there wasn't such a strong push to like really everybody moving to to a roll-up uh but yeah I would say it does feel like perhaps uh we had higher expectations which okay then the other side is having seen for instance the development cycles that went into making the merge happen which is like a very complicated uh update it it also feels like often in that space we we're like okay this is like a no-brainer like we can do this in a couple of months and get into production like no problem and yeah reality is also that roll ups or ethereum or any other chain it's just like a huge piece of engineering and so when you look at the update that we are done and they're really significant so for instance uh Bedrock for or Canon or optimism Nitro for our bedroom all the CK EVMS which uh some very differentiated from from one another and sort of address uh different parts of the of the market and not just ckvm but even things like Cairo for for stockware like it's very clear that a lot of engineering effort has been spent the results are kind of showing we also have on protocol side things like foreign that will boost the protocol's ability to to provide data availability for the rollups so yeah there's a lot of moving pieces at the same time and it feels like maybe it will come to fruition I guess a little later than maybe we expected but I don't know I I would say yeah what's missing is maybe with spinal pieces things like decentralized sequences I think are very important and at the moment there's not like a clear roller that has yeah put that into production uh in a way that that feels nice so yeah I still a bit more to do but also recognizing that you know there's been a lot of work done and maybe we will just yeah keep pushing a bit more yeah absolutely as you mentioned right for the past year I would say there are a lot of great achievements for either optimistic roll up or ZK roll up I mean well as you mentioned right uh basically are like ethereum is the heavily pushing the debt starting EIP 4484 to really help to make the data availability layered derived we need less expensive for the roller projects and I think all these achievements finally will sort of uh pay off um yeah and for the last question right as you know we are doing with the opportunity views that means we want to know some alternative advice or suggestions like you can leave to our listeners and audience like well what kind of alternative advice you have for us okay uh I have to I so the first one is I would say more qualitative but it feels uh interesting to talk about it is the idea of imposter syndrome and the idea that when you start in that space and you're trying to understand like what the hell is going on it feels very daunting and it feels like oh my God I guess these Galaxy brains around that already know everything like how can you like do something that's new and and relevant and yeah my advice here is that imposter syndrome in my opinion never really disappeared like I I still feel myself like oh my God like there's so much more that I could be doing or there like other people doing doing like crazy stuff and I'm mentioning it because we have uh this program it's the third time that it's running uh it could be ethereum protocol fellowship and so we have like this cohort of 25 people who are first they're really brilliant and they're great and they really are super motivated to to work and this came up in a discussion where they said you know it's like difficult to project yourself in that space because it feels already like very competitive very yeah like everybody's like having super elaborate arguments on Twitter and stuff but yeah my advice here is to like not be um yeah don't feel scared and try to find something that speaks to you or at least that's kind of how I started is I was looking for problems that I was like this looks like something that's manageable for me I don't need to understand everything at once I can just focus on this one thing and uh and then taking my own spin on it and trying to build up from there not just talking to people understanding also that most people in the space are extremely reachable which is really nice like they are never going to say oh you know you should know this by now like we were trying to figure it out there's a lot of things that nobody really understands or or even knows about so yeah so generally people are just kind of uh happy to to talk about it and to to try and make sense of it um together that would be yeah the first one and then okay that was I guess more qualitative so I wanted to also give one that is more about uh crypto a bit less beta and an alternative view that sometimes I have is I I keep on the ring if we can do better than burning the base view of EIP 1559 it's it's become like a pretty big Meme and I would say yeah since the start of eap-1559 has been uh I checked the number yesterday it's more than 2.5 million each that was built so if you think of it as like I'll try some money yeah yeah so yeah I'm wondering like okay this is four billion dollar that we just lit on fire it's not exactly that but uh it we can think of it as yeah issuance that just never happened or something but but you know you have like this spot which yeah it's not really about if you consider it burn but uh there may be better things that we that we can do with with it and for instance uh where we too quick to say okay this is the only way we can do it like it's true that it's it's a huge amount and most daos today don't have the organizational capacity to even allocate uh such amounts of money but but sometimes I I daydream and I say you know we're mechanism designers there's these huge space of mechanisms why did we pick like the one that feels the simplest of just yeah we're not going to bother with it we're just going to put it in the in the bin um I don't know that's so yeah I don't have a good answer for it mostly because I feel we are very early in our understanding of what ethereum is and in uh in in relation what if the asset is like we don't know if it's money we don't know what properties it has we don't know how people want to use it like we just know that you need it to pay for stuff uh on ethereum so so I don't know but yeah I don't have a good answer but I'm just putting it out there as maybe something alternative but sometimes I I like to think about yeah we appreciate your two advices yeah that's amazing I think definitely from all your experience and all your life sort of blending for the past and uh yeah uh but no I really appreciate our time it it was a great talking to you and uh yeah really thanks for all the attentions from our like audience and community members and uh hope you found these like sort of sessions very useful and interesting and in the coming months we will just talk to more experts in the industry about their two scalability scabilities and also the economics around the crypto space and uh yeah for more information please subscribe our Channel and uh signing off till the next time yeah thanks everybody foreign
