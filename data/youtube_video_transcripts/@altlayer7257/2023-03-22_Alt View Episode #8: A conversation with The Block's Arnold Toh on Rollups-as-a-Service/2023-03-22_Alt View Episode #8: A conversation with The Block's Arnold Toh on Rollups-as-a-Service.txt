[Music] uh hello everyone Welcome to our view at all view we chat with industry leaders get to know their opinions and insights and hear their views may be popular and popular brand new alternative or anything in between I'm your host Yoshi from earlier and elastic execution leader on ethereum for web 3. um today I'm super glad to have Arnold from the blog research Arnold has involved in crypto research since 2020 his research mainly focuses on blockchain scaling technology and also zero knowledge projects um hi Arnold thanks for joining us uh of you I really appreciate and the why don't you start off by telling us a little bit more about your background and also your research at the blog ah uh hi Elsie uh yeah thanks for the introduction and uh first I would just like to say that it's a great honor to be invited here and uh share my opinion with you guys uh yeah so a bit about me um I started my crypto journey in 2020 in 2020 when I first bought my uh first Bitcoin and then uh from there like I started delving into the you know the technological aspects of blockchain Technology as well as cryptography and um afterwards um somewhere in mid 2020 I managed to land an intern uh role at the Block as a intern researcher and from there uh you know I guess like my research career just kind of grew and um in at the blog uh I slowly found myself gravitating towards like uh blockchain scaling Solutions maybe because I'm very interested in them and uh yeah I just started to look at roll ups and sharding and uh just basically the different mechanisms in which blockchains can scale yeah sounds great and as we know right two weeks ago You released the article called your lab as a service right which is sort of one of the very first few articles uh talking about like Iran's and basically the roller price service got a lot of attractions these days and in your opinion how do you define rust and why do we need Ras in general right so that's a deep question um I would say that um the term grass wasn't actually like uh coined by me like I've actually uh you know heard it from some of like the other analysts that I talked to and um basically a lot of them were just talking about different roll ups project and how all these projects you know allow a developer to just spin up their own roll up and uh you know just utilize um their framework as a form of like Baseline and um you know shares common settlement layers so they don't have to worry about security basically uh the idea of like grass I or at least what from what I gather is that they're just trying to you know abstract away all the complexities of you know having to run your own blockchain trying to like bootstrap your own network and just letting a developer just build up on the execution environment itself so I guess that's how I would Define us right like uh basically you're providing like uh all the services required for a developer to just run an execution environment and like if you can do all that for developer then um yeah I guess that makes you a Russ as for why we need them I think uh based off like the you know traction that you started to see uh you know late last year and early this year it's quite obvious that like um many of like the use cases in blockchains are very um you know narrow because of the speeds that reach like the speeds as well as the fees of like the using transacting on chain so I think like when it comes to things like uh you know Pub trading or like uh games you know some developers might choose to have a more optimal design and therefore you know they want to have an execution environment that suits their needs as well as the needs of their users so you know uh inevitably um they will turn to Russ as like a solution for scaling their applications yeah that's so true like especially uh in your article right you mentioned a bunch of projects also including us so the uh so I think for us like the end goal probably as you mentioned right is just to build some easy or convenient to use uh for developers to quickly spin off like a sort of like uh the L2 infrastructure for them to build some scalable applications on top of it yeah so um like once we have Russ or roll up as a service um like are there any new use cases or applications we can expect in the future by using this kind of raw systems well I think uh generally speaking the new use cases so far would be very difficult to tell although my best guess would be uh you're looking at a lot of web 2 applications that are trying to like decentralize themselves now uh for example social media right um and in general I would say that like uh the state of like web2 media uh you know is set for disruption right like a lot of these social media companies are you know huge uh places where there are venues where advertisers go to and all of most is not all most of the revenue you know uh sometimes don't get passed on to uh the content creators and I guess um well that's not necessarily a bad thing or a good thing I think um the industry is so-called right for disruption however if you were just to you know run like a decentralized version of uh Instagram or Facebook on ethereum like that would be very costly right and if you were to put it on like some generic roll up like arbitrum or optimism like um you're gonna clog up the blockchain for um a lot of the other users so uh these I would expect you know like these applications will eventually move on to their own like um roll up where they can settle on like a secure layer like ethereum so like maybe they will build a roll up on top of ethereum uh but like uh you know with as with this call like we're discussing roll up as a service system I also turn to uh this uh rust to build their own Roll-Ups right because it might be so much more easier for them to just leverage uh Ras instead of you know building their own rollout on ethereum and I think uh the main to answer the question right like what are some of these new applications right uh I would say that uh they are generally applications that uh you know require fast throughput and they are currently looking to be decentralized so I give them an example uh but like as for whether more of them might pop up in the future uh it's hard for me to say today yeah that's true I would say like especially for a social application right these days uh either Jack Dorsey or even Elon Musk they are trying to find new ways to um like you know do decentralize the existing social infrastructure uh basically trying to sponsor some new protocols to help to build the Next Generation social applications I believe with Russ or or this kind of platform right we we can't sort of like a similar experience of AWS in web3 so application developers can just focus on their business logic development instead of like really bootstrap or build the infrastructure from scratch so it'll be super convenient for them to have a dedicated layer to handle the requests from the users and at the same time like to provide better user experience for example the account abstraction or can even carried on the gas for some of the application like social application or games yeah beyond that we know that in your article right you also mentioned about this customizable execution environment because I believe for a lot of these l2s the um they also provide some other virtual machine or environment to execute a contract or programs right so how can these customizable execution environment help the web key web3 applications and what should one look out for in this case and what are the pros and cons yeah yeah so the term customizable execution environments were something that like I thought about and I use because I think it's it's a good summary for what a lot of these um Roll-Ups actually are so basically when we talk about you know uh just spinning like spinning up like a roll up uh basically what you're trying to build is a place where environment where applications can just uh you know execute the code and uh why these uh customizable execution environments are important is because if you were to have a single execution environment um you're not going to get the most Optimal Performance right because you you might have a decks like uni swap that facilitates large volumes and large trades on ethereum and you know because of that gas fees even though it's even though they can go really high it's a small percentage of trade volume but if you were to run like a herb decks on ethereum uh if you're running like a small trade with a very small margin that has a high leverage well that doesn't make sense to run ethereum because the high gas fees is going to lead into the small margin that you put in so yeah what I've just said is and it's a good example of why a single execution environment is not going to work out for all the different applications so what should one look out for in this case well you're going to be looking out for environments that are built to you know withstand the uh the demand of the application so I believe uh you know generic Roll-Ups uh they are pretty straightforward but you have like uh uh Road apps I think from like uh like there's a dimension by cosmos A lot of them are just building like um um a framework in which you know uh basically you can spin up like an execution environment and you know customize it to the way you want now I would say Ras is like a bigger version of this right because like Ross actually talks about settlement but um CE I'm just gonna you know short shorten it CE like for sure is um a place where or like a framework where you talk about uh how you tweak the parameters of an execution layer so that you know the application can perform best and uh if we were to talk about the pros and cons I think you know I've been talking about the pros about C so far right um as for the cons the one greatest con that comes with like using uh CDE is that like uh you're gonna pass off all of the security assumption to the underlying like settlement layer and that is very important right that's why rust is so important because uh when you just you know spin up an execution environment like uh you assume that like the settlement layer will be secure enough but uh as a developer I can't just assume right so where are steps in is that like uh if we build like a common settlement layer for this uh you know these different roll ups like uh you know we extract the way that concern right like multiple Roll-Ups can have a shared salmon layer and then not worry about it because the sediment layer has a certain amount of economic value that's securing it so I guess that's where CE and Ras are tied in together right like they complement each other I see yeah so uh as we know we all know right right now like uh you're doing a lot of research around this Your Love Solutions and uh in the current space we have two directions one is all optimistic ruler and the other one is the ZK show Lab right what do you think about the programs of these two directions so far like uh I'm sure you've been following all the online activities or different l2s right optimism or ZK sync um yeah based on these uh unchain activities uh like what kind of trains are we sort of uncovering from this about the growth of this ecosystem yeah yeah I I think a the debate between optimistic rollups and ZK Roll-Ups have been you know very very uh hotly debated like uh it's a very like oh I would say deeply researched space um I think that the progress of the two of them have been very clear in the sense that uh you know optimistic Roll-Ups are going for uh compatibility right they're just trying to make sure that like uh you know optimism have the evm equivalence you know arbitrary is trying to like uh make it easy for uh uh have developers to you know onboard um basically it's just you know to become a cheaper faster version of ethereum right as for ZK Roll-Ups uh I think it's very clear that they are going with a more optimal like optimized approach they want to make sure that like uh you know we can handle scaling at the highest levels uh you can look at dydx you know you can look at ZK sync uh they are all trying to reach a level at which we say uh you know what we can to rival you know uh the traditional institutions in terms of transaction per second right and the best way to do it is to have like a very robust uh ZK Tech underlying the uh roll up like that's that's the that's the best way they can see right so I think when we look at you know these things I would say that like um the trends that evolve from these uh uh you know directions uh for the optimistic roll upside it's um it's hard to say right like because many of them are just going with like they call data compression methods they're going with like uh I think optimism has their big rock upgrade and uh it's just to make you know the uh environment the the op stack more customizable so I guess um you know when we talk about the trends in the optimistic uh roll up space it's um it's hard to say for now you know exactly where they're gonna go uh it's still pretty much an open book but I think when it comes to ZK roll up the trend is very obvious that many of them are going for the ZK evm narrative right you have a lot of Zeke Roll-Ups that are trying to build like uh evm compatible uh version and you know try to onboard applications from ethereum but um I I guess in the long run um these these uh Trends uh can change and uh in General I would say that like um when the narrative is there like it makes sense for these uh roll-up developers to you know Follow The Narrative uh because at the end of the day a roll-up is only as robust as uh the tech as well as uh the size of its uh Community size of the ecosystem which is dependent on the users so if if you choose to go against the narrative like you're taking the risk that you either you know you set a new trend or you fade out into the background so you know with that I think that like um for for both of uh optimistic for both optimistic relapse and zdk relapse like uh you know the trends will continue to diverge and we'll likely see you know a law uh vibrant you know Divergence of uh Tech uh like Divergence of approach in which these rollouts develop as we move uh hey yeah that that um that's so true especially when you're mentioning about the um I thought of the community friendly approach right for for both directions it would be great like we can really make it like a developer friendly that's why either for optimistic roll up or Zeke roll up everyone wants to be evm uh compatible or even evm equivalent so in that case um basically it's quite non-intrusive for developer to migrate their solid contracts to the L2 Solutions yeah another thing as you just mentioned right uh as we all know like security and the decentralization are basically the basic properties for most of the L1 and l2s but in an article about Road Labs right you see that decentralization is not necessarily always optimal um yeah can you elaborate a little bit on this part yeah right so when I said that decentralization is not necessarily optimal it's because uh I think it's uh been shown over time that um no matter how much you try to like speed up a blockchain uh there will always be some form of trade-off so we can see like I think the best example is a Solana with like it's uh you know fast block speeds uh and you know Fast Track confirmation times but uh eventually you know they they had uh issues whereby the blockchain goes down because you know the validators are just not able to support the throughput of the transactions now I think um uh this is not to say that Solana doesn't work I think Sultana has a great blockchain and like they have its own target audience but I think we must understand that like in order for Solana to to deliver on that level of speed uh you know it needed to sacrifice some form of decentralization and if we were to look actually look closer at some of like the scaling Solutions do they you know whether you look at polygon uh if you look at arbitrum uh if you look at dydx all of them have you know certain level of centralization now does that make it you know um bad I don't think so uh I think that the users who are using these uh roll ups or Solutions like they understand or at least they will eventually understand after using all um if you want these speeds then you need to be okay with a certain level of trade-off right so if you want X for leverage trading right and you want that of uh self-custody right then you're gonna have to face the fact that like that sequencer is relatively decentralized right if you want to use a polygon voice cheat fees well then you're also having to deal with the fact that you know the polygon validate the pool is a lot smaller than ethereums so I'm not saying that you know you you should always be okay with centralization but I think that if we are talking about scaling blockchains at some point in time we'll need to trade out we need we'll need to sacrifice centralization right we need to sacrifice decentralization I mean and we have to be okay with that as a user we have to evaluate like is you know the trade-off in decentralization worth you know the reduction in cost you know the increase in speed like I think these are uh things that like a user a developer should uh think about when they make their choices in terms of you know which Roll-Ups they want to use or how they want to design the rule Yeah so basically there's no Silver Bullet I mean on the scaling Solutions you always a compromise among lines of our security decentralization and also the performance right um so what we can do basically just provide more options for the users or developers so they can choose based on their use case or scenarios and regarding the scaling Solutions right we all know that um like they are sharding app chains and also roll up right how do you feel about them regarding the progress of the deliverables for the past few years yeah so we know that a lot of these terms right they came up like uh six or even seven years ago and right now if you look at the current blockchain space right probably um only like uh the the app change and your lab sort of deliver some of the uh that sort of sdks or source code right but in general based on your experience and also your observations um uh overall how do you feel about the progress or all different approaches um well I think that um all the approaches have their own merits um in terms of their progress how I feel is that uh it's it's great to see you know uh l2's uh you know roll up starting to gain some level of attention some level of traction uh and and in terms of like shot chains or like app chains um you know also starting to see some degree of like uh attraction but I think um rollouts definitely take Center Stage here and um the the reason for that is because uh app chains are still uh you know a relatively newer like uh idea so um I don't think that there are app chains out there which have you know started to become dominant in their market share as for short chains I think um just to be blunt uh most of the shutting Solutions today is still very much rely on having like uh one shot that handles most of the transactions right so um I think that sharding itself is a very useful concept and uh it's gonna be very crucial for ethereum's uh 2.0 when they start launching their short chain for data availability uh like the short chains of today will serve as a very good precursor for what might what might happen uh but if you're just talking about the short chains that have already you know been implemented and like you know existing today um I would say that uh by and far like um they they most of them do follow like the L1 narrative right like they had like a period of uh you know a lot of activity and then um afterwards when the bull market comes down uh you know the TV out as well as the uh on chain activity on geometrics or just start spiraling with most other elements it's not like you know blockchains are worse it's pretty much the same so I I think uh with regards to that um how I feel is that um you know Roll-Ups uh will most likely take the center stage moving forward yeah that that is so true especially right now right we have so many like teams or projects working on uh new Solutions um either for a general purpose or applications plus free roll-up Solutions and as you can see right with more application chains or relax coming out what happened extra on new features uh do you like to see from them apart from the high TPS or evm compatibility yeah so I actually think uh because some of my research have actually gone into like the space of like uh kyc uh or you could have uh for more privacy you say ZK kyc right whereby you can like improve your identity with like a validity proof instead of you know having to show your identity um and I think that you know it would be very interesting to see you know Roll-Ups having like a DK kyc like uh opt-in kind of function whereby you know you have rollouts that uh you know maybe all of this was under a single umbrella right and then like uh some of them you can only assess if like you have a ckyc from a particular jurisdiction right so like in order to get that through you'll probably need some form of regulatory body to come in you know to attest that the kyc is indeed like uh true and I think that that is actually a very uh you know it's a very careful way in which regulations can come in you know without exposing much of like a user's privacy and it's a very uh you know opt-in opt-out basis like basically if you want access to like a roll-up and its ecosystem right and there's like a requirement for kyc then you know you have to adhere right but otherwise you know you always have the option of like uh you know going to a non-kyc required roller and why that's so important I feel is because let's just say for example you are a regulator and you want to like enter the space like you can't just say oh you know I want to do this I want to do that and then like uh expect everything to work out right like uh if you have a kyc roll-up environment I think it's more practicable like it's more uh it is a more achievable goal and like you can actually enforce the regulations in such an environment right like I feel like that might be the first step towards like uh actually having some form of on-chain Regulation and I I think that you know that that would be something that would be very interesting because I for one believe that uh you know the blockchain space should be regulated you know it's not it's like an iron fist but like uh like more of like a step-by-step basis and like I think this might be a very good way to do that um yeah this view is quite uh like sort of new um to a lot of these um uh I mean developers in space because we've been discussion uh with a lot of like I mean uh projects um especially the Privacy project right they want to provide some sort of uh verifiable computation environment uh for a lot of applications in that case so either um it uh the the the sort of the contract or the program can be verified by developers it can probably also buy some authorities as you mentioned like qic is definitely one of the applications in their scope um yeah so uh we always end with uh one more question like uh like do you perhaps have any like sort of alternative or overview of the existing L2 Audio Lab space right now or perhaps for the industry in general right um I think I'm not sure if this is an old view right like but like it's definitely a less common view which is um I think optimistic Roll-Ups won't die uh at least when I talk to other analysts many of them would be like oh you know optimistic Roll-Ups wins for now but uh eventually ZK will have to catch up and overtake them uh well I I personally don't think so because uh with from what I've researched classify I think that you know the idea of using fraud proof is pretty much uh arbitrary right like in the sense that like uh you're just trying to find like fraudulent transactions yeah over like any specific window but um I think there is a branch of research that goes into how we can have like hybrid Roll-Ups like basically uh you could have like proof window uh until uh the ZK proof is generated and then posted on chain and then once the ZK proof is you know posted on chain like uh it becomes uh you know valid so then um you know you don't have to wait for the Frog proof to you know you don't have to wait for seven days to withdraw like you only need to wait for the proof generation times uh and then like if you don't want to wait for that you know you can always withdraw earlier for maybe like a fee and like you know that there could be like a market for that uh but with respect to that I I think in general it's just that like uh a lot of people are looking as if it's like a optimistic roll-up versus ZK roll-up but I don't think that's the case right like I think that uh every one of you like roll ups as like a general concept and like uh frog proofs and validity proofs as like another type another type of concept right then like it becomes clear that like okay moving forward you might see roll ups leveraging both fraught proofs and validity proofs now then that becomes like what a zkoor like uh you know it's just I I would say it's just like a more interesting way of looking at how you use technology instead of just saying oh you know uh arbitrant is going to win uh ZK Singh or like ZK Singh will eventually overtake arbitrary kind of things but uh I don't feel like it's that that that's the case right like it's not a competition like in that sense it's more of like a collaboration like uh all of this is just to you know increase the the to advance like blockchain technology so I guess that that is my view um yeah yeah I don't know if it's really an odd view but it's just like a less common view yeah but I think it's a it's a really nice view I would say because like uh especially right now the for DK roller right you know the proof uh generation time is uh it's a little bit long it probably can take a few hours or even few days during that with a window as you mentioned right we can just combine optimistic roll up and also ZK ruler just make sure like either if you really believe in the proof ZK proof you can just wait for the proof to be generated and verified on chain or you can just in an optimistic way right so we just assume all the sequencers can generate the right blocks um and I in addition right Vitality also mentioned that we can also put some extra governance if there are some extra dispute on this approved verification on the Arrow one yeah but in general I think it's a really cool View and yeah to all the listeners I really appreciate your time and yeah thanks again like thanks anode for coming here and to give us a lot of nice sharings about the Jolla player service and also um the progress in the roll up space in general and in the coming months right we will be talking about more experts on the industry l2's skinning Solutions and just feel free to subscribe our Channel and meanwhile we are waiting uh like sort of for the next guest to share a little bit more either the roll up or on some other new topics um yeah thanks again and uh yeah we are signing off to the next time [Music]
