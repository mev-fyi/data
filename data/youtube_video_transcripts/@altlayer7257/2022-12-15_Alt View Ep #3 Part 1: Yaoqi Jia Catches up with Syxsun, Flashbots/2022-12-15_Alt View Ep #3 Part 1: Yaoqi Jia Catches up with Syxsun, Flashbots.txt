[Music] thank you so hello everyone Welcome to our alternative view of Simply off view as you know right I hope you we chat with industry leaders to get to know them and also their opinions and insights and we hear about their views may they be popular and popular a brand new alternative or anything in return so I'm your host Yoshi from earlier and elastic and versatile execution layer on ethereum for web 3. today it's our great honor to have Xin Yuan working with the flash ball these days and he's also mainly focusing on the research on IBM EV and also three EVS so it's a sort of great pleasure to have him and I see man can you tell us about yourself and what are you working on at the moment yeah sure um so um I mainly do research as fastballs or performance art as most people say that my talks are kind of more like performance art rather than research but uh yeah overall so my agenda would be to unlock the magic of credible commitments that is how I would bring it not that movie but unlock the magic of a credible commitment so what if you think about why crypto has many value right like it's because we want to use crypto as a device such that we can encode General statements about any kind of credible commitment and those credible commitments restring uh you know in whatever game restrain those agents action space and SAS is easier to reason about the game right and then if you restrain the agent from doing some you know undesirable actions then it's possible that you increase the social welfare or AKA like increasing the economic efficiency okay yeah so this is like oh what we are all doing here right I have created as a hobby then why does this tied to Mev specifically is at the you know unlocking the magic part you know it has some magic most people are working on you know uh having you know how do we extract this magic but then like there's a real Blocker in my mind is Mev so because of Mev it's a major incredible commitment cannot be exerted why it is because um it is because the economic efficiency that you can gain from having a cradle commitment will be eroded due to the the negative externalities caused by the you know quote-unquote past dependency of which approach you you take to eliminate those efficiencies inefficiencies yeah so then if you choose to use you know permissionless credible commitment devices uh you know such a crypto to achieve this you know coordination then you have the externality of Mev and this is you know what we are doing here yeah I see I see yeah it sounds amazing at the same time as you even you say that it's not research but from your description it's quite like sort of academic and uh as you know right in that car you talk about what's Mev and what's not an EV I'm I'm still have a lot of like um like sort of Impressions on like how you share about like the description on these um definitions um here can you also share a little bit more about your research on these topics and probably just start with like what's Amy Vienna what's not Mev yeah sure exactly um so at devco my colleague Alejo present and give a talk about this is not a movie and then I give it up maybe so I'm gonna start with this is not let me be part um so uh you know if you think about any game so so previously I mentioned that we wish to use cradle communion to solve the inefficiencies in economy right so in any game the agent have some payoffs right so then um what kind of payoffs are exactly I mean we kind or not so if we take the simplest example a prisoner dilemma right so in a prisoner dilemma you have two prisoners A and B right and they if they choose to both cooperate they got a higher payoff than if they both choose to uh you know defect or if one of them choose to defect another choose the corporate then the one chooses defect will get a higher payoff right so then yeah this is for background now so then like let's take the simplest payoff schedule let's say if they both cooperate then both of them get a payoff of Two And if both of them defect then they both get a payoff of one okay so then like uh in the original game we know that the dominant strategy equilibrium right the dominant strategy for each agent to play is to both defect and then at this time both of them get a payoff of one right so both of them extracts a value of one from the system and this value is not Mev because there is you know nothing happening there's no conflict once right there is no uh right because the OG definition of family states that if one one you know privileged party or a collision of privilege parties um can extract value from a system by manipulation of the system then that value is called Mev right so then like here there's no like manipulation or privilege party happening this is purely like where the payoff the value that you can extract from the original game okay so that one one from prison dilemma is not muv so what is that maybe you know so for example now we have a credible commitment device right so suppose so the we have crypto and then you can publish small contracts right this is some sounds great then one of the prisoners published a smart contract saying that if the other agent commits to corporate then our community corporate if the other agent does not commit to corporate the Alchemy to defect right then once the agent a publishes the smart contract for credible commitments and the other agency States contract and the dominant strategy for the second player would be to commit right and then both agents can meet cooperate and then you know we got we got the best payoff right like both of them cooperate and then both of them get the payoff of two and then if you compare it's four minus two right it's like we we have gained and two units of social surplus and this value uh can be called Mev right because this is like you change the game you wrap the original with like giving both players the power to do crowdable commitments and stuff you've created value and that value is npv however uh and this is clearly one of the good enemies right as people call it yeah um yeah so there are more nuances to this right but uh um yeah let's move on yeah so uh you just mentioned right so uh okay propose a new definition for mev23ev I think that's the the beauty part like the beautiful part I I at least I heard from your talk can you also share about like three EV part-time I believe in the new definition of my Evie it's it's a really more precise yeah yes yeah exactly so um yeah so some backgrounds for us really like the motivation for me basically uh you know to instead of the original definition as the original definition is that any value that the miner can or like the blob users they can like our validator can extract uh from insertion or deletion or reordering of transactions within a block that value is called me so that is cog definition given by fields and the widely used by a lot of academic work on Mev and then you know there is also the folklore version right the folklore version used by most people on credit or Twitter or like while in the industry is that any way that you can make money your own chain is called family or not even on chain right anyway you can make money is called me um however you know this folklore version has been disproven by my previous uh you know uh prison dilemma uh thing okay so now we want to give a better example right we want to give a definition of a movie that actually works so like as a motivation let's think about why uh opaque privacy so things like threshold encryption or Fair ordering doesn't work so the reason why it doesn't work is because you can it is true that you can eliminate them if that originates from Agents gaining and expert knowledge about other people's private information what do I mean by expert knowledge is like if you have two agents AMD they should they are supposed if they were supposed to play the game in simultaneous order but then like currently one of the agents plays the game as if it is it is in a sequential order and such that agent knows the previous agent's actions and then in the activation information is then the Surplus value that the second agent strategy is called you know bad energy or like I I I I usually characterize this as Mafia IV because if you look at this what's what you are really is like form your mob and then use this mob to uh you know either extort others or to act previously on based on your information right so then like uh yeah so extortion is also a heavy part of this right because it is a well it's a it is a well-known principle in classical economy that if the seller knows the utility of the buyers and the seller can extract a surplus or like uh yeah can you extract the Surplus almost that almost equals to the full utility of the buyer so so on that part is it is clearly Mafia EV right so if I'm excited I know that you have a utility of one million for this painting they're like I will charge you one million right and say I know you will accept yeah so so this like and then suppose I didn't know that I would probably just I don't know charge you something like 500k and then you know there's a difference the doubt have 500k is like Mafia IV that's true okay yeah so so uh okay so back to the fair other example so there are other uh or like stretch to an encryption any kind of private mempool solution basically solves this because they say oh there's no way you can extract information from other people's actions right I don't know anything that you do and thus I can't I can't ask on this information right I can't extort you I can't give you an offer that extract almost all of your utility because I don't really know which real utility is so this is like how they aim to solve this but however you know there's a major flaw with this it's because like as we previously mentioned uh the whole reason why crypto has any value is because we want to use crypto as a credible commitment device right however like credible commitments cannot work if you don't know like what what the commitment is right like the whole value why it has any you know the whole reason it has value is because you you know that the commitment has been made so suppose The Prisoner dilemma example now the the first prisoner published is the Smart contract saying oh if the other person commits to cooperate then I will commit to corporate otherwise I commit to defect right this is the the commitment not supposed to end up in like you know uh uh a private scenario then like the other agent does not know this commitment has been has been committed then like zanza again then the game doesn't check out or like more generally what you can see is that uh we know that uh in D5 or in general in amm trading it is better to so so in the simplest example suppose you have six orders Buy sell Buy sell Buy sale right then it is better for everyone if I order the orders in Buy sell Buy sale by sale rather than Buy Buy sell sell sell right because in that case the Sleep the slippage is the least right um if I order by Buy sell myself so that's essentially the like Coincidence of ones we we let users trade against each other instead of like trade against the market maker right because the market maker is more slavage um okay so then like we know there's some coordination there is some welfare that we can recover from knowing what the user's order is right if I don't know what your order is or I don't if I know but I don't have the power to reorder your transactions then I cannot make Buy Buy Buy sell sell into Buy sell by sale by sale right like there's some certain amount of welfare that is lost from not being able to coordinate so this traditionally like in game theory has been called price of Anarchy which is right it's intuitive like it's Anarchy there's no single coordinator that can help you to recover this welfare and thus everybody pays the price okay so then uh so then we also right like so then we know that fair ordering or private mempool or like in general like the traditional private event for traditional strategy encryption schemes that's not account for this because it uh even though it eliminates Mafia extractable value but it's best burden of price of Anarchy so then like we really need a new you know term for this price of energy scene right because what we really care is like social welfare we want to everybody have a better price we want everybody to you know Gain real utility from using crypto or using you know any kind of any bearing applications uh so then we want those two terms but it's ugly if we just add those two terms together right we say oh what we are optimizing is price of energy plus this Mev term why not just like call them both I mean and I are I I argue president is Mev okay but but let's uh let's get back to the three points the price of Anarchy is something I usually call like monologue extractable value for those yeah yeah so uh so monologue is basically like this uh deity in our God in like uh I think Hebrew culture or yeah like like in the Miss that it's uh it's basically an evil God that has a head of a ox and then uh and you can sacrifice your child to the God and then the God will grant you immediate success in war so this is like how the mythology goes um and then uh in you know in modern culture uh people usually use molok to refer to inefficiencies in the economy that is caused due to this coordination right so why is this is because like uh if you imagine like uh you like this coordination is basically you know very similar to sacrificing your future with AKA your child in in return for immediately you know in reason for like immediate gains in war right so yeah uh okay so that's why we call it tomorrow like his credible value and you know you can notice the mixing malloc and Mafia both start with M so we can you know keep the Mev term very well um and so why why you know why I insist on making uh price of energy another term for Meb is because like if you look at the for example uh lft launches or liquidations right so in those things it's not like anybody right like so so it's intuitive those two things are Mev right like Atomic Arbitrage liquidation and energy launches right like like those things are surely me like even by like our intuition on folklore definition however there's no agents that gains any kind of exposed private information Advantage right there's none like all of the information is public and yet we our intuition tells us there is still Mev then why is that is because this is a coordination problem right you have a scarce resource set you need to allocate and a lot of people want it so that is like you have some Mev to be extracted from the you know allocation of those resources and that allocation itself is uh a coordination problem yeah and the validator can front run the other users to like sort of do this kind of value extraction right uh yeah it is possible so in that case it would be the validator exerting Mafia Mafia extractable value on the system however like it is also possible that the value is created without the valuator being the mob right so so imagine like you know two agents uh like resources for example the easy example like Newton and leftness right like the votes claim the crazy like calculus first however like so you can kind of feel there's quote-unquote fronts running happening here right however there isn't like any Experts of private information Happening Here Right none of them are like acting privilegedly to anything it's just like they both come up with the thing so it's same as in F and that he launches right everybody has a need for their essay and it's not like people are acting privileged on that so the thing you you were talking about right like so as a coordinator or the validator acting privilegedly based on the information so they think traditionally so for example we've we've been calling this like this situation has an incredible Auctioneer or incredible coordinator so in this case so for example we know that in second price auctions right second price option is basically right like and you you beat your true value and then the high speeder pays the second highest price and then like in this case we know that it is possible for the auctioneer right the seller to boost the you know to boost the price that the winning agent pay by inserting fake Beats right you can like observe all of the bit and place a bit that is like the first speed minus Epsilon and so extrapolate so this is like um the mafia EV case it is also possible that uh uh so so we also know that uh Second price auction is the most efficient okay we have maximizing mechanism that you can use to allocate a good right so then not suppose you don't use second price auction you use like a sheeting mechanism that is uh some weird things like like for example random right you have people do like paper scissors rock paper scissors to decide who gets you know they are who in the auction so in this case you're not neces you're not necessarily allocating the goods to the people with the highest utility right there is some social welfare loss and their social welfare loss is the monologuing spreadable value right like yeah so yeah you know separate things then yeah yeah I think you you really give like sort of a long explanation about this 3ev and we all know that it's like sort of the um like the different definition like whatever this Mev right already happening on ethereum and also various other elements like poly polygons and also being beaten and even some noun evm chains like Solana uh beyond that we know right for the recent like out to general purpose outfits like uh Aviation and also optimism right we can also monitor like sort of like we don't see anyv at the moment but you know right it's a claimed to be first car processor but at the same time right as as previous previously discussed the bunch of like applications first video lab um a sort of building are built for these adapts that is a device social app and also games I also would like to know like do you think there are some some potential Like Me cases is the in this sort of a prolapse that has the isotonal audio we're also providing some approval for application but do you think in the near future for this uh apparula to do feel like there will be a lot of places for the Mev yeah so great question I've been thinking about this for a while and especially since like you know this is a thesis that many people in the community share right the uh you know action thesis or like most people you know as a fancier name Charlie developed thesis okay so I said people I love fascinating like in the role of community but yeah um okay so so if you think about it then what uh so previously I talked about like monologue incredible value right so that that part is about um uh coordination right and then we know that there is Need for coordination there is Need for uh a coordinator for elimination of a you know inefficiency if the scenario is more complex right if the scenario is to uh if the scenario is simple uh or I would call more common value common value I think everybody wants the same thing then you don't really need a super expressive mechanism to solve this why so imagine the simplest case Arbitrage or liquidation um right then everybody wants the same thing what do they want they want to First capture the opportunity then you real then what you really need is a very simple mechanism that for example PGA works right priority gas auction or like block space priority options that basically says okay like I auction of the first slot in the blog and then this very simple mechanism actually solves most of those Mev right because everybody wants the same thing if it's common value thing um however uh if we move from common value to diverse values and this doesn't really work right so this is also the motivation why we ended up in this model of PBS proposal Builder separation is because the builders is able to not only run those simple mechanisms but also to do bundle merging or like block building uh in general so like bundle merging is basically saying you have diverse preferences and then for example one person wants an nft launch another person wants to capture the uh to capture the liquidation then those two things can be merged right they are not in conflict of both wanting the first slot of the block so then like we have merge them together so this is you know the more simple case like they're like um uh so block building is basically for the generic version of uh the generic transaction version of this like and you can merge non-conflicting bundles together um okay so so this is why if you move from common diverse value or diverse preference is uh then you need more expressive mechanism okay so then now talking about app prolapse then after Labs as you can see moving from generic uh General computation platforms to application specific Grow Ups then we know that on a single domain right domain meaning chain or the roll up then the value moves from diverse preference to Common value right so right like so for example previously people launched both in FTA and the FTB on the same platform now they move to different Roll-Ups different chains then on each chain we only then on each chain we only need a very like you know simple mechanism to solve Mev right because there's less overlapping in the preferences or like you know each agent knows more about other agents preference for the same good or the same resource right so then like we can so so what this implies is that on a single domain or on single chain on a single roll up then uh there is still nav however there's less monologue and EV to be eliminated because there is less diverse preference there's more common value okay so so uh so so this is you know uh the single chain case what about cross chain cross chain is where the model can even believe on right so like uh cross string on like cross application specifically then uh you know you can imagine like the the cross I don't know cross coming coordination here is where it captures most of the uh you know diverse preference allocation problem yeah [Music] foreign
