[Music] we are live hello everyone this is Amrit kumara Chief Operating Officer of Walter and welcome to a new episode of all fear where we discuss layer ones roll ups app chains and other blockchain infrastructures today I'm delighted to have Nick white from Celestia hello Nick how are you doing good thanks for having me Amrit I've been following outlier for a while uh and so it's good to connect on this podcast no thank you thank you I think we have been in touch for quite a while you know we spoke uh me and Mustafa I think we spoke and then we had a call with the smile as well and then we were in conversation by email as well uh regarding the program model of fellowship program as well yep okay so let's let's talk let's talk us all so could you Could You intro to who so that you know the audience who is not may not be familiar with you can get a glimpse of your background and your role at Celestia sure so I am Nick white I'm CEO of celestial Labs as you said and uh I got into crypto because I was originally um an electrical engineer so like into computer science but more actually focused on the AI side of things but in 2017 I kind of fell down the crypto rabbit hole and I realized that crypto was in blockchains were this technology that could scale human coordination in new ways and I felt like it was leading towards the the kind of world that I wanted to live in where people and communities were more empowered to be Sovereign and independent and uh so I I really just got addicted to the idea of building these systems and in 2018 I um you know jumped into crypto full time I co-founded a project called Harmony which is um another layer one my whole Vision was like we need to solve scalability for these things to actually be useful and effective and that was kind of my first foray into trying to solve that problem we pursued sharding um and then after two and a half years I learned about this new paradigm uh which is modular blockchains and I read this white paper called lazy Ledger that introduced that whole concept to me written by Mustafa uh who's our founder and uh it just totally took over my whole my my mind and I I couldn't stop thinking about it for two weeks practically couldn't sleep and uh I knew that that was to me it was the solution that people had been searching for to this problem of how do you build scalable robust secure decentralized blockchain infrastructure that could actually you know unleash the full potential of of this new paradigm that blockchains have created and so I joined the project in early 2021 and um yeah the rest is history it's been a great ride we're very close to launching our mainnet which I'm sure we'll get into but that's that's my story let's talk a little bit about this model Paradigm that as you say um why do you think I mean what you know for those who don't know what model of philosophy is what it is in in simple terms and why should we care about it like if I am let's say someone who is transacting on layer once today including ethereum and whatnot uh why should I really worry about oh think about uh you know model blockchains as the next next Paradigm of infrastructures yeah so I think people are aware of a few different you know problems with blockchain infrastructure um as it is today one of the first ones is scalability so it's kind of well known that um basically blockchains as they are have a limited capacity and so actually I think that's just to sort of frame this right we have to realize what what modular blockchains are versus the status quo and the status quo or monolithic blockchains so what that that's pretty much every blockchain from Bitcoin to ethereum to Solana to every every blockchain that exists today is essentially a monolithic blockchain every layer one I should say um and the problem with monolithic blockchains is that the way they're designed is that the the protocol does all the functions of a blockchain within one set of nodes and that leads to some fundamental constraints um that that make the infrastructure less useful one of the really big ones as I was getting into is scalability so in a monolithic blockchain um there's a fixed block size Beyond which you can't uh you can't go beyond and that leads to the fact that like as a blockchain gets more and more adopted like there's more applications more people sending transactions eventually that block space gets filled up and now you have to increase the fees and now people just get priced out right so ideally we can have a blockchain where actually the block space is not finite it's not fixed and as more people join the network um it can actually increase and that way fees don't have to increase at some point right so that's why for example ethereum why isn't every application living on ethereum why do we have things like polygon or Tron or these other like networks that are basically just a copy of the evm is because people got priced out of the ethereum main chain because of this fixed capacity so the beautiful thing about modular blockchains is that they totally flipped out on its head and make it so that for the first time um a modular blockchain scales its block size with the number of nodes in the network so you can actually have a blockchain where as more people start using it more nodes are being run the capacity also increases so you it's it's really fundamentally the first breakthrough in scalability from that perspective and there's there's other aspects of it I think it's one of the really core ones I'll just stop there in case I think the follow-up would be more like where's does celestia fit in in this in this model architecture right and so could you tell us a little bit more about that here where does where does solicity in this in this new world yeah so as I was saying monolithic blockchains they do all the functions of a blockchain within one protocol and one set of nodes and those functions are a number of things one is uh consensus so that's basically ordering the blocks so like you know once a transaction is like put into a block it shouldn't be reverted it shouldn't be changed so that's that's one function another function is what's called Data availability um a lot of people don't uh it's not a common term in the in the in in most people's uh understanding of what blockchains do because it's kind of solved implicitly in uh monolithic style but basically what it is is you need to make sure that all the data behind a block has been actually published so it's public information that anyone can download there's a another function which is settlement which is basically how do you choose what the canonical chain is and the last one is execution which is how do you verify the uh that the the transactions have been executed correctly um and and there are no invalid State transitions so basically are the rules of the blockchain be followed so they have those four functions and in a monolithic blockchain they're all tied together in a modular blockchain you split those apart and what Celestia does is specifically the consensus and the data availability part of of this equation and it leaves so it provides this very secure scalable block space that is ordered has consensus on it and is available meaning that it is publicly it's published and it's verifiably published and then roll-ups can run on top and do settlement and execution uh on their own basically so that's that's where Celestia fits in is sort of like this sort of Base infrastructure on which people can build Roll-Ups which are themselves blockchains and I mean I guess there's also the benefit in this I mean from from simple uh as you explain right and the moment the moment execution goes out you can actually put all sorts of exclusion execution environments right so you don't are you're not necessarily limited by I guess uh evm if you want to go beyond you could actually have different types of even you know virtual machines running alongside each other and having a base layer that provides da correct yeah yeah exactly so the the beauty of that is that um I mean one of the advantages of this is that your blockchain actually has its own independent space on which to run and it doesn't you're not competing with other uh like applications don't have to compete with each other for resources correct and so talking about data availability how would I mean some people maybe who are non-technical they would ask you questions okay I understand data storage I understand let's say being able to put data on I don't know RV or I don't know ipfs or somewhere right how is that different from having my transactions on Celestia in terms of data availability so basically what how is data available different from data storage of some sort um so data availability is very different than data storage in that um so data storage is like okay I have this data I want to make sure that it is still around for a certain amount of time so you you um you want to make sure that the data persists um now data availability is something different which is like I want to know I don't actually care about the Persistence of the data necessarily what I care about is is this data published so that I could download it so it's a very different thing and and the the problem you want to solve specifically with data availability is like I so to kind of understand why why is it hard to scale data availability because the only way to typically verify that uh data is has been published is to actually go and download that data yourself meaning like so imagine like I claim to you oh I wrote all this stuff down and you can see it when you want you would actually have to go and like read that yourself to make sure that I actually wrote it down and and you could read it if you wanted to now um the reason that's hard to scale is that as that amount of data increases right you have to download more and more data it scales linearly with the amount of data so as block size increases the overhead for people to verify data availability increases linearly so you can't if you want to run you know a global settlement system or like you know a global blockchain that won't work right because as more and more people use it itcreases the overhead for everyone um and so what data availability really solves is it makes it so you can actually verify that that data has been published publicly um without having to actually download all that data instead you just download a small fraction of it and you get the same uh basically security as if you downloaded all the data so that's that's enabled by this technology data availability sampling which uh Celestia well Mustafa our founder uh conceived of and we're the first uh Network to actually build live in production more about this I mean we you know you mentioned monolithic chains and how they're different from this new and they're not scalable and how modal architectures are actually better if you actually want scalability but you know one of the things are still there you know in all sorts of forms and you know shapes right you know you could call them l once you could call them side chains or whatever right they are in different shapes and form available today so you know from that angle do you feel like I mean of course there are criticisms that comes from monarchy chains as well do you feel like there are certain criticisms that are somewhat valid criticisms towards uh you know sorry modular blockchains hmm so I think they're I think there are valid criticisms but most of them boil down to just the fact that the infrastructure is still nascent so I think like most of the most of the problems with modular blockchains right now we actually know how to solve them and it's just a matter of like have we thrown enough engineering Firepower at the problem to to be able to crack that and and solve it and so for example and it keeps evolving too right so um one of the one of the big ones recently was um this idea of like okay well now that I let's say so our goal right is to make it as easy to deploy a blockchain as it is to deploy a smart contract the problem is when you're deploying a Roll-Up um you actually have to still bootstrap a network of sequencers so it becomes very similar to just launching your own blockchain which is a lot of overhead um but then recently there was there's been a lot of work on this idea of shared sequencing right where all of a sudden you can have a shared network of sequencers that perform the function for you almost as a service in the same way that Celestia provides consensus and data availability as a service and so uh I guess what I'm trying to say is like the the cool thing about modular blockchains is that um there's so many new problems to solve they're all very much solvable and there's a huge opportunity to sort of like knock them out and and the people that do are gonna make really valuable uh networks and really valuable products so that's my perspective okay and so and the you know looking people looking in the in the you know in the space today this I mean you would notice that there are kind of two kinds of parallel or maybe somewhat intersecting uh work being done in two different ecosystems one is you can call the ethereum ecosystem and the other one is the cosmos ecosystem and both are on modularity right what do you feel are the differences in either the approach or the solutions being built in the two different ecosystems so ethereum and for example let's say let's say take arbitrum right or or some of the l2s or Roll-Ups that are being built in the ethereum ecosystem right they are one could argue for example that they're not technically fully modular per se um maybe arbitrum Nova has its own da and things like that right but there's a very odd argument that goes in the ethereum ecosystem where if you are not putting data if you're not using ethereum as your da then you know you are not you're not a Roll-Up so but of course it only has a different approach so what what is your perspective on this like do these ecosystems are trying something similar but in a different ways or what was going on there yeah I actually am glad you brought this up because I um so Celestia has a lot of ties with the cosmos ecosystem we are building using tendermint and the cosmos SDK um and we have a lot of just you know overlap uh with a lot of Cosmos engineers and we have a lot of respect also for college but also have a lot of overlap with the ethereum ecosystem because uh John and and Mustafa were you know researchers within the ethereum community when they came up with the idea for lazy Ledger or Celestia and this whole modular blockchain paradigm so it's Celestia is kind of like a synthesis of of those two visions right so and I wrote a thread about this um and I call it what I call is the internet of modular blockchains which is that um so um like it's the the the cosmos vision for blockchains is that there's an internet of blockchain so you want to be able to everyone should be able to spin up their own blockchain and connect it to each other kind of like uh the way that you can build a website and then connect it to other websites this is very powerful because you get sovereignty and you also get this customizability of like your the app chain thing right then you have the ethereum vision and this is the not the ethereum rollout Vision but the original ethereum Vision which is like this world computer where you have shared security meaning that all these applications can talk to each other in a very secure way and then you also have um the ability to deploy something very very easily like a smart contract is like super easy to deploy it's much less overhead than running a blockchain and essentially Celestia is trying to actually get all of those properties within one system so you can actually have shared security you can have ease of deployment you can have sovereignty and customizability all within one system so it's kind of it's kind of a synthesis of those those things um and in the long term I see that um uh kind of converging so yeah we'll we'll see how it all plays out I don't think that I think they're gonna I think the ethereum cosmos Visions are going to kind of align okay and talking about you know you mentioned about app chains right and of course the parallel of some sort would be app specific Roll-Ups in the modular in the modular world one from your perspective what are the what are the key differences and of course technically speaking but uh there are differences because you know the independent sovereign but for me obviously what are the differences and what I really want to know is what is from if I'm a builder and if I want to if I have to choose between an app chain an app specific roll up how how should I decide on which one would be best suitable for my application number one or does you know the do the these two paradigms kind of tell you that okay maybe there are certain applications that are better suited for one architecture or something that you can build on one thing but you cannot build on the other one that's a good question and I my thinking on that has evolved over time but generally what I'd say is for the most part whatever you can build on an app chain is you can build the exact same thing on um on an application specific roll-up there's there's certain things like you know for example you might want to have faster finality and then you um there's an argument that oh well then if you want to have faster finality on a roll up your finality is tied to the finality of the base layer um and that's valid however you can also have you can there are mechanisms you can use to actually give your roll up finality or not well finality is a spectrum it's not like there's it's just like how much how what is the cost of reverting that transaction and so you can actually have ways that like give you a certain amount of economic finality really quickly but it is true that you don't get the full economic finality of consensus until it's actually in the layer one so that's kind of one of the only valid ones that I can think of um but like you know in terms of you know building an application specific VM it's exactly the same on an application specific roll-up and one of the big differences that we also get a bunch of benefits by building roll up versus snap chain first of all the Lo much much lower overhead like eventually it actually will be as easy to deploy an application specific role as it is to deploy a smart contract we're getting there like it's not it's not at all what it is today but I I'm more confident today than ever that we will get to that point and so like if I wanted to build a cosmos chain it's like sure I can use tender mint and a lot of software out of the box but I still have to issue a proof-of-state coin I still have to get a network of validators I probably want to do a series of test Nets and everything before I launch and then I have to pay this continuing continuous security budget to the validators to like run the network versus an application specific roll-up you just eventually it will be as simple as writing the sort of the the business logic of your chain and hitting deploy and then you you will pay fees but it's the same as like paying ethereum when you're using a smart contract there's like dramatically lower lower overhead for a number of different reasons so I think that is going to be one of the big selling points another one is is you get interoperability well actually and this is the other thing right now interoperability between Roll-Ups is actually worse then Sovereign chains because basically we're we're still like figuring out roles of roller bridging is still like I wouldn't say it's an open problem but it just needs a lot of work to get to the ux that we want it to be and um right now actually like an IBC connection between two Sovereign Cosmos zones is actually a lot faster and better ux for now although lower security um but in the future when that's solved you'll also have a higher security when you're when you're interoperating between chains so I think that's going to be a big a big deal and talking a little bit more about this but more more from a I guess business social point of view right um we have seen l once we have seen you know l once in many forms side chains or whatever you call it right um and we have seen app specific chains you know under Cosmos and now we have a new breed this is app rollups do you feel like there's a demand like there would be enough demand for some of these uh infrastructures that are being built today or do you think that will take I don't know next five years for enough interesting applications that actually need their own rollups good question so well I think there's two two things embedded in that one is horribly too fast I mean this is my question yeah yeah yeah well I think there's two there's two questions one is like you know will people actually demand to build application specific Roll-Ups or will they just kind of stick to the current status quo which is building a smart contract on a shared execution environment like ethereum or even arbitrary many of these like more general purpose roll-ups um and then the second question is like also and just in general just do we actually need need scalability right now because frankly they just aren't enough interesting use cases or there's not enough demand for Block space essentially so I think the first one I think the first one it it uh I think there's there's a lot of advantages to application specific rollups such that like a very successful application I think will have a lot of incentives to migrate to their own rollup there's things like customizability so you can like actually make changes to the execution environment that are actually meaningfully in improve the ux or change the fee model in a way that like makes more sense for you right so I think having that those levers to pull are going to be really important if you want your applications for example and you could have interesting things there yeah exactly and I think like sure if you're just prototyping or you're just trying to see like is there you know um you know is this application gonna be viable like probably doing it as a smart contract makes a lot of sense but as you become more successful and you prove out that prove that use case you might actually you probably have more incentive to migrate so that's one thing the other thing that's actually really really really important is the is Mev capture and I think kind of generally if you're a smart contract it's much harder to internalize the Mev related to your application um versus if you spin out and do your own chain or your own roll up and so I think there's going to be a massive incentive from that perspective if you're a successful application with a lot of like you know uh value flowing through you you're going to want to like capture that as much as you can and internalize it so I think that's that's another big one um and then so yeah what I'm trying to say is like I think there will be a spectrum and like people who are building or just experimenting it still probably makes sense to build a smart contract but if you're more successful more ambitious application you'll do it you'll do a roll up now the other question is do we need capacity do we have need all this block space yet and um I think the the answer to that is it's hard to say because first of all like we just um it's it's so hard to predict the growth of a technology like blockchain that that I think has a lot of sort of like uh an exponential growth ahead of it and like what you wanna what you don't want to be in is in the situation you don't want to be in the situation where things have product Market fit and there's a ton of demand and there's no Supply to meet that demand and so I think it's better always to kind of like be ahead of where the demand is and I I personally don't have any doubts that in the long term there will be a lot of demand for Block space it's just a matter of time it's kind of like demand for bandwidth it's like hold on during defy someone as well that no one would have imagined the device somewhere in the way it started it started like you know in a few months time with blue blue is so big so I agree with you that you know you have to prepare because you never know when that one single application was one single I guess type of use case appears and then it kind of blows everything apart exactly yeah and you know like yeah then there's such a feedback loop between like applications and uh the demand for Block space and and so forth there's a lot of reflexivity essentially and I think um you know we're used to that both in price of tokens as well as like just the growth of the space in general so we should be prepared for like demand to 10 to 100 X over The span of like a year or something you know we should be we should be ready to actually like meet that okay talking Hannah you mentioned about Mev so let's let's talk let's take this Mev question that you know uh one of my uh friends wanted to ask you which is you know for someone they're always looking from outside what I mean by outside here is like traditional Finance people you know someone who is used to existing businesses out there so for someone looking from outside in uh you know when we wonder why is the broader blockchain space so Mev Pro like they want to kind of capture I mean we distribute mov and all that right and less keen on Building Solutions that prevent and maybe altogether again I'm not saying that it's completely people are not building all any of that but there's less I mean people are more open towards kind of capturing that MAV and distributing the right way why do you think that's the case like why is why is the broader blockchain space more open to kind of Mev rather than let's stop it all together because in the end it's it's still at least some part of the Meb users right in some way so what's what's your what's your what's your thought on this you know I I had that perspective for a long time uh until I got deeper into the Mev space and um so I think like there's a what's important to understand is there's a there's good mov and there's bad Mev or rather there's like uh Mev that I think is just inherent to these systems and then there's Mev that like is kind of exploitative and uh maybe maybe shouldn't exist if we can eliminate it we should try to and the reason because it all kind of gets bucketed together and then and then people just think that all Mev is bad but like Meb is inherent because like for example if you have multiple um you know trading like decks Dex pools someone needs to arm and there's like trading going on between them someone has to ARB to balance it it's like a it's an inherent service that actually we need for these systems to function or if there's a you know uh like a a maker a social sort of pool like a CDP contract someone needs to liquidate that right to keep the system safe so and that that is actually in some in a sense Mev because it's a it's a way for someone to actually Harvest like money from from the chain but they're actually providing a useful service so like that's that's that's good mbv and and I don't think like eliminating that doesn't make sense because it's something that is needed for these things to function that Mev is things like sandwich attacks where like you're literally just you know the you're you're exploiting a user to extract as like give them the worst executed trade possible um just so that you can take money and I think that that's bad and we should try to eliminate it um so and I think there's a lot of like work around that I think one of the teams I'm I'm really interested in is uh skip so they're they're building in the causeless ecosystem and they have this idea for um like right now the way that they they they do it is that they had to have like a trusted block Builder and what they do is the Mev that they capture they then you know send it back to the protocol and the protocol can choose what they want but in the future they have this really really cool idea which is a protocol owned Builder which is that the building rules are actually part of the uh State machine logic in a sense and so it can be enforced directly by the validators so you don't actually rather than having this trusted outside block Builder you actually have the VOC building happen on chain and um that makes it so that like your protocol can really capture uh Mev and can and your community can directly say these are the kinds of MVP that we think are good these are kind of MVP we think is bad and um this is how we're going to spend the Mev that we capture so I think that's going to be something that that will really take off uh in in the long term so hopefully that answers the question about like why not eliminate Mev I just I don't think you I think that's a misguided question and how does a movie change uh you know in this in this modular landscape yeah we just did a Twitter space on that with with Skip and Duality and another team called Austria um Duality is building this uh amm and Astra is building uh an evm roll up plus a shared sequencer Network and then shared sequencing actually has a lot of overlap with Mev but um Mev will change in the modular ecosystem in that I think um the like it it'll it'll make it easier for applications to become their own chain and therefore internalize Meb I think it also um you know Skip uh Barry from skip had this good mental model of me view which is that Mev is everything that happens between the user signing the transaction and expressing their intent to do something and then business Black Box and then the the transaction gets included in a block and is finalized and there's all this activity that happens in that black box window and that is where Mev lives it's like all these people listening to the mempool and sending their own transactions there's Searchers and Builders and all those things and what's interesting is in a monolithic chain that's a that's like a there's a certain number of steps that happen right and then in a modular blockchain there's actually kind of because there's more layers that sort of window that black box actually is is bigger and and there's more sort of different there's just a lot more um I guess layers of Mev essentially um and so it's it's uh it's gonna make the Mev equation design space much bigger and more complex in some ways um but I I expect a lot of the Meb to kind of resign at the sequencer level because like sequencers are the ones that are really ordering transactions in Mev at the end of the day is an ordering um you know it is about ordering maybe down the stack it kind of creates all sorts of effects right as well so you want it to be as high as possible in the stack correct sort of yeah yeah well we kind of agreed on is like we don't want Mev to cause bad ux for users so like users are are really like the Kings and they should be um and so if if Mev is causing them to have to pay higher fees like let's say like you know you're not sandwiching them but just the fact that there's auctions happening on chain for Block space drives the cost of like transactions up like the fees then that's a that's a bad ux so like trying to isolate Mev in the place where has a minimal effect on users is one of the things that we really want to optimize for and that might be pushing it higher up the stack but now let's let's talk about one interesting project that I think uh you know you guys announced recently it was about the uh The Sovereign roll up uh that you know you know use Bitcoin right as the as the da layer so um let us let us first go into what is this Sovereign role what does this actually mean right number one and number two is um what does it do to bitcoin so if you build a solvent roll up that is connected to bitcoin what does it offer to bitcoin and what should we care about hmm yeah so we we've incubated this um roll-up software toolkit called roll kit uh internally we started that I think in 2021 when there weren't no one else was building there were there were projects like you know optimism or arbitrum or star war or zika sync but there weren't but no one they were all kind of building their own roll up thing and they weren't really trying to build this like an open source tool for people to build their own roll-ups that's changed a little bit now like there's a lot of other teams doing that optimism themselves is not doing that without B stack but anyway so we built this tool and then we wanted to demonstrate how you could use it and um Eric Wall had had recently you know given a talk about how because of ordinals and all the nft activity on bitcoin it'd be really good idea to run a sovereign role upon Bitcoin so we uh over over a week we took roll kit and kind of like um made it able to connect to bitcoin and use Bitcoin as a data availability layer and so you can actually run uh and we actually ran a an evm roll-up on top of Bitcoin which is quite funny um and so it was kind of uh you know uh it was kind of for for fun for the lulls so to speak but it does actually demonstrate that like um just how modularity works and that you can plug in things like a roll up into any layer one and use them as long as they have like a good interface and like to be used as data availability and luckily with with um the the uh what is it called what's the name of the the upgrade the the recent Bitcoin upgrade made it so it's actually really uh there's finally a way to use yeah Tap Root there's actually a good way to use Bitcoin as a data availability layer and what does it do to bitcoin well a sovereign roll-up um doesn't actually have a bridge to the underlying uh layer one or data availability there so it doesn't actually Bridge to bitcoin so it's not like you take your Bitcoin and then you go up there it's not like the eth roll-ups where it's really connected like the ecosystems are connected like oh I bridged my assets up to arbitrum I play with them and then I Bridge them back down to ethereum um it's kind of an independent ecosystem but the thing is that it is consuming Bitcoin block space so it's actually paying to use um Bitcoin block space so it actually creates uh more demand for the fee Market of Bitcoin in the long term and in the future it's very possible that if Bitcoin for example were to add a you know new OP code that is like uh you know verifies the ZK proof then you can have like ZK Roll-Ups actually do bridge back to bitcoin you can actually have like the the capacity to have Bitcoin roll ups in the same sense that they kind of extend Bitcoin in the same way that a lot of ethereum rolls extend ethereum but that's kind of up for the the Bitcoin Community to decide if that's something they want to support um I mean you may not have a validating Bridge today but you could still add a I guess a trust uh trusted Bridge you could exactly you could have a trusted Bridge um where you take your Bitcoin and move it up there absolutely um and our hope is really that you know as much as that was um you know just kind of like to demonstrate the technology our hope is also that like this does spark more conversation and innovation in the Bitcoin Community because uh I think um yeah it'll be exciting to see Bitcoin you know be cool again and actually build build more interesting stuff indeed indeed um let's take two more questions we have about a couple of more minutes so one question is you know there's something about the ecosystem that you are building around Celestia as well and people who are using Celestia for different uh you know um DNA needs and I guess one common or one I say I would say one idea that is that is being seen in the solicitor ecosystem is around this roll up as a service models right how do you see it being different from let's say the likes of op stack or recently orbit you know arbitrum announced their arbitrum orbit I think how do you see them different like um you know from your perspective well it depends how you did Define you know Roll-Ups as a service because I think there's going to be you know they're they're going to be roll-up sdks like roll-up Frameworks you know so that's how I think of like bedrock and the op stack is sort of like a framework um and I think that their goal is like you know you actually Fork that code or you just borrow it and essentially build on top of it as like a tool but like optimism is not gonna run the node for you for example um and so I think that's that's like the framework an SDK approach it's also similar to what rolekit is and there's other teams like Sovereign Labs um and and a handful of others that are building like just a framework it's just software it's just open source software that you're meant to use um and then there's role of physical service which is a little bit different which is like and like where you are actually trying to host the node and the sequencer for four people so it's a little bit more like a white glove kind of like service and you know um first and and the interesting thing is you can actually use the rollup Frameworks to build that service so for example there's a team Caldera that is actually taking the op node stack and and building a roll up as a service kind of um product based on that so um I I don't know it's really hard to say you know how things will play out I do think there's going to be a lot of demand for like there's a lot of latent demand for people to launch their own blockchains but a lot of people don't have the expertise and so having someone who can you know do that kind of end to end for you is a very appealing uh offering I think so uh and so what I mean is like that that second class of role of as a service where they actually host it for you could be could be really appealing um but the other the other approach which which is going to be interesting to see how it emerges is like the shared sequencer Network part where it's actually kind of like a more permissionless uh and sort of like pay as you go decentralized approach to to a roll-up as a service so rather than uh you know someone actually spinning up nodes there's actually already a pre-existing Network on which you deploy or roll up and the sequencing and the hosting of It kind of like happens uh automatically on that Network so I I think in the long term I'm probably more I think that the shared secretary Network might scale or I just have certain better better things I mean they're just going to be different but I feel like the shared sequin network has has some advantages um that will make it potentially more successful long term but I I don't know it's it's so early but yeah we have to watch the end uh so uh the last question that I would ask you is uh the show is called alt view so it's about alternate views uh do you have any new or non-mainstream advice or thoughts that you feel you feel very strongly about but people either don't care people often disagree with you hmm does it have to be should it be crypto related or should it can it be yes that's fine as well shouldn't think of anything crypto related I mean obviously you and I and probably a lot of the audiences big believer in modular blockchains I think that's now becoming more widely known so I wouldn't call that like alternative it used to be very alternative back in you know 2021 um for example um I would say I would say kind of one one of the alternative views is just that you know Roll-Ups should be should be Sovereign I think people uh there's there's kind of been this Roll-Ups were conceived of and sort of birthed within the ethereum community and the goal was always to scale ethereum right to like get leverage on ethereum block space like do more with the same limited resource of ethereum block space and uh and and to like take your assets from ethereum and move them up somewhere and do something and kind of have these Roll-Ups be very heavily tied to the base layer and I think the the problem with that is it's led to this um conception of Roll-Ups that they are like baby chains to ethereum or some other base layer and so um when in reality what Roll-Ups are are there there are standalone blockchains they can choose to tie themselves to a base layer like ethereum or they can choose to not tie to any base layer other than aside from the fact that they post their data there um and in that way they can be Sovereign they can be on the same sort of tier of sovereignty as a cosmos zone or any other layer one blockchain um and so I think I think that's something that I wish people uh kind of appreciated Roll-Ups for the for that aspect like and then I wish we could break free from the mental model of Roll-Ups as like baby chains I think this is this is very true I think if you talk to most of the folks today and I think even if you look at L2 beats right you know there's this common notion that you know if you are not using a base chain for your You Know da needs or whatever right you cannot be you cannot be a roll-up you know they somehow even outright bad you and not even call you a roll-up if you if you which I think is a little bit yeah it's abuse of I guess definition in some way so and I I see I see your point that it is it is a it's a view that I think needs to be accepted more uh more openly I think it's something that you know Cosmos ecosystem does accept it more widely and openly which I think they think ecosystem has to be a little bit more open towards it as well yeah definitely and And to clarify I do think the data availability guarantees the role by actually very important for security but specifically you know sovereignty is about settlement like where is the canonical chain of the role of determined and does that happen on a smart contract on ethereum or does that happen in the node software of your rollup and even though that's a very subtle difference it makes a world of difference in terms of like is this chain just you know an extension of ethereum or is it or is it its own Community its own network and uh yeah I I think there's a lot of uh reasons why people will choose to build Sovereign Roll-Ups in the future great well thank you very much for your time Nick and it was live and would enjoy the conversation that we have thank you very much Nick for your time thank you it's a it's a pleasure and um looking forward to building the modular stack with you guys [Music]
