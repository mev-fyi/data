so I click the go live button I think the YouTube should be good let's realize yeah so last week for 12. one more minute to go yeah let's wait one more minute by the way hello everyone yeah I know so you're waiting for one more minute uh just for uh to be punctual I suppose and then we'll start at 8 pm Singapore time and noon uh London time yeah very nice to see you as well guys thank you very much for uh for joining this session and hello to everyone hello I think it's a time and um hello everyone Welcome to our year and the AMA together with me and also are great um and uh it's been a crazy year and um since the end of last year we started earlier um we made a lot of achievements not just on the technical part and also on the be and the marketing side and it's always grateful to have all of you together with us and today we'll just do a quick uh year and let's start our rundown with a 10 minute presentation after that um as we shared earlier right so we have all you guys to answer questions on the YouTube and then we will pick up some questions to address here and the meanwhile um we will also select some of the lucky guys um to award our RT um sort of icons for them okay let's start with this um very short summary uh for this crazy 2022 for earlier um as some of you know right um I believe like probably some of you uh previously um listen to my talks and uh basically you know like what's earlier and what kind of problem we are solving and basically the problem earlier wants to solve is about the stability issues not just for l1's or general purpose l2s but also for decentral applications for the past few years a lot of the general purpose and while two they are trying to solve the scaling issues where better consensus protocol sharding and the various various some other algorithms but in the end as you know right for the past three years we have so many popular applications like empty games and even P5 protocols examples are like actually Infinity uh d y d x so they just have so many users and so many requests and if you pull all of them on single general purpose or one L2 is just a congested Network and sometimes it can make the network down I example just like this crazy like active projects um especially for the empty means as you can see right a bunch of gas walls and also Network injections during their sale or during their campaigns so at all there right we are trying to provide a so-called like elastic scaling solutions for the web3 not just the general purpose there are once L2 but also for decentralized applications as you know right for a lot of the decentralized applications you want to serve not just like Hydro user or thousand user in the end we want to serve like millions or even tens of millions users and some applications let's say we want to serve billions of users in that case like you definitely need some high throughput infrastructure so what you can have right now either some Airlines l2s you can provide you like sort of golden throughput transactions uh per second but at the same time you also want some customization so for example you want gas list and sometimes you want to have rigid to multiple chance so on earlier side right as you can see we want to provide this elastic and also modular and even better customizations for for the infrastructure we provide for you and if you look at our value proposition right performance wise definitely we can precise a few hundred like so a few a few thousand like TTS by the same time you can also config your time to find finality for each Vlog like can be less than two seconds or for some of our game patterns in once a second meanwhile like we can also support like evm and WhatsApp in the future probably some other virtual machines to support better like sort of scenarios from the partners beyond that right sometimes you want to have multiple um like Bridges to multiple genes in that case uh not only are we we can also support that kind of scenarios so I'm technical front right as you can see we can provide this kind of and demand scaling solution you just click a bunch of buttons and then we speak of a dedicated L2 for you you can precise uh like a few uh a few thousand transactions per second meanwhile with very low blood time and can also support multiple VM with um with uh current execution layer beyond that you can also make a gas list or first account processor just to serve your users in a better manner uh with this idea and also some uh prototype uh in the early of this year we got some uh group foundries from the best of the crypto industry like polishing and also jump Capital meanwhile along with some other very famous engines like large Sean gath Iran King and attacking with their support right we have a relatively sufficient Runway to support the team to have a decent like technical development and also cleaning development together with marketing orange and in early September right as you can see we launched the very first DVM fully uh equivalent test night I mean well with very short block time and right now we already provide the bridge to multiple uh chains like ethereum polygon and the beam weekend and for past a few campaigns especially the ultimate right probably all you guys already tried the bridge it's very fast and we can also like do the refund immediately after the campaign is done if you haven't tried to the Test match um please just get some free tokens from the foresight meanwhile you can just deploy your contract and in contract and also try to interaction with the press and interaction with the Test match and early next year we just launched a new version and you will see faster uh finality and the meanwhile is better like sort of UI and user experience uh beyond the technical development side right as you can see we also grow the team from six people in the early days and right now we have a long-term five people um not just on the like technical side we have super senior Engineers like in the space um basically we work together since a few years ago together to build like sort of public blockchains and also bridging Solutions and at the same time we're also having very uh strong background like media and the marketing people to help to grow the ecosystem together beyond that we are so grateful to have like over seven thousand followers on Twitter and also six thousand like follow like members for this court uh beyond that we uh uh we are very glad to have over 20 ambassadors to help coordinate all the community members mean well to help us to um grow the ecosystem and Community together uh beyond that as you can see right we are granularly announcing partners shapes around like so-called for privacy and also on the did gaming part and also even payment parts we are trying to um help the partners who are reaching to us to provide our elastic scaling solutions for them meanwhile uh we are also trying to apply feedback from them to refund our technical parts for providing a much better solution for a lot of these partners and beyond that as you can see right from the Twitter or from the Discord you can see uh this year it's also a busy year for us to guide the invitation to give talks at ethereum.com uh misery midnight and ECC I mean well we're also invited to be the judges for East Berlin is listen and some other hackathons and events to help the community members to build on top of all year um and uh I think one of the most exact uh exciting moments that um like um this year we bought average my close friend and partner to be part of a team to help us to grow the team and also build a better strategy for the global operations and CEO and uh and then I hand over um the remain part of our great and uh he will explain more about the achievements and also our plan for the next year yeah thank you yochi so hello everyone again um very quickly I think I forgot to introduce myself so um my name is Amit Kumar um me and yaochi we go back I don't know seven years a little ago I think uh we were a part of the same lab we're doing research together and then we later started a company together called silica and now I'm I'm with uh again helping out my friend uh yaochi on different aspects of all's life was mentioning so before um before I saw someone asking questions about when when they can ask questions so the idea basically for this you know this session is we'll give you about 10 minutes of kind of a Roundup of what we achieved in 2022 what we plan to do in 2023 and then once we have finished the presentation we'll open up the floor for all sorts of questions so bear with us uh let us let us take you through a couple more slides and then you know uh we would be into AMA very quickly after that so uh very quickly on the spotlight so you know since we started uh you know we have uh our news and announcements have gotten great coverage across different uh and well-known Publications like uh of the likes of coindesk uh in the block and the coin Telegraph and we have also published uh several of one could call thought pieces on why application chain thesis is something that's still valid and it's going to be even more prominent in the years to come at the same time in order to be uh to do better Outreach we also started a podcast or you could call it a video cast of some software uh called alt view where you know we interview a very well-known uh people in the space uh building and solving very hard and challenging problems in the infrastructure space and so uh if you if you haven't uh you know listen to any of those postcard podcasts yet uh I invite you to go and join And subscribe to that all view channel uh we have interviewed people from inferior interviewed people from flashboard and bunch of other uh people are are lined up uh to to to join our broadcast so uh so do subscribe to that channel as well so yeah if you have we also became Antonio we also became an honorary fellow of uh the Celestia modular fellow program Celestia as some of you may know it's uh one of the I would say probably the first project uh that started uh this idea of modular blockchains and they are actually building a data availability solution for for different uh you know let's say execution layers and so we were invited uh as an honorary fellow to join their modular program we were delighted to be the part of that program as well uh lastly uh very quickly you know we when we launched our ort open uh on on the Open Sea we're actually uh the top nine uh in top five sorry top five nft projects are on openc so thank you very much for all the love that you have shown to OT uh nft uh collection so now moving over so um of course we have been busy building uh you know we have been busy building the flash layer product or something that you know uh you know we have been talking about where you know you could instantiate blockchains essentially or what do you call execution less and you can basically discharge them or you can destroy them when you don't need them anymore and also the persistent chain which is basically a traditional uh blockchain but designed for applications so for specific for applications so while we have been busy building this we also felt like it's important for us to test some of these products in real world scenarios so so we ran about three campaigns so far one of the first campaigns uh that we ran to test the viability of our Solutions in the in the wild was this uh with the first event that was called the OG badge nft the whole event were designed to create a scenario where you would have a lot of transactions uh that will go to the network in a very short span of time so for example we made the white listing process rather straightforward you just have to go and do a few game tasks and you would be whitelisted quite straightforward from that and so we had about 12 000 people were white listed there was no kyc so you know you just have to follow us on Twitter and you know join our Discord and a bunch of things like that and then you are a whitelisted uh participant for the for the campaign uh the entire event was free so you didn't have to buy the NFC you didn't have to pay for the nft and you didn't have to pay for the gas price as well so we actually had airdrop gas tokens for people so you didn't have to pay any single penny to actually get the nft and so the entire campaign was as I said you know was designed to create a huge number of transactions to drive a huge number of transactions a short interval of time and we indeed saw that see that so basically uh you know during that time we have we saw about 50 TPS this is not the capacity we can achieve much higher we actually the same network was tested for about 2500 TPS and just before the launch of the event and the all the nfts were actually sold out within 18 seconds so that popular it was actually not sold out more like it was allocated uh because you know you didn't have to pay for these nfts so they were allocated within 18 seconds and to give you this sense of this number 50 TPS during the time when optimism was doing its uh you know op airdrop uh the average TPS throughout the day was about 5.6 DPS and if you look at the arbitrome so arbitrum did a marketing campaign for Nitro and during the day in which my you know Nitro was extremely hyped and popular around that time the average TPS throughout the day was about 3.3 TPS so you can see how easy it was to and for those who actually participated in that event you could see how friendly it was uh to actually interact with the with the flashlight and the entire experience was gasless you didn't have to pay for any gas at all so that was the first event it was a free mint event designed to attract a lot of number a lot of you know transactions in a short span of time the second event was done with the goal to deploy a real world on chain blockchain game or a flashlight so we actually took Dark Forest as our as our Premier application so it's a it's a dark first for those who played the game uh you would see you would know that it's a game that's fully on chain so every single transaction that you make is an on-chain transaction and so we hosted that on one of our flash layers uh that has a TPS about uh that has a latency about about one to two seconds and then in fact you know I played that game for a while until I I couldn't cope up with the with the experts who came in and you know took all my planets away but basically it was when you played that game you'd feel that it was actually not even on a blockchain so it the experience was completely different it felt like a traditional game and that was extremely powerful so during that uh so we hosted the game for about two days and we received about you know 90 000 transactions per day so about roughly speaking about 2000 200 000 transactions across two days and so that's again to give you a num sense of this number to a thousand transaction this is about 60 of the volume that um optimism sorry arbitrum was doing on a daily basis around that time and about 90 of the volume that uh optimism was doing at that time so imagine something like Dark Forest hosted on a chain general purpose chain like let's optimism arbitrum and imagine one single application driving 90 of your transaction volume you can create all sorts of issues for the underlying blockchain you know gas price will go up things like that and nothing like that happened so if you played the dark force game on flashlight you would have seen that you know the experience was Flawless you wouldn't you wouldn't even feel like it was actually hosting a blockchain so the Third campaign was uh the most recent one the ort nft marketing campaign where we basically this time it was not frequently we wanted to mimic a real scenario where you would have to pay for these nfts so we actually did uh this uh you know we converted we actually created a ort nft collection RT is our uh mascot and this collection was sold out uh um you know within about 100 seconds to people from three communities so being B chain Community uh the polygon POS community and ethm community so you could take your assets BNB Matic on ether you could Bridge them over to the flashlight and you could then go and buy these uh you know um funny looking Ortiz and so it was uh we had about 35 000 people participal participating in that event and in the end again the execution was smallest you could see all these assets going back to open C and then we became uh trending very quickly on openc after all the trading volume I can't recall but you know within matter of hours we were doing about 40 either volume on openc so thank you very much for all the love that you have shown to OT and uh just a gentle reminder uh three of the best questions that will be asked during the EMA uh will be given a special nft ort nft at the end of the event so thank you very much now um this was something that you know um we have done in 22 we did introduced to achieve these these things in 2012. what are we looking forward to 2023 right so far I was for our Focus has been on two key products one was what you call a flashlight and the second one was the persistent line right our goal we you know when we talk to all these Partners uh you know over the year we realize that there's a need to build a kind of an open decentralized execution network of some sort but basically you'd it'd be something like AWS Amazon web services you'd go to Amazon web service and you'd say Okay I want a certain instance with this much of let's say around this much of competing power and can you give me that or this much of this this type of operating system running away and the system basically Amazon basically gives you that service so has that instantiates that instance and gives provides you that so you believe that there's a need to build something like that in a crypto space where you you might come with saying okay I want an execution layer that let's say that runs optimistic execution uh environment you want that to be running evm or runtime and you want it to be let's say application specified so you want to specify all these characteristics in a request and that request will go to this open decentralized Extrusion Hub and the execution Hub will then be responsible to give you or instantiate you rather of this execution layer that fits and suits your needs so we are aiming to go much broader than a much General than just two products and it'll be much more decentralized open and Universal open execution Network for all web 3 applications and most importantly if you go to the next slide most importantly it's going to be very user friendly so for example today most of the tools that are out there to spin up some of these nutritional layers are very SDK heavy so for example you need to understand how some of these sdks work to actually be able to deploy some of these executions and we feel like that has to go away so we are targeting a kind of a no code framework where you have a dashboard you would go to this dashboard and you'd click a few buttons and you specify your request and in the end the system will basically or the execution network will basically spin up instantiate our uh exception layer for you that fits you and suits your needs so this no core framework is going to be super powerful because you don't need to be a developer to actually go and the flashlight but anyway you still go and and click a few buttons and have uh his last layer ready for deployment and by the way it's not just a deployment that you know is is something to experiment with but the deployment that can go into production within let's say something like 10 15 minutes so imagine uh basically clicking two buttons and having an entire blockchain set up for you by yourself so that's how powerful we feel or like can become in the years to come and I think that's uh that's it uh so thank you very much for your patience uh I think it's time to kind of open up the flow for questions uh gentle reminder again we are at a time where uh you know the covet rules are still there so uh you know it's good to have some face time with all you guys and thank you very much for for joining in and tuning in today uh again a gentle reminder we will have a special ort nft uh we'll give them away to three best questions so uh prepare your questions and we are still we have collected a lot of questions and we are monitoring questions on YouTube unfortunately we may not have time to answer every single question out there but we'll try uh on our best to handle and answer questions that we feel more are most personal and something that has that is common among most people are from the community so uh with this I said uh yaochi let's let's start uh answering some questions you want to start with the first couple of them memory you can go ahead yeah okay so let's start with the first question so I think this is the question that came up um a little bit earlier uh which is not part of this but I think I would ask yaochi to answer this so uh we often talk about you know partly as an elastic scaling solution and someone asked us what what does it mean uh when you when we say elastic scale what does it actually mean in practice yeah so it's a really good question like when uh we we keep talking about like the elastic execution layer or elastic solution right the idea like if you look at this um like sort of the web tool or the cloud services we already have this kind of similar services in webtool that means like for example when we run an application or when we do our application right at the beginning we don't really have a lot of users to be honest at the beginning probably we just have a few hundred or even few thousand users right so in that case like probably you you just need a a sort of a dedicated roller or LG to handle these uh this uh amount of users but granularly if luckily we can really grow the business to another scale for example we grow the business from by just a few hundred users to uh tons of thousand users so in that case like um uh granularly from a few hundred requests but later on we have like medium requests once we grow the business into another level to serve like for example a meeting uh user right in that case I don't think a dedicated how to can really host or serve all the users or enamel requests so in that case it's the sort of the elastic scaling will come into the picture so at the beginning for example for your business right uh with you I do like social empty project or a game project for the first 100 000 user right I can see our dedicated out to using earlier to solve this first 100 000 users but later on once the skills um the the skill increases like we need to serve another 100 000 Euro right uh in that case you can just click a bunch of versions and uh and basically you can think of another data how to to serve the second hundred thousand users yeah granular as you can see right with small users to use my application or service I can just like where the Audio I don't need to sort of uh do an extra work I just click a bunch of buttons that similar to AWS right and then I can see off multiple l2s or rollaps to handle different set of users in that case I can grow my business from just a serving a few hundred users to serving a few like meeting million users um yeah that's sort of one way of scaling with the elastic skating basically with the number of users is increasing and we can think of more like sort of l2s where earlier to some of these users and now it does for example for anti-purchase or game projects or some sort of campaigns for a default project right it only lasts for a few seconds or a few minutes um like we know that we did these campaigns for ultimate ultimate means and also ultimate right the first one last uh social only 18 seconds the second one um was done within 100 seconds so in that case we don't need a dedicated L2 to last forever so in that case uh we just need a like sort of spin of a flash layer for a few seconds or a few few minutes or a few days right and this channel like with only a protocol itself controller for all the energy and also the remaining practices to different machines they are like we did for the um uh the ultimate the United States you can see right dedicated and also only likes it for a few seconds of your hour a few days but once you don't need it you can terminate it so you don't need to really maintain this kind of service or this kind of change whatever so that's the second point about the elastic scaling actually the last point I want to make is really about like a lot of the application right once you want to scale if you want to build your own app chain or build your own uh infrastructure you have to have and it's a 5 to 10 senior blockchain developers to build even using Cosmos or subtree some other like software free works and beyond that it's probably uh you also need to pay for the infrastructure fees and the meanwhile the maintenance is another headache especially you don't have the backgrounds or building on public blockchain previously in that case roughly within a year if you want to build a brand new infrastructure you basically need to spend like minimum one two two meaning US dollars to review the infrastructure for your own application but with all there I can promise it's much much cheaper so you don't need to click a bunch of buttons and immediately we can speak of a jeweler and attach to a dedicated L1 and you don't need to care about how you maintain a network how you fix some bugs and everything will be done automatically and the security derived from the L1 so from the three points right why not basically earlier can skill with the number of users you have the second Paradise regarding the duration you want to have the L2 you can Define yourself and the third Paradise since everything is automatic you don't really need to hire your own team to really maintain all the sort of infrastructure of yourself like all the things will be done by uh all layer yeah okay okay let me take another technical question and then we'll go towards um uh slightly less less Technical and business and marketing driven questions so one other question that someone named Xerox nobody asked um which is and the question is and given the development of the modular blockchain Paradigm and the separation of the execution layer from the rest of the functions what advantages does orclay have over other projects so it's pretty true that you know we have come to a space where it is pretty established that Legacy uh blockchains uh what people often call it um you know genes like let's say classical lithium 1.0 or any other chain that you know you see today that do consensus uh settlement and execution they are not scalable in that way and so model blockchain Theory basically says that if you separate some of these components outside of the base chain you can actually get much better throughput and that's kind of why you see even in the theorem space uh you know you know layer tools like uh you know arbitrum optimism zika sync stock aware uh stock net and so on uh as execution list the thing is um if you look at you know excretionally space today right you know you have all sorts of execution layers and that have each have each have their own characteristics for example let's say if you look at let's say zika sync so zika thinks gives you one type of execution layer that is uh runs evm or as the runtime it has let's say ZK Beast uh proof systems so it has a variety proof uh behind it and it's something that is mostly around around ethereum but imagine something like let's say you could you as a user you could say Okay I want to build uh wasn't based runtime I want a ZK uh roll up but it wasn't running on it and I want this to be secured by some other chain for example let's say I don't know near for example so in the end what's going to happen is this entire space will have all sorts of characteristics and all these execution layers will have different serve different purposes so examples one chain could be something like okay it will have ZK on it it will have evm on it if it will be designed for let's say a certain type of application use case for example it could be for just specific applications would be for sector for example it could be D5 chain for example and so on so there'll be a need at some point very sooner rather than later where you want to go to this platform and ask for a certain type of application line and this is exactly what you're building so when all these monolithic chains end up doing mostly settlement and let's say consensus and execution moves out execution will be uh our bread and butter Essentials we'll like we would like to Target all the execution need that comes from all sorts of developers so this is kind of one answer to your question on where artless sits uh when some of these things uh you know when the separation actually gets established over time let's take another question uh uh from a question about if ethereum achieves 100 ktps according to the roadmap do you think that the application specific rollup is still in need so let me answer this question so irrespective of what throughputs your underlying chain proposes if that underlying chain is a general purpose chain for example something like theorem even if it is able to do let's say I don't know a million DPS you'd still have applications that will need some sort of flexibility in how they want to use the underlying chain for example let's say uh that's kind of why for example d y d x recently announced the departure from with him and they're building their own Cosmos based chain because when you move outside when you become big enough and you want to move outside of underlying chain and build your own chain it gives you all sorts of benefits because you can customize your shin in all sorts of ways you can provide better user experience for example let's say you could build a chain today for your application that actually gives let's say uh you know has zero Gatsby for example this is something that's very hard to do uh on a you know gen on a mo you know generally speaking on a general purpose layer one so a lot of benefits comes from an application specific chain so rapid grow-ups and that's exactly why Earthly and other parts are rebuilding makes sense um on uh a non-technical question this time which is and there's something for yauchi uh what are your marketing strategies and how do you plan on implementing Global adoption yeah so currently as you can see right regarding the marketing strategy so um like for this year we have a bunch of invitation to give talks in all the top tier uh like blockchain conferences like ethereum Devcon ECC and Saturday night and for the next uh like Year we will definitely try to speak as much as possible in the major conferences just to share about like the progress of earlier meanwhile also the new products we are providing for the market especially for the Next Generation decent trial applications uh Beyond height we are also planning to collaborate and also participate in more this kind of hacker zones or some other like sort of events to demonstrate the capability of earlier and just try to push like sort of the dashboards we will have next year for the Developers for them to try out I mean well early next year once we like have the dashboard already we will have some invite only tasks for a bunch of our community members so you can really travel there's no code dashboard to launch a dedicated out to yourself you just need to click a bunch of buttons and configure the primary choice you want and then immediately probably within a few minutes you can just spin off a dedicated L2 with foresight excolera and can in that case you can immediately see it right and beyond that regarding the global adoption because right now we really have lots of I mean BD leads in the team are basically a lot of projects special energy and games it reach out to us and trying to collaborate with us for their empty means um so the thing like internally where we uh one one thing like for some partner we are trying to provide a customized uh solution for them that means they give us some uh their requirements or demands we we can collaborate and I will interview the uh like sort of the system but at the same time internally we are trying to automate everything um as much as possible so that means later on for empty Mint or some other generic flash layer requirements and some add-ons like multi-seek wallage and some extra setup we'll just make it automatic so where the dashboard is I need to click some buttons and immediately you can start you know afternoon or you can also start to deploy some like what is your wallage into your dedicated L2 um yeah as you can see right um I earlier we are still quite technical uh driven and so that means we will provide uh basically a series of brand new paradoxical Market probably we can really benefit the entire Market in general States and beyond that uh it's a real like we try to get more and more grass through developers to build the Next Generation applications I just mentioned right once we have a super um scalable infrastructure and then you can spin of as many Europeans as you want and to support your social application deploy MTN game application so what kind of new application you can build right now probably due to various limitations of general purpose Advanced l2s you have to think about like you need to consider the Galaxy and also the throttle link and the network congestion and sometimes the reorganization of the blog different chance but with your dedicated like unlimited your Labs like what kind of new applications you can build with all there that's something we are trying to uh collaborate with some as many partners as possible meanwhile we are trying to work closely with our community developers to figure out yeah one question uh it's a question from redmi three second uh what is the main Criterion uh criteria my Criterion for selecting projects that will be attracted to work it's a very very good question because you know if you compare what we're building at all play and uh compare this with let's say something like a general purpose uh you know L1 for example it's ethereum or any other or Solana for that matter the ecosystem building approach is going to be very different because imagine you're building a general purpose chain right and if you want to have let's say a decks like you need to upon your chain then a text makes sense only when you have enough native tokens running on that or posted on that platform on that on that chain and once you have those tokens a decks you know would naturally make sense because people want to trade that token those tokens similarly for example lending protocol would make sense only if when you have a stable coin natively issued on that chain then you know you can basically you know borrow and lend those assets quite easily using a lending reporting protocol so basically the entire ecosystem building approach in a general purpose kind of model is very stack based right so you you bring tokens once you have enough tokens you bring a decks once you have a stable coin you bring a lending protocol and so on so it starts to kind of become a very stack based ecosystem but for all clear because we are building application specific uh Solutions uh it basically targets anything that is Standalone so anything that needs scalable anything that needs customizability is something that we would Target so um our go to market strategy is in this uh you know for our play is mostly to focus on gaming nft projects and as well as social Fighters anything that can doesn't require too much of composability that you know can stand out soon and doesn't depend as dependency on other applications right so and that's kind of why if you see you know some of our real world events that we have done our campaigns that we did or two of them were nft events and one of them was actually a gaming event and we actually showed to uh the community and uh to the broader blockchain space that you know a flashlight would be ideal for something like gaming so similarly for example something like uh you know a social file application would be great uh to be hosted on on something like our layer let's take an interesting question uh I think for Yoshi would be interesting for you uh there's a question on I know that all Flair users security of ethereum or other L1 L2 chains but how secure is flashlight and how will you protect users from Mev would you like to take this one yeah yeah it's a it's another good question so as you know right for all they are we are doing with our team is the optimistic roll up at the moment and of course in the near future we are also uh seeking um the research around the zkr part but right now um like uh taking various considerations um like we're thinking we're thinking optimistic at the moment is the most performance and also most evm equivalent solution for the entire industry so uh in that case as you can see right for um the source of the rollers like apart from the flash layer basically last uh last for period time right we also have the persistent roll up for multiple genes so in that case like uh we will have this from proof and to ensure the security uh guarantees for the dedicated um L2 basically to get the security guarantee from the license out there at once so and in that case right uh we we basically we can derive the like sort of a lot of benefits from the L1 like ethereum at the same time internally we are also building various lines of Defense the first line of defense is that um for all the dedicated l2s that we provide right it has multiple uh different sequencers so that means like compared to the existing speed right the only a single server sequencer to handle all the transactions to do the frequency and also generating blocks for us by default you can choose how many sequencers you want um like uh like for the our past campaigns right we typically we use seven sequencers uh basically to avoid single point failure and to mitigate the censorship issues that's also the first line of Depends a writing decentralized sequencing system beyond that we the secondary difference is about the various social implementation of our verification system so we provide like granularly next year will provide multiple types of welfare why not you can just run the welfare in your dedicated laptop or your PC to do quick verification and Beyond the ID we also provide a web version that you can run the state this verifier even your browser so in that case like for some applications or users you can immediately verify your transaction or blog without waiting for the confirmation from now too and and beyond that we are also um like uh working on a decentralized network system as I've already mentioned right uh probably early next year we also share a little bit more with our blog post it's a brand new uh satellite decentralized sequencing system and also verification systems so that means for the l2s we provide for our customers or developers right most of the most our blogs will basically verify by these decentralized Network so that means the third line of difference before we have the flow proof from the L1 the from proof of the L1 will be the last amount of difference if you have any like sort of issues um like double strength on the Arrow too uh as a challenger you can just send this cannot dispute message on the L1 to trigger this frog proof on the L1 and of course right now we have sort of like two uh two implementations of that part one is this one stop for proof and the other one is one instruction uh like sort of proof anyway early next year we'll share a little bit more on these terrible details beyond that regarding flash layer right since they only left for a few seconds or short period of time right we don't really have the time to do the this kind of raw proof or verification fully on the L2 itself um within like sort of uh uh a very a few seconds right so in that case we have the mechanism like we will still roll up all the states to select everyone like ethereum polygon but at the same time uh if you look at the settlement or the river right we also include a lot of the transaction and also State changes so in that case uh depending on the application we can have a great spirit to check what kind of transactions so still transition uh being run and then they basically can do the dispute during this grace period if there are no disputes so all the results can be accepted otherwise they can redo the empty sale like on the dedicated L2 beyond that right it's a good question like you asked about the Mev right now we are collaborating with our partner automata to working uh to work on the very first L2 dedicated Mev protection mechanism so the idea arrives as you can see right right now for the L2 to um to prevent the front run awesome balls as you can see right we apply this flight and the gas mechanism so that's why when you do the empty means like for the ultimate Mint or the ultimate right um typically there is no like smart contract boss you know because we fly to the gas and and basically the most of the contract deployed at last minute the boss don't have the time to really check out the code and all the interaction in apis or interfaces so so in that case right it's the social first account versus itself even when you increase the gas on your side but in the end you still flattened and basically all the transaction is basically based on the Samsung the other item we will also like as I mentioned coverage or commentary we are trying to have some Hardware enhanced machines to to ensure like uh not just the time stamp based but ensure that all the transactions will be ordered in sequence instead of like there's no manner or sequencer can modify these transactions can reorder the transaction to have some advantages but anyway these things are already in our plan and we already have some portable implementations and next year we will just show more progress on this part yeah okay let me take a question uh from YouTube um just posted like five minutes ago uh someone by someone named AJ Yoda he says I participated in ort's mint event uh one alt uh can do many transactions so what makes users Hotel alt beside for gas good chain needs tvl or it will be just another chain that come and go thanks so it's a very good question so um the chain in which the chain which you used uh during the ort campaign was a flash layer so it was designed to be sort of short term you know so basically it was spun exactly and solely for that uh mint event and once the mint event was done the network was taken down unfortunately we don't have tokens uh we're all player hasn't issued tokens yet so basically us as the art layer as the as the team were running the sequences behind those tokens but in the long term what's going to happen this is something that we're building towards uh basically in order to let's say tomorrow someone comes and says Okay I want to issue nfts on what my on one of your flashlights then that project will have to somehow or some will have to tell us or tell the protocol how much economic guarantee they want so for example they could say I want the flashlight to give me at least an economic security guarantee of let's say 50 million dollars then people from the community will have to come and stake uh you know the assets to provide that Economic Security so yes the TBR will come in but in a slightly different way but yeah the chain will still be destroyed once they are once they are not longer needed anymore but yeah the TV will come comes from security the security comes in which is needed because otherwise anyone can behave maliciously and basically uh you would buy nft on the flash layer but you actually won't get your nft on the on the other side and that has to be avoided and that comes from Economic Security so all the nodes operating the network will have to ensure that they are they stake enough number of tokens uh to guarantee that Economic Security otherwise everything will fall apart so yes flash layers will be one of the products that will drive a short-term event-driven uh you know initiatives we also have persistent rollups that will drive more tvl but flash layers will be secured by economic theory that comes from tokens as well uh let's take one question that came in uh you know I'll ask Yoshi to answer this uh so the question is I think you kind of answered this in some way but maybe a little bit of clarification or shorter answer would be appreciated on this one so a guy named Cameron asks as Creator I found out about authlay if I log if I launch nft project on Earth layer should I do something by my own after minting or your system will automatically send funds and nfts to origin chain thanks yeah that's something we are we are trying to show uh early next year where the dashboard so the thing is like um it really depends on your requirements right if you want to do a free means we will have the like sort of the dashboard of the page and you just click uh a bunch of buttons and upload your jpegs and then also the wireless so things will be done like uh automatically um and you don't need to do anything yourself and even the acting means is sort of done right so the protocol will automatically roll up all the entities uh back to your selector ones like ethereum or polygon but if you want to do something uh like fancier like for example you want to do these attach auction or some very complex option meanwhile you have a very um like good decent uh I mean very decentralized sort of case about the UI so you want to really run your own you UI and I want to have some for example some gasoline's uh wallage and to support the acting needs in that case probably you need to handle your own front end uh on the back end you can just wear the dashboard or ask to search up the dedicated flash layer for you and you deploy your contact and connect your UI with the contract and also the backend like infrastructure it's also very free for you generally to switch your endpoints the RPC endpoint for the wallet and also for some of your front end and then at the same time you will have the foresight installer and all things writing so it's also like you need to connect to connect your existing API to the backend and deploy the content on the back end uh what the thing is done right the empty wind is done uh still like based on your requirements we can definitely uh automatically roll up all the empties to the selected elements meanwhile uh can also Bridge the remaining token to the different chains um as I as I just share right um it depends on your requirements uh there are some straightforward ways you don't need to do anything else except the like sort of the images uh or you can really have your own customized way to build your own front end but you just need to connect to the back end I mean the dedicated how to just set up yeah okay let's take um I saw an interesting question on YouTube again um so for someone named anward eurov um I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing your name incorrectly so the question is what will be your Revenue stream if there are almost no fees for transactions so it's a very good question so let's take the example of flash layer right so flash layers we spin up uh depending on you know demand from a certain project and then in most likely cases there won't be transaction fees or even if their transaction fees they'd be quite low to a point where that actually won't drive too much too much of Revenue so the model in which we are planning to operate is you know having a cut a percentage based on uh you know your primary sales for example and this could actually that that doesn't have to come to us fully so it could for example be shared across the node operators who are running the flashlight for you so for example let's say if you are a popular nft project and you want let's say high security for nfts you would say Okay I want at least each node operator to bring at least 10 million dollars worth of Economic Security and when they do a portion of the primary sales will go back to those who provide uh the economic security to run your flash layer so yes for our Revenue will be in similar mode where a percentage of the primary sale could come back to us uh you know as as a part of uh running the infrastructure there's one more question that I think would be good if um yaochi would answer this so this question is uh again from YouTube uh someone called God and gawd not g-a-g-o-d so God says uh is the use case of all flag only limited to specific things like minting nft for a mass efficient people efficiently so the basic question is is it is oddly a solution only for nft maintenance or can they do much more yeah you want to take this one yeah um so because like as um as you can see right even during the presentation we share a little bit more on the examples we can support uh since most of the people are quite familiar with rt and uh and it's a little bit straightforward for us to demonstrate like how easy it is to use earlier to scale of io2 to support the active means probably we give you the impression right for all your flash later we can only support everything in it but actually for us right we can really support almost everything um so the first thing like as you can see right after me lasts only a few seconds so it's a perfect like total scenario for Flash Player beyond that it's also game if you look at dark forest or some other 10 days again right or they have some tournaments uh it only happens for a few days like World Cup right last a few days or even less than one month in that case you uh for that kind of game you don't really need to set up a like dedicated l25 ever is I need it to run for a few days or a month right so that's another like sort of perfect scenario you can really stay off a dedicated L2 for World Cup for a month and then handle all the many of the reports from the users and uh and also their transaction and then once all thing done stays right to the select the L1 and the total of a tear down is dedicated out to um after another four years you can redo the same thing or next year we have the uh European Cup right and then you can like basically for different events we can just do different these kind of flash layers beyond that right I just mentioned um it is it's also good for some of these uh uh this kind of metaverse and also Define uh projects as I mentioned right uh flash layer you can rent the flash layer for period of time but beyond that we also provide the supporter of persistent the road lab um so that means like for uh for some games like you feel that you you will last forever right you just feel for the persistent roll up it's a perfect fun with other functionalities we provide you can connect to multiple genes and you can also have the problem and other things can support by them and sometimes like you know again an average they are not solidly compatible so it's still we can still support these libraries natively so you can use your smart contracts a little contract to call these libraries um and beyond that is the right for D5 projects uh you know we know right like the radiance and a lot of Perpetual exchanges like they need this had reports and also dedicated like what to handle the to handle these uh um like B volume of transactions and requests so once with earlier or the our persistent roll out right as I just mentioned right for the first 100 000 users you can one roll up another hundred thousand users so you can use another dollar so you can really skill unlimitedly so in that case right uh if you are building uh Financial exchanges or some other device articles uh you don't need to think about the limitation of the throughputs you just need to focus on your business logic um and at the same time right with the dedicated life you can you can you can think about some Furniture like user experience for example account abstraction you don't need to force your user to use Mac mask or some other wallets right you can invite with this sort of keyless Solutions and then make the user experience very smooth beyond that you can almost make area transaction even like sort of the orders are okay so then we can have a very good like proof or Reserve like all the transactions all the deposit visual will be fully Unchained so no one can can cheat um and beyond that right I I also want to mention like some like our community member also mentioned about payment yeah I think payment definitely can be a very ideal use case in this in this scenario because as we all see right for payment we really need the fast Financial protocol probably subsequent and at the same time we want to have very low transaction fees or even no transaction fees so in that case you you once you have your idea you build your application you use earlier uh for a dedicated L2 and then you can skill as much as possible at the same time really to precise a transaction across the different chains I think it's also a good sort of scenarios a good scenario to to uh to build um yeah so these are just some like sort of examples I believe like what is this elastic skating um basically the first time proposed by earlier the second is about like it's various advantages of multi-vm supports more audition supports I mean well they're very modular and the customization of the entire system because you can configure all the parameters for one of our partners they can feel like sort of the gas limit from like 30 million to 500 million and then they can also can see like sort of contract size block time and various increasing parameters beyond that it's quite decentralized as I mentioned right decentralized sequencing system replication system and meanwhile uh the later on like like um for some um pure smart contract application Builders once we provide dashboard you don't really need to code in runs or in CEC Plus plus so everything will basically handle that yeah okay let's take a question again from um from YouTube um someone named Knight drummer he asks um or she asks um what throughput can be theoretically achieved using All Clear Solutions uh L2 and L3 and what support do you expect to see in the next six months of tests so um just to highlight one thing is um you know we did mention that you know the two flash layers that we used uh for one for the OG nft batch minting and later one for the ort uh nft minting they both achieved about 50 to 60 TPS but that was not the capacity that was not that was just the amount of transaction that came in and then we we saw that number in in real time the same network was uh tested prior to these events uh to reach about 2500 DPS but again that was with a very basic Hardware that you see off the shelf kind of Hardware but imagine something much more a much powerful machine that you could use to uh to run those sequences you could actually have much better throughput so it could it could be much much higher than well let's say 2500 DPS so yes uh you know at some point we will test some of these things in the future as well but you know it's just we won't be surprised if we see much higher numbers than we than what we saw last time uh let's take one more question on so uh someone says um how can users get involved with your project and what resources are available for them to learn more yes you want to take this one yeah so right now um I I know like um right now like we really uh provide a lot of blog posts and a lot of technical uh sharing sessions and it's not that uh straightforward for a lot of community members to be part of the ecosystem and we will improve like next year for example we will provide more explanations for the technical development I mean well we're also trying to push a bunch of products right as I mentioned like One dashboard and the other is called test night so as users like either you can try out the dashboard screen of your own L2 or you can support to become the no validator to the test net and to run um to run the notes and probably later you can deselect a sequencers for different autos and beyond that if you are now a technical person um you can just join a bunch of our like photo of campaigns right um this year we have three campaigns uh 20 and one team next year we just we just have more and uh like we already aligned um with one of our partner uh Partners in probably in favor radio via another game campaign and uh later on we just have more like as a nine-tangible person you can just be part of the campaigns either um particularly in the afternoon or some other it's also interesting um like subtle initiatives that we have and be part of the ecosystem and meanwhile all right um and we will also have from all these Wiki uh pages and materials uh giving out next year so people can really learn how to use earlier or how to Leverage The SDK or apis to build their own applications uh beyond that we um like as I mentioned right we are always very grateful to have all the great like Auto community members either Twitter on Discord and um and also on our physical events to really support them we are super grateful to have all of you to support earlier and next year definitely we'll try to provide more these kind of benefits not just for um this uh our OG patch and also the RT hotels but at the same time we are also trying to provide more these opportunities to evolve um all the like social community members in different channels into our new indicatives yeah okay I think we are we are running out of time now it's uh it's already um we started at about uh noon my time so it has been we have been live for about an hour um let's let's close this but before we close let's let's ask one question to yaochi something that you know he he would like to avoid but it's it's one of the hottest questions out there and the question is uh when token yeah it's a it's a really tough question the the thing like uh there's nothing to share at the moment but as you can see right the next year we'll start to launch a test night and uh basically we we try to decentralize the entire infrastructure as much as possible so later as you can see right we will have some instantaneous for the community and uh and also for the new no operators and application to be part of the ecosystem and uh later on we hope after like probably um like uh two or three years we can really decentralizing entire network so um so the no operators and the sequencers can rebuy uh can really run by the community and then when people spin off the ro2 system so they can directly use the nodes selected um by the decentralized network so that's really the automated goal for all year and to really embrace the community and at the same time make the system as decentralized as possible and so in that case as you can see right it's not just about the L2 Services we provide but at the same time it's about also about the philosophy we have to make the internal Network as decentralized as possible so we can really like sort of embrace the community and also all the different nodes in the network so the together we can provide the values across different networks and also across different applications building on top of all layers okay so that will be the last question so um let me thank you and uh you know from the entire on behalf of the entire team thank you very much for uh joining in today and thank you very much for supporting us uh you know over the last year so the excite the next year is going to be even more exciting we are interesting things uh building uh internally but we'll also be announcing a few other things uh eventually uh next year once we have built and uh those systems are going to production and so uh this is uh not the only AMA that we'll do we'll do probably more amas in the future uh with more probably more focused and thematic amas as well where you could ask specific questions in a specific uh framework and themes and uh so we would love to stay connected with you and um if you if you have any feedback for the CMA do share us share with us on our feed on our Discord or let us know on our telegram on our on our Twitter handle as well so uh thank you very much for your time and again uh one of the three best questions will be sent uh uh a very special nft uh from the ort collection so thank you very much for your time and uh yeah we'll see you soon again yeah thanks everyone and see you very soon next year
