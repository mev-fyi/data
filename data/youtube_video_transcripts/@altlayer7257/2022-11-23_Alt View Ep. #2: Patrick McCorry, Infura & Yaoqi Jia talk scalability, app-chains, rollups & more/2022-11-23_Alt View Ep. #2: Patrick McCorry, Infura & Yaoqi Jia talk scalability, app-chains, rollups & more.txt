[Music] thank you yeah hello everyone welcome to authentic view of Simply auto view at our view we chat with industry leaders to get to know them and also their opinions and insights on sort of all different like sort of aspects of crypto industry and these views may be popular and popular brand new or alternative or anything in return and I'm your host DRT from earlier execution layer on ethereum for web3 today is our great pleasure to have our guest Patrick Patrick works with inferior these days but he's also quite famous in the Academia he is teaching a lot of these crypto courses in the universities and at the same time his expertise in cryptocurrencies smart contracts and also apply crypto he's sort of like the UK's first 3D graduate student in the cryptocurrencies and his Vlog has recently appeared in a lot of major conferences and yeah again welcome party and we read thanks for being with us and can you also tell us there will be more of yourself and also what kind of stuff are you working on at the moment yeah I can give a brief interview but thank you for that by the way um so basically my journey in cryptocurrency started back in 2013. I was an undergrad at Newcastle University and I did a photography course and cryptography was really hard because I'm really about a mop um and I remember thinking I would like to do a cryptography PhD so I can get better at math and so I met my advisor at the time he was called Fong Hao and I was like oh fun you know on the crypto PhD can you help me then he told me about this thing called Bitcoin being used in the dark web you know the bad drugs and maybe a cool thing to look at because it's a crypto currency um so I looked at it and you know there's very little cryptography in it at all it says house functions and signatures but it was really cool idea and that's how I went down the rabbit hole so from like 2013 to 2016 I was mostly working on bitcoin and then around 2016 I moved on to ethereum because I saw this paper uh I was at this conference called Financial cryptography and there are these PhD students presenting about the papers called a step-by-step towards secure smart contracts and they build this application called you know rock paper scissors as a smart contract which is actually really hard to do by the way I always use rock paper scissors as a challenge for students um but after watching that talk I thought wow this is really really cool I've been spending three years trying to design stuff on bitcoin and it doesn't work you're just like punching it in this getting to do anything you want were they managed us to go build this within like a day or two and so that's where I got my first intro to ethereum and then generally like throughout these years you know I was I did research I was a poo stock for a while to UK University and then I was assistant professor then I left and tried to do a startup and then that's how I ended up in a fewer because they just acquired the software so throughout this time I've always had this like large interest in uh and like scalability Solutions so I remember back in 2015 when Joseph Putin came out on a pouch with uh the lightning Network paper yes it was very difficult to read I don't know if you ever tried to read it have you tried to read it the lightning Network paper yeah and after that there's another one right I think around this plasma or these some other new ideas yeah Jesus describe that it's aspirational in his writing um but generally I remember the lightning people was a really cool idea and the first thing I tried to do was summarize it so I wrote this little paper in 2016 to try the you know actually Define how you how you would do a lightning channel uh so it had a huge interest in the payment channels and then and then side chains and then plasma and then now roll ups exists and build-ups are really exciting there's sort of the Pinnacle of what we've all been trying to achieve for about six seven years so very much so I guess just to move on to what I'm working on now um because it sort of leads into it quite well uh what I tried to do last year was I've been trying to simplify the language and the mental models around L2 or rule out specifically because every time I talk to like some do teams or individuals they're always a bit confused about what everyone's really trying to achieve and really under the hood it's just a bridge you know your bridge and lsats to an option system and you want to make sure that your funds are safe that's all the rollups are really trying to achieve so that was like a big thrust that I was trying to achieve last year and I've been trying to do it this year as well with some presentations um and I've also been in these educational courses so I did this online cryptocurrency class uh I think we had about 800 people active at the time when I did it it's sort of hard to judge you have all these pull-up Farmers it was just committed asking but I think after I distilled those I think we had about up to 800 people maybe average three different people per class that was really nice that was very much very technically focused about you know ethereum and cryptocurrencies and again rule UPS and generally I feel like I just I always make this joke I'm like this private Oracle for inferior and teams in the space people just ask me questions and I try to answer them for them so I don't know I like to help other teams out there when I get the chance so I guess that's what I'm working on right now anyway yeah yeah super amazing experience and uh yeah as you mentioned right you spend a lot of time um um like researching all different scaling Solutions uh for blockchain space and in Dev con you also have sort of one hour session to talk about like how to skill ethereum um can you share a little bit more about your study around that like the ways the different ways to scale like software ethereum in the past and also the present yeah well it doesn't matter probably yeah not ethereum or some other like options yesterday that generally when I try to do work I try the food in a generic way so it applies to most blockchains because I think that's really important and I started in Bitcoin now I work on ethereum but you know it's a lot of these blockchain systems are very similar so it's very important to look at perspective and not just you know how does this up code work because then you end up you know it's a technical difficulties of platform so the skill and ethereum workshop was actually something the EF asked me to do last minute they sort of just pay me like the week before being like Oh probably you want to run this hour workshop and Devcon about scaling ethereum and I'm like oh okay sure I'll put this together um but generally like when we think about scalability you know I guess there's like you know two to three different ways to think about it you know one is you know can we just crank up the parameters you know increase the transaction throughput and just make it really cheap for everyone you know that's the first you know can we just you know blow it up uh the second one is you know can we Shard the network so the idea is that you have a you know a list of validators and can you split the work across them so the validate does some work validator B does some other work but they don't do the same work and so you distribute out work you know so not everyone's doing the same work is distributed but the problem the problem with both of those approaches is mostly well one TPS is a terrible metric and anyone ever kicks my class will know that we should never ever measure a system based on TPS I hope that's not in your marketing materials by the way but um you know the best way to think about scalability are three different resources you know one's compute you know how much computation can be supported by the network to storage you know how big do you want the database to get you know that database keeps growing then eventually not a lot of people can hold it so I think at one stage an archival polygon node was growing by two megabytes a second and you can imagine I mean exactly is this explosion eventually doesn't fit on AWS anymore because it's just too big you know it's uh three's bond with you know like you know given the peer-to-peer Network that you have how quickly can you send a transaction across the network or a block across the network you know if it takes 10 minutes to get a block across but you have 13 second block times well people are going to start falling behind so the three researchers you have to care about compute stories and bandwidth and I'll you know alongside that you need to decide you know who do you want to uh participate in the network you know who can be a block proposer who can you know transact on a network you could download the database you could check the database you know this entire system the entire cryptocurrency field is about new trust by verify you know we trust the block proposers to order transactions but we verify everything they do and that verb the verification event is really the bottleneck the scalability you know we have to make sure that we make sure we have the artificially constrain the compute stories and bandwidth to allow people at home to verify the network in real time I guess the real bottleneck there so you know says the stat back of it you know so the issue is that the account has increased the parameters because then we kick people off the network we could try to do sharding but starting to sort of the same problem where uh you know eventually it gets too big anyway and then and also it's very difficult to implement so the third way to scale the network is really to do these off chain protocols and it's really again about working you know could we have a base layer the settlement layer like ethereum or another Network that holds all the assets and everyone can check that that system is fine and well and correct and well maintained and decentralized then can we move our offset to an option system without having the trust that barchian system and that's sort of the goal of the rule up Century group map you know I can move my arbitrim but I'm not the trust arbitrary of Maintenance and by doing that then on arbitrim you could you know take the first two approaches just scale up the resources because you know they have a very different you know trust model there and it can very much be a very heavy duty machine that runs that system uh so that's sort of for me scalability just as a nutshell is all about Virgin we just need to build really good Bridges the move our Focus from block TNA to blockchain B and that's really at the heart of all scalability and of course those three resources yeah yeah I totally agree with you especially when you mentioned right the compute storage and also bandwidth I think it's not just like sort of the limitation for blockchain I think you can also apply this to the traditional web 2 word it's like in crypto right we have more decentralized Network and then like like on top of this right we know that uh recently their topic uh around this monolithic and the modular program right and also in our talk you mentioned about that uh in the early days we mainly about we we mainly talk about the skating ways for the monolithic like blockchains right as you mentioned right probably we can have better hardware and we can have better like consensus algorithms to precise and as many transactions as possible but right now we are sort of like trying to find ways to create these modular blockchains either by these roll up ways like to do this option computation and then but we have some settlement on the l1's um but but for the past few years right we try out all different ways why do you think like the current way like the modular protein is a better way to scale compared to this kind of Monolithic way I think this is you know for the monolithic blockchains we could try to scale a one big blockchain for many years that was sort of at the heart of the block size Wars as well back in 2015 with Bitcoin you know so we have a one megabit block or a two megabit blocker you know an eight gigabyte blocker Giga blocks and that was really like the issue there was that we just considered the one blockchain is monolithic and we have to consider all three resources within that one entity you know compute stories and bandwidth and we know that we just can't scale it that way because it just kicks people off the network it just becomes it basically becomes a centralized database because not anyone not anyone can I'll do that as correct so for the modular approach I mean I made this joke during the scaling ethereum Workshop but I think it's a great way to describe it all we really did was Rebrand those three resources so if you consider compute compute becomes as execution layer yeah storage becomes a settlement layer you know the stories is the database of all the assets and so that's storage there that's a settlement layer that is all the ultimate truth of who owns watch funds and finally bandwidth you know bandwidth the data availability layer you know how how much data can we send across the network such that everyone receives it in a timely manner and that's all the network really guarantees by the way you know we don't guarantee historical dealers around we just guarantee that it was published at a certain time and anyone could have got it at that time but what's nice is by separating it out to you know compute the execution layer Stories the settlement layer and bottom of the data availability there by making these layers it it gives you like a much more focused goal on how to solve the problem so now we can have you know an entire blockchain system maybe something like Celestia which is just data availability and that's the only thing they focus on settlement Lair would be ethereum which is what I my best opinion anyway this would be um you know minimal compute you know basically enough execution to deal with the bridging the bridge or the bridge but otherwise it holds all the options and then the execution layer are the road Ops or these all-chin systems you know like even like even your startup is really focused on the compute layer you know it could be you'll launch this through as much computation as we want and then eventually settle back yeah you know uh so I think by separating out these three layers it makes it much easier for us to actually think well we can actually build another system that solves this problem so I feel like it's actually really nice mental model to use uh so I do like the modular modular uh you know description for how we can solve these problems yeah as you mentioned right so right now we thought of a position the traditional like these um three pillars right the computer storage and bandwidth into these execution settlement and data availability layer and apparently ethereum right now is the position that is the settlement and the data availability layer for most of these executions here or we call roll-up Solutions right and how do you feel about the current zolab space for example the optimistic relapse and zku Labs do you feel like they have achieved the sort of some promises we previously saw and what kind of like drawbacks you build eyes that we have at the moment yeah I mean I love and hit them I don't know I think there's a love-hate relationship um I mean if you said that you should step back and back looking at the rule of evolution you know we had the V1 rule up last year which was like the ZK sink in the Stark ax yeah the payments transfers and swaps you know basically a single stair transition the game basically new smart contracts says that you know as long as we did something we both ended up with a balance at the end and they worked really well for the most part you know dydx was fairly popular ZK single is very popular it sort of solved you know a very nice niche there but the issue was that we needed to do more than just payments you know we want to really build you know the long-term dream of a roll-up Centric room up we need to support smart contracts auction and that's what all the V2 Roll-Ups are trying to achieve now to be much more general you know so both optimism and are arbitrary and basically it's basically called ethereum they're running you know it's uh the fume evm they can support alongside their own additional features uh they have the ZK EVMS coming out or the ZK VMS which is again just a different crazy experimental machines like Caro carols like a very funky registered via system it's crazy that you know something like ethereum can check the proof and keep that accountable so now the VP rule apps are coming out and they're you know trying to be much more general purpose but I think when I get annoyed about with all these rule apps is I mean again there's three problems to consider so one is you know how do we guarantee the deal is available it's just one on this party at the end of this you know everyone solves that by posting it to ethereum that's fine that's easy and we solve that problem the next one's like the state transition Integrity you know how is the bridge convinced that this off chain database is correct and well and all transactions are valid you know they protect the phones on the roll up um and again that's like the fraud proofs versus the validity proves that's fine that's the biggest thing everyone talks about and that's being solved but I get really annoyed about is the last as a censorship resistance you know that entire system if all the all the operators go offline how do we guarantee we can get our funds out and that's actually the big difference between you know uh a side chain we can call solid or a layer two so the original side chain paper in 2014 by block stream it couldn't solve the liveness issue it couldn't be censorship resistant if the other system went offline then all your phones got stuck and the problem with the primary Theater now is with a lot of these rule UPS they're not going to be censorship resistant from the get-go uh because it's too difficult or too hard or you know this is not ready for it and so really they're just like vanity projects in that sense they're just like these uh vanity iTunes that are pretending to be layer twos as a community we need to you know call them out more on that because it's ridiculous that they're not building these Center chip resistance systems and don't Place enough emphasis on it so I get I get really annoyed at them when I talk to them I'm just like why are you not doing this this is like the whole point of of uh of a real lab is to guarantee that my funds are safe even if the system goes offline and many of them won't be when they go live so that's my biggest problem with them but otherwise you know I do I do like what they're building of course you know it's if I was going to pick one thing that I really really get annoyed at is that yeah regarding the like sort of the censorship issues right do you think if we have better decentralizations of the sequencers approvers it can be improved for this kind of issue so so I think for censorship resistance and I'll get the decentralization aspect as well it really well before we go into that let's talk about the end like here are the agents in a roll-up like who's involved in the protocol so as you mentioned we have sequencers and we have these prover sites executors I'll just call them executors because you know optimistic relapse don't do any proving um the sequencer's responsible for basically taking users transactions ordering them for execution and then passing them up you know it's basically like the front end if you're going to build like an application it's the front end you build this website it can take all the transactions and then eventually send them to the back end this backend is either the bridge on ethereum or it will send it directly to the executors or the previous then the Proverbs will get the transactions execute them then eventually propose an update to the bridge that say Bridge you know given these transactions this is what the database looks like so that it was you have the front end component you have the back end component you know sequencer executor so in terms of you know being censorship resistance or being censorship resistant or at least you know protecting users when the system goes offline the signal Source should have nothing to do with that you know it's a front-end component it has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with the system being censorship resistant they're just like offering the fast path you know experience for people that are willing to serve uh in terms of being censorship resistant what really matters is one a user can send their transaction directly to the bridge and they can bypass so we call that forced inclusion as long as they can send it directly to the bridge and get it ordered for execution then we've solved that one the second part is you know we need to get that order transaction executed so how do we do that well we need one honest executor as long as there's someone out there willing to pick up the transactions execute them and tell the bridge about it then we get you know a censorship resistance system so what you really need is force inclusion on one honest executor and that's very different by the way to like a layer one blockchain you know normally you rely on this honest majority of all the validators here we're just relying on one party then you know to keep the system safe and that's really important for what it means to be decentralized yeah no means the system could be you know centralized it could be Federated so the sequencer said doesn't have to be that big because it's really just about user experience it's the executors that have to be decentralized you know it needs to be you know you need we need to think of some protocols where it's you know it's rate limited so not everyone can do it because otherwise you get spam but it's easy enough for an honest party to come along and participate obviously I like to make the joke that what we really end up with is a satellite front end but this decentralized back end and that's really the difference between you know a roll up and something like coinbase because coinbase is also centralized in the back end as well where now it's decentralized back in and that's really cool yeah I fully agree with you I think this is just another I mean uh I don't think it's a corner case because right now it's it's becoming more and more common like there's some native assets on the L2 and then basically once you don't have proper execution on the how to write we don't really have the direct channel to bridge this kind of native assets on L2 to L1 yeah that's something probably the existing uh bridging system for the rollout particles they don't have like as you mentioned right if some eyesights we we sort of Bridge to the L2 there's some uh the R1 contract and these are even the sequencers are executed like sort of down right we can still like send the direct transaction on the airline ethereum to to sort of exit the assets but if it's negative assets or how to I don't think we right now we have uh like a lot of channels to exit there would be a way to do that it will basically um with the Roll-Ups well the other guarantee is liveness since that transactions or the value transactions will always eventually get executed such that you can you know kick your funds out of a smart contract and then withdraw to this system so if you deploy like an ER 20 to uh an L2 you just need to make erc20 has additional functionality says that the erc20 contract could send an L2 to an L1 message to say okay I exist in the middle too I've never been deployed in the L1 before you know here's a message directly from the ill who do they all want to deploy my smart contract there yeah um there's lots of like like implementation issues around that for example maybe a different contract address you know maybe they're not using the deployer and it's like you know a different contract address uh um it's very awkward for nfts as well because nfts are you know you'd have to physically burn the nft and the ill too yeah so it's like there are lots of awkward more things around that but I know there's things but they are working on that because it's a very important problem for them yeah yeah I can start yeah general purpose l2s right we feel that it can rescale like at once for example ethereum beyond that sometimes as you go from you also mentioned mentioned that we probably have a lot of application right like the front end the stuff right and then for the applications right now we have some applications specifically roll ups to solve the scabilities issues of these applications and and do you think these kind of applications specifically your Labs can be a good way to skill the dabs in the near future because like for the past two years right we saw like x infinity divided X and some other upcoming games right they have meeting of users definitely if you put them on general purpose and I went out to probably with just a congestion Network so that's why they either work have changed or work on like so-called ruler but do you think the app rollout can be a better sort of solution for them in the long run yeah I think I think there's several reasons why so I think like let me just think about our Pacific Roll-Ups they were like on roll ups were very very up Pacific you know ZK sync only supported payments Stark acts you know it's like immutable so rare dydx yeah they're all specific you know nft be a store trading based you know so that was like ready is there any evidence to say that that does work and that does get popular I have some Normie friends who aren't really in the crypto but they went on I think it was they went on immutable and they bought some fantasy football players you know so clearly there's there's demand for that I mean I didn't understand why they did that but there's demand for it um so I think that's like empirical evidence to say this does work so in terms so the next question is you know where does this fit in in The Wider picture you know on at least in my perspective at the moment um for me this is like the L3 narrative so the idea is that you have to be able to you know we can Bridge ourselves onto that and then on the L2 it's very general purpose you know this could be like coinbius for example you know uses all your assets or that you're trading back and forth but an L3 is really where you deploy another bridge and then you can move your assets to another system so for example Val is an arbitrim I could then bridge to another opt-in system that's maybe you know run by you guys uh you you control the sequencer you know you have this you have control over the user experience for your users uh so I guess actually let me step back there's two reasons one what's nice about these opposific rule Ops is that the company who's running it has control over the user experience so maybe they just want to support nfts that's all they care about you know they can run the sequencer they can con you know own that user experience and two they can build their software for that one specific purpose now they really want to reduce the data cost if you're doing a rule up they can optimize the data for that one specific application uh the second one is burst traffic you know uh you know if you're doing like an nft drop and there's going to be I don't know 30 000 transactions within five minutes well you know it's you need you need to make sure you can handle that amount of traffic within a short period of time I often accusers your experience but it doesn't necessarily need the hit the blockchain yet you know it doesn't need to be settled yet certainly could be delayed um we redo this with banks you're ready you know when I transfer funds to someone it takes two days to get settled that's fine you know they all get botched up and eventually get settled somewhere else so yeah I think there's there's two good reasons for that one is owning the user experience and two is this hardly first traffic because you know we don't there's been plenty of times in ethereum where burst traffic sort of broke some protocols like make her doubt back in 2020 during black Thursday got broken because of all the burst traffic yeah that's true especially for the empty meme right not just on ethereum but uh all different like hyper coaches but technically like for me probably as you mentioned right costs like tons of thousand requests and transactions within a few seconds uh definitely we can just uh Network and also cause some gas wall it definitely affects the user experience like of the other applications yeah and then like like um as you just share right so for all the rollers and the different ones you always mentioned like the bridge is a very crucial component um for all these different protocols and uh I also saw you like a lot of research around the bridges and beside your study what are the exists what are the issues of the existing bridges yeah so basically the way we've scaled cryptocurrencies for the past 10 years is via bridging you know we've always been building but the question is what type of bridges are we building and I've actually I haven't thanked hobby for this I always I always feel the acknowledge them for to help me work on the terminology for how to describe these Bridges so basically if you consider coinbius when I lock my phones in the coinbase that's a bridge you know there's a bridge under the hood that holds all the assets now the question is you know how is the bridge protecting these assets why does the bridge have to trust you know the bridge is going to you know if I've locked in money to the bridge and into coinbius how do I get my money back out and how is the bridge convinced that the money should be released back to me you know uh so we call this you know the trust assumption you know why is the bridge really trusting and of course this stuff happens that back a bit um the bridge has all the assets and there's often database like coinbase are the liabilities and the bridge wants to be guaranteed that the assets can cover its liabilities you know because then you know make sure that the system's really collateralized so the bridge wants to be convinced you know how can I get my money from coinbase so there's three like different historical approaches one is a single Authority coinbase has the sole authority to tell the bridge how to release the funds you know requirements will say Alice can withdraw 1000 leads coinbase will send us to the bridge then the bridge will send 1000 eat the Alice so we're testing one single Authority with those funds then it sort of progressed a little bit too mostly Authority like a multi-sake maybe there's five out of nine validators that we have to trust in order to you know protect the funds in the system and the you know allow people to withdraw their funds then the third approach is the crypto economic Bridges and this is sort of like polygon you know the proof of stake Bridge but um the difference there with the crypto economic bridge is that for me they become a validator I have to lock up coins I have skin in the game and then I elect myself to be a validator and so if you look at the polygon Bridge the last stat I had was at late 2021 about six entities controlled about 85 percent of the stake in the system and I think that was about one to two billion dollars worth of money by the way so it was a huge amount of funds there but again it's only six parties and so for all three type of bridges you know we had one party a multi-sake and again basically a multi-sake of skin in the game and in all cases we're basically trusting less than 10 people to protect billions of dollars now if I were to tell you that you know what would be your what would be your first thought you know uh what do you think would be the problem if you trust I don't know buy people with billions of dollars to protect it um you know the problem the problem is basically uh they keep getting hacked you know uh like when gox lost 850 000 Bitcoin that's six percent of all Petco that ever existed and we sort of pretend that never happened um every two to three weeks these exchanges just kept getting hacked um the question is why you know why do they keep getting hacked you know why is it so hard or difficult to protect billions of dollars and the issue is really that if I'm doing a cryptocurrency startup today I have to take a set of human processes Implement those human processes and try my best to protect the private keys and protect the servers and we know humans don't scale and humans aren't very good at checking you know performing validity checks or auditing or making sure something's done right you know we're not very good at that as a species and so because of that you know if you try to take these human processes and you know either the team a team B Team C team team D eventually A team's going to fail because they just can't replicate it you know humans don't scale so we're not very good at doing that and so that's quite clear you know it's it's not that the humans are at fault you know they want the offer good service they don't want to get hacked but this is very difficult for humans to protect billions of dollars and so it says winding back a bit you know the problem of all these bridges for the past 10 years is that it relied on human trust to protect the system where now with the Roll-Ups and the you know what I would call the validating bridge is sulfur thus protecting the folks you know the bridge will not release the money unless it's 100 convinced that there's all database is okay and well and so we know software skills software skills vary as well and so we can remove humans from that role of protecting the funds then of course we're going to be able to hopefully skill a bit better and have you know thousands or hundreds of thousands of off-chain systems because we no longer rely on humans so basically that's what came out of the research you know I tried to learn why all these things got hacked and then eventually you realize oh crap it's just because of humans and it's not their fault it's just it's just not made for doing this well I think you're muted I can't hear you oh yeah it's always the case right humans always make mistakes and the two various reasons and uh give me just one more thing um as you just mentioned right the software we can use like the roller we can use to sort out do some social verification um before release the funds but how about like how about the duration between uh between we we we sort of like see the block generated by the sequencer but and also the proof generated by the prover there will be a little bit time in between right um but if this Gap is very big for example a few days or even a few hours right if there are some deals made offline for example I transfer you like a 1 million USD whereby bank account but you also transfer some money to me on a roller but probably the sequencer misbehaved and then the proof is not generated on time um Do You Feel Like We need some some more advanced ways to prevent this kind of stuff I mean the instant information and also proof generation yeah yeah these are the few answers to this is sort of um like empirically speaking with like the centralized you know exchanges we've always had that we have the chosen the settlement for as long as our funds are on that system so like this isn't a new problem in that sense you know it's it's been around for like 12 13 years and we have the trust Finance for actually I'll make the joke about coinbase because queen bee is not the lockout of your account you know while you're doing this transaction and eventually getting your funds out so it's not a new problem so it is always there which is nice you know it's thankfully we'll still create a new problem around this they just make it more explicit because we knew how the system works yeah so with the current rule Ops uh you know are you know obviously these optimistic root UPS take seven days I think that's a bit um they're a bit too conservative of that number it could really be a day or two this is probably way more reasonable but still training wheels and they they should eventually fix that uh the ZK rule UPS what's nice is because once you do settle on the blockchain of the proof the funds could be released immediately it's just the question is how long does it take the executors to you know pick up these transactions and execute them and produce the proof I think the last I saw on Stark net it was like every eight hours maybe I think it was around every eight hours they were doing it because there's sort of this trade-off between you know uh the size of the proof and the gas cost and how many transactions are actually going to settle and who's paying for this and so the longer they wait the more transactions they can include in a batch and they can aggregate the savings for everyone um so I suspect when they get more popular and there's you know much more throughput or traffic on that then it should hopefully be a bit more frequent than eight hours uh but the the last part I want to mention and this is why Roll-Ups are also very exciting is that it's because roll ups are an open platform for anyone deploy code and anyone can offer a survey and anyone can also offer a fast withdrawal service or you know a quick way to synchronize between different different rollouts so I was like you know hop protocol connects uh so it all started called mover although I think they pivoted now from doing this uh there's several different startups there that are just focused and fast withdrawals where our phone's an arbitrim and I want to quickly withdraw back then be in that so there's someone on me and Net who's willing to front the funds for me you know they'll send me the funds on ethereum because they know they'll eventually get paid back from arbitrine you know via the bridge and so it's really exciting now we can have these Venture funded startups that focus on the single problem that make it way better for users to quickly move between and that was never possible before you know as I mentioned being a long-standing problem and now we're actually getting better solutions for it because people are wanting to take on that risk in order the earned profit and it's yeah so it's a yes great great to see a market actually evolve around this and hopefully solve that problem yeah basically I think they are running their own executors or verification and then probably they have more confidence and the client collaborates with some liquidity providers to provide these faster withdrawal for the users yeah yeah yeah and uh and the sort of like we we come to the last question as you know right we are doing these alternative views uh do you have any like sort of uh non-man stream advice if you want to leave to our audience yeah you know mainstream advice I mean my government here uh so other period people it's about cryptocurrency people in general hit they love the hit on binance marching they're like oh this is a fully centralized system how dare they only have like it validators um but actually I think buying on survari or Vari ballsy for doing that if you look at buying a smart chain it's basically you know a it's like working towards the goal of a roll up you know they've taken their centralized Exchange basically tried to convert it into a network it's an open network where anyone could apply code there give or take you know maybe the volunteer will ignore it but you know it's a fully auditable system there's proof of reserves I know my funds are in the system if they get hacked which happened recently by the way if you remember with the I think they I forget most they lost but the there was this minting issue with the bridge due to Merkle trees but the moment they do get hacked is obviously anyone that they lost phones and so actually buying on Smart team is pretty cool because it does have proof of reserves it does have the smart contract system that we can all Deploy on and the only thing that can do is go offline and uh well I guess they could also try to Fork the network but you know they could go offline and freeze the phones so it's basically a sidechain which is you know fine you know most of these systems are side chains anyway and so it's really cool by the smartphone actually button did this and sort of provided this nice empirical evidence that something like this has a product Market fit it's useful and people like it and people will go onto the trade because you know it's much more crypto native than using the centralized exchange so that's probably my normal mainstream advisor I don't know view at the moment I think most people hit or buying Smart Cube but I think it's really cool and there's sort of a step in the right direction of how I'd like to see roll ups evolve and emerge so yeah that's probably I don't know probably not expected so I'm very happy with that yeah it's a great opinion I mean alternative opinion yeah and uh yeah thanks a lot for uh for Patrick sharing a lot of like uh like interesting insights and talking about like scalability how to social labs and also Bridge it's right and um yeah and also a great thanks um to all the audience who listen to our all of you and uh I of you right as I just mentioned right we we are talking to a lot of experts in the industry around like ro2's scalabilities and if you want to listen to more um just subscribe to our Channel and uh yeah we are signing off to the next time yeah thanks everyone [Music] thank you
