[Music] recording has started um hello everyone this is Amrit Kumar CEO of offlay and this is all for you a show where we discuss layer ones their tools app genes and Roll-Ups among other topics today we are Ben position partner at polishing Capital One of the biggest Venture fonts in the crypto World an investor in our life Welcome Ben hey Amrit thanks for having me how are you Ben yeah doing well how are you not too bad not too bad well welcome to all of you and thank you for joining me uh let's start with a quick introduction for those who may not know you tell us a bit about your background what brought you to the crypto land Your Role at polishing capital and what excites you these days yeah um I took a little bit of a circuitous path um to get here I didn't have a background in um you know engineering or Finance or anything like that um I studied philosophy in college I worked at Airbnb for a number of years but crypto was kind of always on my radar from from the very early days um but I would say that my uh sort of Eureka moment was um reading the ethereum white paper in late 2015 and that really kind of opened my eyes to you know the The Wider breadth of possibility um around what could be accomplished in decentralized networks um and you know I started thinking a lot about what we could do broadly with smart Contracting and and more expressive applications being built in you know permissionless decentralized environments so that really sent me down the rabbit hole I started reading a lot of white papers and um kind of you know playing around with um investing and trading early on um and ultimately made my way to polychain in in 2018 um I started my time at polychain uh working on the post-investment support side so supporting the founders in our early portfolio with uh sort of strategic and operational questions um and then you know as I kind of grew my networks and built relationships and stuff like that um started you know kind of finding some additional research opportunities and and made my way over to the investing side of the business so um I am now a partner on the Venture side of the business that's where I spend most of my time um I've LED Investments across um a number of different verticals you know um alt L1 ecosystems D5 Layer Two scaling interoperability end user application so you know wallets gaming all that kind of stuff so I've covered a pretty wide breadth um and uh most recently have kind of been primarily focused on some of the infrastructure stuff as well as you know gaming and kind of end user applications pieces behind some of these Investments and other topics do you feel like infrastructure is one sector that is kind of Evergreen in terms of investment especially it becomes more active during the bear Market you feel you feel that in that way yeah I think that's been true um throughout the the bear cycles that we've seen you know it was certainly the case in 2018 and 2019 um where you know a lot of people who come into the space with a lot of excitement during the the bull markets um tend to get shaken out or lose interest um during the bear so what we see is um the people who stick around tend to be you know these really sort of Hardcore Builders and developers people who are really focused on improving the underlying systems so that when the next wave of people comes back in during the next bull market um we have you know better Frameworks on which to build new applications support more liquidity more users more activity all that kind of stuff um that's a you know a trend and kind of a contingency of people that I um were contingent of people that I don't see going away right and and I think um something that I often have to remind myself of but that I that I think is really true is that um we're still very early in this space and we still are kind of building at you know the bleeding edge of technical capabilities so there's a lot of people out there that are really trying to push that edge forwards in terms of the research they're doing um the infrastructure and the protocols that they're building so I don't think that you know we're anywhere close to sort of like an end State and I expect that Trend to continue for many years into the future so I expect infrastructure to continue to be an investable category um obviously you know crypto provides some unique opportunities for the kind of collective ownership of the underlying infrastructure on which these protocols and end user applications are being built um and kind of builds in these value capture mechanisms so um I do think that you know in infrastructure is going to continue to be an interesting place for new research new development and new investment for for many years you're talking about you know the basic thesis around infrastructure you know polishing you know literally means multiple chains so let's talk about kind of your L1 thesis uh and what was your thesis around l1's in let's say you know 2016 2017 basically the post ethereum era when people were building you know scalable Solutions and whatnot uh in those days and you feel like that has changed over time you know let's say in 2022 or 2023 when you know you see Roll-Ups uh coming up how do you feel your thesis has changed from your initial taste yeah I mean I would um maybe start by saying I don't think we're in or anywhere near a post-etherium environment um I think it's pretty obvious that you know ethereum is still yeah yeah yeah I I know what you mean but I do think it's important right and I think that informs kind of um the thesis around all l1s you know in in 2016 2017 um I think the um the explosion popularity of ethereum as a smart content smart Contracting platform um and of the ebm kicked off this whole wave of research and development and Innovation around um layer one optimization people started playing around with new consensus mechanisms um trying to optimize for certain areas that they felt ethereum was not uh sort of delivering on whether that was privacy or scalability or you know proof of stake various economics designs again consensus algorithms whatever it might be um I think a lot of that work was was really valuable and a lot of um great new layer one technologies have have been produced because of it um I would say the the thing that has Maybe um informed our thesis going forward here has been the strength of the ethereum community and the ethereum flywheel right um I think it's pretty clear at this point that while there are other competitive layer one ecosystems out there that maybe do certain things better than ethereum does they still have not quite been able to capture um the level of Engagement of developer activity of liquidity and end user sort of participation that ethereum continues to enjoy so I do think that um there are still great opportunities both for Builders and investors and users on ecosystems outside of ethereum um I think that will continue to be true um but I think you know there's definitely a big hurdle to get over um for those ecosystems to compete with ethereum um the one thing I think is is really interesting to observe here is the way that you know those other ecosystems have begun to adopt the evm and incorporate EVMS into their own ecosystems right we see this on Cosmos on polka dot on Avalanche and uh I think that you know that both speaks to um the size and the engagement of the evm developer Community it's a way for those other L1 ecosystems to try to attract devs to come build um in their own ecosystems by saying like hey we can potentially offer additional kind of technical proficiencies but we have an evm that you're already familiar with building on deploying on um and at the same time I think you know over a long enough time Horizon the proliferation of those EVMS and you know potentially their eventual interconnectedness might result in sort of a dispersion of liquidity uh you know kind of originating from ethereum but then eventually moving outwards into those other ecosystems so we're definitely still really interested in in the work that's being done across these different ecosystems it's been interesting to kind of watch these different l1s carve out niches for themselves position themselves try to attract new developers and then also kind of incorporating some of what has historically made ethereum so successful to try to make their bid for a competitive spot you know moving forward and so you I mean of course I think in the last year or so uh there have been a couple of I guess albums that are that are popular as well uh with with a non-evm I suppose uh you know runtime and environment right how do you see how to see their future in some sense I mean without naming names and do you feel like there's still room for let's say better run times including by the way wasn't for example you know there was a you know I think in 2017 there was a huge awesome where you would compile you know wasn't to back to EDM do you feel like that has somehow failed to attract developer attention or do you feel like there's still room for people to build new runtimes that could be better in some way I think there's definitely still room for it and I think that you know as I mentioned at the top of this conversation like we're very far from seeing a sort of um stasis or end point in terms of um technological development and capabilities so um I know there's a lot of teams out there that are still working on upms new runtimes um I think that you know as the space continues to mature and as people continue to find you know more expressive applications new kinds of protocols or applications that they want to be deploying into these decentralized environments some of those VMS some of those runtimes are going to find user bases they're going to find sort of core communities of of developers some of them already have um I think the challenge is again you know the evm has such a head start there there are already so many developers who are um familiar with building and solidity and deploying applications to the evm that to me it feels like you know kind of a good trojan horse for other ecosystems to attract developers um and again you know sort of invite them to come in and start learning more about the underlying Tech stacks of their L1 environments right that being said you know there's a lot of uh sort of unexplored technical capabilities that that could potentially be unlocked by other runtime environments so I definitely expect to see that Trend continue whether or not they'll be able to you know attract sort of critical mass of developers and users remains to be seen I think one thing that definitely has become clear is that um simply building new technical capabilities uh or or like new runtime environments is not enough to to attract that critical mass right there's a lot of other work that goes into making an ecosystem successful um Beyond just the the VM that they're working with I also feel like and I've also kind of experienced this myself right which is um if you talk about languages like solidity and you know and JavaScript for example you know if you ask a web developer they would you know hate I mean they generally hate JavaScript and yet it's the Deep you know the de facto language for for web development and so I also feel like you know these languages you know these are not natural languages but yet they have the social construct to it right which is you know you you can't just say okay here's a fine language or the best language out there and you could program in it but it it may not actually be accepted by by the mass for some reasons so it's it's more complicated than just as you say you know it's not just about being able to do something better from technical terms but you need to build a lot of other things around it that makes language or runtime successful yeah I think that's exactly right and talking about let's say the ethereum roadmap itself right you know vitalik I think last year posted this uh end game uh blog post talking about how Roll-Ups would be the kind of the end game for ethereum and how execution will move out of ethereum and all of that will go to l2s ZK Roblox in particular right and so um you know that's kind of one side of how he sees uh scalabilities uh in game while some of the other I guess uh you know people or you know critics would say that you know for example from dragonfly Capital he recently commented that in ethereum Foundation took the roller proud after years of research on execution starting only because sharding was deemed to be too difficult to implement do you agree with him that Roll-Ups are not an ideal scaling solution and in fact a well-designed L1 could including by the way ethereum right and if you had done a proper sharding directly on lithium that would have been a better option would you how do you what how do you position yourself on this yeah I mean I think that um you know progress is sort of made incrementally and um when you are in a position uh like the ethereum Community ethereum Foundation is in you know you don't have unlimited time to improve on the base layer capabilities of your chain um I think it's a much more pragmatic approach to insofar as you're able to roll out improvements over time continue to iterate and and improve the capabilities that you're offering your community that becomes more difficult as you have more users and more developers right because you're asking them to sort of change um their processes their procedures every time you're asking them to change things that they've become familiar with um and environments that they're familiar with working in but ultimately that is you know that is the nature of sort of uh technological progress right so um I I think that you know haseeb is right to an extent um that you know there are currently and there certainly will be in the future other L ones that you know maybe do have um better let's say quote unquote better uh technological capabilities than ethereum um I also don't think that you know ZK Roll-Ups are likely to be the end point uh of this kind of push for technological progress right it's hard to imagine exactly what it's going to look like in you know another 10 20 plus years um but I I have to imagine that we will continue to um iterate on these things and and make more technological progress in terms of what's capable both at the L1 level at the Roll-Ups level at the application layer all that kind of stuff um so I think you know Roll-Ups are a great solution for the problems that we have right now and they make use of um kind of the most advanced scaling technologies that we have available to us especially to deploy on existing layer ones so I think it's a great intermediate step I think it you know ZK Roll-Ups have the potential to really unlock a lot of new use cases and a lot of you know address a lot of the scaling um issues that kind of plague ethereum as it exists right now do I think it will be the permanent end state of of uh ethereum's scalability questions probably not um but it certainly is is seems likely to me that it'll get us through the next you know at least the next uh sort of bull cycle and and maybe persist even beyond that I agree with you agree with you uh so let's let's move away from layer ones and infra so um when you look at let's say device summer right uh you know some would argue that you know since D5 summer we have slowly moved away from fat protocol thesis to Fat application these and we saw that you know we saw that how powerful some of these applications became uni swap you know at one point you know no one was really using it in that way and you know during that phase you know Unison was the centerpiece of of D5 and compound and other protocols around lending protocols they became centerpiece pieces so do you feel like uh and you know that kind of became a little bit more apparent you know when dydx announced that they are kind of building their own uh chain using Cosmos SDK so would you consider yourself in the fat protocol thesis camp or um you are shifting towards a fat uh application thesis Gap yeah it's an interesting question I um you know I think I still am I'm kind of in the fat protocol thesis Camp uh if you're going to make me choose as a binary um I think it's you know definitely possible that um certain applications or app chains and certain ecosystems um may eventually kind of outshine or or achieve a larger market cap than the underlying protocol but my gut is that it's not going to be the dominant Trend um and I don't know that it's like long-term sustainable from sort of a security and economics perspective right um I think that you know the core component of this question is um how well the underlying protocol in this case the you know the layer one environment that we're talking about captures the value of the economic activity that's being built and deployed on top of it um so you know my sense is that if for example dydx manages to reach a significantly uh higher market cap than um you know than atom right that to me speaks more to a potential issue with the underlying value capture mechanism of atom and the underlying sort of long-term economic incentives associated with holding atoms staking atom you know participating in that um the base layer protocol uh then it does a broad scale shift in economics across the ecosystem right um I might be wrong about that but but my sense right now is still that you know a properly designed layer one token should still be able to accrue more value than any individual protocol launched on top of it or any individual application launched on top of it let me ask you a follow-up question do you feel that in a unique uniform or viable let's put it that way do you feel that that's that's possible there's a possibility of having Unity or you know I mean the I mean what I'm trying to easily say is that you know if you have let's say some of the biggest applications you know like dividx you know it's one of the biggest applications on ethereum today right if if some of these protocols start to move or some of the major ones do you feel like that becomes a problem a problem in what respect in problem where you know you because the the value capture at L1 mostly what happened with some of these biggest applications out there right so for example let's let's talk about ethereum and if some of these biggest applications become too big or the outgrow the underlying does that threaten no matter what value capture mechanism you have does that threaten in some way uh the the value capture mechanism that everyone has I think it it certainly could right because ultimately um you know in the way that the kind of blockchain Stack works right now um those applications tend to rely on the economic security of the underlying chain to prevent sort of existential um attacks from being carried out against those applications themselves now that I suppose can can change to some extent you know depending on um the architectural level changes of other ecosystems right um and I think you know ultimately this is kind of what Cosmos and and like the app chain um sort of thesis is ultimately trying to drive towards I think this question also becomes um even more complex when you start to introduce like modular blockchain architecture um where you know ultimately um components of those Tech Stacks are kind of being cherry-picked and Drawn On by individual applications um you know it's an interesting thing to to speculate about but the reality is these are relatively very new um structures very new environments in which to deploy these these new applications and I think um it's going to be actually really difficult to predict exactly how that's going to play out on you know a three plus you know five plus year timeline so um yeah as I said I I'm still kind of in the fat protocol thesis um mentality both in terms of like how we've seen those Trends shaping out so far and also with the the way that the security models tend to currently be designed um but you know I may have blind spots there they're certainly um open to having my mind changed as we start to see more of these application specific chains roll out and see how they manage to capture value for themselves how much of that value gets driven to the underlying ecosystems and ultimately how the end users um both the kind of benevolent and malevolent ones end up interacting with them you know there's some people who even talk about fat you know what it pieces these days do you do you do you give them any Merit do you feel like wallets are because they are an entry point to the ecosystem of any sort they will also have a potential a way to capture a lot of value through through users are coming in do you believe in that thesis as well yeah I think it takes away yeah yeah yeah um no it's something that I think a lot about because I think um actually like end user asset management is a huge problem in the space um and one that you know up until recently I would say um most Builders have been ah with varying degrees of of willingness kind of willing to accept that like it's an issue but we're dealing with people who are here and know how to you know manage their tokens manage their assets you know sign transactions usually that means people managing a bunch of different wallets combinations of software wallets and Hardware wallets and you know multi-cigs and all that kind of stuff managing assets on a bunch of different chains different protocols all that kind of stuff that's a complicated user experience and it's one with a really high barrier to entry um and I I just don't think that we can reason reasonably expect Mass adoption at the retail level if that's the experience that we're um that we're requiring people to engage with if they want to enter these ecosystems so I think there's a huge opportunity out there for um end user Asset Management products that are more expressive that have better UI and ux and that sort of unlock a lot of the capabilities that we all take for granted across the ecosystem right so I think allowing users to for example sign transactions on different chains with one set of keys is is a huge opportunity really valuable allowing users to interact with different protocols and assets but fungible and non-fungible tokens on different protocols on different chains um natively from within the app you know kind of give people um the opportunity to stake and trade and lend and you know Bridge all that kind of stuff from sort of like a wallet front end um all of these things are really valuable and I think really improve the end user experience and anytime you're offering that much of an improvement over the existing user experience I think there's a massive opportunity to capture value there um we haven't really seen um anybody like actualize on those potentials or capture those opportunities so I think that's a you know I know that that's a space that a lot of people are working on currently and I expect that in the coming year or so we're going to see a lot more wallets and and applications that are designed to kind of address a lot of these challenges and and build out these products and these features for end users I think that the the earliest entrance to that category are going to be able to attract and retain a significant user base capture a lot of value from it the question then becomes you know once that space becomes more crowded and more competitive will those wallets those applications be able to continue to monetize on them right I expect that we'll probably see some amount of fee compression happening um and then you know at that point those teams are going to have to get a little bit more creative on how they're capturing value from users entering this broader ecosystem through their wallet application and do you feel like you know those people who would build those let's say wallet uh you know next-gen wallet that's that is easier for people to use do you feel like you know we who are here in the web 3 world are we so complacent and used to these complex wallets that we would have a hard time building a more usable solution or do you feel like you know we need we have 2.0 guys to come in uh you know who have worked all their lives and user experience on building better in you know SCI human computer interaction tools do you think that we need a little bit of help from that side as well I think um it would certainly benefit um I don't think that there's a lack of capability in the current developer ecosystem I think the reality is what I'm describing sounds intuitive but is difficult to build because of the nature of crypto right um you're you're you're having to sort of find this really delicate balance between maximizing security for the user uh people who are sort of self-custing assets managing key material interacting with complex protocols in a way that is immutable right if you make a mistake you don't get to undo it regardless of how good the front end is um so there's there's a balance to be struck between um you know preserving the security and also on the other hand um sort of building user interfaces that abstract away as much of the complexity as possible and help guide users through a flow that isn't intimidating that doesn't require a huge amount of background knowledge into how these underlying systems work in order to be able to interact with them and that's a really that's a really difficult problem to solve indeed I mean we know if you look at passwords you know you took quite a while for people to get used to passwords and we are now giving away uh people private keys and public keys to manage which is of course a nightmare so you agree with you it's this is a there's a balance around security and you know you know ux that needs to be you know very carefully thought and even you know you need to carefully think about about those parts the one thing I would add to that as well is like that's really just talking about sort of the retail or like end user experience right I think there's um an additional opportunity and I know again that there are there are teams working in this space but there's an additional opportunity to build um better tooling for developers people who are deploying protocols um and giving them sort of more expressive Asset Management Key Management capabilities right better permissioning systems better identity systems um you know better sort of like key sharing or Key sharding Systems that that sort of uh allow developers to build in these more expressive capabilities into the actual core protocols themselves and hopefully that will both make things easier for people to deploy and manage protocols on an ongoing basis um and then also could sort of improve the security of those protocols and and improve the end user experience as well yeah I mean good things there's some work being done as you said you know people are building working on account abstraction people are building NPC wallets um smart contract worlds and so on so I think some of these things are you know shaping up slowly and I think maybe a few years time will have probably better words than you know what we are used to today I suppose yep I agree uh moving to you know when we discuss a little bit about you know app specific Solutions you know we discussed a little bit about Cosmos um you know you recently invested in order and you know we are very proud to have you as an investor what is your thesis around uh you know apps specific uh Roll-Ups for example yeah I think you know again it it goes towards this idea of constantly improving um sort of the expressiveness the flexibility um and kind of the dynamism of the tool set that we're giving to developers right um and so giving developers enhanced capabilities to um you know whether it's manage assets or in this case manage traffic and volumes and all that kind of stuff um the more tools that we can put in the hands of developers the more interesting and expressive applications we're going to see being built and deployed in um decentralized environments um so for me you know the concept of having sort of application specific Roll-Ups um is is an interesting one because I think it just puts another really valuable and Powerful tool in the hands of developers it allows them to customize the way that they want to build and maintain and manage protocols on an ongoing basis it allows more flexibility in terms of both cost and throughput for those applications as they see um you know volumes and traffic changing developing over time yeah I think it just like improves the sort of core functionality of the tech stack that that we're building on uh in a way that you know will ultimately make for better development experiences better end user experiences you know reduce costs reduce settlement times all that kind of stuff and this is this is a question again you know I have my own thoughts on this and unfortunately none of these uh application specific Roll-Ups are fully live yet in in the true form of it including art Library still building but here's a you know question that you know I would love to kind of pick your brains on so you know imagine you know if this if these role of providers lineup for example including another whether that exists in the market if they start offering these highly customizable Roll-Ups you know where adapt can use its own token for gas for example how did their own token which I assume at some point they might have a token right so how do you think their own token will capture value do you feel we might see a cosmos Style kind of No Cap I mean right now it's changing in Cosmos as well but do you kind of see similar scenario or do you think these projects will learn from Cosmos and circuit there has to be a better value capture mechanism you can't have independent Sovereign Roll-Ups without the token playing any part in those those systems yeah I think that's um it's a really interesting question and again um it kind of remains to be seen right um I think it's another scenario where the first entrance into this category will have an opportunity to um to capture value with their own tokens and then it will kind of depend right we'll see how developers end up using these things we'll see how other entrants into this category end up handling their own economics some of these uh sort of application specific Roll-Ups or roll-up Technologies may end up kind of in the realm of just like common public goods that anybody can make use of um and you know in that case the developer teams are going to have to think really deeply about like what is the role that a token might play for a project that's that's building these kind of application specific Roll-Ups right is there a role for a token in that system and if so you know what capabilities does it does it afford and how can it capture value based on the capabilities that it grants to developers who are using it I think that um you know the the benefit that we have now is kind of looking back on seven eight plus years of um various different token economics designs seeing what's worked and what hasn't um if we get to a place where for example the application is able to pay gas fees on an application specific roll-up in their own token um you know there may still be opportunities or mechanisms that those roll-up developer teams can employ to capture some of that value right maybe they end up taking some of that value in the native application token um and you know swapping it converting it you know burning it um issuing it out to uh to to their token holders um in kind or you know again converting it into a native token something like that right all of those possibilities will depend on the different capture mechanisms the liquidity of the sort of exchange pools between those native tokens Etc um I think there's a lot of uh opportunity there it's it's very like early design space there's a lot of different Avenues to explore um but I don't think it's uh I don't think it's anywhere near like a settled question yet I agree I mean we don't this is something we have been discussing internally as well and in one thought that you know we had again we have not finalized any of the bit yet but we do have for example let's say multiple sequences that we run for each roll ups right and these sequences will have to have some security guarantee right because if if they turn the malicious you need to be you need to make them accountable and so that could for example come from you know the token you know of the role of provider and then somehow there has to be a way where a part of the application fee you know has to go back to you know these uh you know sequences because they have to be incentivized in some ways for example a portion could come up the other way could be you know you could be it could be a mix of these tokens so for example you could say let's say 50 of the token has to come from let's say the platform total or the roll up token and 50 of the token could come from the application token and so now both parties are incentivized in some way to maintain the roll up in some way yeah but anyway again as you say it's these are very early early design discussions and you know it will take a bit of time for us to and I guess the space for our for to to come up with these token you know tokenomics as well yeah yeah agreed I mean there's a lot of different levers to pull I think you know the challenge is always again striking this balance between um the the value of the offering that's that's being made and reducing the complexity uh and the friction on the user in this case the user being developers right um so making sure that there's an economic system that properly aligns incentives and drives value where it needs to go or captures value uh in in the way that it needs to be captured in order to provide security or even just kind of operate the network and make sure that transactions are getting through um on the one hand and and on the other trying to make sure that like as a developer using these systems you're not introducing so many additional steps frictions complexities Etc that they just say like forget it it's not worth it and it indeed now let's let's move a bit away from Roll-Ups um and sort of try to be broader maybe uh what is what are some of the areas in the crypto space today where you see interesting projects being built by developers um it could be D5 it could be infrastructure you know what are the other areas Beyond Roll-Ups and you know layer ones and layer tools yeah I mean there's a handful that um to be honest with you like I haven't actually changed that much over the years um because again you know there's so much new research and new development being done uh in in a lot of the same kind of historic categories scaling um is obviously a big one um for me I think privacy is is a big area of of Interest I think there's a huge opportunity um and it's sort of a critical issue in the space right now uh around privacy um you know ultimately like if blockchains end up um just sort of becoming these massive like Financial surveillance networks um I would consider that a a sort of systemic failure on our part right um so um you know I'm really excited about a lot of the work that's being done in zero knowledge space both at kind of the application layer the infrastructure layer and also at the base layer um I think that you know bridging and interoperability is still a really important area again you know we talked about this a little bit at the top of the the call but I think that um you know unlocking cheaper more reliable more secure value transfer between ecosystems is generally a good thing for everybody I think it um you know when done correctly will improve liquidity and reduce fees um across all these different ecosystems and unlock a lot of new interesting applications and capabilities um I think that you know we we covered wallets and sort of asset management in depth I think that's another super important place or sort of category and um you know ultimately like end user applications I think is also a really important category right defy I think has a niche of users there's a ton of value in having these sort of permissionless Highly liquid markets that that never close that no one can sort of turn off and that support a really wide variety of assets and asset classes long tail assets um you know liquid tokens nfts you know potentially real world assets you know there's a lot of people working on that Etc um but at the same time you know most retail users um right now in kind of like the web 2 world or like the existing Financial system have very limited interactions with the broader Financial infrastructure right it's not an area that most people spend a ton of time thinking about or interacting with so um you know thinking about okay what what do end users um end up actually using and what do they want to use and how can um like building and deploying end user applications in decentralized permissionless environments unlock new behaviors unlock new capabilities new business opportunities whatever it might be right so um gaming I think is is a huge one it's very interesting category that I think dovetails really nicely um you know we've seen a lot of work being done on like decentralized social media protocols streaming applications storage um you know compute all that kind of stuff I think there's a lot of really interesting possibilities in in that broader category as well and I think that's going to be a really important one if we're serious about sort of onboarding you know a mass adoption wave you know kind of extension of this question is you know when we saw for example you know back in the day icos were one crucial factor and you can call it ICS you could call them Investments right but icos were one way to that brought a lot of you know blockchain users users quote unquote um but then we saw D5 that really brought users you could actually see TV going up people started to play around with the uni swap you know basically was doing more volume than coinbase at some point of time uh what would be a sector that would you feel could bring and you know recently in fps were the one you know at some point I think I saw a report from Electric Capital saying that you know the the newer wallets that have come up in 2022 the first interaction that they did was in most cases was another free transaction rather than a D5 transaction right so 80 of new wallets did a nft transaction first so what do you think would be the driver for the next batch of new users would it be gaming you feel I think gaming is um a serious Contender I think that you know there are some really major opportunities to um kind of gradually invite people into crypto ecosystems using games as kind of a trojan horse right and I think in general we haven't really seen that work yet primarily because the kind of crypto games that have come out so far have largely been you know experiments like token experiments or nft experiments with with the kind of game skinned over them and generally the games themselves that have not been all that fun to play they've attracted users because there's like a clear and immediate financial incentive right and we've also seen that as that Financial incentive dissipates um so do the user bases of those games right that's it you know coming if you're speaking from sort of a traditional gaming perspective that's a huge problem right one of the big questions that um sort of AAA Studios or even like fast casual games they're trying to solve is is this idea of player retention um and I think in order to attract a significant base of users players and retain them over time fundamentally you just have to have a good game you know you have to have a fun game that people want to play on its own terms for its own purposes the economics of it should I think reinforce those core game loops and um sort of create a gaming experience that is more immersive more expressive allow for kind of like emergent economic behaviors around it um but it should not be the primary focus right so I think there's a lot of interesting work being done now where um you know we've seen a certain amount of attrition from sort of um existing AAA game studios into the crypto space people who are trying to build games that replicate the feeling of you know existing AAA categories and titles and building in new um you know incentive structures um digital asset ownership structures that are you know effectively crypto Primitives right um so I think that as a as a as an offering is really compelling and I think there's uh there's a good chance that you know that kind of format that kind of setup is a great way to onboard a lot of people into this ecosystem more gradually right by saying come play the game you don't have to know anything about crypto you don't have to own any tokens in advance you don't have to have a wallet as you play you know maybe you accrue tokens maybe you accrue in-game assets Cosmetics you know items whatever it might be um and by the way like if you want to own these things meaningfully on chain take them outside trade them um whatever it is you know that that you might be looking to encourage through your game we can kind of guide you through the process of minting them setting up a wallet for you um you know encouraging these in-game economic activities um you know the the end result is that I think a lot of people end up sort of de facto familiarizing themselves with the concepts of digital asset ownership and and you know asset management and having wallets and all that kind of stuff but it's not like the first thing that they encounter when they're coming in right so um from a user onboarding and user experience perspective I think gaming actually has potentially a lot to offer there and in terms of fully launching games do you do you what do you stance on that so do you feel like there would be good and decent fully on chain games as well or you feel like it's it's mostly going to be uh you know kind of samey on chain games or own chain games where mostly games where basically nft assets are are tokenized in some way game assets are talking about yeah my sense is that probably it's going to be more of the latter um just because you know games where every action that a player does um are on chain means that there just is like there are there are limits on the style of play the the pace of the game um the cost of running the that game and initiating those transactions um and again just demands a certain amount of kind of technical familiarity with managing assets and interacting with blockchains um I don't think that they're well suited for uh games that will have really massive user bases and like more complex core game Loops right they'd be very difficult um to say run a game like Call of Duty uh fully on chain right and it wouldn't make sense to do so I don't think that it would meaningfully improve the experience of the game so I think much more likely is that we'll see games being built and deployed in kind of existing game engines epic or unreal or whatever it might be with an economic component attached to it where users are then earning nfts creating nfts to contribute them to the game um earning tokens or exchanging tokens um but those those transaction components will be much more sort of ad hoc that the core game engine the core game Loop will not rely on settling to a blockchain every time users take an action right right okay let's let's talk a little bit about crypto and crypto startups right and or crypto startups and valuations so just about a year ago you know valuations the cryptober world you know seem to be pretty high you know for someone outside and also inside people were often talking about crypto valuations you know was it also a low interest rate phenomenon as you know Elon Musk would say how do you see the valuation these days you feel like the valuations are getting a reset in the in the last few months over years um yeah to an extent right um I mean obviously you know uh the kind of venture capital boom that funded a lot of the web to um sort of tech platforms that we're all very familiar with now um certainly was enhanced by the low interest rate environment um you know following the 2008 financial crisis um so you can't fully separate those things out right at the same time crypto has always been a pretty volatile asset class we've seen uh significant Bull and Bear markets in the past and the public and private Market valuations tend to lag or sorry I should say the private Market valuations tend to lag the public market valuations um by a couple of months but they they definitely respond in kind right um so I would say right now you know we've definitely seen private Market valuations come down it's definitely a more challenging fundraising environment for new Founders and for existing teams to raise later stage rounds but it's also still happening right there are a lot of significant funds in the space at this point that have raised significant amounts of capital and they're looking to deploy their um I think the the Smart Ones are kind of seeing this as an opportunity just to be aggressive and to um continue to sort of double down in specific projects or categories that they find align well with their Theses um so I think it's more challenging now the valuations are lower but it shouldn't be uh you know a period of sort of Despair or discouragement for people who want to go out and raise money and build new protocols in the space right and so um you know I mean if you compare let's say maybe the web 2 world or the traditional VC space right there are somewhat set ways I suppose I mean not really sets that but there are some ways or see there are ways in which you can value a certain startup in a traditional world how do you as a VC value a crypto project today yeah that's a great question um it the unsatisfying answer is really that um it depends on the project the market that they're trying to deploy into the category that they're building in um and ultimately like how we sort of mentally categorize a specific project in terms of value capture models or like what the sort of business is right at its core um the model for kind of assessing the valuation of a defy project is going to be different from a new layer one it's going to be different from kind of an end user application um so you know a lot of it comes down to trying to really deeply assess okay like who are the founders you know how well do they know the area that they're building in are these the right people to build um the project that they're trying to take on what kind of experience do they have what kind of background do they have um a lot of it comes down to um you know assessing the risks right and there are a variety of risks from you know execution technological regulatory Etc and obviously the earlier you get in the more you have to sort of build in those risks into your evaluation model um there's you know certainly a certainly a component of um we just have more kind of historical information right um I think you know the the D5 summer was a great example of kind of watching this cycle of um private Market valuations into public market launches that kept sort of pushing each other higher and higher uh and then you know we'd see kind of a shorter and shorter timelines to the sort of boom and bust of the market caps of you know a lot of these new emerging D5 protocols um because you know they were able to build a lot of hype maybe they were able to sort of vampire attack an existing protocol and attract a lot of initial liquidity pay out really high yields early on but ultimately those economic models were not sustainable enough to support that protocol over the long term right so um a lot of it involves really getting into the weeds around like you know can this protocol if it works the way that it's being laid out right now um is it long-term sustainable right and do we expect these value capture mechanisms to persist in the future continue to capture value what happens when they um are when the environment that they're launching into becomes more competitive um all that kind of stuff so there's definitely like a structured way of sort of moving through all of these different items um but you know at the end of the day um a lot of it kind of comes down to looking at historical examples um kind of working through different Financial projections and then making sure that on a core like really basic level you're doing your diligence making sure that you know your Founders making sure you know you know who else is on the cap table and what the financials of the business look like and you know how much of what they've currently currently raised do they have left and what are they spending it on and you know how are they sort of running the business internally all that stuff is obviously super important as well in talking about you know some of these startups that I've you know raised let's say just before the start of the bear market right and we saw that you know over the last few months several crypto startups you know had to shut down for lack of product Market fit but also due to I guess a shortage of capital because you know they raised right before the start of the bear market now it's a year and a half as fast and now they are you know they have they have a crunch of capital right and you know the situations with three AC and Terra and you know that didn't help either right because you know the contagion in the mark and it was very difficult to do fundraise do you feel like um you know more startups would call it a day in the coming months you know we are seeing people you know some startups actually I think it was today but yesterday that magic Eden uh you know decided to let a lot of people go you feel like that's going to continue where you know you see a lot of startups uh calling it a day and say okay we run out of funding and it's very hard to fundraise these days um yeah I think ultimately like just like we're seeing in the existing web 2 um like Tech category um I think we're gonna see a lot of teams who raised large amounts of money um grew too quickly uh or sort of too ambitiously and failed to you know produce meaningful revenues and are not able to sustain themselves on the revenues that they're generating if there are any um and then finding themselves in a position where they raised rounds at really high prior valuations that they can't really justify when they go out to investors now so there's certainly a lot of teams out there that are finding themselves in this difficult position of you know maybe having to raise a bridge round or even a Down Round maybe not even being able to do that and looking forward at a macro Market that is still sort of dominated by uncertainty right it's really not clear at this point what's going to happen with interest rates here in the U.S over the coming months or a year it's not clear what's going to happen you know in the broader um Global macro markets and I would say that you know if those teams don't have the runway to kind of get through this period of uncertainty um certainly we're going to see a lot more of them you know laying people off taking drastic measures to try and reduce burn and kind of go into survival mode as much as possible some will be successful and get through it and certainly some will not I mean it's talking about VCS themselves right you know there was a lot of criticism towards VCS recently due to the FTX incident um what I've what have we learned from the FTS Saga and you know how can crypto VCS do better yeah um I uh happy to answer this I do have to run um I've got a interview that I've got to do it but um I'll answer this this last question um yeah I mean I think I think you know I think it's a little bit more complicated of a question than most people want to make it out to be I think that there were certainly a lot of red flags um around that that situation and that you know there's a lot of investors that could have been um sort of more scrutinizing and done deeper diligence really looking into again um you know the cap tables and the finances of the business that they were investing in especially at those later stages um trying to get a clearer picture of how the business is being run how internal funds are being used and managed and um you know what kind of accounting systems are being used to track all of this auditing systems Etc um I think there are certainly um some folks out there that that maybe didn't do that level of proper diligence on the other hand uh if you have um a Founder that is obfuscating that information not providing it when it's being requested or blatantly sort of misrepresenting the information that's being provided to investors um that can be a really difficult thing to to get around right if you have somebody that's you know um just hiding information or or giving you false information I don't think you can really fully blame people for acting in good faith on on what's being provided to them so I think it was kind of a a mess on both sides ultimately and I think that uh you know my hope is is that more investors will just slow down the process make sure that they're doing really deep diligence and if um you know if you get that feeling that something isn't quite adding up or you're seeing red flags trying to really take those uh those those indicators seriously and not just getting blinded by you know fomo or kind of the hype cycle that's surrounding a certain project I would also just point out that you know this is obviously not a phenomenon that's unique to crypto we've seen this over and over again in in kind of traditional uh Venture so um it is definitely one of the risks you take as a venture investor but um I think it's incumbent on every one of us to try and mitigate that risk by doing as deep as diligence as possible well thank you very much Ben the time and it was lovely having you here um so thank you very much and I really hope to see you soon again yeah thank you [Music] foreign
