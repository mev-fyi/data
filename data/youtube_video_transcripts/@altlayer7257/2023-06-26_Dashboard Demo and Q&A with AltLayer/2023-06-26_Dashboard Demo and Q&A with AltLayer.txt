[Music] thank you [Music] hello this is amritanya chicken I hope you enjoyed the talks in case you missed any the entire video will be available on YouTube and we'll also be segmenting it so that you can jump directly to the talk that you may have missed me now we have towards the end of this virtual event this segment will be the last bit on our agenda today and therefore we'll keep this segment as a q a session have you received several questions from the committee beforehand we'll start with those but please post your questions in the YouTube chat box and we'll try to pick as many as we can but before we start I would like to ask yaochi to give us a quick demo of our roll-up launch pad we have been building this for quite a while now and you know we did a couple of campaigns around this as well um and so let's go through that first and then we'll open uh the the floor for broader q a now she over to you um yeah so so I believe like most of the audience already know we have this Yolanda service dashboard or platform right so easily you can just log into this dashboard dot dot technology and once you enter this page with a single sound typical your Google account you can see roughly the same uh like sort of structure and setup as I'm showing to you so here I will just show you how to quickly set up a roll up or Flash layer in our context um so there are two ways actually the fastest way is to use the flash GPT so we integrate uh like GPT with our dashboard so in that case as you can see right you can just describe what kind of flash layer you want and then within a few seconds I will generate the configuration file for you and and since you see since it's uh it's checkable right so you can just tap what can what kind of configuration parameter you want to change example we want to change the name to uh last day and uh Tolkien simple to rust so after that you directly change the corresponding parameters and uh yeah after that so this is uh so you can change the token symbol again to rise to so after that right you can you can basically literally deploy The Flash layer where the generated configuration file um or we can just use the default one here you just click the deploy The Flash layer it will just deploy within two minutes and there's an alternative way if you are a developer right you want to choose the parameters sort of with uh with some Precision right so you can go to this second tab called create flash layer and then by default there are two modes for you one is first conference so the second one is the typical gas mechanel and then you can just input your flash layer name for example Rusty again and then you can configure the gas limit and also the block time um after that you can also Define your our token simple and also the the currency name um after that you define the Genesis account you uh you want it and by default we have this uh blog uh blocks blog Explorer and also token foresight uh for your roll up or we call flash layer after that you can just click create typical is just like take a two minutes to generate the thought of The Flash layer as you can see right it's uh already generated uh one and and basically you can look at the Block Explorer um all the blogs are generated and also you can go to the Token Force app and the claim the tokens you you sort of have beyond that right as as we can see there are also IDE so you can deploy your contract to the flash layer or the roll up you just deploy and by default we already have some token contract template you can you can basically go to the first tab there's a contract generator and you can just choose what kind of uic20 erc721 to a contract you want to use and beyond that if you launch multiple roll ups right uh you can manage your roll up where this tab called manage Tab and then uh you can decide what kind of uh operations you want to apply on these flash layers or your labs um and as I've already mentioned at the beginning of this conference right we have a very special feature called flash layer settlement so that means when you do anti-mint or some events right so you can deploy a contract on the L2 but once the event is done you can leverage this type we call Roland time and then select the contract on the Arrow 2 and then in one shot the product automatically roll up all the entities and also assets within this contract back to the selected L1 yeah this is roughly the sort of the um your lab has a service platform can provide for you and later as I just mentioned at the beginning right we'll provide more services and for example the direct here with the persistent roll up with short proof and the multi sequencer and meanwhile we are also integrating the auditron orbit so later on you can have more choices to launch for your dedicated your life yeah well thank you yochi um let's open so by the way a gentle reminder if you have any questions uh that you want us to answer you can post them on the YouTube chat box and uh you know we are monitoring that chat box and you know we pick questions from that directly as well um in the meantime you know we have received questions uh you know I think from Twitter and I would like to take one question and I'll pass it to yaochi first and I'll take another one myself so um let's start with this question so this is maybe okay maybe I will start with this one and then I'll pass the second one to yaochie so uh the question is can you explain the advantages of your technology in comparison to other competitors out there in the crypto space right this is something that I addressed in one of my in my first talk so basically there are different types of providers out there so um in particular Ras providers that are you know that are building similar Solutions and by the way when we started building this I don't think there was anyone or even the term roll up as a service wasn't quite there uh you know used in the in the space uh but yeah since then you know they are there have been couple of at least four or five uh similar vendors or people building similar Solutions so here is the comparison so the first thing is uh we are uh the only ones that has uh fraud proof enabled at the moment are using our own Tech Stacks so this currently on the test that uh but we'll hopefully go main net uh very soon after that once we have we're happy with the results from the Tesla the second thing is uh that we support decently sequencing from the get-go so uh again people are and we you heard talks about decent class sequencing from several uh speakers today but these are sequencing is still not enabled in in any platform as far as We Know and uh in fact uh the Roll-Ups that you launched from uh you know from through through dashboard could have multiple sequences if you wanted to and you already have a multiple sequence of tests not already live that you transact with already and there's other thing that is which is uh mostly around uh different kind of like a wasm based because in the entire stack is based in awesome it kind of gives you a multi-chain multi-vm support from the get go right it allows people to kind of have different choices in terms of evm that they can have and finally uh which is we are the only ones that provide this unique type of execution layer that we call flash layer so this disposal disposable layer where you spin up the flashlight you use it for as long as you want I mean you feel like you're done with it you don't need that anymore you can take the entire network down all the infrastructure that was supporting it uh will be taken down as well so it's very resource optimized and we're the only ones to offer this uh let me pass the second question to yaochi this is more of a experience question which is uh someone asks uh could you share some unique challenges that you faced while developing roll ups and you know modular blockchains are all fair and how you overcome overcame them yeah it's a great question so as I'm ready just mentioned right so on your side we are providing a lot of unique uh and brand new features um for this space uh for example this decentralized sequencing model sequencers and also um it's more TVM apart from evm support we also support like WhatsApp and later for different programming language they can also compound to WhatsApp for execution and beyond that regarding is the Disposable execution layer with a proper proof system and all these stuff I would say are quite new uh to the interior like sort of blockchain space and today I also share about this instrument roll-up interlayer the beacon layer right and I believe this is also the first time for us to explain what's a beginner and how it can really benefit the interior roll-up space so to implement and actually to design these features in a comprehensive way it takes a lot of time and a lot of efforts from inter team to really make it possible so the implementation side is already very tough and uh beyond that um for the other challenges is really about the automation um compared to some other public blockchains or a lot of these general purpose l1s and L2 is right so you just need to build your Tech stack and you almost generally to run the infrastructure for your chain itself but for us we're building this your lab as a service platform which is quite similar to address in the web tool space right so in that case we need to handle tons of thousands Road Labs uh give you one example like for the current flash layer spin-off right we already got over 12 000 free tier spin-off where the dashboard so in that case we really need to build a full automatic infrastructure to really launch this relapse many these real life and and also coordinate these rollers so that's also very challenging compared to for most of the general purpose and once L2 design it to manage their own chain for us like we need a completely automatic system to handle all these automatically instead of like doing it in many ways um and beyond that I write as just mentioned because in the long run we want to decentralize the interior infrastructure so it's not like uh a pure AWS in web3 we want to have a decentralized this kind of uh Zoloft as a service platform so that's why we come up with a beacon layer try to manage like for example sequencing verification uh stating slashing governance and upgrading right so we only with picking layer to basically help us to coordinate all the rollers and customers so this has been the roll up where the beginner and in the end all the sort of the sequences of refers are from the community in that way we can make a decentralized and at the same time everything is automatic so that that's why it's it's not a single challenge like for example just to achieve uh consensus protocol or some algorithm it's like a systematic uh challenge uh in in general so from the uh the design implementation for particular features and then uh for the instructor infrastructure design the building and then to the decentralization of the internal infrastructure as you can see we need to make a lot of these steps one by one to really make it work in the long run so in the future you can see a very decentralized rollerback service platform um with the sequencers of revers from the community and powered by all there okay let's take station and I will answer this this is a question that came uh beforehand I think by Twitter and I also saw a question it's very similar question on YouTube as well which is basically the question around um can we expand Beyond ethereum or one is can be expand to other evm chains Beyond ethereum and then the second question of follow-up question is can we expand Beyond evm chains so can we go to non-evm chains the answer is yes uh so the first part uh about the evm part we already support evm chain so it's not just ethereum for example we did an event a paid mint event where you could actually go and Bridge assets from BNB chain polygon and ethereum right so non-empts are already supported uh and you know almost any of them can be easily supported um because all you need is a basic Bridge for non-e-beam chains the answer is yes it should also be possible and the reason is that we have this stack that is built and it wasn't that allows us to basically support any chain and I think Ed Felton was talking about something like this as well during his talk that you know because you have a awesome piece anything that compiles down towards and can be supported so the answer to both questions is yes the evm part is already supported so right now if you want to have a flashlight you can actually connect it to any chain you want any evm chain that you want non-em changes is in the pipeline but first first we want to finish the e-game components uh completely yeah um let's take another question that I saw on um on I think YouTube somewhere which is there were talks around um eigenlay there were talks around with espresso will it be possible to integrate espresso and um let's say eigen in rollover service you know offering given that orclay already has some of the big bits already built you want to take that yeah so for eigen layer as uh mentioned um in this morning's talk right so um the eigen da is basically uh quite uh balanced DNA so uh it's sort of like it balances the costs and also the performance um so in that case size raw Supply form um so later on for the new uh version we'll have multiple options for the developers to choose regarding da so either you can use your own notes as the option DNA system or you can choose probably uh like eigen layer or even Celestia as your DNA system which are quite professional uh in building uh DNA Network or if as a person right for example as a different person you really feel that your data to be should be posted to ethereum to make sure like all the data available actually this uh ethereum security level then we also provide the option that you can post your data to ethereum engine like it's quite costly um and beyond that it's also open to various like evm chains and and also some other story decentralized storage uh projects um regarding uh missile espresso actually had a bunch of conversation with Ben and uh with you that espresso is realized it is a pre-execution DA so it helps you to um to basically uh Fetch and aggregate the transactions on the espresso platform and after that it gives you ordered like list of transactions for your Google app to execute the next is also a non-intrusive um like platform for us to integrate to um actually for both of this project right we already have some team members to look at their code base and documentation to look at how we can plug in again layer um use them isda at the beginning and also for the expresso we can look at how to leverage uh espresso Network as this pre-execution DNA to order these Translate action and send to some of our your Labs if the Jewelers really choose expresso as as sort of the shear sequencing layer at the beginning yeah um okay let's take another question which is um around orbitrum orbit so the question is explain the integration with arbitrum orbit and the text tag what is its relevance and why facilitate L3 how it facilitates L3 app development so let me take that question um for a little bit of context and I think um so those who listen to the talk from Ed Felton he gave a talk on arbitrary in general but also had quite a few bits and pieces on arbitrum orbit so arbitrum orbit is basically a tech stack that allows people to deploy application specific instances of arbitrums code bases actually perhap which is text stack session and again for context arbitrum is today the largest uh Layer Two or the largest role provided today in the market it has a TV of about 5.8 billion uh in dvl it has a market share about 60 percent so arbitrum one is one of the biggest providers in the market for roll-up or biggest roll-up uh today and so it is it's really interesting for us to kind of help our people who are building an arbitration to give them a choice uh to build uh the application specific infrastructure that uses the same stack the same Tech stack that Arbiter offers as a part of arbitrum one for example so it's it's it's it's it's it's really relevant because you know there are people uh and you know Ed Felton mentioned that as well there are people who really want customizability they're people who want um their stack to be much more scalable and that you can do that only if you have your own uh application specific infrastructure and that's why it's important for us to support RB market in terms of integration it will look very similar to what yaochi demonstrated at the start of the Q a we basically will have the same kind of dashboard we have the same experience it will be able to just pick and say okay I want a flash layer or I want an arbitrum orbit what I want on a flashlight connected to orbital one you would have all these different choices you can pick uh the right kind of Stack that makes sense uh most sense for your business and an application use case hope that answers your question around um arbitrary orbit and why it's important for us and obviously it will help anyone wanting to build on arbitrim orbit and that will basically we will provide the entire let's say managed service that would run behind orbital uh let's take a follow-up question and there's something around weaker I think uh there was uh I mean I think we actually gave a great talk on Beacon land some of all the benefits that vehicle provides you but I think it's good to summarize and this is a question that kind of pertains to that as well which is why do we have a vehicle as an interlay like what's the significance of the internet and why this inteller is important yeah yeah so um why we need Beacon layer so um from the system uh evolving perspective right so um as we can see so we can divide these rolab category into multiple stages uh the first to say that is we need uh basically a single sequencer and also um the proof either these fraud proof or validity proof and this proof of Journey to verify the execution of the transactions where these evm right so in that case if the proof of the journey to verify the logic for the evm and also the evm instructions and then in the stage two um since there are a lot of requirements from the community or projects the one is multi-sequencer to make it relatively decentralized uh to avoid the C Singapore inferior and to mitigate an EV or some other issues right in that case we need to have multiple sequencer and once we have multiple sequencer we need some sort of agreement protocol within this sequencer result to make sure like they agree on the same block of transaction to the executed and the generator so in that case like for the proving system we also need to take the agreement protocol into consideration uh Beyond its execution of the instructions and so then we need some extra implementation and Logic for the proof system to support this uh extra agreement protocol among other sequencers and on top of that so since we have multiple sequencer we know who behaving wrongly and who are behaving in a good manner they are the proof system right so we need staking and sliding basically a panel team maganda to basically punish some of the sequencers who behave maliciously and that's sort of the stage two as C3 is sort of like where where we have why we are proposing this uh Beacon layer because uh like right now we have probably five major relapse but granularly when more games and social applications different applications who are capturing a lot of users so they will definitely spin off your own your Labs or app genes so in that case we can foresee tons of thousands relapse in the world and in that case we really need a sort of decentralized layer to manage these rollers that's something we we are building on earlier right the first step that we provide is no code platform for developer to quickly spin this uh spin off the relapse within two minutes but after that we want to make it decentralized so that's why we need this insurance roll up interlayer between the roller and also the interior so once we have this decentralized layer right it can help us to handle a bunch of things first one is a decentral sequencing so as we just mentioned right you love me I want to have multiple sequencer where to find these sequencers we need a decentral network and after that we also want to decentralize verification where to find these verifiers we need this uh an hour and beyond that is how we do governance How We Do message passing across different Road Labs how we do the upgrading and even how we do this option governance all these we need a decentralized protocol so in the in the ideal case it should be ethereum that's why in my talk I mentioned about like the best case for inferior lab is to light all the Rolex in front to ethereum but we just created too much responsibility for ethereum in that case so that's why we need like something like this Beacon layer to help to coordinates or orchestrate all these relapse at the same time provide is a decentralized sequencing verification sticking slashing governance upgrading all this stuff in that case like we can provide the entire decentralized platform for all the developers especially game developers LTE or the social developers which they are not familiar with how to speed up a jolab or blockchain right so they can just focus on their business logic so that's why we need a billionaire basically it's sort of like we follow the evolution of the technology in the uh in the in the lab space but at the same time it's definitely needed when we have more and more relapse in Easy in this ecosystem and space let's take this question I'll take this question which is which came on YouTube just now any plans to have your blocks Pro that look like etherscan but built on all player lost Scout experience explore scan is somehow confusing so the answer is um you know thank you first of all thank you for the feedback uh around Rock Scout um and so um the idea is yes we would love to support multiple uh different types of explorers and but at the moment we mostly focus on integrating those explorers that are kind of Open Source it's easier for us to kind of integrate that quite easily uh without rest of the uh you know stack at some point if you feel like it's not good enough for clients would be happy to go and build uh uh separate Blogspot hopefully at that point maybe someone else will build a much better block uh Explorer and that we could just use and degrade um but for those and some people might those people who are looking to have a persistent uh block Explorer persistent roll up they might actually want to have a proper ether scan like like you know like like tool so in that way in that model basically you have to you know contact either scan an ether scan can build uh you know a Blogspot just for your specific use case as you can imagine it's not you know it's it's it comes with a cost and it's not very may not be interesting for let's say short-term usage that's kind of why we are using something which comes open sourced and free but yeah for those that are outlines that are looking for let's say a longer term persistent roll-up then I think something like ethers can could make uh make uh sense and yeah at some point uh once we have a little bit more time on hand we might be able to um might be interested in kind of building our own a Blogspot as well uh let's take another question which is um on um yeah so let's take a question more on the non-tech side this time so this is for Yogi uh what are some of the real world use cases or applications where author Solutions have been successfully implemented um would you take that um yeah there are a bunch of Partners we've collaborated uh recently um like uh I believe I believe some of the questions that Quest the center successful examples we show like for the past few months once this entertainment as we all know right we maintain this OG badge and also these ort empty and also these carriers uh cool um and for this afternoon right typically it's quite straightforward for users to use and obviously all the entertainment here within a few seconds or a few minutes so it's quite smooth and in the end uh like the protocol automatically uh settled all the antibiot to ethereum and people can easily trade over the Open Sea and beyond that we also have the partners who are organizing events using some antique case and we we successfully like sort of run is a anti uh system uh for some of these events like the football events uh recently in Malaysia and um and with some smart wallet we provide this really seamless user experience for the users so they don't need to set up metabastes they can just click on the page to meet the entity as the ticket and everything is done automatically on the back end on the other side it's related to the big partnership announcement and basically um some of the firms we already set up the partnership and they will start to use our layer um I mean our rice platform to set up these different Rolex for different females again and again Studios so as you you are not right for game and uh um and and also social applications the uh the latency is very important so we got a lot of feedback from uh the game developers either from the web tool or from web3 of course their requests are quite different some of them requires for 15 billion gas limit some of them require for sub second block time and some of them want to be uh quite like sort of uh um quite user friendly with zero guest so in that case is there like not possible for general purpose I want to achieve that and so they seek the help and support from us and the leader for all these sort of parameter or configurations you can just assess the app where the dashboard yourself so no need I mean this manual support animal and these are sort of the examples we've done for the past few months and of course we continuously received the uh sort of the demand from D5 projects for different projects they want the security to be as high as possible so in that case they want the multi sequencer and the meanwhile proof system is a must and and also some other like governance in Persia the one is a multi-sequencer basically as many sequencer as possible because it's for governance so it would be greater to have a quite decentralized system uh compared to single sequencer or it's largely a centralized a rolapse system so as you can see right the requests and also the requirements from different projects are quite different but in the end the light we we clearly see that there's a lot of demand for customization and a lot of Demands for this dedicated rollout just for the applications so it's a quite clear Trend at least for us to provide this local rust platform for these projects as they can just focus on their main business logic and underlying infrastructure can just be requested where our layers platform uh thank you yochi let's take a couple more questions we are we are pretty close sir running out of time so let's take two more questions so I'm seeing a question on on YouTube um Ultra theme uh Team thank you for such a great event a lot of insights and deep dive into the role of landscape and developments are you planning to onboard third-party validated companies and test that the answer is yes uh we are at a stage where we're still the nodes are still run by us but we will so it will be kind of staged release the next stage we'll be opening up the test net uh in a kind of whitelisted manner so if you watch list then we then you'll be able to come and join the network on the second stage uh would be a completely permissionless or tested by anyone could come and uh you know become a known operator presentation uh he has a list of uh you know upcoming I guess Milestones that he touches upon there's one of the related questions that I will pass to yauchi which is uh what is the system requirements for running a validator node yeah the cool part that based on our uh experiments like uh the specs for running either a sequencer for a roll up or running a validator for the beacon layer it's a minimum but typically um like for some of our internal machines is like a two CPU core and 4G Ram but we recommend at least you have the machine with the laptop laptop specs right but in general it will be sort of the um the minimum machine requirements and so that's why we always emphasize that we want to have this decentralized infrastructure as early as possible so we can welcome as many community members to join the network to provide their like sort of machines for uh for this for becoming uh sequencers or becoming the beacon Valley teachers so United is as I just mentioned right it's no longer like the AWS in web3 it's a real truly decentralized infrastructure system to provide your local system products for the your lab space okay yeah I was on mute um so uh let's take one more question from I will take one more question I will leave the last question which would be a simple question for yaochi to close off so one last question for me which I'm picking from YouTube which is how do these Technologies address scalability uh cost efficiency and user experience challenges commonly faced in Design Lab decentralized applications the answer is actually when you have imagine for example when you are interacting today with a uni swap on ethereum you are basically as a user you're paying two fees uh one fee is what you paid to ethereum uh as gas fee and the second fee is what you pay to uh the application itself right so the two fees that you pay and this is not great for user experience right and that's kind of why people are developing and building uh you know account abstraction where you could say okay I don't want to pay user doesn't have to pay the gas key user only pay is the application fee for example the the fee for trading for example and all of this could be very easily adjusted on our this is very hard to do on a base chain and that's why you need layers and layers of Attraction on top to be built but if you have something like an application specific a roll up you could actually do and build all of this quite easily for example you could have a completely gasless experience and not in the form of uh account abstraction because someone else is paying a gas but here the motor could be completely gasless where there's no gas at all even at the protocol and you couldn't do that and that that's why that actually helps you in one way at least from user experience in terms of user experience so users don't have to worry about you know acquiring gas token and paying for gas and the other thing that you can do for example you could improve your latency and scalability which obviously uh gives a lot more benefit to people interacting with the blockchain one last question if we close off as we are running out of time [Music] yeah so we are progressing uh step by step uh so right now uh if you look at the dashboard right so uh for a lot of these uh Lola Services they are sort of production ready uh if you want to launch this empty campaign or some gaming sessions you can quickly launch via the dashboard and uh so basically all your operations and activities can be done on the flash layer after that you can settle down the uh selected one ethereum polygon and beam region so that part is like already production ready um but for the beacon layer side right that's why we are running a lot of campaigns on the testing the the features for the beacon layer recently like for the past two we already tested uh sort of like this multi-sequencer and also staking slashing mechanism and later on we will test this no joining and challenging kind of um so granularly we will roll out a features once this uh production ready and I mean well as you can see right we want to build all this stuff ready before we launch a midnight and so in that case I believe you will see a lot of good news and the partnership along this way and hope the community can can basically join us and together we witnessed the progress of the entire development yeah well thank you Yoshi with this we have reached the end of the last day the roll up as a service day hope you enjoyed the talks from The Amazing speakers and this q a in particular for those who didn't notice it was a live q a uh so we're picking questions live from people posting them on YouTube and we are answering them in live uh we also thank all the speakers for making time to prepare for the talk uh given their busy schedules and you know time zone differences what not uh so yeah that's the end of this uh last a gentle reminder that several of our team members will be in Paris for ETC it's an event that happens it will happen in mid July this year you'll also have a roll-up day Side Event there so if you will be in town come and say hello until then goodbye and have a very good day ahead thank you foreign
