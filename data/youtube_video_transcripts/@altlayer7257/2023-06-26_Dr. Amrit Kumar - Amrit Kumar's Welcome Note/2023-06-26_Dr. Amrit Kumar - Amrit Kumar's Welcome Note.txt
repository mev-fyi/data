[Music] thank you [Music] hello hello yeah hello and welcome to all players raste short for rollups service day whereas is a virtual event with the goal to bring together experts in the roll-up and modular space and to talk about the present and future follow-ups but from a Roll-Ups as a service perspective that is a world where we have many application tailored roll ups you have an exciting lineup of talks but let me kick start this event by giving a talk on why build rollups and service platform in the first place and how off layers is contributing to the space in general so why build rollups in particular why build role of the Service Solutions you know such as all flat now if you look at the space today right uh we it's quite as well established by now that modular design philosophy is the only one that can come and scale or applications so that's capable to provide you know applications the right kind of Da bandwidth the right kind of you know blogspace bandwidth and so chains that are monolithic in nature in particular for example ethereum they have started to move kind of adopt this modular stack and basically focus on settlement and uh DNA needs for applications um while the main component which is the settlement layer I mean main or one of the components which is the second layer of the model stack has started to move out of ethereum right and we have started to see all sorts of an execution layer is also known as Roll-Ups these days uh to pop up and in fact if you look around um you could see in the space today different types of rollups depending on uh that have different features for example you could have a Roll-Ups that are based on ziki or based uh and also for example ability proof based uh Roll-Ups or you could have for example optimistic execution model there's roll ups you could have these Roll-Ups that run different runtimes for example you could have evm based Roll-Ups or awesome based rollups so Lana IBM based rollups and so on and some of these groups have different purposes as well so you could have a general purpose roller for example arbitrum optimism ZK sync and others you could have application specific Roll-Ups that you could build using let's see op stack or arbitrum orbit and so on and they could be deployed in different contexts for example it could be a layer two for example you could attach them to base change for example ethereum or for de needs or it could be implemented as a layer 3 on top of an existing layer 2. but basically the idea is that because execution has moved out of the base chain now people have all sorts of flexibility because they are no longer limited by the constraints that a patient provides or restricts you and so people are building different types of execution layers that have different characteristics so you can mix and match different features of your execution layer or that best suits your application business needs and so this is also you have all sorts of execution layers or Roll-Ups out there in the market today you know ranging from uh you know persistent or application the general general purpose Roll-Ups like you know zika sync uh you know orbital optimism but also very specific application specific rollups like op stack based Roll-Ups and so on and so what has happened is because of the different execution environments or the different execution needs so different execution characteristics that have come up you're seeing a fragmentation of the entire execution space today and as a result if you are a new application developer uh and want to build your own application uh specific infrastructure so your own application specific question like you'll have have a hard time in some way because you have to deal with all the heterogeneity that comes from this fragmented execution space there's a lack of for example a single development framework that could use that you could use to build your own application dedicated infrastructure and um even though there are some sdks that I do that are offered sometimes they are very low level so it requires still quite a bit of understanding of uh how Roll-Ups work which might not be uh the expertise of some of the application Builders out there and so the goal was to kind of build something that could unify the entire space in some way right when we started we were thinking about okay how could we build a universal execution framework for all web 3 execution leads and so it's it's a question that you know we kind of know the answer to right because if you look at the space in the web2 world you have this uh giant Amazon web services and so if you're a developer and you're building anything right from a startup to you know even a medium or big or large scale uh you know venture you Outsource your compute or storage capacity to Amazon web services because it's much more convenient it's it's cost efficient and also it kind of takes away all the hassle of maintaining that infrastructure yourself and so the idea was to kind of learn from uh what AWS has done for the web to space and kind of take it a little bit forward and move it to the web 3 space so can we do this and the answer is yes we can do it let's see let's assume that you you were able to build an AWS for F3 of some sort right then what would happen right so one thing is it could reduce cost for all developers so right now if you're going to build an application dedicated infrastructure today uh it will take you millions of dollars to go and build it right if you're not using something like let's say uh you know an SDK that is very tailored to application specific infrastructure it requires a lot of Dev resources right and it's like a good example of this is for example um d y d x right d y d x um was decided to build an application dedicated infrastructure uh they announced it sometime in last year it's almost about a year now and it's still not out there yet right because it simply it takes time to go and build application specific or application tailored infrastructure in the blocks in the in the blockchain world and so if you had something like AWS then you could wrap it rapidly innovate so you could very easily go and deploy a fully customized infrastructure and you could host your application of that infrastructure and you know when you feel like uh you know uh you know this is something that you know you really need you can customize in all sorts of ways the second thing is you can scale the structure can scale depending on uh you know based on application that you have and so uh this leads to uh sorry and so um the goal was to kind of build something like AWS but in the web 3 space and so the idea was to kind of build something what we call today as roll up as service solution so roll up a service didn't exist a couple of months sorry when we started back in uh 2021 and now it has become quite a few uh quite a popular theme outs and a lot of projects are interesting projects that building in the space around around rule of a service or Solutions so what does it offer you so uh allows anyone to go and deploy a fully customized application dedicated roller within minutes and it should be doable by any non-technical team members so imagine for example you're a business uh person or a marketing person in a team and you would like to have or at least experience or even deploy or innovate using an opportunity infrastructure you should be able to do that and shouldn't take you you know months or years to be able to deploy that so the goal was to make it easier as easy as possible for anyone to go and deploy uh these application tailored rollups and so this that's what the goal of sorry my slides are jumping um so the goal was to so if you had something like authorized role of a service what could you get from this so one is because I said it's it's designed as a no code framework so anyone with a zero coding experience should be able to go and launch an application dedicated infrastructure you know by themselves and so it it makes it much easier for anyone really and so the second thing is once you have it when it becomes easier it also means that it becomes low cost it's it's also fast to deploy right and um what's really interesting and I think it's it's one of the core component is that when you have infrastructure like this to to deploy a rollout for yourself then if you are an application builder then you can go and focus on your code expertise so imagine for example your game developer then you can go and focus on game development rather than worrying about oh how do I go and manage my infrastructure and how do I go about uh you know maintaining uh nodes that I have uh that have been drawing uh for my for my role here and so all of that goes away because you're basically Outsourcing your other component to roll up a service provider it basically gives you a managed service of that kind and so um where do we stand uh in terms of uh roll up a service provider so uh we are the only ones water is the only one that offers a unique kind of roll-up that we call a female Roll-Ups and I'll tell you a little bit more about it uh in a minute and so it's a role of that is basically disposable nature and uh so you can spin up this rule up you can use it for as long as you want I mean you feel like you're done with it you can take it down it's one of the only Ras provided today that runs with display sequencing so this is something that you know has been uh a point of debate uh in the last couple of weeks or even months where you want to make sure that um you don't run with a single sequencer because it can create uh liveness issues can create issues where you know if your signal goes down you will have to find ways to get your transactions uh processed the second and third thing is we are the only ones that are working for proofs on the tested at the moment and which hopefully will go over them individual soon so um our dashboard which allows people to deploy these robots already live so you want to play around with it go to a dashboard dot all the technology uh there are several uh I would say tiers uh depending on uh these are pricing tiers but there's a free version that you can go and try uh this allows you to deploy and roll up that will last for about two hours when you feel like you're done with it you can take it down the two um kinds of Roll-Ups that we offer at the moment on one that we call a female Roll-Ups or Flash layers so as I mentioned these are Roll-Ups that are disposed by Nature the second one is what we call persistent roll up so these are roll-ups that are basically something like arbitrum optimism but um you know for dedicated applications so you know it doesn't go down for you know immediately it stays there forever and the last part is um roll ups that so by the way these two roll ups The Flash layers and the processing multi chain roll ups these are both builts using our own Tech stack but we're also in the process of integrating external sdks so for example arbitrary orbit which is uh which allows people to go and deploy arbitrum based l3s and the idea is to kind of offer people a framework you know a dashboard from where they can go and deploy arbitrary orbit based l3s so we are adding support for third-party orola best as well and so uh let's come back to these flash layers or female rollups so these as I said this these are Roll-Ups that are disposable nature and they're ideal for applications that drive a piece of number transaction volume or in a very short style of time so imagine something like a mint event uh which can be extremely popular and hyped and you want to make sure that you know it doesn't create a gas more like situation if you want to host it on the general purpose chain so take for example UK Labs right for example so uh if you want to UK labs and you want to do mint event you know that you know your project or your invent event is going to be super hyped and you want to make sure that that doesn't create a gas or like situation so you would spin up this roll up that would be disposable in nature so you do your mint event so once you have spun up your roll up you do your mint event on the roll up and once you feel like you have sold out all your nfts and there's nothing left to you have to do and at that point you can basically take down this rule up and all the assets that were minted on the rollout will go back to the base chain and at that point you can basically take down the infrastructure and all the assets uh move back to base Gene for example ethereum and any node infrastructure for example RPC endpoint and those sort of things will go away it will be taken down and so it's a very resource optimized uh version of rollups the second and as I said it's the benefits of you know multiple one as I said you know if you are minting uh nfts for example if you're using for a very short short span of time it allows you to kind of have a dedicated block space but in a very kind of resource optimized manner people would be familiar with user experience will have familiar use experience in the sense that you know if you are uh your users are familiar with TVM you could have evm runtime on develop side as well and it's very uh you know your assets go back to the base chain so for example if your energy project uh it's very important for you to have liquidity and so you want you asked us to go back on ethereum so that you can trade your users can go and trade on openc and enjoy all the liquid benefits that ethereum and the patient provides you and so the second part so this was the flash class so these are Roll-Ups that are disposable and this is now I'm talking about the persistent roll ups these are Roll-Ups that stay there forever so they don't go down they don't get taken down they stay there forever and these are ideal for anything that has a longer term kind of perspective so imagine for example a D5 project or a game five projects a social five projects so these projects would be ideally uh should be on a persistent roll up because they they prefer they'll prefer to have a longer term infrastructure only has been there for quite a while now uh so we have been experimenting our class Tech in a variety of settings in particular nft mint events uh and uh gaming so um for example we hosted uh twice already and I think we're hosting one more event of Dark Forest uh soon and uh so dark Forest uh every time we did host the Dark Forest and we received about 100K transactions a day from about 300 to operation to place so uh our Tech has already been is already been used for different activities ranging from games to social fight to uh nfts there are some other usage metrics more on the tech side so we ran a campaign a few months ago on a flash layer so we allowed people to go and deploy uh flash layers and we asked them to go and do transactions on those flash players and during that campaign we received about 100 million transactions on those flashlights um we'll come back to a minute but we also have a network called Beacon layer which basically acts as a decentralized sequencing layer and yaochi will give a talk about this uh uh you know later and that has already been live on testnet and that has been doing about has done about quarter million transactions already you also have a multi-sequencer test net so there's a test net that has multiple sequences they run a local consist protocol among themselves and that has also been live uh and it has done uh close to about a million a million and a half transactions already so um as I said this is a roll up a service day our idea was uh to bring together experts in the roll up and the model of space to discuss and share insights on the latest technical developments and economic points of view uh we have an exciting uh lineup of speakers and talks uh this will range from shared sequencing to rule of restaking it's a straight arm from eigenlayer will be coming up next after the talk uh we have a talks on Mev PBS designs and economic designs for roll ups so um this will be mostly talks uh to start with we have a panel uh towards the end uh with Stephanie from asari uh Patrick McCory from arbitrum and maida from variant uh and uh really at the end we'll have a q a session with myself and yaochi if you have any questions around roll ups in general service platforms but also uh you know quality in particular so thank you very much for your time and attention and enjoy the talks I foreign [Music]
