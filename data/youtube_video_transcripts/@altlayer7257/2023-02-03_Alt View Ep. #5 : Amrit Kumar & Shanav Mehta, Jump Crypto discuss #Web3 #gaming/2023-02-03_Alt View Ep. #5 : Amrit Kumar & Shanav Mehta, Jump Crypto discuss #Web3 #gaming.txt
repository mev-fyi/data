[Music] thank you okay I think we are live uh hello everyone my name is Amit Kumar and I'm the CEO of all Flair and this is all for you and we are today uh very happy to welcome Shawna from jump and we are going to discuss about uh gaming and this particularly blockchain gaming so games that are built on chain so welcome thank you for joining us thank you for having me so let's start with a very quick intro so uh tell us a little bit about yourself you know you know what's your background uh you know what brought you to the blockchain space and what you do at Jump uh essentially and what excites you yeah absolutely so I I actually got introduced to bitcoin and read the white paper back in 2017 while I was still in college um got really fascinated with the space And while I spent the the next couple of years out of college um working with a Consulting Group that specializes in due diligence for uh private Equity hedge fund transactions I spend most of my time outside of work sort of coming back to the space um I sort of was Moonlighting as a researcher publishing a bunch of stuff and uh you know investing most of my personal capital in the space I think that that's a story that that most people uh can can relate to and I don't think mine was uh any different in that regard and so then you know come summer 2020 uh was fortunate as I think were a lot of folks to see uh you know capital appreciation in all of the Investments made through that time and um we're spending so much more time uh with the space than I was in my day job that I decided to uh to go out and start a small fund of my own with little friends and family Capital um and then again you know fortunate with timing uh was investing largely in the liquid markets through uh 2021 uh doing a lot of Angel Investing on the side and through that period got in touch with one of the folks that was building out uh the Venture business at jump and saw the opportunity to do something uh bigger and work with a group that was doing things uh at a much larger scale and sort of having to look back since so that's that's sort of how I got into the space um I announced it on jumps Investments and Partnerships team um and where I personally have been spending a lot of my time recently is looking specifically at the application layer of of you know the space and also sub application infrastructure that can help facilitate these application use cases you know jump specifically has a lot of folks looking at core infrastructure which is you know which is our bin button where we Thrive um and personally I've been looking more at the application layer because I believe that for all that infrastructure to have value over time it requires some of these applications that sort of breaks through and reach not just the people who are interested in the technology for Technology's sake but who genuinely want to use these applications so that's that's why I spent a lot of my time personally and when you when you mention application layer is it like broadly sweeping the application layer or is there any sector that you feel uh more inclined towards like D5 or totally so you know we we look across the Spectrum uh I do as well but the one place that I've been spending a lot more time recently is uh on the gaming space for sure okay wow and it fits it fits our agenda today yeah um so let's go to the next question which is basically um when we when you look back in let's say 2020 uh doing D5 summer we saw compound Ave a bunch of other are very promising protocols and applications you know being launched and they were very successful you started to see the product Market fit in those segments and that actually brought in a lot of users uh you know where you know interested and excited about the promise of Nephi but some people would argue that I mean they would say okay yeah D5 is great but it's becoming more and more complicated by the day you know previously you were just using spot trading and now you have all sorts of derivatives popping up Structured Products and whatnot to a point where you're kind of alienating regular average uses right it's very difficult for example to any you know for average user to go and use uni swap uh not the swap part but more like the lp part right it's very complicated for an average user to do so so do you would you agree with some of these critics who say that uh you know the next wave um would not be D5 the next wave that would bring the next wave of users would not be D5 would be something else but would you agree with this statement yeah I think I think there's there's like some level of nuance that I do think a lot of the financial applications uh make a lot of sense right and so you know I think I've been having this debate with a lot of people is you know what are the specific use cases for the blockchain what's going to bring more users to the blockchain I actually think that's that's the wrong way of framing the question and the right way of human question is like what does what is a blockchain good at doing I think we reached a point in the hype cycle where it was you know there was this thesis that blockchain is going to be everything every application requires a blockchain and I think that sort of led to this view of what's going to bring users to the blockchain uh you know I think a lot of people in in this space get very tribal about the things they support and it tends to you know lend well towards that view um but when you zoom back in in my opinion and would love to hear your thoughts as well but in in my opinion the blockchain is good at doing three things specifically one is instant peer-to-peer settlement the second is verifiable programmable ownership and the third is which I think has been pretty interesting in gaming which we can get to later is being a shared database for non-financial information and so if you think about like but these are the three things that the blockchain is kind of doing I think there are a lot of financial applications for which it's going to make a lot of sense and we can really keep that to a different conversation um I do think games are specific you know particularly well suited to leverage all three of those right so if you think about um you know more featured Rich games like MMORPGs and so on which require like high compute capacity and will really live from a game Loop perspective on unreal fiber like one of these uh rendering engines uh the asset layer and programmability makes a lot of sense because you can now have part of your game specifically the application they are living on chain you can introduce like various forms of asset programmability um cross access and those sorts of things and then when you look at stuff like hyper casual games which don't really require as much of the asset layer to live on chain they can leverage stuff like instant peer-to-peer settlement when you have stuff like escrow based tournaments and all of these things which um you know which which you would otherwise need to have Financial reels in every single country to be able to access those users you can now start doing that stuff launching right and then you have this category of fully on train games which can use like this uh shared immutable database property which is uncorrelated with assets or financial information and so you know going back to the earlier question I think there's a lot of interesting Financial applications that will come through um I do think you know when you ask the question of like what can blockchains do for each specific uh application category games actually you can use all of those properties depending on the category of games at all I agree I completely agree with your statement and I also feel like and if even if you go back to the early computer age right uh when uh I get I I first bought my first computer the first thing I did was was uh you know basically play games because I think it's a fun way to also introduce and bring a technology to to uh to to a crowd right it's it's of course the part is of course about how you can leverage the properties of a blockchain in a much easier better way but I also feel there's a fun element that and I I don't think you can eliminate that fact I feel because technology can be very complex right and for example if you look at let's compare let's say chart gbd with something like let's say uh Tech an about blockchain I feel like blockchain has become way too much Tech techie I would say for example if you look at the even the marketing of chat GPT right it's it's very focused towards what value it offers rather than about the bft protocols rather than let's say how the underlying consensus protocol works and you know the papr network and whatnot so I feel like if we can see what we can offer to people from that you know that gets benefited from the blockchain infrastructure that I think is super powerful so I do agree with you that you know games and by the way I played uh you know um Dark Forest as a fully on chain game you know I I won't say that it's it's any different from any other block you won't I mean if you're it's actually hosting a proper blockchain network with let's say decent agency you actually don't even feel like it's a it's a it's a any different from a web 2 game I feel you know from a user perspective and you get all the benefits as you mentioned uh of programmable ownership and whatnot from the underlying infrastructure so I do agree with you that games are one of the sectors that really take out all the benefits of blockchain in a true sense of it yeah absolutely now um but of course you know we are not quite there I feel and of course you know blockchain games are not new right you know we started back uh with I guess cryptocurities was arguably probably the first a game that became popular to a point where people were interested in owning some of the uh you know kitties um but what do you think has happened over time could you give a sense of like a history of blockchain games you know where we are today and uh where are we coming from basically what have we built so far yeah totally so I think like if if when we look back at this specific moment in time uh I think we'll we'll feel like we're still in the discovery phase right if you if we look back at this time several years down the line uh I think today we're still in the discovery phase of what what really works there have been a lot of shots on Golden I think that's helped move the ball forward um but I think we're still trying to figure out like what specific approach to building games on-chain works and what makes it fun what makes the user experience frictionless and um I'm sure we get into some of this later in the conversation right um but I think as you'd rightly mentioned crypto kitties was the was the first uh blockchain game that you could say sort of cross the chasm and uh reached a lot of people uh you know here hit around 8 million in daily trading while the Emirates speak and so you know you could suddenly say that it captured the imagination of a lot of people um and I think that that was the first one and I think this happens with like any new innovation right the first iteration will always um sort of hyper focus on one specific benefit that that underlying technology can offer and in this case it was asset programmability in you know offering game mechanics that you couldn't really do elsewhere obviously the downfall of that sort of thing and I think this is something that happens in the discovery phase of any technology is that it was extremely narrow in its use case and the fact that it was extremely narrow in its use case uh I.E like the core mechanic of the game was beatability which led to you know increasing Supply which led to dilution of uniqueness and those sorts of things eventually lead to the demise of that sort of application I think it's at the groundwork of like these are interesting mechanics that you can't do uh with any other type of Technology right and so then obviously axi Builds on top of that introduces uh stuff like your your PVP and all of these other economic paradigms around uh the game I think so this is what a lot of traditional Gamers hate is that it took that core mechanic and like really financialized it to the extreme where everything you know all of the the benefits were tied to um to the financialization of the underlying assets and obviously any game where at customer acquisition cost is like way higher than anything that the user eventually spends in the game and you're paying out more than you get in it's not going to survive but again I think it um I think it took that mechanic one level further and got more people to start interacting with the sort of Technology right and then as you I think you mentioned Dark Forest right which to me is like a completely different Paradigm it doesn't really look as much of the at the programmable asset part of things which it does to some extent but it looks more more at this aspect of like distributed serverless compute where everything is on train um and now you can build like interesting mechanics that weren't really possible before right um and I think we're now starting to see people experiment with different parts and then you know going back to the thing that I was talking about earlier is that every game is not going to use the same sort of advantages that the underlying technology offers some folks will use a peer-to-peer settlement for payments some folks will use asset programmability some folks will use serverless compute but I think where scientists see more interesting experiments um that aren't exclusively cash craps and so then that gets kind of interesting I think to me the thing that's most interesting now is that what these experiments have done is not only gotten a bunch of users that you know try out and use the underlying technology not only gotten a lot of people to start building infrastructure to support these kinds of applications but I think what it's really done is gotten a lot of uh really really high quality game developers and this includes you know everything from small Indie Studios to some of the largest studios in the world starting to build on chain over the past year and I think we're going to see some of those games start to come out um and so you know to summarize like we've had all of these shots on goal that look like failures to date um but I think what they've enabled is uh getting users accustomed to like playing these types of games and interested in playing these types of games and more importantly gone like the real developers to sort of come to the party to ask you a follow-up question do you feel like each of these game scripts or kitties uh to start with and then actually I mean again we can hate and love all these games but do you feel like each one of these games actually brought out some interesting aspect that was not so apparent initially for example back in the day when you if you're building a fully on chain game you know around the time when you know crypto kitties was there people would say you know it's not going to work you know what's the point of trying anything uh while dark force actually showed you that you could build a fully Unchained game with every single move that happens you know as an online transaction so do you feel like each of these games even though some people may color it's a it's it's it's a crap game or whatever but he actually brought out the unique feature that blockchain offers to to users and to the blockchain Developers yeah absolutely and I think like this is uh if you look back at like any technology over time the first folks that start tinkering with the technology would that that specific um that specific approach is not going to be what the the eventual outcome looks like but I think it takes these sorts of things to eventually like bring um you know the final end product to Bear right and I think all of these applications sort of in some way started showing each of these uh you know individual capabilities of what can be done I think that's laying the groundwork for what's to come so uh now let's take a controversial kind of statement or topic that uh I mean we have been discussing a little bit on that anyway but if you if you look back right now if you look today right you know many hardcore Gamers outside of crypto would say you know blockchain games are basically crap or they they lack uh you know for a better word you know it's they're basically crap essentially and uh anything that you have and maybe it's it's probably post taxi that happened where people say you know it's it's all nfts and you're just playing with those uh very recently I think Microsoft announced that you know you can't go uh build nfts into Minecraft things like that so how do you look the general perception at least from the web to Gamers at least what some people who argue is Is Not Great towards or perspective towards blockchain game is not great so how do we feel like we bridge this Gap like how do we make those Gamers serious about or take us seriously totally I mean first of all I I don't think they're wrong uh when you have like the first iteration of the product that's extremely experimental you're bound to have a lot of polarization right and I think this this the specific like approach that blockchain games have taken so far was extremely polarizing because it hyper financialized everything right and most Gamers will tell you that they hate like pay to play or pay to win mechanics which is which is what a lot of these games were so far um I think what it's going to take eventually is what it takes in uh in any line of businesses just building good product um and I think a lot of the folks that are building games today are taking the learnings of uh uh all of all of these things that have come before and building core mechanics that are actually fun and more importantly like not using um the blockchain as a means to financialize the core mechanic but moreover as you know it's it's sort of becoming more and more subtle within the game I think this this extends to like the the broader question of like it's it's not as much as like what can we do to bring Gamers to the blockchain it's almost again like what can the blockchain do to enhance the experience of users and I think as we see more and more and and we're starting to see this with designers see a lot more folks uh sort of take that approach um and build some of these capabilities into the core mechanics of existing games or new games you know all of these possibilities and I think as those uh games become fun for people to play is when they'll eventually adopt and more importantly I think they may adopt it without even knowing that they're adopting it right and that's I think the the ideal outcome I said would you say that it's going to be kind of uh in towards out or would be out out end where basically we build games that of those Gamers would play and feel like oh it's really fun you know my my whatever we thinking about blockchain games are actually wrong or you feel like some of those Gamers themselves will find some parts on blockchain interesting and they themselves will come out and build something that you know uh us blockchain people would like what do you think would be the approach is it going to be in and out or okay I think the it I think the ideal outcome which is starting to happen by the way is is almost like neither of those two things I I don't think traditional blockchain developers are the best suited at building games I think a lot of people have proven that you can build interesting things um but from just like a success ratio perspective you know the ideal outcome would be to have traditional game developers who understand the benefits of the technology and more importantly understand how to build games that people enjoy playing like having those folks come in and start building um you know parts of their game on train is where things start to get a lot of get a lot of you know get a lot more interesting than they are today and I think that's starting to happen like there's this is this is not like totally public yet but it's starting to happen like a lot of folks are starting to um you know sign the build on chain and they're gonna you know push these titles to the existing users and I think that's how that that cycle of adoption kicks off yeah so by the way I've put up uh you know the gaming blog post that this is part one of the big of the four part series if I recall correctly uh the gaming uh discussions now um there are different types of phone chain games and you just you discussed this and mentioned this in your blog post as well could you could give a sense of you know and I think we mentioned a little bit in the early conversation but could you tell us a little bit more about how would you categorize um some of these games that exist today or you think would be built tomorrow uh based on you know some activity that they do on the Block on the blockchain itself so how do you categorize these launching games yeah and by the way the reason this like this definition uh exercise came up is because a lot of people recently have been throwing around the word web3 gaming and in fact a lot of people who were developing quote-unquote web 3 games when you ask them like which part of your game lives on Jane would say oh we'll figure that out afterwards right um and so when we we really dug deep and started speaking to folks who are building games online thoughtful manner the three sort of approaches that that came to bear was the first is what we call uh fully on chain games right this is what we were speaking about I think dark force is a great example of this where every move is a state Up played on chain um and this works for a specific subset of turn-based games today uh you can imagine like if you have have you know simultaneously or you have like an extremely high frequency of moves per second this is going to uh basically uh spam the blockchain and cause some downtime at least right um but for games which are turn based it it lends to some very interesting mechanics where um you know you can have every player action be recorded on chain and then you can build a completely new game mechanics that don't exist today uh so that's that's the first first example of games that we thought was pretty interesting the second one uh and by the way this this category is the one which uh which you're speaking about earlier leverages sort of like this serverless persistent compute capability of the blockchain uh the on-chain assets approach is somewhat like more low touch when you think about it right because every move doesn't have to be a state update on chain and this this applies by the way to games that are simultaneous play um or have you know high frequency of moves per second but still want to leverage sort of the asset programmability uh and verifiable ownership that can happen on chain and so what you can have then is your entire game Loop can continue to live on on unreal five and you know all of the progression can be tracked there but what you can have is like the asset layer can be represented on chain at the start of every game session uh the uh the game server can query the blockchain for the current state of the asset enable capabilities Within the game based on the current state of the asset and then either at the end of a session or it could be even more frequent like when there's some asset level State ownership like let's say some character like uh loses energy points or picks up an asset those sorts of uh things can trigger sort of a data relay on chain which then triggers a change in the in the asset State on chain and then again that whole cycle repeats uh call it every session or it can be more frequent if required and then the third approach is probably the lowest Dutch approach and not not one that we're particularly excited about but one that I think a lot of uh traditional game developers have actually been adopting because uh it's the least risky which is what you could call like an optional cosmetic mint which is everything lives off chain and then the user just has the optionality to Mint uh an asset as an nft on chain or like have some sort of game bus that lives on chain uh and very infrequently interacts with the blockchain this by the way it from all the conversations that we've had with game studios is the most popular because it has the least user friction right an interesting conversation I had with the game developer where uh you know we were talking about like building on chain the benefits of building on chain and he comes back and says yeah that's all agreed and we would love to do that but the thing that you have to understand in game development is that every click is you have like a number of bips of churn from a user perspective and so every click I'm losing like a percentage of my users and I care about like my day seven my day one day seven day 21 retention and introducing like three more clicks drop set by an order of magnitude right um and both the first initial you know the initial two approaches that we spoke about right now with the current state of infrastructure have some of that uh that lag and introduce some of those incremental clicks which is why a lot of folks are going for this third approach and then what we argue is with the right set of infrastructure you can actually enable the first two approaches to have uh a sim a similar level of frictionlessness as as a third approach here well so you mentioned that you know this is kind of the thing that creates least friction for it for developers which means that I suppose that it means that this is probably the most popular among among uh game developers could you give a rating of you know which ones are the most popular at the moment and who you who you think are you know what do you think you know you'd bet on in the in the coming years would you think that the fully Unchained game like the Dark Forest would become a standard or would become at least ideal for a certain type of games or people would still be pretty much inclined towards approach three of you know doing cosmetic means and then maybe skins and things like that and then maybe you have a marketplace where you could trade them things like that yeah totally so I think I think there's there's two parts of innovation that are going to be somewhat Divergent but they're going to lead to a lot more users playing uh games that are at least partially on train right the First Avenue which is a fully on chain games I think what's really interesting about this this approach is that it enables a new mechanics so I think what you're not going to have here is traditional game developers who can force fit their IP or their titles onto this technology and so what we're starting to see is like a lot of native developers start to build you know new mechanics new gameplay with this approach which I think is probably like one of the more interesting things in the space the other approach I think ideally a lot of the the traditional game developers want to be building on their approach too which is like on-chain assets have the asset layer live on chain have the game Loops live off chain and have those two databases frequently communicate with each other the reason that that hasn't happened so far is like a lot of the underlying infrastructure really isn't there yet so as that gets built out I think we have two two completely different groups of people pushing the ball forward and I think like this this optional cosmetic mints approach sort of becomes less relevant over time but I is it is it true that at the moment or really at the moment the the web 2 developers who come in or trying to build games they are more inclined towards approach three or would you say that it's even if you are starting from web3 directly you would still be inclined towards going to approxy because of its Simplicity and because it makes uh their life and of course uses life easier I think it's it's more of like the the traditional developers who favor approach three and a lot of this has to do with the fact that they have a lot to lose right of course these guys have like millions of daily active users if they push the wrong thing that leads to a lot of user friction they're going to have drop off across their titles right um and again I think like as the infrastructure improves like they'll be able to find their way into bucket to overtime okay there's something that we discussing you know during the conversation earlier but maybe we can talk a little bit more about this so you know when I speak to some of the uh web developer you know web 2 Gamers and game developers they would say you know sure on-chain games are you know you have to develop a certain type of on-chain games and even if you look at Dark Forest it works because there are certain mechanics right behind it you know when you go and capture a planet it actually takes a bit of time and all of that allows you to tolerate let's say a blockchain latency right um and they would say look if I don't think that much to to to build a game you know I would rather just go with the most you know um cosmetic mint approach because I don't want to think that much just to figure out how to build my game that fits in that model so do you feel like yes you know you could build different games and games blockchains are suitable for certain types of games but do you think that that's also pushing some of these web 2 Gamers away with they saying that you look it's it's so much of mental gymnastics why would I do that yeah I mean they're not wrong right I think the the thing that's important to understand I think the the error that sometimes happens is like when one particular uh game approach gets popular everybody feels like that's the only way to leverage the online technology that happened to some extent with actually uh I think it's happening to to a lesser extent with with dark Forest um but I think again each of those approaches sort of leverages a different capability of the underlying technology and is best suited to different types of games so again like the the serverless uh the system compute which which is what Dark Forest leverages is extremely well suited to turn based games uh especially turn based games with like either you know a low number of players which is what Dark Forest has done with Seasons or fewer moves per player per game um I think the more featured games anybody building on Android 5 is not going to use that approach right but they can use they can sort of Leverage the uh the verifiable ownership programmable asset capabilities of the blockchain that's going to look totally different and then you can have the hyper casual which is all the way the other end of the Spectrum which doesn't use either of these things right uh it may not even use optional cosmetic means this may be like a totally fourth category the three that we outlined which just uses like the payments the payment rails of what building on chain enables and so I think you know the error would be sort of trying to phosphate um you know game mechanics to capabilities I think the ideal outcome is like leveraging the right capabilities for the ik mechanics right uh so this this kind of takes me to this kind of second topic which um you know you wrote about is this part two of your blog post series about the right framework for data for example launching game launching data and that's called ECS and I'll let you explain in a minute but before that I would like to ask you this question you know this is this is stuff started to come up this new time not new I mean it's actually pretty standard in in wave to gaming but um why are we hearing about this now why not like a year ago when people were thinking about blockchain games like what has taken us a year and a half to understand that you know the format is not great we should think about some different object represent representation yeah I think this is one of those things where Innovation begets Innovation right so in in in any sort of new category the first few um the first few sort of attempts are going to be uh extremely simple which is what cryptocurities was which is what to an extent XC was right um and so when you have like these very simple uh these very simple sort of uh approaches you don't need extremely complex uh back-end infrastructure infrastructure to support it but as you see like these attempts being somewhat successful at least successful in attracting folks to build more uh you know featured stuff to build uh more involved game mechanics then you sort of but then you need like the right infrastructure to back that up so I think that's that's sort of the cycle that we've gone through um it took those early shots on goal to attract folks to build uh you know more involved game mechanics which is now why I think people are starting to talk about the right underlying infrastructure to support those uh those approaches okay now tell us about ECS what it is and uh why we should uh care about it yeah totally so I think a lot of folks who are familiar with traditional game development will uh will instantly know what ECS is but ECS is essentially an architectural pattern uh that's used in traditional game development uh and sort of the the core functionality of ECS is that it separates uh data from execution or it separates data from Behavior and what this means I think the best way that the best way to understand it is to understand like the constraints that traditional object-oriented programming has with uh especially as you have a lot of entities being built uh within a certain ecosystem and especially as those entities start to have more inheritance links um you then run into problems the the traditional problem in oop is called The Diamond problem and that that sort of problem has to do with the inheritance pattern as you have more objects being created right and so the simplest way to understand is like let's say you have uh some class A which is the parent class for some class B and some Class C right and then you have uh some object D that has the probability properties of both B and C right and so then you have this uh conflict of inheritance which is like which branch of the tree is that deriving inheritance from and how do you um you know how do you differentiate that as you you know when you want to call on that object and so what ECS says is well let's not take this inheritance approach let's sort of separate the data from the behavior right and so ECS is built around is it stands for entity component system which is uh the the three sort of categories within uh the architectural pattern so what entities are is uh data list containers right and so you can think about this as some object or some asset like let's say um let's say you have some character a which is represented by an entity now rather than that character a inheriting trades from uh you know multiple classes above it you have this uh separate uh data layer which is the component right and so what what components are is dataful structures which can be attached to entities to give them Behavior right so let's say I have a character that can fly in that can swim rather than having that character inherit inherit rates from uh you know the fly and swing classes you can have these uh you can have science swimmers serialized components that can then be attached or unattached from The Entity to give it uh Behavior and so this as you can imagine gives a lot more modularity in like you know how do I attach Behavior to my entity it's as easy as adding or removing a component um and then what systems are is essentially just um the the underlying code that can execute against the component so cause a change in a component either it can remove a component add a component change the behavior of a component and therefore change the behavior of the underlying entity a quick quick one so this is a standard uh that I guess Unity uses at the moment correct yeah so it's it's a it's a standard that's available on several blockchain engines so this is this is one of the approaches to building traditional games correct sorry sorry go ahead yeah no so that that's sort of the high level overview and I think you know as you start to understand that concept you can start to understand why it can be valuable in the blockchain context right um and would you say that ECS would be more interesting uh and of course it may or may not make sense if you're doing cosmetic myths only right so I suppose it's most beneficial if you're building a fully on-chain game uh and you have to read data write data and you know all that correct yeah I think I think it's actually very valuable both for fully launching games as well as for on-chain assets and I think for different reasons right so in for the on-chain games it's it actually serves some of the purposes as it does in traditional games which is you know very strong game Loop management right so every uh you know every entity that you see on your screen is can be represented uh as some sort of uh you know some sort of entity on chain and so now you have much better like game logic management uh with with fully charging games with on-chain assets it becomes I think the same framework is extremely extensible to that right because you can actually have your underlying characters your underlying assets be entities and then you can toggle Behavior based on the components that you attach or remove from it and tell us a little bit about your work on the uh sort of building this framework for Solana game developers I'll push to that page as well yeah you know you can actually scroll down this article it should be it should be here as well um yeah so so the framework that uh we proposed which is um you know something that they can be leveraged by anyone it's all open source um is it's called Arc which stands for Action registry and core which is sort of inspired by the ECS framework so you sort of have three contract types with an arc that that sort of Leverage The the benefits of ECS right so you have the the core contract which essentially the purpose of the core contract is to act as a database for entities so all of the entities live within this this database and can be queried from this database um you then have the Registries which are essentially like governance systems and what what Registries do is uh sort of dictate who can and cannot uh change the state of a component within a specific entity and that that leans into the action which is the action through the line code that executes chain components within specific entities so what happens is um and and you can sort of Envision this for fully launching games and foreign assets and in the case of fully on chain games uh the action sort of sits at the the client SDK level and then on chains is like in this consider like the the data relay that we were talking about earlier it can sit at that level so uh whenever there's a change in game State that's caused by gameplay what happens is uh you know whatever whatever sort of database you're using to execute changes in game state so this can be like the game server in the case of on-chain assets this can be uh the client software in the case of fully on chain games we'll essentially query the state of uh the underlying entities from the core contract and then what happens is when um you know a game State a game State transition is initiated the registry essentially confirms that that action based on the governance parameters has been authorized to make the change to that component right so let's say like you know you're playing a game on unreal and there's some underlying character where you know the energy points go up and down based on specific game outputs what the address you can do is like verify that this is the actual server that based on the governance parameters of that registry is authorized and made changes to the components associated with that entity and so once it um you know once it uh validates that you then have like the state changes happening at the core level uh within the end within the components within the entities that are stored in that database and I suppose this uh I think I saw the link but I suppose this entire repo is public so people who want to use the entire framework they could use it yeah it's totally public open source like the our goal from this was just to offer you know this is something that we got interested in as you know there were a few folks in their free time on our team was starting to just experiment with building on chain games and yeah our goal from this is just to sort of push the space forward and um you know help folks who want to build games plus uh now let's let's move away from let's say uh this data representation and how you could make uh you know your blockchain games better particularly launching games better uh what about the other let's say ancillary infrastructure you know for example let's say if you know if you're playing something like Dark Forest you know you have uh to sign you know transaction every time you make a move and dark force kind of gives you a way where you know it's kind of a hacking I suppose I don't know what took um but to put it basically you have a private key somewhere and you authorize that uh your browser to basically sign on your behalf essentially uh but you believe that they're they need there's a need to build better uh wallet support but other infrastructure that needs uh that could enhance the experience I would say for game developers and game users yeah absolutely I think that's one of the the biggest sort of needs in the space right now this goes back to the point of time earlier the biggest complaint that game developers who understand Gamers have is that the level of friction is just too high if I need three clicks to do in an on-chain game what I could do with one click in an off-chain game all those benefits that I can get from building on chain are sort of mood right the value of those is far less than what I would lose by having those friction points and so I think like a lot of work that's happening around account abstraction a lot of work that has already happened around abstracted Key Management like all of these things become increasingly important in delivering an experience to users that feels a lot closer to what what they're traditionally used to and then you you can offer like the the higher touch more involved approach for folks who are you know who care more about like the key management who care more about the the security and all of those sorts of things uh so yeah absolutely I think that's one of the most important things and I think I'm assigned to see like a lot of movement uh in that direction I think people are building these uh what some may call session wallets uh particularly for games where you'd start a session so basically when you start up a game uh session get started and you have this key that is there and you can use that key to basically sign transactions uh and in the end uh if you don't want uh to have your assets in depth let's say for example you've got some nfts or you minted some some tokens these nfts then move back from your session one or two much safer wallet but again you could make it the whole experience is even better with something like account abstraction so people are definitely building but is anything beyond what do you feel like there's anything else that is missing something that is beyond data infra but uh at the I guess at the ancillary level if you see what I mean like like yeah I think one thing that a lot of people don't talk about is is the Innovation that's starting to happen around mobile like if you look at the the share of revenue for traditional games a large portion of it comes from mobile and this has happened over the last like 10 years or so right and I think a lot of what today's infrastructure enables is strictly browser-based um and as you have stuff like you know the Solana mobile uh stack which you know has can have like a key management um you know in in the core of the uh of the chip of the phone where you don't really have to care about uh managing your your private keys that unlocks like a totally different experience for users right and as even more people and you know that's that's going to serve a subset of games but as people start building infrastructure that's more mobile friendly um I think we're going to start start to see a lot um lower bar for adoption now we're talking about the chains itself right so I mean of course they have you know chains like Sedana that can offer you sub second uh latency but most chains you know I would say have this latency of about one to two seconds right um and if you all let's say building a blockchain game um as a game developer what and also as you know given the space what is a reasonable you could say ask uh from a from a chain what's what's something that you know acceptable of course and if you say okay give me instant uh latency that's probably not possible what's uh what's the reasonable ask of from a game developer and what what we can provide them yeah I mean I think again as as you as we take like an infrastructure first approach right the answers to just always have more right to have faster finality to have uh you know faster execution more transactions per second right um I think there's a there's a lot of great work that's going on to make that happen uh so I I don't think there's a I I think this is gonna be one of those things again where like Innovation begets Innovation so as you have faster settlement you'll have uh you know new mechanics that weren't possible before that'll start to be experimented with uh in the interim I think what will happen is again depending on the type of game you may just have folks that uh where the user touches a blockchain less frequently so this is like the on-chain assets approach right um and then I think there's a lot of really really smart people working towards making the core infrastructure faster and as you start to see more of that you'll have I think more interesting mechanics available in like the fully online approach where you could where you can now manage like more moves per second or more players playing simultaneously um I think it's going to be very much like an iterative process let's take another um sort of critical I guess take on this so some people would say okay or even some game developers would say okay uh you know change albums are okay but you know I need I need more customization for my own channel historically right you know if you look at crypto kitties as well even though they start in ethereum they ended up building flow axi Infinity the second I would say wave off uh Gamers uh they started on their own chain they feel like um you know games are better suitable for L1 uh or you think they would enjoy you know their own space uh as a as a let's say subnet or an L2 or an L3 whatever we call it do you feel what's what's an ideal platform you think uh from your perspective yeah I think I think that's going to be like very game specific a lot of folks will make varying trade-offs I think the one thing to consider when you go spin up your own chain and I think this can be mitigated to some extent by like the new technological developments that are starting to happen um around proof-based settlement and those sorts of things but in a traditional consensus approach like the thing that you really need to start thinking about which I don't think most game developers are well suited to be thinking about is um managing Economic Security it's like a completely different settlement there right um and a lot of folks do this by like sacrificing security to some extent which is okay um but as uh you know as the underlying infrastructure becomes more performant I think a few Folks at least maybe more incentivized to you know stick with settlement layers that are more economically secure right and this also something that I noticed right which is something you most games have a shorter lifespan right if you look at D5 you know if you start a different application the goal at least intention is to have it there forever right while um even in the web 2 Gaming space most of the webto games have a very short lifespan right they're people who want to play with it for a while because there's a hype and you know other people play it and then after a while it actually dies right uh because the marketing isn't there or the hype isn't there and even if you look at some of the blockchain fully launching blockchain games like let's say Dark Forest right uh many of these games kind of run in rounds where you know or seasons whatever you call it right you start a game around and you play for a while and then after let's say a week or you basically tally this course and you declare the winner and then you kind of move on to the next round so do you feel like this this this kind of ephemeral nature of blockchain games uh do they require any special platform you feel or you feel like no they could either be on a general purpose and one or it could be you know any shame that they like but my feeling is that if you start with let's say if you're building a game of that kind and if you let's decide to build your own chain and uh then you have to someone maintain it right and imagine a game that only lasts for let's say three months or four months you know somehow you have to go and figure out a new game which of course you do but do you feel like platform has to offer something different to some of these game developers yeah I think so I think a lot of a lot of the infrastructure we talk about is like somewhat horizontal when you talk about like better Key Management when you talk about account abstraction when you talk about like data Frameworks to to organize like game Loop logic to organize asset level a lot of those things are pretty horizontal um there may be like some degree of customization that happens but I do think like a lot of that should be on the game developer Side based on you know the available infrastructure um and then and then I do think I totally agree like most there's very few Evergreen titles in the history of the the games industry and so there will be a lot of churn um and you know I think I think my my broader approach is like especially for folks building individual titles it makes very little sense to be their own infrastructure provider for folks building like you know uh a whole Suite of titles they may want to take on that additional risk of offering Economic Security of the settlements there uh and those sorts of things but I think yeah beyond that totally agree with you in that um you know building the underlying infrastructure shouldn't be the job of the game developer okay so I think we are towards the end of the discussion and this interview so let's ask the one last question which is something we call all for you so basically any alternate view that you think is something controversial something that you feel very strongly about but most people disagree with you or how most of you feel like no you're crazy or something so is this something that you feel very strongly about uh especially the gaming sector that you feel like it you know it would be better if people had focused on this idea or I think I think the one maybe I I don't know how contrarian this view is but I think a lot of people sort of take blockchain gaming as a given right and you see this from like Studios you see this from investors you see this from a lot of folks in the ecosystem where there's a lot of underlying assumptions that this is obvious um you have a lot of folks just throwing the name around and saying we're building games on chain it's going to happen it's going to be huge in the next you know six to 12 months 24 months whatever I think there's a lot more deep thinking that's required uh to actually have that be the case uh then a lot of people assume when they first start um and so I think like the one the one view that I have that I think is is critical for a lot of people at least spend some time thinking about is like really deeply understand like what the specific game mechanic that you know that specific developers building around what underlying you know property the technology is well suited for that and Bill very specifically along those lines the I think the error that's occurred in in the ecosystem because of these assumptions is that there's been at least over the past year not So Much Anymore a lot of available capital for anybody who you know through those words around and so there's been a lot less deep thinking and a lot less like assume success than I think uh yeah and I think is apparent so anyway that that's that's not like the most um positive note to end I think there's a lot of potential obviously but I think it requires like some very deep thinking um and iteration to make things actually work well thank you very much for your time it was great uh having you here at ulti on ulti and uh yeah very very good to have a chat with you on Orange in gaming and you know more generally the space as well so thank you very much for your time and uh it was lovely having you here likewise thank you for having me [Music]
