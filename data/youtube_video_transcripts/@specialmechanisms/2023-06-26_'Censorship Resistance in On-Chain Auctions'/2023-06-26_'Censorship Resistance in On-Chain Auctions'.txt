our focus is going to be on on-chain auctions and whether censorship can warp the equilibria of OMG options and cause some issues and you'll see what I mean by those issues in a second so let's just talk about some motivation here why do we care about auctions on chain first of all auctions extremely versatile mechanism and it's kind of slots into whatever you want to do in financial Market design so even just the central limit order book is sometimes called a continuous double auction right we also have even already on chain we have art gobblers with their uh variable rate gradual docs options we have maker and Euler with liquidation options in some ways nav boost is an auction that doesn't run directly on chain so these are kind of existing mechanisms one thing I want to point out is that we've been talking about lvr in our own research group a lot lvr is loss versus rebalancing it's kind of one of the reasons that liquidity provision on an amm is maybe pretty bad for the ability providers so we think if you start the block off with an auction that allows you to capture the lvr then you take the proceeds of that auction and give it back to the LPS that can start to heal some of the ldr issues that are causing a lot of the even swap fund on Twitter okay so that was kind of the direction that we started this with is how do we hold a starter block option to capture all the other I think we moved it in that direction so why are we talking about censorship because if you censor bids from other people who are bidding for competing Vetters it becomes easier to win the auction and you can win the auction for less money okay and we have off-chain agreements like Med boost that allow you to pay the proposer to censor other people's bits what do I mean by that if I win the Block in the Meg boost auction I can make sure that only my bid gets in and then I'm going to win the auction for free or at the reserve price nobody else is going to get to bid so that's kind of the main question that we're going for here okay let me get into the model here so a simple model of an auction I want to go over this because not everybody uh maybe it's an auction burst but we're going to have n plus one buyers for an object okay each of these buyers is going to have a private value and that's drawn from a known distribution what's going to happen the seller announces that I'm selling the item then all the bidders are going to submit their bids and their tips so a little bit of a Point here is that the tips are going to be public tips are always going to be public but we're kind of giving the auction the benefit of the doubt and saying the bids are actually private so you can do this with a commit reveal scheme you can do this with some more fancy ZK stuff and I'm sure the cartographers cryptographers here have a lot to say about there's a ton of ways to do this but we're giving the option all the bids are perfectly sealed but the tips are not okay and then we're going to select the highest bid and then for those of you who haven't seen set price auctions we're going to take the second highest beta as the price that the winner pays and that's just for incentive compatibility we want people to visit you guys okay I'm going to add one more thing to this model I'm going to add an opportunity to censor other people's bids and that's going to be and after all the bids are submitted uh uh extra bitter bitter zero is going to make an offer to the proposer for the proposer is the one who controls which bits get into the option because they control which transactions get into the auction and he's gonna make a take it or leave it offer and uh the money is going to accept that offer if it's greater than the tips that correspond to the bits that he's censoring Sergeant felt would you mind um if we share sweet let this one for that upstairs to look um yeah computer I want to share it to the upstairs um sure just share screen um well that's all um um questions interrupting we can do one right now uh this model will like passively assumes this for a single block now yeah so I'm gonna get I have multiple blocks later but we're gonna start with sync block just because if it affects the cloth it does affect the cost it's actually a surprising result and spoil the goodies yeah yeah and oftentimes like if you're what we're really concerned about this single block in many cases because multiple blocks is too long for high frequency and this is let me give sniper music trading we really care about getting it okay let's solve this simple model and this is going to be the only math that I make you guys do today okay we're going to do the two player Ace we're gonna do two bidders one of them is the polluting bitter looting better gets to make a bribe to the proposal to Omit non-polluting bitters so the first point here is that the tip that the non-polluting or on a spitter case has something to do with their valuation by value the item I am willing to pay more to get into the auction simple right and actually we know that the honest bidder will never pay more in tip than they value the item because if they get into the auction and they end up winning the items they value less than their tip and they've actually lost if they paid this large tip that's more than they value item so even if they want the item for free they would still not want to pay a tip Which is higher than they value okay knowingness the colluding visitor can say given the tip that I see I know that your volume is at least greater than the tip and what that allows us to do is say when the tip is less than the colluding bitter's value be zero we're going to make the bribe and we're going to open the other person's bid but when it's greater than V zero it doesn't make sense to do that and so it's a simple best response and that's going to allow us to write out the expected utility for the honest bidder that's going to tell us what the tip is so it's t the probability that you win the or the probability that you're included times your expected Revenue if you are included which is you win every time minus the tip that you make so just reformatting that into a simple quadratic equation T V1 minus t squared take the derivative set it equal to zero and I promise this is all the math we're going to do V1 minus two t equals zero T equals V one over two so I submit a tip which is half of how much I value okay now we get to the non-mathly part um what does this mean what like how do we see what happened here first of all in equilibrium the the bidder you value the item is only winning three-fourths of the time whereas without censorship they've been waiting all of the time so one-fourth of the time we have somebody winning the auction who didn't value it so that's a loss of efficiency and the language you opt to do um one-fourth at the time we have or the proposer is extracting actually a lot of value here they're extracting 1 4 which is the expected tip because either the honest bidder is paying the tip or the dishonest bidder is paying abroad the same amount as the tip and that means that the so this is like Med clearly right because the proposer is getting minor expected value of 1 4. and this is a lot if you look at the kind of expected value of the option so the revenue of the auction for the person who's holding his way down that's not great um in fact we'll see later that it's almost as if the uh proposer is running the auction as the number of bidders increases and the tip function this is an important point for the cryptographers and it's not going to be a fun one for you guys the tip function is invertible so we can even though the bid is uh private the tip is public we can use the tip to back out your bid this uh kind of destroys The credibility of the option it actually kind of raises the question of whether um privacy and bits matters so much because we have the potential that the public tips which are associated can reveal information about the product that's okay have some more math here but I'm gonna skip through in the interest of time and show you the results Instead This is for the gunplayer case um as you can see the expected total tip so this is inversely proportional to the probability that the dishonestator wins so as you can see as n increases the uh which is the number of bidders the probability that the dishonest bidder wins the auction is going way up why is that because the tips are going down okay so as we add more competing honest bidders the dishonest bidder does even better the minor does even better with a proposer I should say and we've kind of arrived at a point where we don't even have an auction anymore because you can see this is turning to zero um there's kind of no reason to hold an option at that point um so that's the single block case when we talk about this real quick this is just with a bunch of other distributions just to share the robustness of that previous result as you can see this is kind of trending towards zero with a bunch of different wacky distributions beta distributions over here same results okay so it wasn't just the uniform so now I'm going to talk about holding it over multiple slots right we would think that if we hold it over multiple slots we're gonna get more security and we do but actually let me do the next slide first unless the number of blocks grows faster than the number of bitos censorship is still profitable and the auction still breaks down so I'm jumping around a little bit here but be point to see here is that this total tip function is decreasing sublinearly so it's like decreasing really really fast and so if I add more blocks I get kind of a Linear Security but this overpowers it and that's the intuition let me go back to the more formal stuff basically um we're gonna make a slightly modified assumption here and I'll explain that this is okay to do we're going to allow the colluding base distribution to be a little bit wider from zero to K where K is greater than m and that is going to allow us to cover the equilibrium from the signal wall case what is that n is the number of blocks so now I before I had one block now I have unblocks and uh you know if you want to see this this is maybe the trickiest result in the paper if you want to see more about it's in the paper but it's also the most surprising result that kind of this eventual censorship resistance that we get from liveness that's the definition of liveness right isn't fast enough in practice to hold an auction um so if you have you know a large number of expected bidders you probably don't want to hold an auction on an ethereum or something uh or you are going to need to have a ton of ton of vlogs um so that's I think maybe one of the biggest takeaways of the paper now I'm going to talk about okay since running it over multiple blocks in work maybe we can try something else maybe we can try multiple concurrent proposers and this is an idea that I'm really excited about life is really excited about I think even Anatoly from Salon is a bit excited about it too so here's how it's going to work it's not just going to be we submit one tip we're going to submit a conditional tip Little T which is much less than Big T and they're going to be in a pair Little T is going to be paid if more than one of these concurrent proposals include the transaction Big T is only paid if a single proposal includes and everybody else commits it and what this is going to do it's going to set up a kind of prisoner's dilemma here's the um The Game Matrix the payoff Matrix in the single uh in the two proposer case okay if if you know business dilemma this looks kind of exactly like that okay let's think about what we have to do as a sensor in bidder if we want to Broad the proposer to like knocking through the bid we have to get this up to greater than capital T otherwise we're still going to end up at this equilibrium so we need to pay at least capital t to both proposers so what happened here is the honest bidders are paying Little T but the dishonest bidder has to pay at least n the number of concurrent proposers times Big T so we get much much more security for a lot less of a cost okay so okay I promise no math so we'll we'll see that one bitter zero so this is kind of solving the full equilibrium of the multiple proposal game here's the takeaway bitter zero doesn't bribe the proposers ever instead they just compete in the auction good all bidders pay zero in tips on the path which is really good because they're not you know giving any d and the equilibrium tips don't reveal bits so the cryptographers they can keep showing their audience okay one more thing I want to talk to you guys about which is how do they actually do this last slide so The Duality team has been kind of hacking hard on this and I think maybe if you asked to read you would say that multiple contractual process is really hard I think we maybe disagree a little bit here's a pretty simple and practical way to get multiple posters so we're gonna kind of take Tinder in as a base and before anything happens you've heard of we're going to have all the people on the committee who are not the leader submit a special bundle of transactions and those are the bids that we're talking about and then we're going to require that the leader includes at least two-thirds of these bundles otherwise the block is invalid so in order to make a bowel block you have to basically provide the censorship resistance and then just the takeaway from that is if you want to make a block that omits a transaction um it's very hard if it was included in greater than one-third if the stake weighted bonus okay that's my last slide I don't know how much time we have left but happy to take any questions if I have time just a note of anyone who cannot see this screen um all the slides are of only hacking these so any questions Princess uh one question I think would be that would be interesting for you to speak to that we've spoken about before but I think it's just interesting for now in the multiple uh proposes secret sequential proposes um result you have a different value distribution for the censoring bidder versus the like normal bidders um and it's much much larger which intuitively seems like it might like support you in getting this result does it still holding at the same distribution for all the bidders yeah so there's actually a footbed in the paper about this um thanks for asking it's a really good question um you can do it with uniform01 here's the issue because um so if I've end blocks I'm multiplying the security of the tip by m because the driving dinner has to pay the first proposer and the second proposer all the way up to n so they have to pay a tip of M times t remember we said that the tip was actually decreasing um super linearly so overall the expected tip is still going to be less than one as long as and uh stays lower than n but the issue from an analytical perspective is that we really want this uniform distribution this kind of constant Hazard rate and when we multiply the tips by end there's some probability that when we add up all the tips and multiply by n it's greater than one when it's greater than one there's no chance that the colluding bitter uh has a value greater than that so there's actually no probability of biome okay what does that all mean there's like some probability that the uh that increasing your tip doesn't do anything um and it actually means that you want to pay less of a tip if we did uniform zero one and that means you actually get bought out more so it's even stronger because of that yeah and there's a more detailed discussion of this in the paper but this is definitely we actually found that kind of slight issue right at the like 9 00 PM of the submission deadline so I think in the next update we're gonna we're gonna do the uniform zero one full derivation it gets a little messy there's a nuisance term but it's actually a stronger result with the zero one and then uh I guess another question about the assumptions you're making these results uh so as I understand it the reason that as a number of bidders increases it like doesn't really actually favor the the bidders is because you have this kind of like um tragedy of the commons um arising from them when no one wants to Bear the brunt of outputting the centering bidder but doesn't that does that rely on the bidders knowing how many other bidders they are and what do you think changes if people don't know n I mean if you don't know then you probably have a prior over end so you probably expect n is somewhere in the region of 100 right like the 105 that might so you're probably going to get kind of a similar result maybe a little more messy analytically um yeah let me speak to that tragedy in the comments real quick because it's an important tool for understanding this um if everybody's so if I submit a higher Tiff as an honest bidder I'm actually helping all the other honest bidders but helping the other other audit Spinners get into the auction is worse for me so um that's that is a force along with the fact that kind of there's more bidders in so I'm likely to win the option at a higher price uh if I do win means and I'm also less likely to win the auction is a bit more videos as well so there's like all these forces driving together and that's why we get that super linear reduction and expected tip and that's why we see the colluding bit everybody the auctioneer um the part where you show that person is dilemma you're assuming that the posers don't collude yeah is there any way to do that practically yeah I mean well in some ways we have already a baked an assumption that if the blockchain is working then the proposers then not greater than uh one-third of the proposers are Byzantine so that's a bit of Kappa let me say in terms of like a game theoretic situation right we have repeated prisoners dilemma we have folk theorems about this um there's kind of a trade-off between how often this game is repeated and how high the payoffs are that um tell you whether you can have a Tit for Tat equilibrium or whether you can have a full colluding equalizer like that and if you look at ethereum actually the rate at which proposers are matched against the same committee is pretty low right just because there's so many nodes if you look at tender men 150 no that's right that's no that is that's a lot more likely that you're going to have the repeated prisoners dilemma and a lot more likely that you're going to be able to see kind of collusion equilibrium sustained so I think but also another thing to keep in mind is that if 40 of them notes are controlled by Lido that argument that there's a ton of nodes and so they're likely to meet each other again is kind of falls apart a little bit unless there's any other questions thank you guys [Applause]
