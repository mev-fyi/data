[Music] read on is a decentralized Content distribution platform that seeks to help users access quality content efficiently and freely and break information silos and explore a real new world first to read on will bring a new experience of content consumption read on created incentive mechanism for users curators and content creators along with a unique topic bound nft design we believe this design will improve the quality of content that users see second read-ons product format is composable in the future read-on will also launch plugins that help creators readily claim their ownership of content produced on web 2 social media platforms like media these contents can be used by all media D apps and can be used to feed Revenue directly into the Creator's wallet without the need for Creator media connection finally we have a clear understanding of our business model thanks to our team's experience in the past the successful startup experience from day one we have been thinking about how to build a new advertising Paradigm in web3 and become the primary source of income for read on so the past the six months have been very exciting Journey for a read on we won the award during the Solana Riptide Global hackathon in July we completed the complete 2 million seed round left by 7x we released the read-on soul card mint campaign in August generating their first web3 profile SBT for tens of thousands of users and bringing over 30 000 community members to follow us we will first release a mobile app which is under intense development right now and will soon begin Community testing first of all we will work with paid content providers on web2 like Wall Street journals New York Times and medium so nft owners will enjoy a collection of paid content secondly we aim to be the next big player of online advertising on web3 thanks to our reward mechanism we know whether users have finished some contents and more importantly it is bounded to a wallet address it will be a great idea to airdrop to these wallets it's a similar concept with YouTube's true feel for videos which shows great success also content is naturally connected to interests we could provide web 3 interest the targeting which should be a feature that most advertisers would like to have the core mechanism of read-on is based on the design of topic Bond nft users will need to own and then have tea to start getting rewards and it is the core Assets in the token economy to absorb token liquidity and every nft is bonded to a specific topic which gives users the right to govern the corresponding sub-community and collect incentives from the growth of the community there are three tiers for the nft to develop each tier will unlock different mechanisms the first tier is for basically the enthusiastic readers they will get more reading rewards if the content they read matches the topic of the nft the second tier is designed for Community managers who vote and find the best content the third tier is designed for Community creators new topics are proposed by these people as a Content platform growth strategy is always around content we will focus nft owners as shareholders who can collect more rewards through govern to earn so they have the incentive to roll the community they would invite experienced and famous authors to join the community create greater content by themselves or change the ranking or distribution logic we are also experimenting with important users interests and influences on different topics into web 3 in the form of Soul Bond nft as a way to provide better recommendations to the users in the future in read on there are clear governance goals and scenarios users with the different tiers of nfts will be involved in the recommendation process and the generation of new topic communities first the read-on has the true read mechanism which is used to generate reading tokens through actual reading Behavior it is used to optimize the quality of the content recommendation Network secondly redon will incentivize curators and bind the revenue of curator's work to the community success forming a positive feedback Network finally radon has a clear external value input advertising scenarios and paid content will provide positive Revenue stream for the entire economic model we used to ask ourselves if we were among the best of teams when we were doing the redone project and the answer is yes our founding team includes engineers and product leaders from web 2 social giants like Tick Tock Pinterest and uh shoot hotel which is the largest web to read to earn project was about 30 million daus the team includes machine learning experts from the natural language processing lab of Carnegie Mellon University who are experienced in content understanding and distribution and is also supported by growth hackers who assisted Step n and steemit along their Journeys [Music] 7x and US often meet in the Common Ground about fundamentals and long-term topics it's a really nice experience redon's goal is to participate in the changes that will happen in the blockchain world over the next decade maybe even two decades and to bring differentiate of value to its users we see 7x holding the same philosophy they're really helping entrepreneurs accomplishing something different in addition to financial supports they're also bring us a lot of help in financial planning positioning and token economy design choosing 7x as the lead investor is also choosing a partner who will move forward together on this path with us
