thank you all for coming for the invitation I'm Sam Hart I work at skip protocol which is a Mev company that works in primarily in the cosmos ecosystem but kind of in the application specific ecosystem more broadly I have a really quiet voice so maybe you all can can quiet down because I'm not gonna be able to compete with you uh so just a over overview the talk I'm going to say a little bit about Skip I'm going to talk about how to make off-chain out actors more accountable that's kind of the the thrust of this talk and then I'm going to give in here in real life analogy talk about kind of an accountability framework that I've been thinking about and speak about some applications that we've been working on at skip so um there's a little bit about skip like I said we primarily work in the cosmos ecosystem application specific ecosystem more broadly we build Mev and ux solutions for application specific blockchains and we we do that kind of all along the transaction supply chain so we have an order flow solution which today does cross-chain routing and Dex aggregation and we have a block space solution which is kind of like a combination of um PBS and Pepsi with actually you know even more features it includes things like Lanes in protocol Oracle uh we actually have a variety a few more markets that different chains can can select from uh I think we're gonna have the first credible Mev auction with uh multiplicity or like multi-proposer um uh consensus and then like I said pepsi-like commitments we actually have things that are even more powerful than Pepsi where the entire chain can um can basically require proposers to commit to certain commitments and then I'll talk a little bit about uh this relayer jobs board the the notion of a relay is a little bit different in Cosmos it's actually kind of a bridge uh an entity that varies transactions uh over IBC and just generally how I think about this is like we um we're kind of building connective tissue between users and chains um and then we also are are thinking about kind of order flow that exists between different chains and so this is kind of where the the IBC Network comes in as this like standard message and uh and proof protocol so um you all have heard a lot about intents today but uh the kind of working definition I'll use here is is uh basically one where uh intents are introducing a degree of Freedom um into the into the system and asking solvers to to leverage that degree of freedom to improve some condition of satisfaction that could be efficiency ux something else by doing this we introduce a principal agent problem with the solver and the options that you have on the table to kind of minimize the principal agent problem are to you know reintroduce constraints um to change the information structure of uh the relationship between principal and agent change the payoff structure or to turn it into an iterated game and I'm not going to address these like explicitly but like the general shape of what I'm describing like kind of touches on on all four um this is okay so this is a just IRL analogy the restaurant industry this is all of the bagel shops in New York City and I want to just use this as an example of like a an intent satisfaction framework um so um if you walk into a bagel shop in New York you're pretty much guaranteed to get a high quality product you know fast service no matter where you go like there's there's kind of bounds on like how bad a bagel you can get in New York City um and so why why is this what's going on here and we can kind of like just track the the kind of Market structure to understand a little bit more about what's going on so first of all customers have repeat interactions with the establishment like with the bagel purveyor the restaurants themselves rely heavily on reputation to to attract new business so like Yelp reviews and word of mouth and things like this um the restaurant the restaurants also enter into long-term relationships with the service workers like their their working contract they have personal relationships you know coming to work every single day um and then there's a managerial structure that that kind of oversees the the quality of service the quality of the product that they're producing and then moreover customers actually have a direct relationship with the the service workers they they tip them they have personal interactions so there's like there's long term relationships and kind of incentive structures that that like hold all of these actors together and what I'm going to kind of posit here is that maybe not for every single incentive game every single kind of intent satisfaction system but for like but for some intense satisfaction systems we could actually have a very kind of like uh diverse robust set of actors that are involved in in satisfying intents um you know it may not may not like track into this like hft top of block auction but like for a lot of other stuff I think that we can we can make it look a little bit more like a New York City Bagel map um so this is kind of like one of the key Frameworks that I'm I've been working with here and I've been um so I actually outside of work I I do a bunch of writing with this uh this research group called other internet and we've been doing going kind of pretty deep into the um the kind of institutional Theory literature and so some of this is kind of drawing from that uh and basically there's kind of a notion of accountability that that exists in institutional theory that has two parts answer ability and enforcement um first off I'll kind of just read this uh this definition of accountability so a is accountable to B when a is obliged to inform B about A's past or future actions and decisions to justify them and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct and there's a lot here but yeah this is kind of you can kind of separate it into the notion of answer ability answer ability and enforcement so a lot of the uh the kind of mechanism design that we have we're familiar with in crypto really focuses on enforcement you know the bread and butter is like you put up a bond you make it slashable under some conditions um there is also kind of uh you know the opposite of this you can reward good behavior the answer ability portion is really kind of underexplored in my opinion and um yeah so the the kind of way that this is is understood and in literature is like a responsibility to explain or Justify a behavior so that requires attributability and this kind of means of justification um and so uh the you know we're just completely unfamiliar with like Builders trying to justify why they were doing X Y or Z they're just kind of uh you know they are completely fungible actors from the perspective of the protocol and that kind of um misalignment in the assumption that the protocol is making is is allowing Builders to to really kind of come to um you know become dominant entities so anyway the uh accountability kind of like brings these two concepts together so um answerability kind of substantiates enforcement um you know if you have the attributability and the kind of justification you're able to tell whether you should enforce or not and enforcement obliges answer ability like you're you're saying that I'm going to enforce if you don't answer to um the accountability structure that I'm putting in place so you know this is how every institution in the world exists if we want to model this for uh for our off-chain actors then we can think about so I'm going to kind of contrast this with like a user interacting directly with a chain which we're kind of it's very rare that this happens these days but um it's a helpful kind of Benchmark so if the user wants to interact directly with a chain they're uh there's no delegation whatsoever you know and there's no basically the user needs to be accountable to themselves the protocol needs to be accountable to itself however if the user wants to delegate some responsibility to a third party so the solver here you know they're they're delegating this capability and then in order to kind of overlay the correct accountability structure they need to delegate the answer ability to the solver so the solver needs to answer to the user or to the protocol and then the user is also delegating the enforcement mechanism to the chain um and this kind of uh this enforcement answer ability Loop that exists between the chain and the solver is what allows the user to have comfort you know making this delegation um alternatively so typically when we I think when a lot of people are talking about intense they're they're talking about like okay the user is allowing for extra degrees of freedom in the execution of their transaction however you can also invert this and say actually what's happening is the protocol is allowing for a wider range of uh of possible execution paths and they are the one that's delegating that responsibility these are these are kind of like equivalent statements and you can formulate a kind of accountability system that that works with either of those and it's just a helpful kind of like that inversion I think is helpful um in a lot of the things that we're doing with our our protocol design which is um uh you know oftentimes giving you know applications more agency over their own protocol or their own transaction supply chain okay so just like zooming in even further um this accountability Loop um exists between there's always this kind of like uh countervailing Force in the opposite direction so if if a solver is kind of answering for um uh the satisfaction of some intent they're you know they have answer ability going in the direction of the chain the chain is enforcing the correct satisfaction of that intent well on the other side what's happening I mean there's there's a contract between these two the chain and solver you know an implicit contract and the chain is answering to the solver they're saying I'm going to compensate you for this the solver on the other hand is enforcing uh is is enforcing their behavior by basically like threatening to exit the system so I'll leave if you know and I I won't build here anymore if you don't satisfy it if you don't compensate me properly um yeah so uh this is just a helpful kind of like uh lens to bring to protocol design and I've just found it very useful in kind of uh breaking down and and kind of composing a supply chain um so this is one project that we we've been working on uh it's we've been working with dydx to bring their chain to Cosmos and um so just for context the dydx has building their own causal SDK chain they have a combined mempool and order book so all the validators are uh in addition to basically they have this like they're taking in transactions they're actually doing matching um themselves and then they're they're gossiping off other transactions and they're expected to to perform this gossip and matching Behavior correctly and it's all happening off chain so um what we what we did working with dodx we decided to run a globally distributed set of nodes to collect copies of each of the validators books and um and basically uh build out this uh this kind of metric of order book discrepancy where we're measuring expected p l uh versus what we're seeing um from from the the validators that are giving us copies of their books and this isn't this is by no means a perfect solution to solving Mev however it's it's a start and it gives us one of the nice things about this is that it gives us information uh over a long time scale so we na we we don't know if validators are uh are performing any single match or gossip event correctly however you know over weeks and months we can tell if there is Divergence in the expected Behavior versus what we're seeing from validators and the kind of idea that I want to drive home here is that what this does is it is it really uh kind of presses on this notion of answerability so by giving more kind of kind of surfacing more information about validator Behavior by making validators answerable to their actions we're able to to start to bootstrap an accountability system for the validators there's going to need to be a lot more um to to really make the whole system kind of come together and be stable long term but it's a good start so this is kind of what this looks like over time this is real real data from the test net not from mainnet of course it isn't live yet uh but this green line is uh you can see dydx research they were running a node that was uh was misbehaving and you can see over time it diverges and you can kind of clearly see you know that signal um uh stands out there's a lot of like gray questions about how you actually set the threshold and like this is going to be kind of an evolving conversation that the community is going to have together and I can talk more about how that exactly is going to work if you want um one thing that's really important to to know about why this works at all and kind of what the environment looks like in Cosmos is so in Cosmos validators are known entities they're kind of branded entities I mean you could actually see um in this last like these all have names and like they're I don't know friends validator is like a the they project like a very strong like brand identity they do information you know provide informational content like they do this because they're trying to attract delegations and the relationship between delegators validators and the protocol there's actually like a through line um and like a trust supply chain that um that we can leverage in in Cosmos um so validators are a great uh candidate to delegate to because we can Leverage The the latent reputational Network within Cosmos and you know I mentioned before they're they're branded they kind of really try to differentiate from one another um and not only that but they have they have a long-standing relationship you know the validator is a long-standing relationship with protocol the delegator has a long-standing relationship with the validator so this really helps to to make sure that um that that trust supply chain is like upheld over time one of the other really interesting things uh about Cosmos is the this reputation is kind of informally transitive across the network so um those validators are branded they have this they carry over the same brand across different networks and so if they misbehave on one network you're gonna know it I mean people will call you out on Twitter basically and like talk about on the forums and that degrades their relationship across all the other networks that they're they're um that they're validating on and this is something that like is pretty widely understood in Cosmos and and one of the reasons that this notion of like mesh security which is like uh basically um enshrining this uh uh this transitive relationship into into the staking protocol is like um feels very natural for uh for people working in Cosmos uh just to like drill into this a little bit more uh Kepler which is the the kind of most popular wallet in Cosmos has this feature which is a it's kind of like friends.tech for validator delegated relationships in a way so uh if you delegate to a particular validator you can now that now opens a chat Channel with them and you can like talk to them about their preferences and like how they what what their setup looks like and like how they're voting on things and um and so this kind of just further uh reinforces the the kind of trust relationship and this kind of long-term uh yet social relationship between the uh the validator and delegator actors um so this is something that I'm working on right now uh so IBC is the kind of main bridging and cross-chain verification protocol in Cosmos it's really nice that there's a standard for this it makes things a lot easier and and it's a very robust like generalized uh framework and however I one thing that's just absolutely wild is that the entire IBC relayer network relayers are the entities that that move packets from one side to the other uh happens entirely autonomously without incentives right now there are a couple of Exceptions there are a few foundations that have kind of granted um a service contract for for relaying but basically validators do this as a way to solicit delegations so this just kind of goes to show how powerful the trust and reputational relationship is between delegators and validators that uh that validators are willing to expend resources and just pay transaction fees to ferry fare these packets across because it's like doing good for the network um so yeah kind of an incredible phenomenon however uh this structure doesn't necessarily result in like the most robust packet relay system so basically like the main channels you know osmosis to the cosmos Hub or something like that you'll get good timing guarantees and you know you can generally expect your packets to get to the other side and reasonable reasonably quick however there's a lot of inconsistent inconsistency in the network so we are we're taking a similar kind of lens to what we did with dydx and applying it to the relayer network so the first thing that we're doing is we are um we're creating kind of a shared standard this like SLA so a sponsor who might be a chain or a foundation can craft and SLA I can say Okay I want relay service that is like no greater than one minute and I want X number of relayers on this channel and they can just they can actually like basically create an objective function and uh and then relayers can bid to satisfy that objective function these are going to happen over the course of you know a month or a quarter or a year so they're gonna be like long term intents but um we think that there's there's actually like a the market structure that should exist here looks much more like a um like a utility like a public utility than it does a high frequency trading system and yeah we we think that like making it so that the relays are really kind of competing along the right uh kind of putting in putting them in the right frame of mind so that they're trying to like really optimize this SLA it can actually make it so that we can we can make it so that we can leverage their kind of Optimizer uh mentality to like focus on network robustness rather than like latency games and things like that um so yeah how do we make this a win-win for users and solvers we want to we want to make this just like a little bit less adversarial for I mean I want to kind of solve our ecosystem a little bit less adversarial that's kind of the point of application specific blockchains is you can you can actually like segment out certain application behavior and this may not hold for every single like you know if you're if you are dydx is going to be like more challenging but if you're a an application specific chain that's just doing I don't know like provisioning uh Akash for instance like provisioning like GPU resources you might get away with like a much less adversarial system um so like how how can we kind of engender this type of relationship by the way this is my favorite bagel shop and in New York um so first is we can um so one thing that's leading to this this more kind of competitive environment is that uh contention along block space is uh uh is you know the combination of content block space contention and whole block building uh introduces this monopolistic Behavior I think the last talk addressed this directly so we're we're introducing application specific block space so we have Lanes we can actually segment out the top of block from a a lane that's specifically for an oracle you know a land that's for um rest of block or eip1559 type transactions so we can actually segment out the the market structure um we're breaking the proposal Monopoly with a kind of multiplicity-like system um we can make it so right now Searchers are kind of motivated by like obviously profit but also just kind of stunts like that you see a lot of like really crazy composed transaction types and like I kind of attribute a lot of that to just like trying to make headlines or something there's like no need for a lot of this um and I think a lot I mean it's cool but I think one of the reasons that we're seeing this is there's also just like no venues to measure alternative behavior that we actually like consider to be healthy so I think we should try to make metrics and like try to praise other forms of behavior um so we obviously want to make a longer term games here so um leveraging the the delegator validity relationship like I mentioned um and making it so that off-chain actors have uh repeated interactions that that are kind of recorded by the system and they have kind of skin in the game to continue and then finally um we we just need to to kind of like uh change the narrative a little bit about like what we're trying to do so focusing rather than focusing on kind of value abstraction like value production like how can how can intent solvers actually like generate more value for users for the protocol itself how can we make it so that they're optimizing for these things how can we like really praise and uh and you know create a dashboards like metrics like things that that are really inducing them to to perform this type of like um uh you know gregarious Behavior um yeah I would think that's about it um this is my contact information if anybody's interested um we are so one of the things that's interesting about Cosmos is I mean it's very Dynamic like Rich ecosystem like a lot of differentiation in the application design that you see um one of the things that's maybe interesting for this crowd is that we are um uh well part of the Pepsi design like came out of the this paper that I wrote in Cosmos the atom 2.0 Paper so this like notion of block space features was like I came up with and um and that like has inspired uh Barnaby and some of the EF folks to like think a little bit more about these proposer commitments and we're we're actually building a lot of this and so we're going to be able to like test it in the wild and and we have like a really healthy kind of dialogue with the EF about um you know where this could go which is which is really nice to have that like uh uh I don't know Collegiate like interaction with uh with another ecosystem um yeah thanks very much it might be a mix of the questions I had for the last two but um yeah like uh it's with Pepsi it's like one of the concerns for me is um like you uh proposer could enter a commitment that's like negative for the network okay so how like I'm curious like what you think like um I guess the model might be slightly different with Cosmos but um yeah like how opposed would think about that yeah so what we're what we're starting with and this is like something that ethereum will never do could never do is basically making it so that okay there are these proposer commitments but the protocol like protocol governance um Every Chain has like top level governance basically um they uh vote on whether the validators should uh should make this commitment and then all the validators are are committed um and so that gives a lot of flexibility and and like gating to what the commitments could be uh we're going to and then one of the other things that we could do is we could actually make it so that okay the protocol governance can vote these are the these are the commitments that are like eligible to be made um so that's an easy way to experiment as well you could like turn them on and off like at the top level again not something ethereum would ever do but it provides like a really easy way to to prototype these things and it makes perfect sense for Cosmos um I have been thinking about some ways that ethereum might be able to implement this I'm going to publish an article about this relatively soon so I won't like leak too much but I think that there's some clever ways that um that uh also what are we trying to do here we're actually trying to make a we're trying to create some kind of accountability between the protocol and the proposer and what what we're actually trying to do is make it uh make it so that the welfare of users is maximized with the commitments that um that proposers are making here so we can actually frame it within this same kind of language and one one of the kind of interesting indications here is like okay well maybe users should have a say in what commitments can be made within the protocol um so that's something I've been kind of like doing toying with in the front of the presentation we use the profound loss of a validator kind of as a metric I was wondering if you have considered other metrics because that's I guess just the uh um The Profit just comes from the revenue from the delegation without the revenue from the delegation um uh yeah the revenue for the validators or it well it's the p l of the book um so yeah But to answer your question yes we've thought about some other things this is kind of the well dydx came came to us and they're like here's kind of how we're thinking about me being the system and it really like focused on p l so that that's like why why it looks like that but I think it's a good first order approximation of like behavior in the system one of the other things that we've been that we kind of suggested that's you know further down the line could be explored is uh doing kind of signed commitments to objects in the the mempool so this would look a lot like narwhal if people are familiar with that you can look at the kind of dag you look at the the mempool itself as a dag and you can actually like um understand Behavior about a transaction propagation and like withholding and whatnot through through that deck that's very much down the line I don't know if we'll we'll be doing that really interesting but in terms of the dydx like uh off chain order book like what's like the metric dicer we're trying to maximize for to kind of say this like political is honest like how exactly do you know that like your order is hit the top of the bottom of the book in general but it could be differences yeah yeah I mean I can go back to um this is like a lot of this was kind of informed by dydx so it's like some of their concerns but um uh basically it's like we can Sim so we can run nodes in the in the network and then we can like simulate we get transactions as if we're another node we can simulate what books might have looked like and what the PL p l might have looked like and then compare that to um The observed P L's that were that we're getting from validators so um that's the the general thrust of the the metrics so I guess does that kind of be more like validator like for instance we could have validate earlier it's actually not based on the on-chain commitments it's based on the these like ephemeral order books that are being shared among the validators I think it was so here's all the talks today and we will have record language thank you
