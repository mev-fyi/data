I'll just try to use eight to ten minutes to introduce what we're doing and why we're so uh I think we're one of the most supportive you know VCS in Asia to the whole Arab ecosystems and I'll tell you why uh we want to do that okay so yeah please yeah a little bit about 7x Ventures so uh we're kind of a community and research driven uh VCS that trying to bridge the Asian developers to the Western kind of you know you know infrastructures and we actually are focusing on investing into early stage and super early stage projects so basically uh for all the projects we're invested in almost I would guess uh 70 of them actually from the seed or pre-seed stage so the first round of fundraising and then uh what we're trying to do as our mission is we actually want to become the guidance or helper for all the entrepreneurs who want to actually explore something the new continents in the Webster world so basically you want to provide something that's valuable for them not only just the money for example we're actually helping them to build tokenomics and that's one of the greats I would say maybe the value we could bring to the entrepreneurs I think partially it's because right now for almost all the entrepreneurs in the Webster world they're coming from a pure Tech background uh so but like for me I'm from a tech background but I actually you know have my master and study more in a kind of like a finance background so basically I think we should combine the two kind of sets of knowledge together in order to build a great tokenomics and definitely for those people who only have economics uh backgrounds they cannot understand the basics or the the logic of of especially a tech driven company or tech-driven projects so I think that's what we are aiming for and what we're specialized at yeah please okay so uh like I said we want to build the Asian Western and the app infra Bridge uh for web3 so right now I think we already uh raised the third phone so we just closed it last week it's a 100 million fund so half of the fund will be deployed to um you know infrastructure level infrastructure projects uh I I would say that maybe I would say Western developers some more good at infrastructure projects but on the other hand the Asian developers or especially where I come from the Chinese developers are so good at building Mass adoption apps so basically another 50 will be allocated to the app developers and what we want to do from a strategic point of view is for all the infrastructure projects so we want to ask them what kind of you know ecosystem we want to build and what kind of kind of projects you're looking for so we'll introduce all the other portfolio companies from our portfolio from our investment to try to bridge them to help them to find the best you know infrastructures they could and on the other hand when we are actually talking to the Chinese or the asian-based developers we see a trend that a lot of great talents coming from web 2 to web3 and they're living web too because they're tired of you know all this you know big corporations taking charge of everything and the decision and centralization and when they come into web3 the first thing they're going to face or first difficulties they're going to face is they do not understand the full stack or the tax stack of web3 they are kind of looking for which are the best layer ones to build out which are the best layer tools or is there any databases is there any decentralized databases is there any kind of tooling that I could use so basically will give them the knowledge because we already kind of during our six years of of uh investment we're already invested in great couple of uh infrastructure projects so we'll give them kind of like a map help them to navigate okay go there and try to you know you know you know just utilize the different features some different uh you know infrastructures so right now we're managing uh 250 ml uh assets and we already have 80 plus different portfolios and like I said we already have six already more than 60 years of experience experiences and I think that's another important thing for VC that is you go through you know you already went through Windows already went through bearish market and bullish market and that's why we're not so excited about all the hives out there you know what I mean when I'm talking about the hives and you know those other ecosystems are not so organically grow going and maybe you know organized by some VCS with a pump and dumps you know kind of thing so basically what we are looking at is yeah next size yeah yeah and one thing to add that we're a huge RV ecosystem supporter we already invested in right now it's 10 but I already I just listed nine here and sorry every Finance I just don't know that you're changing to every Vision so I gotta change the slides later so yeah from the infrastructure point of view like like a Nissan Network quality Brio to apps like hard drive in accord so basically I think um that actually shows our attitude and support to the whole RV ecosystem next slides please yeah so why are we I think this is very very simple actually this slide sorry the last three slides you can you can see it it's actually from my assistant right so it's not me who's making this but this slide is actually me I'm doing this because I truly believe that why we support or we select our babies because of the three simple things one is useful right because right now when I talk like when I'm outside the door and talking to some of the other projects and they always often ask me why you're so interesting RV it's just a storage Network right so I said you're wrong you don't know you do not know that right now RV is actually a complete layer one solution you can build all types of things on RV not just using it as a metadata storage for your nft so you can you can have Atomic nfts means it's directly on Aviv you can have some more contract on office and everybody says which layer is more kind of like layer one and it's very very useful you can do all the things together on Aviv like only and also the other another one is scalable so basically everyone out there is talking about modular blockchains and talking about data availability layer everything everyone's talking about this but always actually doing this I think from like three years before or three years before right so so we already built a modular blockchain like every layer on RV is actually modular and we can support the data availability layer we actually can be the data availability layer as ourselves right so and third one is the most important thing that is organic so I've never seen a project or an ecosystem before that's as organic as RV should uh RV so basically um right now I see because I feel a little bit kind of like the vibe in the ecosystem or in the community it's kind of like the Earth super early stage of ethereum so basically everyone is working on their jobs and trying to find what is the missing link here what else should I build on top of RV and there's no competition everyone is friendly everyone's actually talking to everyone else about okay if you build that I'll go the other the other direction I don't want to compete directly with you so everyone's happy so so as an investor I do like some some ecosystem like this for example if I investing some other ecosystem I don't want to mention the name but I don't know when they're gonna dump and I don't know when they're gonna pump right although I may make money but I will not fall asleep at night because I don't know which one the bubble gonna burst right but for Aviv I can sleep sadly at night because I know that it's growing so organically that you just need to contribute to the ecosystem and it's fine and you can just go away go go together with like the growing together with the ecosystem and it's okay so that's why I think RB ecosystem is one of my best choice when I'm actually you know opening my my second found actually is when we begin to invest into RV ecosystem yeah sorry next yeah and also another thing is like uh I want to describe I believe in my mind or in our mind is um I I may want to give the definition of backbone of F3 why is I think all the webs free uh things is all about how users can control your data where the data is stored can you actually get access to your data or well someone actually steal your data or your data get lost right so basically I think obvious all about this so I want to say obvious actually the backbone of web stream because it gives you 100 to secure permanent storage of your data and I think I think you don't want to actually for some important data of yours you don't want to put it somewhere and if you've got to pay the rents you know you know which project I'm saying and then you lost your data right so so I don't want to actually store my data some networks like that so I think uh in our minds we actually think there's a lot of different layers upon RV so on the bottom is Aviv and you can have some contract layer upon Aviv and that's the most interesting thing is I know that small babies actually you know created by the team but actually Redstone is doing another very very great technology and I have never seen anything like this you know other day or ones that smart contract layer is actually developed by some other team rather than just the original team right so I think it's very interesting and also the database layer like we invested in quote DB right and upon that you have decentralized indexing and Gateway layer like what our IO is doing and option computation and scaling layer like sap like whatever finance and sorry every vision is doing and in decentralized city and layer like like missile Network and then you have two links I think um Community labs are actually more focusing on you know incubate some projects like in this layer and you have apps layer like Rio and Accord so who is building a very useful things for like like directly to the users to the end user so I think it's a perfect Tech and everybody is actually trying to fit in for their own layer and uh yeah I think that also shows us the like like like how we are mapping the whole ecosystem and how you can see you can actually name each of the project and mapping it to each of the layer right that actually shows all of our portfolios in our review ecosystem yeah and the sex I know it's short but uh welcome to the party and let's have fun uh tonight to enjoy the uh the evening thanks
