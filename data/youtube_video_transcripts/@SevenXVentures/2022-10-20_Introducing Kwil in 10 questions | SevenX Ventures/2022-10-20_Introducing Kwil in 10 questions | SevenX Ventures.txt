[Music] quill is a platform for Designing and deploying databases for data intensive daps and protocols I don't know if I would characterize quill as solving a problem as much it is more opening up new opportunities right now in web 3 for infrastructure and for building decentralized applications you have Smart contract platforms like ethereum like Solana where you can Define custom business Logic for your application deploy it and now people can just interact with that permissionlessly and then you also have protocols like are we even filecoin where you can deploy data intensive applications that contain a very large amount of data but don't necessarily contain the same like rigid rules that a smart contract has and so quill is sort of bringing both of those two into one platform where you can have the permissionless functionality of a smart contract and the data intensive functionality of something like our week or final coin and we're bringing that together with existing database engines so now you can build all these applications and you can do it with the same data stores you know SQL databases graph databases key value stores that you've been using for your entire developer career but at the same time is containing all this new functionality that's provided by web3 the main warrant for quill is in acting as an infrastructure layer for some of the newer sectors of web3 prior to about 18 months ago web3 was almost entirely synonymous with D5 you know every major application in web 3 or almost every major application was a defy application but in the last 18 months we really see web3 grow Beyond D5 into decentralized social and decentralized gaming decentralized science decentralized analytics and all these new verticals require complex and data intensive architecture to build permissionless applications on with quill while we do have a couple of E5 projects that we are working with a lot of where we're seeing traction right now are in some of these newer sectors where there just aren't any infrastructure solutions that are solving their issues and we are now coming in and being the first player that can really handle this at scale in a permissionless environment so they're really two parts to the quilt business model so there is the you know typical blockchain architecture you know blockchain price structure of quill then then there's also a SAS side sort of starting with the typical blockchain architecture that is you know when you're writing data when you're interacting with databases deployed on the network it costs you some amount of money right now what we have built is a system we can pay in with uh currencies from other chains for example in our MVP that's live right now the most common way people pay for it is with usdc on polygon so in this it's not necessarily a native token based way of paying in but you can pay in with existing tokens that then get distributed to validators on the network so that's sort of like the blockchain business model for writing data to quill but for reading data or for like very very high volume Enterprise players we also have SAS offerings so this it's a typical invoicing system a lot like a cloud provider and so I think the best way to really draw similarities to existing business models here is the writing data side of things that's like ethereum or polygon or Solano or really any blockchain where you're paying to write data but then you have gateways and service providers for reading that data from those blockchains that's like an inferior or Alchemy or Morales and over time we do hope to decentralize these and we actually already do have some partners that are working to provide like decentralized and trustless access to this data this is sort of like the business model we see ourselves taking right now as well as some more specific SAS offerings for larger Enterprise players so the cool technology it's a really cool mix of you know existing web 2 Technologies but then also incorporating some of the newer things that we've seen grow really only in web 3. so starting with the web 2 Technologies a quill does run with out of the box database engines so right now supporting postgres but then also moving to ad sport for other types of database engines in the near future we also use Apache Kafka for our event sourcing so this is more in like the traditional web 2 data architecture side of things but then on the web 3 side of things we are building a bft protocol around it where the nodes are orchestrated via tokens that are locked up in a smart contract and distributed once they perform their jobs properly for what we are providing to our customer and what's really Innovative about our solution is that it allows you to take an existing database schema so you know maybe you have five tables you deploy those to quill and then you can Define parameterized queries for those so essentially functions that indicate some sort of insert update or delete statement you can deploy those as well and then deploy business Logic for interacting with those and now you have your C equal database but it's entirely permissionless now and so we've created our own ddl language that is SQL like for defining these data structures it's based on SQL and it transpiles to SQL but the entire point of it is it makes it much much easier to Define and deploy permissionless data structures and so this makes it really really easy for developers to come on begin using quill and to make a complex yet you know very robust application very very quickly the community is a really important tool for building new tools you know new developer tools and new applications are on quill but also getting feedback on the cool protocol to make sure that you know we have a clear Direction on where we're going and you know if we need to change our Direction they let us know how we change that direction and we've actually seen this and the community is largely why we did end up pivoting from a social project to quill which was the infrastructure for that social project you know at quill we're really trying to emphasize a developer Community getting deeply Technical and passionate and just really smart developers into our community helping us to you know build the product but more importantly build the things surrounding the product and really building the ecosystem I think I have a somewhat unpopular take in the case of crypto governance or at least it was certainly on a popular take six or eight months ago I generally believe that crypto projects should have no governance or if they do need to have governance it should be heavily heavily limited especially quill it's supposed to act as a protocol you know just in the same way that HTTP is a protocol it should be something that generally does not change maybe it has upgrades maybe it has changes that you know get rolled out but there shouldn't be some governing body that's making changes on a you know month-to-month basis on this protocol because that's not a protocol that is just a software you know SAS product that you pay for with a crypto token what people typically mean when they think of like you know governance like a dow governance I think that's where you see protocols and projects have a severe misuse of uh you know consumer trust we are trying to really remove that and really just trying to have quill be be a protocol that generally does not change too much and people can plug into reliably knowing that even if you know 60 70 of people want you know something to occur it will still continue functioning in the exact same way as before right now the quill protocol does not have a token this is something that we talked about quite a bit internally but we haven't made decisions on and we likely won't make decisions for quite a while you know generally our team's view of the token is that it should serve to uh you know serve the product I think too often we see crypto projects where the product is serving the price of the token when in reality the token should be serving the product right now we have quill it stores data it has all these different functions that you know it can perform and if a token meant it could perform more functions or it could do its job better or it could do it more securely then we would add a token but for the time being with the current payment methods and incentives we have for the network we do not immediately need a token and so we don't have plans to launch one right now but we are seriously considering it in the medium to far-term Future right now quill is a five-person team we are hiring right now and we have a couple pretty awesome candidates in the pipeline so I think we're probably looking at making it a six-person team in the next one to two months the team it's a mix of younger people like myself or the two co-founders that live with me but then also a bit more seasoned and a bit more you know experienced industry professionals so I guess you know start with myself I'm the founder of studying mechanical engineering that the two co-founders one of them is Luis so he's a friend from college he has experience working in business development at database companies second on the other side is Luke he's my older brother he's been helping with everything operations legal accounting HR related the other two team members so our CTO Randall he previously assigned two startups that both got Acquired and then he spent 14 years working as a VP of SAS and platform as a service at Oracle you know he's been really awesome building out a lot of the really deeply technical parts of our stack and then our other team members and hires name is Brian very talented my research developer as well as has a lot of experience building parsers quill has quite a few backers we have top VCS as well as projects or is that are either using cool right now or seriously interested in using quill in the future the rhyme was co-led by FTX and blockchain we also had amplify Partners dcg alley Corp as well and we show 7x for two reasons we saw 7x as web 3 oriented that was also hungry enough to like help us day in and day out no matter what it was if it is marketing if it's finding new projects if it's designing our token when we've looked at economics 7x has so far been the most helpful PC for that the second reason why we chose to partner with 7x is because of their really really strong connection in Asia they have tons of connections to Asian projects Asian VCS Asian incubators I mean this has actually also been really really helpful for us so far a lot of our really awesome either Partners right now or partners that we are you know sort of in like an integration phase with were brought to us by 7x we're really happy to have them on board foreign
