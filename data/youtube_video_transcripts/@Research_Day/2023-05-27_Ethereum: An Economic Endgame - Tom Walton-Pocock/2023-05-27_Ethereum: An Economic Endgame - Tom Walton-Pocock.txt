foreign as Michael said I like to get rugged overnight uh by Justin Drake um and also by John Charbonneau um so and I'm also I'm sorry I'm in the middle of a giant it's okay sandwich attack as well um so this is nothing to do with ZK and this is geometry really going off-piste a bit and it's some very hazy guesswork about the economic end State and maybe even computational end states of the ethereum machine so the things that I want to cover today and I'm going to do this in 10 minutes this is also how the scissors on it so you can all go and enjoy the uh the the after event uh party um the things I want to cover really are some infrastructure design principles um that overlap with some sort of basic macroeconomic principles and also how um protocol Builders can continue to be economically sustainable which is going to be quite a difficult thing for people who are sort of building l2s now it is the the uh the business options that they have ahead of them and the opportunity for economic surplus are massive but you just got to stay on top of it and I want to talk a bit about that too so um I'm going to give a quick kind of sanitized where are we in history right now account of ethereum uh so um ethereum and I want to this is kind of applies to all l2s but particularly I guess ethereum was the sort of the first mover with the scaling problems suffered first um there were some Panic highlights as I call them including sharding State rent mapreduce lots of these things how on Earth are we going to scale this thing uh this gave rise obviously to um the production of layer twos um and they all scratched their heads and thought well whilst we're doing this we didn't you know we have sort of you know sort of mixed views on on evm and we have uh maybe some other machines will be interesting in trialing too so um let's let's try Cairo and maiden and risk five and Noir um and then there's all these companies that are sort of tying the state the balkanized state of these things uh back to um back to these l2s so that they can sort of reason about things that are going on in other chains and of course there's also the ZK Bridges as well doing the same thing between uh l1's and LTS so it's turned ethereum into this massive virtual microchip Factory uh it's an accelerator it's almost like a kind of it's hosting a load of startups so maybe this means long run the layer one's job in this model if it's the correct model is something like mind your monetary stability find cheap Capital validate validated Capital accumulate a lot of it store things and check proofs so as far as the infrastructure goes what game should we be playing at each layer we've got the layer one and we've got the layer two layer one I argue and I think uh John and others of experts have sit on the fence on this but I think it is playing a macro game and I don't think this is particularly uh controversial um it is after deep liquidity of the underlying asset and I'm going to explain with some correspondence to fixed income markets why actually this is quite important uh it's up to deep liquidity price stability wide dissemination wide handling of the asset because this is going to affect its cost of operation um the layer 2 is playing a slightly different game in that it probably cannot get access to candidacy as a macro asset for the native asset and so I think it is playing a slightly different game and I'll explain all this in the talk um so here's some possible layer one um design principles in the sort of hierarchy I think they should be addressed in number one is just do enough by returning cash flow through some sort of burn mechanism to the layer one asset so that you kind of you manage its Supply you make it a sort of plausible part of the military Furniture then the next thing to do is take any additional Surplus and make the aggregate number of dollars maximally available for security capital for validators and then three uh aim for low apy on that validator capital and you will probably enable essay I'll explain it later in the talk but I think you will do Best by that a very good start is stabilize the layer one assets the first thing you can do and then the second is you know sort of make the maximum number of uh dollars of cash flow available to attract lots of their capital um layer one and particularly the eip1559 debate was really interesting I don't know how many people have sort of braved um Tim rough Gardens um 40-something page report on this um but aside from the analysis of the eventual design of 1509 there was additionally uh some sort of was a section towards the back with a load of other designs that might also have been looked at at the same time one known um sort of rather grandly as the else move mechanism essentially take the um the feed that you were you're about to burn and don't burn it and send it on to the sort of the stream the next sort of L um the validators of the next L blocks and if L is sort of big then that means that the opportunity for collusion should remain relatively small so I don't want to dwell too much on that but I think we're about to revisit or have a recapitulation of a similar argument in the context of Av now um I've tried to suggest the post from Justin overnight and John's excellent thread on this and John's thread is um fast settler and far um more educated than mine uh than my my analysis will be but I'd like to actually run through um what Justin's sort of cites as the main motivations for going for a burn mechanism which is so this is kind of like the company buyback mechanism you totally return the cash to the unstaked version of the token not just the staked version of the token um and and what are the reasons for things well one interestingly is um there's a there's a concept of sort of you know reducing the the the validator account a little bit this is actually there's a very specific reason that this might be beneficial which is to promote single stock finality um there is um a sort of sense that you know sort of increasing um staking APR or sort of keeping maintaining uh sticking APR um as a consequence well I mean really I think your markets future markets if there's a good primary function there's a good ability to put money into um uh its validator form and then uh remove that money that should be a good primary mechanism to make sure that the Market's view of what a rational stake or ought to be compensated will be reflected in that eventual AP APR maybe why I should say um there is an argument around economic sustainability so this is obviously looking forward to uh dank sharding when we're going to have sort of severance of data so not every not everyone will be sorting all the data but the data is going to be sort of somewhat sharded um then there could be some revenue losses from that and this is about sort of looking forward towards compensating for that tax efficiency I'm less sure that should be a concern of a layer one uh protocols that's the kind of one of the ones I push back on um there is an argument towards economic scarcity that would have been more economics gas debit higher net burn as a consequence of burning Meb um had this mechanism being an operation today again I think sort of the deflationary asset if that is ultimately the aim is not necessarily the best way to promote an asset um either as an expression of validator capital nor which is the really important point is can it support future fixing some assets which includes Credit Systems um the there's also an argument around a try and use the count of mimetics I think we'll sort of we can skip over those but anyway that's the argument that's kind of been the 16 targets put around the Mev burn model rather than the MVP smoothing model which I think was first proposed maybe two years ago um so what about economic design at the layer two so can the layer 2 get a piece of this macro candidacy I think it's a lot harder it doesn't have canonicality in its L1 it's not actually sort of necessary to the creation of the layer 2 Network um that there should be a native asset there is ethers there as a as an expression for denomination so it doesn't have candidacy as a macro asset quite the same way there's not that sort of canonical role that it's granted there's actually no binding uh equivalents to the board shareholder relationship or any any sort of source of value value capture of cash value capture we've seen historically that ensures that there is a constant ring of margin it just doesn't really exist so I think that needs to be thought about a bit um it's typically meant to buy gas there is some history around telephone companies and um you know as we saw you know so people were using telecom companies data to build so Skype not that was necessarily in the integrate success story but that certainly was an application that had the power to price discriminate between users it could tell the difference between packets of data by definition in a way that the Telecom couldn't I suspect this is uh the the layer two is closer to the Telecom company at the moment but Mev may be maybe an exception to that um the other thing is protocols need to freeze you know these midi mid-air reconstructions of the aircraft that are done um sort of mid-air by protocols today they can still happen but they probably have to become more and more and more minimal and you need to leave Innovation to where um security concerns so sort of data availability guarantees execution is being gradually loosened as you go up the layers of the infrastructure and that's where you can probably afford to experiment because you're probably not carrying the weight of business that is being carried ultimately by the layer one layer two um there's also I think a sort of sleepwalking sense for the community in which well this stuff is incredibly hard to build it's created it's required a huge amount of accumulated genius and we've seen actually a lot of it on display today um a huge amount of accumulated genius to build these systems but does that give us actually moral rights of economic access to a return at the protocol layer big question um so the layer two I think as much as anything it's a matter of sort of psychology and is the business um and are these infrastructure businesses more widely prepared to just keep on looking for the trust residues that are left once they've done their amazing work the exact KP sort of you know extinguishes a lot of The Primitives of business economics uh that um that you're sort of used to trying to find in building some kind of business or service um but plenty is left the arguably the the surface of utility actually widens and there are lots of businesses you can build on top of this I've listed some examples here just we all know about the wallet you know that sort of never goes away uh number three the developer platform that's a kind of trust relationship that does not actually imperil uh the user's right of um priority so bear access to their to their asset but there is a um there is a sort of a role for sort of threat detection and deployment migrations migrations of the user funds migrations of uh of smart contracts um that probably means that there is a long-term value extraction operation opportunity there and then number two is kind of weird I don't think people I I'm calling this the virtual private computer but there are two of these novel VMS uh that support private state um and this might be part of a route towards um the sort of the final flourishing of our general migration to the cloud so we've been gradually sort of you know sort of walking off uh the edge of our physical hardware and our computers are really sort of not physically sort of present where we think they are a lot of the compute and the and the um the storage is actually going going off off chain this in some sense could be the final flourishing of that so you have a fully fully validated uh ephemeral computer that sort of um that's running on something like a blockchain network of course the difficulty with computational privacy can be well and we heard this earlier I can't remember who said it but there's sort of essentially more vulcanization of State it's more single player mode and so sort of the questions then start to open will you know do we really need this on a sort of on-chain or a knock-chain environment um more generally I'd sort of ask infrastructure companies to keep on looking for the pair business so keep keep hold of your companies don't dissolve them um You probably will need them um see so obviously the end game for a lot of these protocols tends to be should wind up the company and the token goes out and then it's got to Define its own economic way in the world um seek the pair business lots of historic examples here so the older one and the classic one the one that rules PCS like talking about is a Morgan deviant mongodb ink um but there's also next.js and first cell there's lots of kind of modern examples as well the sort of the open source thing the utility and then the and then the sort of the the trust residue the thing you need to provide to the user can make and they come to depend on you and this opportunity to Value extraction which is not there okay so I quickly want to return to a point I made about the macro asset and the stability of the asset and what the implications this has for validated capital so um a very basic theory of the rational snake is the validator return on investment is something like it's fixed income instrument something like fixed the fixed free rate whatever that is the slashing risk premium which I think we all assume in the long runs be quite small and then there's going to be some sort of FX risk premium and you can see this in classical things fixed income markets these these differences really do exist and uh so corporates who issue debt in different currencies and they're also even Emerging Market countries that will do kind of U.S denominated debt and sort of um debt um currency and they often pay more for their own currency because it's less liquid more volatile less widely held so this could mean that the moment a layer 2 or any piece of infrastructure decides to accept validator capital in let's say eth versus its own token you could open and you could end up opening up a two-speed uh validated Capital system one with a tighter Roi and the other with a wide or Roi and this could even give give rise to sort of virtuous and vicious circles so for example the higher Roi instrument is the one that the protocol wants to de-prioritize the reason is it doesn't attract as much validated capital for the same mental security fee that's paid and so that then becomes a less widely held asset less liquid it requires a higher premium Etc and you can see the cycle go round and round and on the flip side um you know you could end up with eth becoming a more and more widely accepted expression of validator capital and it enjoys the converse phenomenon um so quickly here's the example of an Emerging Market um country um so um Mexico for a long time and I think still does have some USD bonds outstanding and you saw this differential you saw these extra premium I'm not sure whether you can see it on that slide but basically I've added in extra Premier extra returns so between the eight what is that seven percent Bond and the eight and a half percent Bond the extra return the extra amount that the rational lender the rational owner of the bond needs to be compensated for holding the peso-denominated asset versus the USD denominator asset so here it's illustratively 150 bips um on the right hand side I've done an again illustrative example of what the layer 2 computation might be so now the reason I've equilibrated the left and right hand sides of those um of those types of uh of both I should say in the Blue by the way that's the capital balance and in the red is the sort of red and yellow is the income balance so let's suppose that there is a really dramatic difference between the liquidity the price stability and the L2 asset so we might see I don't know it could be a differential of you know eight to eight percent versus three percent return on the validator capital now if we hold fixed and this is a big assumption but if we hold fix somewhat the amount of fees that are available to the LT stakers and you'll collaborate those you can sort of see that the result of a rush some sort of efficient rational staking Market is you get 2.7 times whatever it is the the amount of staked eth for the same amount of security fee and then for much higher efficiency for the level of security that you're providing to your users um so could I've called this um a lot of this talk um I'm calling it charbono's return which is this sort of I I this sort of ephemeral return uh that is due to the um to the to the to the uh the token holder um which is kind of if you if you kind of if you're willing to be charitable and say this is all um this is sort of purchased um so knowingly and with the expectation of bearing the costs of bootstrapping the system there's this all this kind of approval work that needs to be subsidized and so you kind of need this ephemeral return to sort of get the system going um in the midterm you then get the introduction let's say of of eth and largely this might be because of competitive Dynamics oh wow I need to be cheaper for the same level of perceived security obviously there are lots of things go into security but one of them is how many security dollars we posted against your L2 versus the other L2 because I don't want them going around saying they're more scared than I am so I have to now accept Eve and so that's the moment then you get the TC Capital system and then you get that potentially suspicious Vicious Circle in the in the L2 asset um so again this doesn't mean the LTS cannot make money they certainly can they but they and I'm going to go into how they can keep on um keep on tracking value later on I started to put together a value so I don't think we're gonna go through any of this so I'll just say sort of bottom right so generally sort of sees I think for us sees more green than anything else I'll just show you how this thing's constructed so on the left you can see those sort of purple boxes layer one layer two layer three so layer the idea of the the difference between these layer one moves to Layer Two Three execution scaling Layer Two Loops to La three let's say through data availability scaling scaling now um obviously with uh dank sharding approaching it's going to take a lot of pudgy Penguins to require um possibly layer threes immediately but at some point they will be very very relevant and then along the top you've got all of the sort of capital and service providers who might be engaged in the system um so from the kind of unstick token on the left through to the capital provider slash proposer and I've put them essentially twice one to sort of account for how big is the sort of the the ultimate dollar market and then the other is what is the ROI on the capital deployed into that market I even got Builders private Farm storage I mean yeah um and then you've got maybe maybe the sort of the the things that you won't have sort of maybe looked or thought about quite so much before things like the virtual private computer I mentioned earlier where there that's kind of the environment in which let's suppose Maiden VM does not optimize for client-side proofs and then you've got some sort of remote computation for all of your private transactions well in such a situation then there is a VPN like role perhaps even better for Value extraction for the company that created the virtual machine the very first place they have that trust relationship with the user um developer platforms wallets you know I think we know the sorts of things we mean by something that has a kind of a trust relationship um anyway I think we'll try and make this public and then people hopefully criticize it and comment on it and uh and over time we can maybe improve it uh given time I'm going to skip over this um the final thought what are the um crypto digital um archaeologists gonna find um is the layer one evm is it sort of wreck on the ocean bed but is it sort of only relegated now to verifying proofs that's one possible in-game for that um does uh layer one Mev actually become more like a wholesale Market really interesting every video travels down into the low layers um interest to sort of have some conversations with uh with all the mvpx here um afterwards to hear about that um we'll layer twos with um layer one defined uh d a be enough um da reduction following dank sharding to to build quote unquote normal programs and does the um increasingly siled execution environments of let's say layer threes layer fours um start to reduce me the opportunities and to what extent um so look these are all just sort of questions they're questions without answers um and I think that's really the extent of the talk thanks very much [Applause]
