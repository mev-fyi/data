foreign and this is basically an intense talk and maybe a dumbed down version of Uma stock um but uh that's sort of I've been trying to figure out um so I mean who am I uh I've been doing blockchain protocols and cryptography since 2014. I've been interested in consensus protocols interop smart contract VMS application specific blockchains Mev and D5 I built an end user protocol application a defy protocol uh similier it's a digital asset manager like one of the things it does right now is it generates uh the best e-denominated yield using Cosmos Tech the reason I bring this up is I'm somewhat uh unusual in someone who's built like a bunch of core protocol stuff and end user applications um and so but I've been doing this for 10 years um and every time I want to use the systems that I've been building for the last 10 years um it takes an hour um and when I started this and I want to use Bitcoin it took an hour um and in many ways the systems are now much more expressive but it still really sucks um and when we've in building sommelier and looking at end user applications um users are constantly frustrated and placed in situations where they don't really understand um what's going on and they are exploited by more sophisticated actors on chain um so the like common wisdom um is that like if we had better account abstraction better Key Management better wallets um we will be liberated from this bad place um and so like you know in Cosmos um we build account extraction two years ago some form of account abstraction two years ago um Key Management still sucks um and there are lots of companies out there that are trying to make it better um and you know wallets are really hard and we keep hoping that like a better wallet um will liberate us from this um but it's not going to fix this problem which is um debugging a failed transaction is terrible right like no user can make sense of eat like uh ether scan error message of what's going on um when people make when I make routing mistakes and like I built all of this uh I still get money stuck in like the wrong chain and it takes like 20 minutes to like under rewind the like bridging sequence that I strung across like three bridging protocols to get where I was trying to go um and the control flow problems and the exception handling problems of all of the ways in which we use blockchain are just a nightmare for the like most sophisticated people at this and I don't I don't think this is solvable within the Paradigm of like what we've been doing for the last 10 years so this is not the way um when what I'm imagining is what we're doing right now is we're specifying execution paths across protocols with heterogeneous infrastructure and you need the context of like an economic actor you need the concept context of being a power user of understanding like of being able to look at different prices on different markets understanding Market depth understanding like you know there's just like a huge amount of domain expertise that is required to actually like say I'm going to turn the wheel um to like execute a transaction and what we've been basically doing with the way we've been architecting like the end user facing side of blockchains is we've been expecting our like our user base to be able to be you know whales or to like work in the same ways as whales and market makers do when they like functionally don't have enough information and they don't have enough context to do that um so what I've observed and the reason like I've been running around pilling people on the intense discourse um is because the best teams are doing something different um uh so what I would observe is if you want to uh see probably the closest Glimpse I've seen of all the protocols out there of what I think the future looks like like use one-inch Fusion like install a VPN use one inch Fusion like it's worth it um the uh the like so like what is one inch fusion um basically you sign a a statement that like gives people gives one inch the one inch smart contracts the ability to take funds out of uh uh custody out of like your custody smart contracts and uh and then like says like here are a set of constraints on a trade and then it just goes out and tries to find something some solver who will solve it um Cal swap similar it's essentially Like A Primitive intent system uh a Noma we like all stand we all stand on the shoulders of Chris goes um and like Chris was telling me about intense three years ago I had no idea what he was talking about um here I am now showing it um and like Mev share is another really good example of uh of a intense system in production so like I think it's relatively clear what um what the where the future is going like we have these examples levels of real systems that you can actually use today and play with um and they're like so much better like it is so much better to use one-inch Fusion uh like you don't pay gas fees you don't think about slippage you don't do any any of this nonsense that you deal when you interact with uniswap directly and it might totally makes sense for something like similier like a similier strategist a market maker to actually deal with one inch directly like there's I'm not saying that like no one is going to use blockchains I'm just saying that like the kinds of users who successfully use blockchains today um are probably the kinds of users who are going to successfully use blockchains in the future and the solution is to build an abstraction that like is not sign a transaction on a chain um so yeah these are the like common elements of what I think is the future uh so users like we should we still have to stay in a world of not your keys not your crypto if we don't have self-custody we have nothing um so like cd5 is obviously a disaster um and like is the thing to like avoid um people need to be able to sign over a set of constraints that describes their goals and then all of the things that are a nightmare need to be handled by off-chain actors because trying to embed control flow and exception handling into our smart contracts and to into our protocols is probably if not difficult it's important if not impossible it's like super difficult you're going to end up in a situation where it's like the user wants to do what you know I want a hundred dollars of Pepe and then like 10 000 lines of exception handling code um this is not a viable way of working it was and like evolving things on chain so so mostly by moving away from like the current notion of transactions we actually potentially can solve like all of these things that like seem unsolvable within like the current Paradigm which is like how do you like actually share profits from Meb how do users actually benefit from the Mev that their order flow generates uh routing is super hard like which decks should I use like no one can make any sense of this um there are probably new ways of doing transaction privacy in this sort of uh uh non-transaction world I know the enoma team has thought a lot about it um and like you know like IBC is amazing from uh security and Trust point of view but it sucks to use um and really what you want is what basically to say like you know I want this asset on this chain or I want this you know I want to be staked on this chain and here's some money um these are the things that you would just want to be able to declaratively say and we have the like underlying technology to provide like low Trust settlement of all of this because of all the bridge and interop work but what we don't have is like a way of of saying these things in a in a sort of General way um so to conclude uh my statement is transactions are not going to make it and we should give up um we should basically give up trying to build like transaction systems uh and we should try and build a new abstraction for end users otherwise we will just repeat the sins of the last wave of mass adoption in the next bill so thank you very much [Applause]
