coming to our first talk of the semester and I'm very happy to Thank You Irene Eldridge from Abel alpha come on a roll market data and well I've known I ring for about what maybe ten years when I started writing papers in market microstructure she was writing a book about high frequency trading and I kind of talked a little bit about sort of that early literature and in that area and anyways in kinston she's a sort of explored new areas such as N and a book of her Electra we just came out a month it's coming at the end of the month okay so and it's called real time real some risk I'm Riddick em and I guess today's top is the connection that's Katie the long term in vanessa's though I think about it okay so another thank you thank you so much thank you hi my name is Irene Aldrich and thank you so much for coming i dream appreciated and just just by we all just services first so what we going to talk about is what is real time risk and what are its causes and how does it impact investment across different strategies but I think specifically today I want to address the common misperception that 30 timers does not affect multiple managers and for example the other day Iowa said they on the panel and struggle and there was a gentleman next to me and he manages a billion dollars and mr. Lowe only fund and said you know I don't care about high frequency trading because it doesn't impact me in any way but it was interesting because it's something new right because we've had the last ten years of lonely portfolio managers campaigning against high frequency trading but if it was really damaging their stuff but well you know they just trade around and I just hold it for a long time so there's no harm done and nobody cares and because you know and even if you cause flashes class crashes they don't care about it either they it's typically at the end of the day from the flash crashes over and and and the price goes back up so so it's all good so bottom line is we're going to talk about it actually does affect the long-term portfolio managers and regal and thought about how so really what I want to talk about is what are the systemic changes in the marketplace and how they impact was we do and everybody does and and what does it imply for portfolio managers with their long-term or short-term and etc okay so my background is really funny enough so so I do electrical engineering at Cooper Union for my undergrad which I kind of leaded there almost by accident because I really wanted to do computer science and but cooper union was offered me scholarships so i took that and my parents were very happy obviously but during the program we did a lot of this SVD or was now is called big data in math lab and i had up to the no idea why we're doing what the applications work I mean it was interesting from the mathematical point of view but it was it was kind of you know just something for to get a grade in the course and if now it's all the rage to employ the friend of mine who just stopped being a high-frequency traders and and he deploys the same techniques now from from from this space and also from high frequency trading in the advertising space in California and it's like a huge demand for this kind of very sophisticated not just this video is very sophisticated analytics test that people are just lapping it up and it's it's really becoming commonplace so anyway so Africa premium at the same time was working a lot enough and software development and the later software architecture when I am I had my own calm back in 99 where we did software security and later I moved into risk Kyle said for the grad school Columbia and inside engineering department I you are and I edited MBA at INSEAD and they came back and that I was that in grad school in finance and I was also doing a lot of consulting in risk management it was after the two thousand crisis some risk management was very hot and so so I ended up on the loan pricing best enquanto and actually had the team several people where we were pricing loans and even then we already have fast it was a it was a pretty sophisticated operation in that sense but a lot of stuff we had to do we had to still negotiate with human people of human loan prices and and they had the scorecard and they would only give ten percent to the Quan psycho say of the total value of the loan I'll say of the credit rating and it was commercial loan so we would we would it was valuing the company's credit worthiness and they had a scorecard in which only ten percent was input from Kwan's and forty percent was input from the loan Assessors personal judgment personal feel about how this based on his interactions with a CEO and management of the company how they're going to perform so of course this has changed dramatically now and we have companies that are qualitatively pricing loans in like microseconds right when you just fill out the application it was a big fin Zach space in that which is that all people do based on Roger all those models and stuff like that so and but the so i left the loan quantification and night i did send in research that is actually research before at goldman too but i did just send in research in etf space and then it up is a clause on the trading floor and there I was very surprised because nobody even had staff at the time and that really what people had was Excel I know it was completely manual as a scoring change desk was completely manually treated there were these long rows of people just sitting they have computers and they had their Excel spreadsheets there were Bloomberg or whatever Reuters with streaming in the data and and they were just kind of pressing buttons so they had these displays and they were clicking point quick trading and in many cases they were losing money right versus and in one extreme case it was there lady who was in charge of training Australian dollar and she was so superstitious about her trading like to calmly walk in through the side door was very specific side door onto the trading floor so she believed if she walked through any other door on the floor she would have a losing day right so and but that said what's her good omen if she went to that one specific bill so that's kind of how people trade it and it's true and it was like literally only ten years ago and and so now fast forward not only the loan pricing is completely automated give me or two large extended but also the way we were going today if equities are largely automated now all the training and equities they'll domity and today we really have a lot of automation happening in foreign exchange which already had seen the first round of automation and there is a lot of stuff that's been billed but now really are really going into it and making it completely automated and the thing was fixed income and the same with commodities there's really a big push for automation so what automation create something interesting so it's designed to really replace human trading right and human trait is no dock right so when when I hear it on visit I was the first quand on on me on the phone that particular trading desk and they're standing room like 50 traders at that time they were highly resistant to sharing any information like they knew what was happening and and they have kind of most of them were there for 20 years at the time so they had some intuition which is in the way in a sense kind of analysis that they have seen over and over how the market moves and what happened during specific points in time i will need execute this trade of that trade so so they have some ideas but they didn't want to share what these were they can see they kind of had a sense that if they did it would be immediately automated right and and this is what happens anyway so my former boss literally now bakes cookies all right and the guy who is sitting was sitting next to me the real estate agent and because they just uh it's it's what's what is what is going on in the industry in general so so but the people who serve quote-unquote survived they really embraced big data and machine learning and and they really try to you know stay kind of current not to Kern because then it's too visible and it's you know threatening to other people but like up to date enough to to really have a meaningful conversation you know without like appearing to be overly a much better but anyway so bottom line is it's all happening and them it would always head because maybe has have happened and now of course we have this big data and I remember five years ago there was a conversation that people were really set out for the term big data and they're like my links in a lot and I get most of my news from London and so there was you see where these conversations about you know like people are going to puke if they hear a big date and one more time it's just so annoying and it's so meaningless and blah blah blah so lo and behold is fast forward five years and dictated everywhere and everybody is doing big data and people really have huge amounts of beta now okay five years ago he went or in and it was two thousand seven so maybe 10 years ago now talking with one of the big banks and it didn't have any data on commodities besides me 21 days that was required by the regulators actually it was not even sell two sentences it was like 2009 but in it that's all the data people had right so they had just just just 21 days of data and they couldn't build any model they couldn't really do anything data except maybe some toy kind of things and here and there and and now you know there's people are building databases your stream diff structured data there's unstructured data and all of this has to be processed in in a lot of different ways now one of the most interesting application is a lot of the people who are working with data today or who are managing teams working with the data they are trained on daily data on small data sets with daily data okay so now they're surrounded by this huge amount data and one of the interesting and growing opportunities everywhere across wall trees is really taking those giant piece of data and converting them into small data so the experienced researchers who are used to smaller sets of data can actually make a meaning outputs this is where we come to a 3d it was a long story by the TV is a singular value decomposition it's basically principal component analysis and it's it's it's a fun kind of thing it's evolved in many different ways but it uses its used a laden in digital imaging etcetera etcetera so and we're going to apply to portfolio locations so portfolio allocation also is one of those industries that's on the brink of being automated there are already a lot of people who are doing passive portfolio allocation so the investment EGF and or sectors instead of really i am speaking the stock however today we had a meeting with like a 20 billion dollar fun that is very well known and and they still do it the old-fashioned way so they have researchers who research monthly data on different stocks and based on their now officially to say they form to invest in starbucks and and the allocated billion to starbucks so they take like highly concentrated submission and very in very few names and they hold them for some time do seduce about Morales so there's there's other issues involved but they're all sorts of kind of ranges but even these guys who are doing monthly data presently so what they want their main initiative now is to get in as much data as possible and bring it to the portfolio manager so that the Foley managers have the information that they may not otherwise have so that they can incorporate it and improve on their decision-making ok so it's part of the big data but this dub SVD is named one of the key Big Data techniques and essentially its main value is it allows you to reduce the data so you take a huge amount of data and with SVD you make it a very small amount of data and then it's manageable and even an Excel spreadsheet if you like and and they see what it is so like a lot of Google advertising or you have google who at lower or some sort that have a bunch of customers with different customer values like this allows you to to figure out how you can classify the customers in the simplest possible way right so firm just complete complete complete cloud so and again if there's a lot of arts as well as signs it's not the it's not obvious bit of all right so it's used very widely is a very basic example where you have an image and it has 400 vertical line okay this is the image it has 400 work aliveness and so it's 400 vectors and and so you do as video this thing to think of a value decomposition it comes out with a bunch of singular values so if you just use one value this is what you get okay when you plot the Swan value if you use two values this is what you get so students 10 valleys picture looks like this and then 50 validate it almost looks like a complete picture all right so now we take out of 400 calm you reduce it down to 50 home you basically have the same image as you have but already it's not perfect but for the purposes of research you know it's pretty good guidance and the rest you can consider noise or some people discard the first city depends on the application they made sure to discard the first 50 values and only focus on the noise if this is what you're looking for if you're looking for something that's very specific yeah sure [Music] if you go for let's say take my fig leaf I mean when you consider that within pro now me also dr. dimension yeah okay so you would well it's a very good point so so they're different ways to organize the data right so one way you can do that this example one way you can do is you can put the tick by tick as the s called okay so in that case you can if you're sure it's basically shrinking number of combs it's not drinking a number of rows it's drinking a number of poems so if you organize your data in such a way that you have big date pics actually lining up this way then you would shrink them aloud yeah it's that it's more complex than that so it really allows you to not just drowsy it really allows you to determine the important ones to return yes captured change or someone's were the ones that have most variation technically small variations so it's really you're keeping the ones that this says that you basically you project the youth group you're projecting into the hyperplane that we're with the most mentions so instead of like this is XY axis you would be optimal XY axis maybe looking like this and so you're changing the access to really to to to kind of accommodate the data and the biggest variation is that where the information is but potentially yes I haven't really looked the math specific idea but scary yes 100 60 60 each of them are great scale phone twice the glass yes here to pick people she's the kind of work you're saying you don't need a vector of dimension for 400 sectors subscribe enables fit yes so in this case pictures so creating so these are we can be expected right 400 vectors for a sort of the picture and so we're keeping 50 of them yeah all right and then but it's not like we're just throwing out every other vector okay it's more that this singular value decomposition determines for us which vectors are important to keep and and we're keeping those vectors okay so they wouldn't do the same with the Foley management or anything else and in fact people have been doing it okay so for example let's say we do this is russell 3000 okay so we have three thousand stocks and we have dimension so we have sentiments ten dimensions to ten factories because we're looking for NHS 3,000 softener official one days and we have a price home prices i've been without intraday arranged volatility market capitalization beta and it's a three-year beta like oh one of this data is from yahoo we set for these three you're using big data techniques for for capital market we estimated progressive hoc institutional binds percentage of volume or institutional self so we're on this video list and it is called a scree plot so the scree plot does it basically it's over doing starting the single thing about we get some assisted in office hello there sighs so the most important ones are the biggest ones are is beta then followed by price and that person without his been in the curve but it doesn't go in directly to zero so this is just kind of local bus starting from market caps so there's current residence is considerable more so as market faster than back then people buy 30 and here the daily returner and very small sodium and a ball toys that are often most commonly used for patrol analysts right now in a sense what with anything about started that pace traditional analytics can can be in principle replicated by other factors right and and and it kind of makes sense and in the reason it makes sense if you look at price and beta so these are the two biggest ones okay so beta is the market risk and the more market risk you have and it's basically everything now moves according to ETF all right so if the stock belongs in an ETF then you can be kidding basically guaranteed that there is a high frequency trading out there arbitrage that particularly GF vs the basket of stocks that are comprising this ETF so keeping it a law of one by law of one price and inconsiderable equilibrium most of the time so because of this like everything that's part of the ETF is moving along with with with a broader market and basically everything is part of the EGF right now so and then it becomes very dominant so if you have a correct forecast for the market for for tomorrow you can pretty much you know very accurately predicts where your stuff is going to go and the price is just the kind of a qualification as to how much in dollar terms your price talking or you stop is going to increase because if you know betta you know the return it means you know market return on your baby and all the return and then you determine the actual game put them all right so so that's not if you look at that the next two dimension which that market capitalization and dividend yield and market capitalization is really practical acquitted so you have how much you can buy buy or sell right so many players out there with holding yourself are there and dividend yield is also part of the return so in in themselves they're they're kind of also call stations return this is me know this is what bar assaults right so Barra msci bar they run the singular value decomposition on on equities and then the is basically there the market capitalization dividend yield and a bunch of other macro factors are part of of that framework that says that it is used to with with the variance covariance matrix to do really by the fully managers okay so it's already out there you know people are buying this and being a lot of money first two and this is something that that we provide so it's institutional activity and the aggressive a shifty the way we estimated again we're using big data on tick data and we're looking for specific patterns and for example they incisional by it is only a small institutional activity today it has traded their beer several algorithms resin which be weapon to you up probably the most prominent we lap inequities and POF elsewhere and that and you know there they actually when you look at the order flow with your eye and you and it's only thing is broken down you don't you know what's with the large water out there it is then because everything else is very small now myself all the orders are not like hundred shares and stuff and so if you put the thousand share order it's going to be very visible and of course because you're putting money into that order it's very credible signal to other market participants ticket to think okay this guy really believe this because he's putting all this cash it's into it so so everybody's going to pounce and essentially go up to your order so even though it's anonymous but you're just going to seriously multi-market so instead people break it down into small orders and there there's a view app which breaks it through the day on the kind of a you curve its volume weighted average price and queue up is that which basically break this and do even places regardless you know it's a foot from from the this big data to Nathan and it's a it's very visible to the Machine I so it's not necessarily visible to people because all you see is a bunch of hundred share orders back and forth but so so essentially you can you can reverse engineer and the graduate receives a set of strategies that executes using aggressive orders so the other markets order so you take milk lady taking orders I across the spread or close to market limit orders so if it's an aggressive limit order and it's basically guaranteed and you're guaranteed to execute I can also be comprised Lincoln hydrogen city can be both short term alpha it's always short term is type of ninja training but it can be alpha driven in which case there's some information or idea that that is or usually follow the rhythmic obviously it's not the personals idea I've already text coming and they take a few mil it's a little bit more positions than usual or it can be sad are when the balance is all very quickly and which can't very well so the bottom line is these strategies because they're aggressively enrolled the quiddity okay so the opposite is a passive H of T which is which is purely limit orders like market-making which naturally supply limit orders and some people claim that the staff of h FG is flaky blah blah but I'm honest markets are anonymous you don't know who is a 50 who's 1950 and if you order arrives and the h of t's order is the best order out there you're going to be filled with that particular order I so the HP's don't have the ability to say oh I don't want to fill this guy like my limit order their overall some best price I'm not going to I'm not them that filled its person like if it's there the best fries and market orders arriving anyways it's going to be filled so it's not truly flaky it's a especially just just regular but the owner of cancellations are largely free so there are a lot of obviously order cancellations go along not just by high-frequency traders but also by by execution desk find who hold priority for their customers and then perhaps take the orders out that the question doesn't arise so anyway so but these guys are eroding liquidity so they're really taking aggressive position and they wiping out liquidity on the other side's generally takes about 20 minutes 40 please to replenish naturally replenish unless there's another event or they there's a significant kind of imbalance in which case they wipe it out again but it sounds just this kind of wipe out of liquidity it's been increasing spreads right because there's a larger bit of sound and as a result there is a risk contribution so at the end of the day you will have a higher risk if you are estimating using realized volatility especially you will have a higher higher number right for volatility then you would have if I could concentrate is from operators these particular hydrogen skaters all right so the top of high frequency traders is the opposite because they provide limit orders may reduce volatility that's realized volatility because there's just more more padding you know and institutionalizing agent said it's a really value ranges average prices or two of which is high weighted average price and now it's going mainstream be much everywhere cuz they're the reason the time-weighted average price still uses in some markets like foreign exchange you some of you may or may not be able to get the actual volume so it's been some somebody's or some some participants don't close your volume the only quote you benefit and best offer and and the the best sizes so so there you can't really do the volume-weighted average first anyway so this is just how it looks on the chart put it it again russell 3000 on this dimension is increasing data destruction will be banned substance equal price pizza fun that circle larger circles are more aggressively cheap then smaller circles someone who really needs concentration will stop small beta long vista my chance there's a slight well that was so smaller surprise install the is immersed year they are equally according to a greater this unique and wonderful sophisticated system and this is just the secondary character this is a fictional buying with the sky so in future send users are by itself kind of thing rumors the stock certificates finished by volume so when there is no institutional fine selling that people scare in our comments possibly because there's you know their larger share of the volume because institutions done are not in the market it's not addressed so anyway so so the viva las dimensiones the previous day's return injured a range volatility and we can extend this you're like you know the last five years of returns and etc but but these are just like traditional traditional variables that I used in class supports innovation including research Razzaq excuse very matrix shrinking etc and and they're really very small okay so this is the same SVD this is the four instances actually it was 500 and it's a mixed bag is supporting change there and commodities and fixing go okay just the various name is Ling gold and australian dollar etcetera etcetera but bottom line is it's kind of and then we have limited data columns those taps excuse for variable hair accessories that's offer and the guertin yourself i and and so no bec food is the most snow down on their own discuss fraud can describe individually various financial instruments according to this yes this is the actual values a single volume then was so mean an interpretation it's something that sets you combined with Phillips with the other if its morphological yes so if it's kept it up so let's say is a amano them so suddenly suck you down from them some water it's not like it's fitted them we have a button in this case we have securities in rows ok the fourth for calls so if you wanted to describe a security all right he was initiated into services if I home soon and we did my best experiences of comfort yourself right miss the most dominant forces thanks but there that you know you can you can put gift go ahead differently yeah so in this case we don't have a ball we saw some web on data right but yes so if Emily wait in the innocence here I mean market yet kind of proxies for all this is not yet but it's certainly something something that you can do it there's so many ways it can really slice and dice since data and and it's not not many people have have really like a dom extensions human even like you know it's not it's not widely kind of established and so on and if you talk about intraday volume into the volume is very sparse because there's so many changes now go in the US alone I think they're now 19 exchanges equity changes and in total if you consider exchanges and are full there are 63 or 64 trading venues right so because of that and then there's upon the background there's an MDB o MZ bo is a national bestest best offer and so it does is it part of reggae Pia 50ml I think not regular this came out in two thousand baht but what it says is that in the inter in the interest of investors all orders have to be executed as a nationally best available bid and offer okay so if you send in order to an exchange and they don't have a nationally best dinner offer respected by law they're required to forward it on to another exchange so what happens then is that there you have limit orders on every exchange just didn't best offer and each exchange submit these orders it's a certain time interval and it changes it shrinks all the time to what's called a security information processor or slips cake which is run by the SEC and where the aggregates and they determine that within every interval this is with our best in and best offers okay and and they disseminated back to the exchanges and the exchange is made only execute if they have the best business best offer the matching or better than the one that's provided by the steps they're obviously very issue without issues with that because true one changes are mentally yeah so so but do you mean Matt Cain is beyond the internal internal is attaining their fully and all the laws don't have you supported but then if somebody has to reconcile so that's our show evidence scientists said their regular my mind yeah I don't know I think it's wrong search technology classes not certain tests all the levels everything I mean you can just so have people to enjoy yourself off against each other office well is that way else if they see that from the outside and companies fun I don't think anybody's going on if anyone well if there I mean it's still its mandate writers you have us and I think if there is an issue then the government would have been and they've not just gets it I so maybe the redistribution park we're saying the same the same things when I feel what it also not the whole hi every stuff because exactly what we wanted what work well for cards let's do it so so it still opened up for a lot of gays right so for example you're in exchange this is where this hole comes up the flickering order to come with it like you an exchange and you want to get extra flow so you kind of click like put on and then take off a limit order that's kind of matching Oh better than the best available order out there and then you take it off very promptly but not before it actually set down through inlet in this case many exchanges and the sip and it's registered everywhere no one sense all the flow from all the changes flow through your exchange right and so by then of course you may not have you may not want to indicate that price or whatever you may not have that order any more books do you have to send it elsewhere but if you have somebody who is specifically to subscribing to your feed they would obtain information about the orders I said one of the orders can you possibly get in this second if you work if you did have to spray right how much interest is there and you would get all these market or streaming through your exchange so so there's your different kind of thing in fact we didn't study on one of the exchanges and it's only I didn't get a very small fraction of the order to thank you but there's a lot of these pinging orders and it is track it doesn't track algorithms so algorithms just completely gloss over those they kind of are capable of identifying that this is really not a real order but people who are human you're definitely getting hooked on on these so you see some orders that are pinging exactly like 999 milliseconds you know I port for like a fraction of five seconds and then the midgets go go stark until the next 999 millisecond and and the human totally recalibrating and they constantly so it's a it's definitely you know there's a delay like kind of an reaction that you can see from Marcus's position but it's a very interesting problem but it's obviously a risk from the real time perspective and there's a lot from big data perspective as you can do to identify those too so anyway so from the long term proposed in the prospectus of long-term portfolio managers they don't concern themselves with execution right so institution is all fun and dandy it's not their function it's somebody else's job but what they want to do is create the risk-return characteristics a traditional approach as you do min Baron customization but as we said it's lonely on the singular value decomposition scales how about upgrading to the higher values and oh recent book shows up but sabara and they mentioned has been selling my CI barra has been selling the risk factors as inputs or actually quite a bit of time including like market capitalization and stuff but there are other things in addition to to incision progress lots of microstructures that is completely unexplored and there's a lot of data and if it kind of stopped and of course there's a lot of risk that is coming up with us so our book does not have any equations just FYI but um and it's coming out a couple weeks but basically here's a step-by-step approach so you have this decomposition in the middle of your singular values measure and see people take this and we'll find out with you for your available matrix whatever the mean variance matrix you're using and it's very predictive so one day I had you have pretty good this is this is what you predict based on mom ah based on your previous return so if you do this data plus factors market cap see i know'd Sharpe ratio times trading and volatility or slots for practice whatever so it looks pretty good on paper it usually doesn't quite work out like that in real life so this is based on Monday performance horses on five okay so this is very much sensitive and so we start with us and if you reminded me of what private and critical your source and what this is red wine defenseless but they're still my stuff though it was so seriously selected business be the only reality once a year and we can do things for for a new analysis and soup and this is for 2016 those works a lot better here take it off but it's basically anything combines with your existing portfolio management system yet creators whatever mean variance matrix you all you have is suspicion on and this is creepier major fifth I last so anyway so it is very consistent across the boards of factors and but the vs will be assisting fully I see here is that what we have no because of ETF once you have a flash crashing in one instrument eventually it spread very rapidly because there's there several factors so one is of course there's an arbitrage between the baskets of the comprising the ETF and then a GF itself the second is even if you have a large institution that's holding a large position until May and there's a crash and they're not sure with the flash crash or if it's not a flash crash then instead of selling that particular security then they may choose to sell something that's similar okay so they may choose to actually sell that BTW of itself and especially if it's more liquid and just liquidate the entire position or whatever they mount right and then gradually rebalances with with their original stock as he wanted to sell in efficient execution strategy I so instead of executing instead of selling off the stuff that you actually if there's a flash version one instruments or a crash and monitor instead of selling all that stuff you sell in ETFs comprises that stocks right and then you gradually balance out the ETF or just the stock the maybe not the liquid in the first place so because of that there's there's like because something happens to one stock the entire market just hang right in and F and so all of these three factors do daily factors they really have trouble with its like the beta is better because they're heavily depends on market and and it's a it's a problem I mean it works there's only works and works great when the mark market as a whole is going up so if the market is going down it doesn't work feel great so the micro structure on the other hand it's a completely different it's independent also larger market movements I given the people could see its correlation in 3d correlations right they they don't exist they break down the f of X because they're so liquidity dependent that is the larger comes daily portfolio of innovation does not apply here at all so it's been very different if you look at my construct it's a very different portfolio input and it's in a way it's mune from larger mushrooms and so yes so there's a real impact and in so many different things that we talked about and it can improve returns and Sharpe ratios etc and obviously we have a book that again has no equation for it but it's kind of an overview of where the market has evolved and and what's in fact companies that they're doing was and it's stuff like that okay so this is sufficient thank you very much any questions yep I know you have the other card about their up there that should kind of how age right yeah have you found anything kind of like today on the autocorrelation was where that a 15-10 streets and rock so hard over yahoo how can see this is very despondent Ronnie Brewer it up so so the reason why high frequency trading is persistent and then why is the valuable impact into the local malls even the annual like it's an annual relocation because high-frequency traders are fixing their computers right there that are assigned certain dollar amount to trade every day and the dollar amount typically does not go from like a million 20 in one day so it's typically scaled or like larger mouth so it's typically scaled up or down Roger I because of this they model the highly persistence so within a day like intraday high frequency trading may range from 0 to 100 channel volume but over time google has been pretty stable and my thirty-six percent for the last two years alright so so it may change to thirty-seven thirty-eight percent one day and then it may go to 42 friends and they stay there it's in the range the Kuiper high frequency trading participation in Google sockets it's kind of you know it's this range bound and itself so in the same was with other soft so the cross-sectionally for example in for any case there's still some pairs that only have seven percent of volume that's room by high-frequency trading and it's been like this for the past five years so because of that if you if you're doing long-term portfolio allocation you're taking into the factor it's a meaningful faster because its persistence and it will last it may last for four year for you know teachers not a cop and not a predictor of the future but so far it's been it's been very stable yep yeah yeah likely right i don't know i mean typically i don't have is that i don't have very specifically learned a lot of aggressive side becomes training and somebody's like Apple Apple they it has so many retail traders like it's really dominated by retail slow but there's not there's not comparatively there's a smaller percentage of the volume is to gratify percentage changes because there's just so many retail traders trading it every day but generally what happens is a or a high-frequency trader the main cost is suppressed by because I frequency traders go back and forth and if they have to cross a spread if they're doing aggressive may then then it's a bit cost so in the cost minimum cost you can have as a spread this of course they is that right it's a tick right so in comparison so it's the higher is the price of the stock in principle the lower becomes your cost the minimum cost you have filled or thumb so because of that you see Senate would be in fair number of high people screeners well actually what it would hire place so if they're not in this category if you receive the lowest rates relative already too many high prices Google is its in the next example we might be constraining fairly high and it's a fairly high priced stuff so you will not see a lot of pipe fittings training in like a penny stocks because it's just very expensive to for choose to do that yes I mean pacify pic went at the quality passive consequence of trading is very prominent but not not aggressive nothing right right you're okay right but positive on Bob's no surprise you know you have one sense absolutely right sweetie month one box and your only function right you see any difference after software absolutely yeah so so any discontinuity min again the type of concentrating is computer program right and in most cases it's too complex to write every possible scenario in terms of your program so what happens is when there's an expected Sox leather or some action but people just quickly turn turn them to be resolved or about period of time which which to avoid the discontinuity so when there's an unexpected socks lip or or dividend and some people live perhaps may not it's it yep Ashley high-frequency traders tend to avoid like high dividend stocks right because unless you want to like actually write it in right you want to code around it but it just created as kids relating to agree microstructure because you want friendship yeah yeah so aggressive is the one that that use market orders or aggressive limit orders so the limit orders that they're very close to the market part horse assassin other ones that use limit orders that is spread out throughout the deliverables sure yeah well the other point explained that is a to do this right so being a wolf on tolerable i were really big data to actually get them out and same with with aggressive agency admit it it's basically we face in our knowledge of aggressive agency strategy we do this and of course there is an evasion in the age of g space and it's continuous but in most cases and most of the strategies out there you know you have a person who and it's just even with joke which i read again on linkedin but there's a joke about Kwanzaa life cycle alright so you have a quant who comes in and typically brings a strategy from another shop alright and so and so they fit in the trading desk in the first year they have this blowout here is a super strategy from a previous work place and they're just killing it and they have a really nice bonus the next year we really have to innovate and produce something and then there's a large number of people who can or some there are a lot of people who cannot right so but it's really the testing year whether you can actually develop any strategy and then the third year i mean if you develop something is great you can get good bonus but you know in many cases people have to leave so it's a three year life cycle so after three years the same person takes the original strategy this was the kiss and they go to the next shop and they implement it again alright so that's why you have this huge concentration about kind of similar high frequency trading strategies they may be slightly tweaked right but but you actually have these waves that you can see in not in data know where there's a lot of all the hype administrators all of a sudden the moving this way rather I get in the particular security is like surplus of how buy orders versus sell orders because everybody's in the same place I mean there's different different strategies but fundamentally sixers seriously but I have a book on that too it's called high frequency trading we take every single data point so we buy the data from exchanges and we could take every single at council daughter tech me what you are they give off our power crowded in the pachinko issues what if you worked there for very good right so right now we're going to chuck e yeah so so uh constitutional right now we update every half an hour and it says aggregate is basically an average for the past half hour of institutional activity and the core aggressive high frequency trading we do is every 20 minutes and the reason we do it is we find that it's the most it's a the most predictive and be it's a it's really sufficient and they're in its own basement analysis but doing is most predictive it again you have a bunch of high frequency traders it's went through different shops and the models are slightly tweaked so they execute you know almost at the same time but not quite i think is some of the malls are all this and malls and you're sewing when they come together this is where you know you really have this impact where there a lot of high five inch models doing the same thing and you can't really detect it on like a 30 second in scale because then you get a bunch of individual orders and you can see that they're high frequency but you don't know if like it's some guy who just started a new model right and it may not be like really prevalent in the crotch it's going to have a chamber bus what's your legal again oh boy a long time ago oh well I think that high-frequency trading is good I mean I really believe that high frequency trading is that it's automation you know it's a it's really it's not a lot of people excusable it a bottle of a song I mean if you take people and unfortunately animation is coming everywhere right so we're talking about basically any aspect if you like it you have struggles cars you have lost true you have like you name it right so I'm really struggling but yeah like these robots the Queen's cleaning floors you have you know now complete home automation you can turn like we turns exceeds the heater of the house when from New York City right now our houses album Long Island so it's a in and it's all this stuff is good it's a you know it's out there you can have visual recognition as i came across this kool Bell and people bring it and you know it takes the picture but not only does it take a picture it identifies a person so it sends you a text message to recruit a few door and then you can click through and as we look at the picture who's there and so the rules it's cool processes people are working on and it really boils down to it's either you're doing this and ends in a big data but you know I better you're doing automation or really your people are going to live in virtual reality right so it's another what else assistance right i mean i'm sorry i'm i'm part of me cynical but but but i think it's a very realistic scenario and having tried virtual reality recently which again is a lot of automation and it's very it's very complex and there's a lot of definitely be got analytics going on and that it's really something else so yeah sure which one free fall yes we know that the right room they are oh by elimination right so you try justjust you can beta and and they're so stable discomposed extremely stable they literally the value doesn't change if you just have one vector thing so if you just plug it well not one but they take the first three vectors when we can reorder and we'd get certain values and then three weeks maybe those because they're so indifferent there in the census there I'd involved so they're completely orthogonal and by elimination you can I mean there's some software packages that actually gives you the names of all the vectors good but in many cases you can just figure it out by by tried different vectors and schools comes out completely on devices or pair of socks right I just said daily changes perfect i very much damage changing the beta of the sox vs dell change the price right there is no reason why we have to be empirically uncorrelated buying them tight i guess i can favorite weird that you know you're able to you know sure you know i mean is it to see calendar de la galerie you're making it right under their normalize returns I success I think not me it's not a different some price difference it's it's a percentage and and because I mean we don't know what about illicit or we mean we do because we cover exist right but but it's unrelated to what it's sheriff listo percentage wise its kind of it the baby we will business day the business like the third most random noise I eventually pay the return our are not meaningful at all like they're really annoys in the in the kind of information system but that steps out there and after they say their noise because you so many people you know you know it's like a classic right so it's a it just it just traded out so it definitely is not starting so you know I try to feel these classes at factors I thought himself or photo location war construction I yurei yourself or minus two successive makes high position second position what the murderer why use confessors as a face of God mang quick Santos not battery for the return but you know men whether I want to be fully exposed to all this so if you list cave called I use inside tensor a defense of the way I just and it just completely it kind of you know off the wall kind of thing so we say the least remake a thief this you can to think it's fun plus agencies work experience I had rather me not much and then k existed matrix if you give you evaluate stopping in an hour in this mall are in rows actually 0 corresponds to shopping so this major is computer matrix it gives you the importance or the coefficient for each sock because easy singles out right so oh oh it is here is suppose but each of these rows for let's say first saw apples it can be you know 54 market data and for full price Brandon building individual days and then you have a single value for each of a state variable so please play about 65 on spin out four times price signal valley of the facts on the other price right now and it's not necessarily the way within the raisin sandwich anything about it when when you're doing make the matrix shrinking operation okay so yeah with variance covariance and explicitly inflexibly this doubly incorporates variance covariance of different elements and because you're introducing it seemed to be a solid so so but when you're doing the Rivera's command shrinking you are incorporating the return and you are incorporating except use to make it more specifically i see is tweaking stuff it can be both in the same way though so here we are going to do that when we find x mas here to jerk-off return previous helmet however many days and is it when we predict myself and this is we actually unfold so the error we got to be aggressive motivated small for tourist agency but there is a beginner missionaries together the better way to doing it right and I'm sure they're there are very very complicated ways of doing it too so it's just a very basic toy model for our services not inconsiderable thank you thank you
