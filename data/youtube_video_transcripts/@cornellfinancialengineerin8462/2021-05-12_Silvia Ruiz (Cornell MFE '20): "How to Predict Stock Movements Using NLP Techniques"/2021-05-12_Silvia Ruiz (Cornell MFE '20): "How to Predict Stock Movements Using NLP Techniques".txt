my name is sylvia and as professor said i'm a recent cfm graduate and i will be presenting some of the findings or our project which was called can we predict stock prices using nlp techniques and what we were trying to do is to look at the impact that corporates filings such as 10k or 10q have on the stock price of a company so here for example we have a 10k report of twitter and i'm sure all of you know but the objective of these reports is to keep investors informed about the present financial condition and the future outlook of the company and in our case our group was focusing on 50 companies of the s p 500 of five sectors and in total our data set consisted of 1095 reports that we scraped from the edgar website and i want to say that we spent a good part of the project scraping these documents because we were just extracting the management discussion section because that's where we believe that the company gets to tell the the story in its own words and it's also where we can perceive the sentiment so from these 50 companies we use the reports from 2013 to 2019 as our trained data and the remaining assert s data and then well as as professor lee hall was saying we started as anybody else does with the dictionary based models but we found two main problems so the first one was that i very few words got classified by lauren mcdonald dictionary in fact in average only one percent of the words in a report were classified as positive and about five percent as negative so that was one of the first problems and the second one is that using a dictionary based approach is blind to context so a for example words that could be classified as negative such as liability might not be negative if depending the context for example a decreasing liability so that's where we decided to use the two nlp techniques the word to back model we used to expand the lm dictionary and finberg we used to understand the context so i think professor lee hall explained very well all the skipgram model and that's exactly what we did so what we did is that we took all the classified words as positive and negative that were found in the report by lauren mcdonald and then we train a skip grant model on each report and then we expand if oops sorry we find the most similar words and add them just to the dictionary if the probability of being the most similar one is greater than 95 percent and if that word is not present in the negative words and we did the same for the negative words in that way we were able to expand a little bit the lm dictionary and at the end we ended up having like eight percent of positive words in each report and seven percent of the negative words so that was also more balanced and when trying to to see the words it actually made sense and then we use the findwork in order to try to account for for context so the way that we use a well i don't know if you're aware but a finbirth is a model it's a bird model introduced by google that is a in it understands a contextual relations and is strained from left to right and right to the left so um what we did with each one of the report is that each one of the sentence was classified as either positive negative or neutral so those were and or like feature those were like the first variables that we had and then we tried to build some features to try to measure sentiment and word complexity so some examples of sentiment measures that we created was the polarity for the word classification the polarity for the sentence classification and then we also try to measure a word complexity so we were taking a look at how many sentences are in the management discussion how long are these sentences and that was something that varied a lot sector from sector and then after we created this a we had about like 13 features we run an xg boost model oh and our or why variable or prediction was whether the stock price will go up or down and we accounted for market returns and the way we did that is like we said um time interval let's say five days so we take the stock price one day before the the file releasing then the report is released and five days after so that's like the five day return and if that is a greater than the return of the market that's a one and if it's less that's a minus one and actually our accuracy was quite bad for the long short term we have a 61 percent accuracy and for the long term at 53 percent and then we try to see if we could at least do some kind of a strategy from this so what we did is that we use our predictions as the signal so if the prediction was one then we lost long the stock if the prediction was minus one then we short the stock and then we compare to a portfolio that is all long and equally weighted and on both short term and long term we could find a that our strategy was better than they equally waited so i think there is still something that can be done out of this but uh it shouldn't and needs more uh more research on this first of all because we need more companies and i think it will be worth dividing it a sector-wise because each sector looks very different so for example financials has a very long report then technology is very succinct and yeah i mean here is my contact information and the link to the github i am happy to answer any questions you might have
