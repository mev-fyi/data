hi my name is sasha stoykov and i'm a senior research associate at cornell financial engineering manhattan and in my role i've been advising students for the last 14 years on financial engineering projects and because over the course of the 40 or so projects that i've advised on i've realized that data has become more and more of a prerequisite for a successful project and in fact in the last four or five years we've called these financial data science projects um at cornell financial engineering manhattan so um i thought that this conference which focuses on big data and finance might be a great venue to to showcase some of the financial engineering projects we've done and um and give you an overview of the kind of of questions that that industry as well as academia is interested in so um first of all what are financial data science projects at cornell what do they look like essentially they have three major components first of all we have a company sponsor that is in charge of um sort of identifying an important problem in the financial industry and pitching to the students this problem and and the company also often provides data and uh and guidance then there's a team of um typically four students that that work four credits on this project and then there's a faculty advisor who's with someone like me or or a researcher at ori in cornell who who will meet with the students on a regular basis and um sort of steer them in in a direction that will help them fulfill something that is uh applicable to the company but that is always also grounded in in science now um what kind of projects do do do we have well this year i think i took a few examples and i'll give you a little overview of these four examples um two the first two are are sponsored by rather small or small companies that are hedge funds or or startups and the the last two are sponsored by banks and um large banks and and we're we're very interested in keeping a diverse set of of companies and um and they give a great diversity to to the kind of problems we're looking at so the first problem is about um using nlp so natural language programming uh processing to to classify companies in terms of their esg environmental social and governmental scores the the second project involves designing or simulating a market maker on cryptocurrency exchanges the third one involves applying reinforcement learning to optimal execution and pairs trading and the last one uh involves creating a framework to allow um to quantify the relative importance of portfolio allocation and manager selection so i'll delve a little bit deeper into each of these problems and um essentially in the spring of 2021 the the companies that um that we reached out to gave a 10 to 15 minute pitch of uh what the problem is and uh and what is uh asked of the students so um first sponsor uh alex fleiss at rebellion research came up with this idea of creating a dictionary for esg investments so in um in his hedge fund he has found that there's a lot of traction towards in a push towards esg so environmental social and governance scores of of companies and um and he's also noticed that dictionaries are often used to algorithmically decide on on the score of um sort of sentiment score of companies based on on text and thought that it might be interesting to develop an esg dictionary so a dictionary that would allow an algorithm to take a corpus maybe a in this case a 10k or 10q from a company and assign an esg score based on the words that they they used in in these filings the second project that i'd like to talk to you about is in market making on cryptocurrency exchanges this is the first um project that we've done on cryptocurrencies and laura benayun who's the founder of hedgetech um put it this way um a crypto market maker essentially who who is executing trades on behalf of their clients needs to have capital across various exchanges in order to provide liquidity uh to clients so that means that uh every exchange and um you know some of these exchanges you may know of like coinbase or binance needs to have a certain amount of capital allocated to in bitcoin and in usd and the question is how how to allocate and how much capital to allocate in order to avoid too much rebalancing across venues which is a costly costly thing the third project i want to talk about or mention is one sponsored by tpnders at goldman sachs and they have sponsored several projects with us in the past and the the goal this time is to quantify one of the sort of biggest dilemmas in in asset management is that there are essentially two decisions one is the asset allocation decision in other words do i invest 70 percent of the portfolio in uh equities and 30 in bonds or or 60 40 or 50 50. and the other big decision that asset managers do is which manager should i select in order to to manage various parts of my 60 or my 40 of my portfolio and um and what was asked was to develop a simulation framework and in order to quantify the relative importance of these decisions and um finally the the fourth pitch that i'd like to describe today was one given by peter the kramet city and the the idea here was that in data science the technique of reinforcement learning has been extremely successful at developing ai for games and the open-ended question was how applicable is this technology to algorithmic trading in other words can can we look at the market in the intraday behavior of a market intraday as a sort of a board game and can we train algorithms to perform well on this board so um as you can see these questions are often uh sort of aiming high and are rather uh sort of ambitious and um and so basically the the students are tasked to present or read or sort of analyze the data create sort of theories and then ultimately give concrete answers to to the pitch questions and so uh actually as we speak some of the students are presenting their their final presentations but uh in this venue i'd like to give you a few sneak previews of what they've done and uh and hopefully this will give you an idea of the diversity of uh of techniques that can be used in financial data science so um on the first project the one that where the students were tasked to build a dictionary for esg investments this involved a lot of scraping of data in particular the the edgar 10ks and 10qs for s p 500 companies were were scraped and um and these these large bodies of unstructured data were um were filtered for uh diagrams and trigrams in other words sequences of two or three words and then um independently um there the students looked at an api on yahoo that gave numer for each company a numerical score for the e s and the g score so essentially the environmental score i think it's a number between 0 and 20 and same with the social and governance score and the idea was to identify the the type of words that contributed to more positive scores and those that contributed to more negative scores on on e s and g and as you can see by looking at the sort of this um sample of the dictionary some um some words some mentions of commodity prices natural gas plant equipment raw material tend to have a negative impact on um on the environmental score and um the intuition behind that is that uh companies that are in the energy field tend to score poorly in environmental um in the environmental score and there are a lot of other words that that have impact on uh the social and governance scores now how do how does one prove that this dictionary is effective or better because of course you can imagine there are many ways to produce such a dictionary um well ultimately the students did an out of sample [Music] analysis of the across various scores the accuracy the precision and the recall and found that if if you took 10ks and 10 cues out of sample and used the built dictionaries from um from an in-sample set then they actually the performances actually carried on into these um these other uh unscored companies so this in other words validates the the dictionary and uh and let me go on to the next um project so this one is uh the market making on crypto exchanges and what you see here are simulations of the amount of dollars that [Music] that a crypto market maker would have on on a specific exchange binance if they receive buys buy and sell orders from their clients uh over the course of the day and so what what you see is that often on on normal days the the balance of buys and sells is is sort of um you know rather is a 50 50 balance and we the the students were able to to derive some uh um capital constraints or rather the amount of capital needed for um in order to to stay within certain risk limits and what this what they then looked at is or did is certain stress tests of for example a rally on on on bitcoin or or crash on bitcoin which would be a very unbalanced set of client orders maybe an 80 i believe it was an 80 20 imbalance of buyers on the right side which essentially showed that although on normal days a certain amount of capital might allow one to rebalance every seven days on a on very abnormal days um the the rebalancing rate could be as frequent as every day and ultimately the the the results of the of the analysis were to look at various sizes of market makers ranging from a small market maker that trades a thousand trades per day to a large market maker that trades a hundred thousand trades per day and based on the uh commissions that um and the there is a uh recommended total capital uh to be allocated across exchanges and across currencies the the third project that i want to mention briefly is the portfolio allocation versus manager selection project which essentially asked what is more important how much you allocate to um you know what what your portfolio allocation is and in fact every color that you see on this graph represents um a thousand simulations of a of one allocation say um you know the the light blue in the top right here is a 70 30 allocation and of course the the the axes are mean and standard deviation the classic marco it's uh efficient frontier but what we what the students have done here is that for each um asset allocation there's a further thousand simulations where um they go and randomly select a manager from a database of um of um mutual funds in order to see how diverse the performances are for a given asset allocation and so what you see is that sometimes these um these colorful blobs overlap a little bit and those are cases where actually the the choice of the manager selection matters a lot and uh and sometimes the the blobs are quite differentiated from each other indicating that maybe the portfolio allocation a change of let's say 10 in portfolio allocation is much more important than that of choosing a manager and um and finally um the reinforcement learning for pairs trading project which in a way is a night is an idea that uh that attempts to take uh financial data and turn it into a game and train an agent to to play that game um the students looked at intraday data of uh pairs of assets in fact so um so those those are very co-integrated assets in fact they were i believe twice and three times leveraged etfs and what we what we find is that if you regress the price of one asset against the other uh the residuals of these regressions are good predictors of the the next um price moves at a at a short and a short time horizon um so what you see on the colorful left graph for example is that over the course uh what you have is on the x-axis the the residual from this region from this regression and on the y-axis you see the changes in um in the relative value between the two assets so what you can see is that certain uh horizontal lines seem to form and these these lines have to do with the microstructure or the granular nature of the intraday data and uh and from this we're able to sort of um discover that there are seven uh main streaks horizontal streaks which encouraged us or the students to look at seven buckets of of relative pricing between these assets and that is one of the ingredients of of the the state variable that that you can see here four two one means uh the residual of the regression is in bucket four the order book imbalance another predictor of um of price moves for the first asset is two and the order book and bounce um for the second asset is one and as you can see there's a rather uh these this three-digit number essentially tells um you know the the our simulation or rather tells an agent how you know what state they're in and that is an important ingredient in these reinforcement learning problems and as a result we can use the data to simulate uh pairs of assets and we can simulate extremely large amounts of data which is what reinforcement learning requires and the output of of um of this this approach is that for every state as you can see the the x-axis on the left on the left graph indicates the state and the color um indicates the the optimal behavior of the agents that has learned how to trade over time so um and of course after afterwards uh we can test these agents in um in out of sample days and that is um that is essentially what the the students in this project have done so um hopefully i've given you a sense of how diverse uh data science uh financial data science can be and um and i've been very excited to to work on these projects some of them have to do with nlp some of them with reinforcement learning uh some with clustering and uh and i found all of these very exciting so um so if you find these type of problems exciting and you'd like to be part of uh our fe project slates in i encourage you to reach out to me sfs33 cornell.edu and and i hope you found this talk interesting thank you
