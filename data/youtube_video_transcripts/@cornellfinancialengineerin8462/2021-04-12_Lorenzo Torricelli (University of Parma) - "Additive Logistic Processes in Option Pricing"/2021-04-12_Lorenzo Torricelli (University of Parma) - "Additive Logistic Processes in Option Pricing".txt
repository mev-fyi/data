hi and welcome this is lorenzo richelli from the university of parma and this video is a short introduction to financial models based on the logistics distribution i have some slides or it's some theoretical background material and then we will jump to the mathematica code where we can see the logistic distribution and the associated processes in action uh the talk is based on this process uh sorry on this paper additive logistic processes and option pricing which is available at ssrn and will be shortly updated so what is the idea uh to generate logistic uh security um underlying marginal processes the idea is to start from valuation equations so we we start from uh no arbitrage uh option functionals a call option functions which is supported on the real line and a function for valuing the merit booth so the max payoff which is supported on the positive reals so um s and b here so you have an excess uh a normalized monuments here and two term functions appearing s and b which provide which gives uh described intertemporal behavior of uh the options prices and of the underlying price distribution as well so so long as s and b this terms function are r0 and 0 are increasing and b is bounded you can verify that c and m are decreasing in strike convex in strike and increasing immaturity which is all you need to establish that this formula formula are arbitrary free once you've done that you just take the derivative with respect to k and you generate and then by the you know the famous remark by bretton litzenberger you can obtain the implied security price distribution what are the the cdf in particular what what are they for the real valued underlying coming from the log sum exponential function is just a logistic function for the positive price process coming from the merit put positive evaluation equation you have the so-called vague distribution which after a log transform is seen not to be nothing else that uh skew logistics distribution so another form of the logistic distribution with uh distortion power here appearing which gives you the negative skewness so these are the log returns of the positive price process coming from the merit put valuation what else those distribution are infinitely divisible so those of you familiar with theory of levy process might wonder uh then can we do then with a levy process associated to them well principle we could but it turns out that this is not the right thing to do but it would not support such a process the evaluation formula we started with so we have to do something else we have to consider this infinitely divisible as a time family and once you've done that you can apply a theorem which uh um the existence of an additive process provided that the law that you have chosen that you are starting from uh satisfies some technical assumption on the levy structure which in our case turns out to be the case uh and that's all we need to verify the existence of an additive process which means uh stochastically continuous with independent increments supporting the uh implied price distribution underlying executive distribution which in turn determines the formula of the statement an additive process is what you get if you relax the time objectivity from a levy process okay and also it turns out that these processes in our specific case are pure jump these are technical details on the levy structure of the log returns of the positive model and the returns in the models which uh has logistic distribution so log logistic skew logistic and logistic return for the processes once you've done that we are basically in business because uh what the bit missing is that those processes must be markets and they naturally are why why because we uh obtain distribution starting so a class of time dependent distribution starting from no arbitrage evaluation from them in the first place so you can verify this mathematically but financially the reason is what i just mentioned we call the two uh two modulus cpda model conjugate power taken additive and the second model uh it's a logistic additive model which has uh in addition a cell similar specification taking the term function as to be sigma th now for numerical test i'll take b so the bounded term structure in the the cpda model to be something which look like uh the self-similar specification in the ssla in the in the logistic model when time is small or something like this sorry if you do the taylor expansion you see that okay so we have a model with all this uh let you go through them these good desirable properties which supports some very simple pricing formula uh which is basically what we start our studying input going to the code i hope you don't mind too much uh the terrible coloring uh so what i'm done here is uh i'm implementing some formula from our paper and uh so here you have the specification for the term structure i have the formula i implemented the formula for the option uh cpd and ssla vanilla options spots and calls and also i have the distribution logistic and skill logistic so log returns for the cpda returns for the ssla so the formula and their instantiation in terms of the price of the of the term function and there's these expressions for the cumulative term structure for those models which can be expressed as a functions of the riemann zeta and the polygonal function so the first test i'm doing is a density comparison i want to compare the density of the logistic uh pricing word with the you know the standard uh the standard the normal models that shows in bachelor what we have so i am comparing of course the log returns of the cpda the degum positive model log returns are skew logistic versus the normal normal uh so the logarithms in the black shows models which are um which are normal with the variance sigma with variance sigma square t and uh mean minus sigma squared t over two so uh i just drift adjusted in order to expo when you exponentiate you have a magnitude to have martingale relationship so what we see here is that as time progresses the normal distribution just you know there's a variance increase of course and there's a bit of a location shift back with location shift but the shape does not change which is in contrast when you consider cpda model what you see is that the skewness the shape of the distribution changes with t and the left tail becomes progressively heavier than the right one so you see which this this of course doesn't uh does not happen in a normal world and this is a remarkable fact which has implications uh for a marketing relation when you look instead of the comparison of the normal and logistic distribution once you variants match them so in the left in the left plus i haven't done variance matching here in the right hand side it must be much easier i did do that and you see that you know the in fact the the distribution are quite similar but kurtosis can be clearly appreciate okay so the blue line is the logistic word and the purple line is the normal word the normal plot so you see the double crossing here which indicates skewness for logistic distribution heavier tails and more peaked distribution around the mode so i have so that i also have is a cumulative stem structure i am plotting the cumulus as a function of time for blue again the logistic model and i am benchmarking again a linear revolution of the term structure which is typical for homogeneous models so levy models and what i observe is that i can generate much more flexible shapes in particular an exploding variant here and you know a short-term very steep increase of the skewness okay so this is not really black shoulders these are not black shows these are homogeneous models i should write here um that shows you symmetric so it should the line does not exist anyway uh so you see that there's a very very uh is a high rate of increase of negative skewness which indicates possibly might be connected with a steep a short-term volatility skew because of symmetry of the distribution also the kurtosi had created this is a very interesting flexible shape moving on so for the logistic um these are these are plots for the cpda model so log returns in the positive model the returns in the real valid model the ssla models have shown a similar pattern for the variants and the constant kurtosis which is a known fact for the logistic distribution it does not depend on scale and therefore it does not depend on the scale function in our case so finally implied volatility to the surface this is just an implied volatility finder normal unlock normal i have two models for just producers for the sla and cpda models volatility surfaces for some given model inputs i have 225 here 225 options i do a speed test and i see that this is very fast because the option formula are explicit known in close form and much simpler than even than that shows by the way i should mention when we look at the volatility surface we see that we have for some of implied volatility skew is present in the skewed distribution the positive one the cpga model okay so the log returns are skewed and this is reflected in unimplied volatility skill as you can see the deep in the money options are not come at a higher premium compared to their uh out of the money and the part of the money counterparts this is you you still have a slot a smile in the logistic distribution because of kurtosis but there is no uh there is no skew because the logistic distribution is symmetric and besides you see that the more the modal parameters also impact the volatility term structure in a similar way two parameters not very orthogonal um so maybe there is some work with the something can be improved in the parameterization which i have chosen so that's all i had um i'd be happy to take any comments uh or questions at my email address thanks uh for watching and the code will be uh uh made available publicly i understand so thanks for watching and i wish you a nice day
