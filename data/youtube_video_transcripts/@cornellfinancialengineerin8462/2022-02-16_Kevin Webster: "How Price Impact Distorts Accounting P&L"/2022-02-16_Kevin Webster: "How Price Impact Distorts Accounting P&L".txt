okay um well uh welcome to the first cornell financial data science seminar for the semester i'm really excited to have uh kevin webster talk about how price impact uh distorts accounting p l so um i've known kevin for a few years now and uh i've known him originally as a as a researcher and a phd student at uh princeton in the or department and um and then he went on to a brilliant um sort of applied in the financial industry career uh first at the butcher bank uh then at citadel always working on these uh um sort of high frequency trading topics and topics that i i very much like and always sort of at the interface of uh applied and um and theoretical work and more academic work so he's had um you know today he's coming with his academic hat and sort of his uh applied experience and giving us a sense of uh you know the what market impact really is and how it's accounted in practice and as so i'm really excited to have them tell you more about these uh these topics so kevin welcome to the seminar and i'm really looking forward to your talk thank you thanks sasha for the introduction and thanks roselle for for organizing this and thank you for having me at cfm ah before i let you start i'm just a few ground rules and um if you have questions please put them in the in the q a not the chat and i'm gonna put a link to uh the papers that kevin will talk about in the in the chat as well as a link to our youtube channel so without further ado go ahead thanks um so as i said i'll be talking about how price impact distorts accounting piano so as a motivation for this talk at the intersection between price impact and risk management specifically liquidity risk um i'd like to provide two quotes that i think are quite powerful the first one is by ben bernanke in a speech about the financial crisis um especially given 2010. in it bernanke states that the notion that financial assets can always be sold at prices close to the fundamental values is built into most economic analysis and before the crisis the liquidity of major markets was often taken for granted by financial market participants and regulators alike this quote relates uh the financial crisis um to price dislocations and these price dislocations are due to trading in the world of math finance we call that price impact the second quote comes from the seminal word by casualty bouchon farmer which i'm going to quote a lot um in this paper they reiterate the point bernanke makes about how price impact is a contributor to these liquidity crises and they propose a solution to quote the three authors the practice of valuation by marking to market with current trading prices is seriously flawed we propose an alternative accounting procedure based on the estimated market impact of liquidation that removes the illusion of profit i particularly like the last expression the illusion of profit and i hope to illustrate during this talk that that's really what's happening that because of price impact um initially traders and portfolio managers may have this illusion of profit may think that their current p l uh reflects their expected piano into the future only to find that um these profits evaporate either slowly over time or during a crisis they evaporate instantly and so these two quotes give a colorful picture um a causal picture with a chain of three events that lead to to this conclusion um the first event is trading trading causes market impact market impact in turn causes price dislocations away from financial values this is not a temporary effect temporary sensor is instantaneous it's an effect that builds up over time and then takes time to relax and finally these price dislocations lead to this illusion of profit this idea that portfolio managers and traders celebrate too early their wins only to see them evaporate over time now this is a nice colorful picture but uh our goal here is to not mathematically formalize this now to be completely fair the seminal work by cassioli bouchon farmer does provide a quantitative framework and it to some degree is more general because it allows any price impact model but i will try to have a more math finance point of view um to this uh problem and i will try to prove specific results under specific models with a emphasis towards the end on closed form formulas so this is a talk about price impact and liquidity risk um so i'll give a quick refresher of both um both for the part of the audience that's uh used to microstructure and the part that might not have seen this before um so at its core price impact is a causal model it's a cosmo for trading it states that if you hadn't traded the price wouldn't have moved the same way the way economists would phrase this is as a counterfactual trading of stock caused price moves to the stock that otherwise would not have happened traders prefer the terminology what if what if i had traded faster what if i had not traded at all to illustrate this consider the following simulation so i start off with a baseline trading speed which is whatever the historical trades were on my uh on my data and i see i observe a price path this would be this red price path there and i may ask the question or my trader may ask the question what if i had traded faster what if i had traded slower and the answer to those what if questions to these counterfactuals as economists would call these are the green line in the blue line which are simulated lines they do not exist in the historical data you have to use a model to to achieve them and so the intuition here is that price impact causes the price to get pushed further if you trade faster or more aggressively and if you trade slower or maybe not at all the price push would have been lower and eventually all these price dislocations all revert back to some unperturbed trajectory so this is at a very high level price impact obviously i'll provide more concrete mathematical formulas and definitions later in the talk um but i think it's important to have at least an idea of what price impact is supposed to achieve in practice um the industry uses price impact models for transaction call cost analysis often called tca and optimal execution there are plenty of other applications but these are the two most canonical ones to give an example i'm going to quote bershov and raklan there are two senior quants at alliance in bernstein who in 2013 used internal proprietary data of lions bernstein to both fit an impact model and apply it to tca in their paper the two authors state practitioners use impact models as a pre-trade tool to estimate the expected transaction cost of an order and to optimize the execution strategy to make this um a bit more tangible for the viewer um below i have a mock tca report all the numbers are completely fictitious and a real report will probably have even more numbers more confidence intervals definitely and um yeah but uh the goal is not for me to go line by line in this report or even column by column um rather i'm going to emulate this report from a liquidity perspective when i when i look at liquidity risk and the reason is this is a report that traders look at on a quarterly basis to evaluate their trades to evaluate how their algos are doing so this is something very tangible that traders are already used to that they already communicate to their perform address um i'll maybe give a very brief introduction to some of the columns for for the readers who aren't familiar um orders tend to be grouped by certain characteristics uh so these would be the groupings on on the left here and then the the three columns that are of most interest to the traders are order slippage price impact and alpha slippage order slippage because it's the objective function of the trader the trader wants to minimize the slippage of the order the lower the number the better but as anybody who does machine learning you know it's not enough to have the objective function you also need the gradient with respect to whatever decision variable you have available for the trader the main decision variable is whether to trade faster or slower and that's where price impact and alpha slippage come into play if most of the order slippage is due to alpha slippage aka that means that the the price move would have happened regardless of whether we traded or not then the trader would have liked to trade faster to capture more of that alpha conversely if most of the order slippage is due to price impact due to the mechanical moves that they've caused on on the price then they would have liked to trade slower so this illustrates how traders think about price impact how it's used in tca and we're going to try to emulate similar thought processes for managing liquidity risk on the liquidity risk side i'm going to first quote the european regulator the european securities and markets agency so asthma in 2020 published guidelines on how to run liquidity stress tests in those guidelines esma states managers using liquidity stress tests should simulate assets being liquidated in a way that reflects how the manager would liquidate assets during a period of exceptional market stress there's a lot in those guidelines not all of it relevant to to to this talk but amongst the technical specifications in these guidelines are are terms like fire sale and um an emphasis on the ability to simulate these reactions from the market these price dislocations that that bernanke mentioned so i modified a little bit the tca report to mock up a liquidy stress test report that would satisfy the as my guidelines and that report again i'm not going to go through all the columns and all the rows just as a as a very i can do that in the questions just as a very brief summary you have three scenarios no hedging mode hedging full hedging you obviously care about how much the hedging reduces the risk exposure but and this is the the part that relates to the liquidity part of the liquidity stress test you also want to be able to simulate these periods of exceptional market stress or these reactions from the market or these price dislocations and the terminology of the guidelines and so in those um in this report the way you do it is by computing the price impact due to your own hedging and the price impact due to the market reaction and you usually want to also have a sense of how quickly these dislocations pervert because these tend to be temporary dislocations kevin can i ask you a question about uh hedging because typically i we hear that word in the context of options so what do you mean exactly by hedging oh sorry in this case we're not delta hedging an option we're literally just reducing the position so in this context um it is synonymous to liquidation you're liquidating a position to reduce the risk so you're so the context here would be your wrist model tells you that you have too much risk maybe you have too much exposure to a specific factor or just to a single stock um and you want to reduce that exposure does that answer your question yeah so a fire sale doesn't oblige you to liquidate it it does not the term fire says i guess a little bit vague but the idea of a fire sale is whether you're considering hedging and the rest of the market is also hedging so it's more a question of correlated liquidation behavior so the two aspects of fire cell is that there is either the intent to liquidate or an actual liquidation happening and there is a contemporaneous liquidation by other market participants if it's just you liquidating and nobody else that would just be a standard liquidation and there wouldn't be this fear of contagion or this um high emphasis on um priceless locations due to other market participants you wouldn't have this statement here period of exceptional market stress and actually if you go again line by mind and as my guidelines they explicitly state you should not be using your vanilla optimal execution assumptions when doing one of these liquidity stresses you should be explicitly simulating a fire sale does that make sense thank you obviously the two are related like your your fire cell model shouldn't be completely different from your execution model because otherwise what data are you using but um there is that added ingredient of you're simulating the rest of the market as well um thank you that was a good question i'm now going to move on to the literature video so there's two strands of literature i need to review the liquidity stress test literature and the um price impact literature these are going to be reasonably brief there's obviously a larger body of work here but um the uh the most important pieces of work are on the risk risk management side the seminal work by cascioli boucheron farmer where they explicitly model the effect of price impact on accounting penile and liquidation costs and come to the conclusion that this is very applicable to risk management then there are the two documents by regulators by the u.s regulators the baffled committee and esma the european regulators and both of them essentially stress the importance of sorry portraits of wood of liquidity stress testing uh to avoid a situation such as um the 2008-2009 financial crisis and um maybe three-level high-level takeaways from these documents um the first one is that these liquidity stress tests should be used um they shouldn't just be a check the box exercise they should actually be used by decision makers so think traders risk managers or higher up um or and perform managers to to make decisions on the shape of the book that they want to have the second takeaway is that they should be simulation based and the third takeaway is that they should be based on a simulation of um price dislocations of the rest of them caused by the rest of the market these periods of exceptional market stress um or fire sales is the term that they also sometimes use uh the fourth and last document i'd like to highlight on the liquidity stress test side is a paper by rensselaer for context francelli is the author of the handbook of risk management and therefore comes from the mathematical risk management community so in in in his uh most recent paper he or in his recent paper rather uh he reimplements the uh framework from kazooie bouchon farmer um under the the the from his point of view so from his subfield uh risk management and he does so using both an empirical approach and a simulation approach um this talk can be seen as a third uh point of view on the same on the same approach more from a math finance and getting close from former's point of view speaking of math finance i'm going to anchor myself to the ob java and wang model so there's plenty of price impact models out there and i picked that one because it's the easiest to get close from formulas and um it can be generalized quite quite a fair bit that being said nothing here is specific to that model it's just the one i i like to use to illustrate things um so after the the original uh paper by object which i'm going to give the shorthand ow so after the original ow model uh jim gather approved absence of price manipulation strategies for that model and many other models and then a pair of papers i really like to highlight is a pair of papers written by fruit schweinerbahn urzoff where they find an alternative proof for the owml that greatly increases both its um [Music] its applicability and allows the use of allows the addition of lots of bells and whistles so with this significantly simpler proof you can generalize them all quite significantly in terms of what parameters can vary over time or be stochastic and you can also extend the number of applications and those papers really showcase the the power of having a simpler proof so i strongly recommend that pair of papers the last collection of papers i recommend are are the papers by early shorts um i put there one example the 2019 one where he and his students solve fit and implement on empirical data i believe it's lobster data the most general case of the ow model in terms of the contributions of this stock from a mathematical perspective the main contribution is a more formal mathematical setup of the framework by casio di bouchon farmer this includes definitions for various uh forms of p l so we'll see that there's multiple ways to define p l and they're obviously related to each other and we we'd like to relate them also to the expected closing value of a position out of these definitions arises a variable that will be of particular interest that i call the trading footprint of the portfolio and the reason it's of interest is because it seems to be the variable that ties all these things together and that is the most practical way to measure the distorting effect of price impact on accounting piano and finally using that framework i set up a simple but effective fire sale model which allows me to populate the numbers in the in the report i uh put at the beginning from a risk management perspective the contributions are mostly just to illustrate again that the points from cassioli bouchon farmer there aren't really new uh conclusions here just more um uh more illustrations of the the very powerful statements made by by that paper the first statement is that uh the accounting pnl the position significantly overestimates the closing value of that position um concretely what that means is that the number that traders and platform managers look at on a daily basis overestimates their final pinot when their position closes or when they finish the trade that the their p l will deflate the second insight from the paper is that this inflation property isn't some abstract mathematical uh theorem where you need to solve a very complicated say fbsde to estimate it now this is a quantity that you can measure in real time and that i will claim you can have on your trading screens as of tomorrow [Music] the last point and this is an important one is not only can you measure it in real time but it's actionable and the reason for that is if you have the ability to decompose losses into position inflation and permanent losses the position inflation part are these price dislocations which are typically temporary and depending on your willingness to stomach risk you may not want to lock in these losses conversely if you are very risk averse you may want to take these losses into account earlier and i'll show that optimal execution engines don't take these losses into account that concludes the introduction to my talk which i appreciate is a little bit on the longer side the next three sections of my talk are going to be uh more technical i'll start with a mathematical setup we'll formalize um what i'm trying to prove i'll then prove two examples of position inflation on on special cases of the ow model and then i'll apply my framework on concrete example or fire sale model in terms of my mathematical setup i give myself a filtered probability space and i need two spaces for my variables to live in a i give myself a space of stochastic processes l2 and the space of functionals l211 the reason why i need functionals is because price impact is ultimately a path dependent functional um this slide is here so that if i get more precise questions about the nature of these functionals i have that slide available once i have these spaces i can define some variables of interest the first variable of interest is my position q and it's derivative or it's different it's variations will be will represent my trader's trades and then as as it's customary in microstructure you don't have one single price you have multiple prices depending on what you're trying to achieve i'll start with the observed price which belongs in in the space of functionals so p is a function of t omega and q and the reason it is a function of q is because of this what if analysis i mentioned earlier because of price impact so p is the observed price all the market participants agree on the observed price think of it as the mid price um it is observed but it does depend on my actions on on cue if i choose q equals zero i then observe the unperturbed price st of omega in practice i tend to not set q equals zero so st omega is usually unobserved but that is the price that i would have had if i hadn't traded and so that becomes a stochastic process because it doesn't depend on q anymore so the gap between pt and st is the impact of the trader finally i have a transaction price p tilde now um the the point i'm trying to make with the transaction price is that every trader achieves a different transaction price the transaction price includes the bidas threat traded achieved either received or paid depending on whether you're providing or taking equity but just because i see a trade at mid say in a dark pool doesn't mean that i can achieve that trade different traders based on the quality of the algorithms on the latency of their infrastructure may achieve different transaction prices so the observed price and the unpredictable price is common to all the traders other market participants but the transaction price because of the bid ask spread will depend on the nature of the trader on their ability to capture certain opportunity opportunities on the market so these four quantities defined i can now have my p l i'll start with the unambiguous part of the p l which is the cash account there's no ambiguity as to what the value of my cash account is if i have ten dollars in my bank account that is the value of my cash position so that leads to the formula above for the full p l i need to value my stock position so people who are more familiar with option pricing know this problem should i trust my pricing model or should i trust the prices on the market here the question is what price should i use to mark my stock position should i use the price including the price impact or excluding the price impact and there's a whole continuum partly because i could have multiple pricing back miles partly because there are other ways of defining p note i'll focus on two definitions the first definition is the accounting p l and that just means marking the stock position to the mid price the observable price this p l is a canonical p l and it's in some sense the most practical piano because it's model free i can agree with my trader with my portfolio manager or with regulators or with anybody on the street as to what the mid price is and therefore what the value of my position is based on that mid price so the accounting canal has a definite advantage over any other uh pn measure of p l which is that it's model free it's what the platform manager and the trader see on their screens on a daily basis or intraday basis if if they probably because they'll monitor it more closely but if you look at the internals of the execution engine or if you look at any of the literature on optimal execution and you look at the running pnl that these algorithms track it's not the accounting piano instead what the optimal execution algorithms track is the fundamental keynote where you subtract the impact um [Music] and that creates a gap between what the trader and portfolio addresses and what their trading algorithm sees as the p l of a trade if you ask a trader why is there a gap why do you see a number why does the execution algorithm that you use use a different number the answer usually goes along the lines that you don't want to provide an incentive to the execution algorithm to push up the price and that's the reason why execution algorithms use the financial piano to avoid weird behaviors now i'm going to define the trading footprint that's the difference between these two notions of p l so ft is just going to be the difference between the accounting piano that the traders see in their screen and the fundamental p l that the trading algorithm uses to make decisions at this point you might ask the question what's the correct p l you gave me two definitions uh which one's the correct one which one should i trust um so the good news is there's one point in time where that distinction doesn't matter which is when i close the position this is probably an obvious statement but if you have no stock position the ambiguity is lifted all these definitions of p l agrees because there's no stock position to to mark to a price so let me give myself a stopping time t at which uh my position is closed um and i will call x t the closing piano and in some sense the intuition that most people have is that they want to see the expected closing piano of their position and intuitively you'd think that the accounting p l is an estimate of the closing p l of a position and the answer is that's not the case now part of that is just you need to be able to liquidate a position but even taking into account liquidation costs or even if you hold the position if you don't choose not to liquidate the position you still have this property that i call position inflation now you do need some assumptions it's not it doesn't hold all the time uh it either holds an expectation or it holds under certain conditions on your trading strategy but my goal in the section section of the talk is to provide some assumptions under which this very common assumptions under which this inequality holds so first let me give myself an impact model because it's going to be hard otherwise to to prove anything um so i there are two cases that i care about the original ow mole where the coefficients are constant and they generalize the w mole that fruits froener bond and oversoft look at or that overshores also looks at so both of them are linear stochastic differential equations and either the coefficients are constant or they're stochastic and there there is a no arbitrage condition between lambda and beta for for this model to make sense there's also self-financing equation condition that needs to be satisfied for all this to make sense i'm not going to prove any of these statements you can go back to these papers or you can ask me questions at the end um if if these equations aren't clear or if it's not clear where the self-financing equation comes from with this choice of impact model or this class of impact model you can already start decomposing the expected closing key out so i give myself again a stopping time t at which the position is closed and i want to evaluate the expected p l at closing time and what i find is that it's equal to the accounting p l plus a number of other terms the first term is the trading footprint and that's going to be the first order term then there are two additional terms that basically capture future trading profits so at this point i can already say that the trading footprint is the bias that the accounting piano introduces because even if i suddenly stopped trading if i just held the position and did not do any further um did not engage in any further trading activities my accounting pena would still be biased a biased estimate of the closing kingdom i can be a little bit more precise if i've captured all the alpha opportunities up to now and don't plan to do any future alpha opportunities so the price s as a martingale from time little t to big t and i'm not going to be particularly tactical about how i'm going to liquidate i just have some liquidation far into the future i'm not going to be particularly tactical about it i'm not going to try to find the best liquidation strategy just a standard liquidation strategy then you get this convergence result here which is that the expected closing p now converges to the fundamental p l minus the far away liquidation costs and so this statement shows that the fundamental p now is a much better estimate of the final closing keynote um it's basically the estimate if you didn't have if you didn't plan on liquidating and then you can always tack on a an estimate of the liquidation costs which will depend on on your liquidation strategy um so at this point this already shows that the the first order effect here when i talk about the bias that accounting can now introduce is measured by the trading footprint so let me have a closer look at the trading footprint i define it as the difference between the accounting p l and the fundamental p l but it can also be rewritten as just the position times the impact state and the powerful point here that i'd like to make a practical point is this is not the solution to complicated fbsd this is a variable that you can compute and observe in real time i'd like to go even one step further the trading system already computes your position in real time your optimal execution algorithm already computes your impact state in real time you could therefore have this quantity on your trading screen as of tomorrow because both of them already computed somewhere in your trading system the second statement is the one that i'm going to try to prove in the next section which is that this quantity on average is positive again depends on certain assumptions um in certain condition under certain conditions you can even show that it's almost surely positive but in general it's only positive in expectation and so that that's going to be the reason why accounting keynote will be biased so let me try to prove this position inflation property i'll start with the first case um which is more aimed at the point of view of a trader so trader likes to think of trades not positions and so typically they like to pair up trades have a position entering trade and a position exiting trade and the reason is you don't know the final piano of your trade until you exit the position but again they don't like thinking of a portfolio that constantly oscillates up and down they'd rather see the position entering trade and position exiting trades technically there's no loss of generality because i can always apply an algorithm like fifo or lifo to match every position entering with every position exiting trade but it is a little bit time consuming and not very practical but from a purely um trader and tuition perspective this is a very good representation of the world there is a position entering trade some waiting period and then eventually the position exits and so i'm going to show is that during the position entering phase if it's monotonic we will see position inflation and then naturally that position inflation will stay during the holding phase and will eventually evaporate either during the holding phase or during the leverage decrease phase so even if you don't end up decreasing uh liquidating the position you will see that footprint evaporate as the price impact reverts back to zero so let me let me state my mathematical proposition so i give myself a trading process i give myself an extended w model i start off from a zero impact state and i need to make two assumptions the first one is i enter this position monotonically otherwise there might be some tactical strategies that show up the second statement is i do need a upper bound on how quickly the mean reversion happens on the on the model so under these three assumptions i have a lower bound on the trading footprint and it's positive um and so that's that's the mathematical statement the trading footprint is positive when you enter a position but let me take a step back here um and focus on the trader intention here even if your trade has no alpha even if the price is a martingale the trade will mechanically look profitable on average it will actually be have negative expectations because of transaction costs but basically you move the price by the full impact and you only pay half of the impact and transaction cost so at least temporarily you will look um profitable so this is this expression of illusion of profit that uh busho talks about those profits do not stay as soon as you hold the position it will slowly decay or if you liquidate the position by no price manipulation there isn't a way to lock in these profits otherwise you'd have an arbitrage which we know is not possible at this point i'd like to pause to go back to the original paperback as julie bouchon farmer because they they make it somewhat similar um argument um with a different model and and not exactly the same proof but they at this point of the analysis they ask two uh in my opinion very important practical questions and they answer them as well the first practical question is when should you monitor these prices locations these illusions of profit the answer to that is as early as possible because these are mechanical piano moves there's no reason for you for you to wait until you've accumulated these illusory profits and are forced to liquidate for some reason so rather than doing risk management right before the liquidation you can use these methods to anticipate these illusions of profit as you enter them the second question is how to monitor price dislocations how to monitor these things and i've already answered this question but i just want to repeat it you already have all the building blocks in your trading system you already have the price impact model in your execution algorithm so the answer to the question how to monitor these prices locations the answer is with little additional effort now i'll go back to the math so i'll prove price inflation in the second case the second case will be significantly less general but it'll be a lot more practical and intuitive to put four managers and the reason is as i stated before this whole matching algorithm between the position entering the position um uh ending trade closing trade is very intuitive to traders but not intuitive to portfolio managers they think of their portfolio more as in steady state whenever they enter position they have to liquidate a different position whenever they liquidate a position they tend to enter a new position and also sometimes they don't fully liquidate a position they oscillate around some value so again they prefer to think of their portfolio as a whole not as a sequence of paired trades and they prefer to think of it not as entering and exiting but in some kind of stationary limit obviously sometimes they they move away from it they go from one stationary uh state to a different stationary state and that's obviously interesting but i'm going to treat the case where there are in the stationary limit so i'm going to use the original w model just so i can get close from formulas for this case but the result can be generalized and i'm going to have to define what it means to be a stationary portfolio and intuitively you have to control two things you have to control the size of the portfolio that's measured by qt squared but you also have to control the turnover of the portfolio and this should be intuitive um to traders and portfolio managers um you can hold the size of the portfolio constant but increase the turnover and that will dramatically affect the the behavior of your portfolio in the math finance world you can control the turnover portfolio by controlling the size of the impact state um there's a one-to-one map between the two and it's mathematically more convenient to control the impact state so i'm going to control i'm going to define a stationary portfolio as a portfolio for which i t squared and qt squared is constant under these assumptions i can show that in the stationary limit the train footprint is positive and i have a close and formal effort in addition to that because i'm in the stationary limit i can talk about the running transaction costs in this stationary limit and i find that these running transaction costs are proportional to the trading footprint and the proportionality depends on the on the time scale of the impact model this is a very practical result because most traders and platform managers have a pretty good idea of what their running transaction costs are and so the the result here is if you know roughly what your running transaction costs are well just by knowing the time scale of the propagator you get a pretty good estimate of how much your position is inflated how much illusion of profit you have that you might lose if you start having to liquidate this position rather than stay in steady state so that's a very important formula we can also simulate all of this obviously i have closed conformance so i don't need to but you could generalize this to models which you don't have closer formulas or on empirical data on empirical portfolios so if i give myself a simulated portfolio long short equally balanced between long and shorts it's an on-sign-on-deck process so i can control exactly the size of the portfolio and its turnover the other parent to tau and i can plot um its characteristics so you see i successfully managed to have a constant position and to vary the turnover um and you can also see the trading footprint is always positive and is proportional to the daily transaction cost i've picked an impact model with a time scale of one and therefore the two are equal as expected so this highlights that all of these formats aren't just theoretical they can be simulated on empirical data on some on simulated data and you have close performance as well and this is a real effect this concludes the second section of my talk and now i'm going to apply the framework and some of these results to a fire sale model um so to begin with i'm actually going to talk about liquidation without fire sale and this goes back to your question sasha what what is the fire cell and how is that different from from [Music] what does it add to the to the model so i'm going to start with a standard liquidation model actually it's not quite standard in the usual liquidation or in the optimal execution um literature you start off with a zero impact state that's a reasonable assumption if you're entering a position there's no reason to believe that the impact state would be biased in any way in your favor but when you're liquidating a position i've just spent 40 minutes trying to convince you that there's this phenomenon called position inflation and that almost by definition the impact state when you're starting to liquidate a position cannot be zero it is almost always biased in your favor and unfortunately that's going to be painful when you're liquidated because you're going to have inflation you're going to have an inflated penile and it's going to violently decrease um the second uh addition which is new compared to the optimal execution uh literature is is this distinction i made between uh accounting p l and fundamental p now because as i stated all the optimal execution literature or your optimal execution engine maximizes the fundamental keynote which is all good because that's the real piano of your book but in the short term uh the risk manager might say that that doesn't match what i'm seeing that's not the drawdown i see and to match the drawdown you see in accounting female you also need to keep track of the trading footprint so suddenly if you're risk averse you may not want to minimize uh the trading costs you may also want to minimize the effect on the trading footprint because that's the short-term drawdown that you will see on the flip side if you are not risk averse the trading footprint captures temporary penile movements that you might be willing to stomach and that others might not be willing to stomach so there's a little bit of a trade-off and different objective functions depending on whether you are willing to stomach these temporary losses or whether you are not willing to and you you want to minimize the accounting piano uh the accounting drawdown as a whole so i'm not going to interpret the the coefficients because i'm probably running out of time they could be interpreted and everything is post form so it's quite easy i'm just going to give some plots um from simulations in those spots you can see that the dependency on the impact state is quite high if you have a large impact state to begin with which is typically the case then most of the losses will be temporary because they show up in the trading footprint conversely if so you'll see more losses but most of them will be temporary if you have low to no initial impact state again not usually the norm you will see lower drawdowns but they will all be permanent there will be no temporary aspect to them so that's a good baseline to work with but i haven't actually added the fire sales the idea that other people are trading at the same time that's going to change change these equations a little bit first i need to model the fire sale so i'm not going to solve a nash equilibrium where all these quantities would be endogenous because that would be hard absolutely doable and i again point to the papers by um well which horse has a paper vos has a paper there's a couple of papers on optimal execution as a nash equilibrium you'd have to modify them for the fire sale case especially with this non-zero impact state that i think is very important for this because of this position inflation but these are doable i'll do the case where uh the partial equilibrium case where i just give myself a candidate hedge from the rest of the market and importantly a candid initial impact state from the rest of the market and my argument there is if i'm hedging a position and that position was inflated and i'm assuming the rest of the market is also hedging a position there's no reason why their position wouldn't have been inflated too so just as important as quantify as quantifying the hedging trades from the rest of the market is also quantifying how much they've contributed to the inflation on this particular stock so when i do that i get these modified p ls both for the permanent part of the p l and the temporary part the trading footprint again i'm running out of time so i'm not going to interpret these coefficients even though you know they could be interpreted as correlation terms between my trades and their trades um and everything's closed form but again i'll just focus on on some pictures and what these show overall is that these crowding effects these fire sale effects um only affect the permanent part of your penal if you're actually aggressively hedging if you're not aggressively hedging they will not show up in your parent keynote however they will always affect your accounting piano the temporary part will always be affected even if you don't hedge you will see a massive drawdown because of the hedge from other market participants the question is do you want to act upon that or do you want to stomach it that concludes the third section i i'm going to give three high-level takeaways from the talk and then i'll open up to questions the first takeaway and the the main one if you had to take one thing away from this talk is that the accounting pl that traders and portfolio managers see on their screens overestimates the final closing p l of their trades and positions and from math finance perspective i've only proven position inflation in two cases i think there's a more general result um i think it has to be an ergodicity type result but i think there's more general results here at play the second takeaway is that price impact manners for risk management actually i go as far as say price impact is almost as important as a risk model the reason for that is at the end of the day we want risk management to be actionable and the way you act upon risk is by liquidating it and to liquidate uh you need a price impact null the third takeaway is that managing liquidity risk starts before you end up with a illiquid position you sh you should be able to quantify these effects especially these mechanical p l movements i've just described these biases in your p l these are not difficult problems these are problems that if you have the impact already you can mechanically predict them ahead of time and this concludes my talk thank you for listening and i'm open to questions okay kevin thank you so much um so feel free to add questions in the q a i have a few questions of my own so i'll start with those and uh and as uh if we get some more questions i'll read them from the crowd um so the first question i had was um how accurate are typical price impact models and because i guess how precise the estimate of position inflation will depend on how good your price impact model is does it mean that everybody will have very different estimates of what their position inflation or do you think that um typically people tend to agree on on on those um now so um that is a that is a good question in the sense of there are definitely a lot of price impact models out there they usually agree quite tightly on the brunt of the data if that makes sense um uh so whatever your typical speed is whatever your typical size is uh most impact malls across brokers or internal will will agree just because there's so much data at that granularity that you shouldn't have any problem and all the models capture the the the center of the curve whether whether you use a bucho style parallel or or a number gentleman they will all agree the problem is at the end of the day you would like to measure this for you you'd like to have the tails both in size and in duration so to give an example the demo fitted by oarish horst uh provides a time scale of over of roughly a couple of days let's say two to three um tends to have models where the time scale is measured in months for the brunt of the data it doesn't matter they they fit the same way but if you're looking at um these at risk management over longer horizons those things start adding up um similarly for size um so um so the answer to your question is for most of the most uh use cases there should be full agreement but if if you're pushing the the envelope a little bit on either duration or size yes you you will have to be a little bit careful and you might have to create a a specific impact model for this okay so different impact models have may disagree not just on the dollar amount or the change that the price has been impacted but also the time over which is yes to disappear right yes and i'd say that's actually in some sense the scarier part because it's one thing to say like i have some temporary dislocation and it's x amount you see a drawdown of um y and and you know that let's say half of it is temporary it does matter whether that temporary uh dislocation is a couple of days or measured in like is of the order of magnitude of a month um so that does matter but again if for if you're looking at a standard order or standard position uh measuring position inflation that should be pretty non-controversial and straightforward so if you're just trying to de-bias your traders or perform managers um any impact model will do so um so if you do sort of as as you said uh keep track of your position inflation using your um your impact model um how does it typically help a trader make a decision so um the is it so for example in in your picture the one you had very earlier on where you had these slow trading fast trading and middle of the road trading does this mean that exiting the trade yeah this one um i think so i think what you're asking is how actionable is this yeah from a risk management perspective is very actionable because it says you know these drawdowns it's a temporary part and a permanent part and depending on whether you're more your objective function is to minimize the drawdown or to stomach it you you either want to act upon the drawdown or you don't does that make sense um from a trader and performance perspective it's mostly a communication thing i don't think there's that much of an action set besides not pre-celebrating a successful trade that actually isn't that successful does that make sense the only actionable point though is for portfolio manager who is going from one steady state to another steady state so if you have a current turnover and size and you want to go to either higher turnover book or lower turnover book you're going to have to communicate ahead of time that if you're going to a higher turnover book or higher size book you're going to mechanically increase your p l and that that p l is not sustainable um you're just inflating your that that's not you know that's going to stay in your book conversely if you're deleveraging the book either by reducing turnover by reducing size you will mechanically lose p l because you're deflating that that depth that you have that position inflation and you might want to communicate that because otherwise people might start second guessing why you're deflate while you're reducing your your your exposure so um from a risk management perspective i think there's a very clear action set from a trader and performance perspective it's mostly a communication thing by not by understanding if your p l is mechanical or you by removing the mechanical part of the penile rather you can focus on what's your actual alpha what's your actual uh edge here on the trade so for example can you just go to the next one the the one that had this illustration or rather the one that had the um uh the picture of the three types of impact oh sorry the very first one yeah exactly um so in these three scenarios uh when so the trading and i presume is ending when they're most yeah at the peak so that would be at the end of the trade yeah exactly does it imply that you know if i exit the trade i may be incentivized to exit it if i did a fast fill that i may be incentivized to to exit earlier than if i hadn't done not so the reason for that is the no no price manipulation so you might say hey i have this illusion of profit and it eventually evaporates why shouldn't i why shouldn't i just lock in the the product and you can't basically either lose the position that's that's part of the proof position inflation isn't just like hey you have k now and you might be able to get or you might not be able to no you always lose it you either lose it because you hold the position and just deflates over time or you lose the position because you liquidate it immediately so just think of the two thought experiments the two extremes i hold the position for forever by mechanically that position inflation has to revert that down to zero now the other extreme is as soon as i enter it i want to lock in the profit and i liquidate well the the no arbitrage argument tells you that that will also be uh zero or even negative p l does that make sense so there is no way for you to lock in these profits if you make profits it has to be through some other variable but the position inflation is called that way because there's no way for you to these profits have no way to become permanent yeah all right well uh in the meantime we've got a few q a's in the um in the chat so uh the first one is could you give an interpretation of the coefficients from the fire sale models which you said like correlations yes so if you if you look at these extra terms here um the fundamental p l is mostly driven by this correlation between my initial impact state and the initial impact caused by the rest of the market and then my hedges and the hedges from the rest of the market so the more i'm correlated with the rest of the market the more painful this is going to be conversely if i were contrarian um that would actually uh be beneficial to me and then you you can go a little bit further than that analysis depending on how much you choose to trade like the relative contribution of the impact correlation versus the position correlation i could be contributing less i could have entered the position earlier and my footprint could have already reverted more but i start off with a larger position and conversely i could be the other way around that could be more of a higher frequency i have a larger footprint but a smaller position and and then that formula gives a slightly different answer in general the the footprint is the main variable more than the position actually um did that answer that particular question or is more detail needed for the most part you can just directly read from here that like that these are correlation coefficients especially because the um sorry i should have mentioned that liquidation costs in this small are quadratic so if i if i divide if i write this as a ratio of the of the of the of the two um liquidation costs i literally get a correlation coefficient um okay well uh john uh seems to say that that was uh answered his question and we have marcos asking would a running calculation of an impact adjusted meta order be helpful to calibrate the model um so what are running calculation impact adjusted method uh so i'm not 100 understand the question it seems like an interesting question so one uh element i see in the question you tell me if i'm completely missing the point here is can i trust my regular impact model in a fire sale environment um if that is the question i would say unfortunately you won't have that much data outside of of of your regular impact model what you can do is the main in my model the main distinction between a non-fire sale and fire sale is the fact that you're correlated with the rest of the market so you're going to assume that the coefficients are the same uh whether the rest of the market or not is trading or not and then what's making the transaction costs higher during a fire sale is not that the impact coefficient is higher but that you're trading with the rest of the market now in practice most of these most of these coefficients also scale with volatility and scale inversely with the liquidity on the order book so they will also mechanically move up but you do you will likely not have enough data to fit a model only in 2008 2009 or similar crises so you're going to have to make the the assumption that the extra costs come from the parameters scaling up during high volatility liquidity regime and from the correlation with the rest of the market i would actually say that this approach has the advantage of you not needing to kind of bump up the impact coefficient as much during crisis periods because you have this correlation that contributes already a fair bit from a regulation perspective what kind of institutions would be affected by this bias corporate bonds would seem to have a higher bias of maybe insurance companies i will admit that i don't know very much outside of equities so i am not sure how to answer that question um i i i will admit the mathematics seem to me somewhat general um if you have multiple definitions of p l you start asking the question of which one estimates the closing p now more accurately but i'm not sure um besides maybe the the slightly cop-out answer of if it's less liquid then this is probably going to be more of a bigger effect um um besides that that kind of standard answer i don't have a great uh detailed answer i'm sorry okay kevin well thanks a lot for this really engaging talk um i really like the the idea of these traders uh celebrating right after entering a trade and this sort of celebration always coming uh you know looking uh like um maybe too optimistic a few days or maybe a few months later uh and and thanks for giving us the math to sort of uh really understand what's going on here so um so again thanks for the talk and the this talk will be on our youtube channel that uh i've posted the link so if uh you need to look at the talk a second time that it'll be there waiting for you and we have a few exciting talks coming up in march and april so um so stay stay tuned and and see you on the next one thank you very much thank
