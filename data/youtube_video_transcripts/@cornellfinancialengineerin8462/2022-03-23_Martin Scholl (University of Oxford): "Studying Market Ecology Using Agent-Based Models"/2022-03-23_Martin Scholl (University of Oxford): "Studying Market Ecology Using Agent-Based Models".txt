okay we're recording okay well um welcome to our second seminar of the semester um i'm really happy to have martin shaw here from the university of oxford he's a computer science phd student in his last year and i got to know about his work already a couple years ago when i went to a webinar presented by doing farmer who's um who's really done some great work in in general in the in the realm of econophysics and uh ecology and sort of a lot of very creative um sort of points of view on the market and uh he was presenting this work uh that he was uh that he had done with barton and showing some really cool uh charts that i'm sure you'll see today um from the person who made the triad so i'm really excited to have uh martin talk about uh um market ecology or rather studying market ecology using agent-based models so uh if you have any questions please put them in the q a and i'll uh i'll ask them towards the end or um or in the middle if it seems appropriate and well martin go for it glad to have you thanks for having me sasha um and as a uh mentioned um this presentation will contain some some uh work i did together with my supervisor uh don farmer and uh ali khan karen esco as well and mike waldridge at the department of computer science in oxford so a brief overview um uh i'm going to draw an analogy between the world of biology and finance and for this we need some some common background background to talk about this um next up i'll present my model and set of simulated experiments on on this model and from this we'll draw some lessons about understanding financial markets in the real world and how we might uh apply tools from biology to real world data um this isn't going to focus much on uh what the limitations are to uh uh common assumptions like the efficient market hypotheses uh that many uh models uh built upon um instead i think there are several uh main several complaints that i have against the typical rational expectations equilibrium theory that is used in in the neoclassical finance and um this mainly has to do with the fact that um irrational expectations equilibrium demands that all of the the participants in our markets that their understanding really matches the real world that they operate in um if you look at the finance literature then there's more than 300 factor models that have been published and which are claimed to be statistically significant but we don't know which is it the true one or which which is the best one to use and in practice if you um if you look at what kinds of investment funds operate then you will find a wide diversity of different investment funds um there's even firms like morningstar and liver who help investors uh pick the right investment fund for them just because such a heterogeneity of different approaches to investing um on top of this there are some empirical results that show of course that people are abundantly rational in in their decision making and so there's some biases they they show irrational preferences uh in some experiments um and finally um a bit weaker but still important is there simply uh physical limits on the cognitive ability of uh retail investors but also those of fund managers uh so whether it's processing information uh about the markets or uh computing the optional the the optimal execution strategy to uh to execute on those uh beliefs um there are computational limitations on that as well um finally um if we assume also that all our opponents are rational and we want to reply rationally to this it quickly quickly leads to all kinds of uh paradoxes um you probably know this already so um instead i'm going to draw an analogy between ecology and financial markets and um it works it looks a bit like this in that an investment strategy uh corresponds to a species in biology so in the individual investors now they correspond to individuals of a given species um and the aggregate wealth that is invested using one particular strategy say for example a growth investing this now corresponds to the abundance or the the total population size of the species in biology um of course uh as these investors they incur losses and they make some profits hopefully um the wealth of their species species changes in time and this leads to different relative sizes of these species in the entire population of investors um of course they're all interacts in the in the same centralized markets so we should be able to observe some interactions between the different species so we start with a toy model really of an investment game so we give our agents um a simple choice uh the first choice is to leave your money in your your money market account and you obtain this deterministic interest rate the other option is that you buy a stock in the market and this stock happens to pay dividends and we define a process here but more or less uh describes the defense um uh it's fairly realistic although then in the real world dividends are quite infrequent in here we pay them daily but um the tendency for dividends to increase and to grow geometric geometrically corresponds to the real world and also the tendency for the to be trends is also what we observe in dividends uh dividend payments in the real world um so we we give our agents uh a choice of allocating their wealth between these options and this this can be any uh any fractional allocation they can also short sell and they can also borrow in order to get a leverage position in in the stock this discusses uh two very simple accounting equations namely your wealth uh is the amount of cash that you have uh at this point in time and also the marketing market value of your stocks minus any loans that you might have and the second accounting equation that we have is our returns so this is different equation um i'm working discrete time here because uh we will move on to uh simulation shortly but this should work in continuous time as well um so your returns are determined by the interest that you gain on your cash but you also have to pay on your loss um plus any returns on the stock so changes in the stock price of our one time span plus any dividends that were paid out in this time span um so the the pile here stands for the returns and this will pop up later so uh going back to smoking um is it um a very big limitation that there's only one stock or is this sort of uh in order is this do do you think of this as uh not a very important detail um it's a simplifying assumption in that um uh in the market mechanism that i will talk about shortly this sill allows us to find unique uh clearing prices most of the time if you introduce more stocks then you get sets of market clearing prices uh and so the analysis becomes much more difficult okay thanks but um there's no reason why this shouldn't work for for many more socks um okay so let's talk about a species um so in the neoclassical assumption there's only one specie and this is the the perfect rational investor [Music] but as i mentioned there are some objective objections to to this um one of it is that people in the market might have completely different reasons why they're in the in the market in the first place um financial firms are there to profit from trading but uh ultimately consumers for example they might enter the market in order to to purchase something that they will later consume um and they they they specialize in something entirely different than the trading in the market and said uh they focus their attention on that and it's only in the market that they happen to interact with different species namely the market maker and the investment fund and so on um another good is in biology we have the neighboring habitats as i said uh a fish for example is uh very much uh designed for swimming and so on uh the the bear uh interacts uh with the the fish in in the stream where it can try to catch it but uh um we wouldn't say that uh for example um the the the fish is somehow supports them all at uh surviving because it's not as good as uh surviving these encounters as the the berries um so um our first axis of uh splitting the the strategies in the market is by saying well there's going to be a a group of people who simply come in the market to take liquidity out of it and um they're not as sensitive to the the price as the financial institutions that operate in this in this market from from day to day the other reason why we want to subdivide our aspects of strategies is that um optimizing for something this causes energy and so it may be beneficial to special specialize yourself into a certain niche um [Music] so famously darwin looked at all the these finches on the galapagos islands and he founded these birds uh optimized for the the local conditions uh in these different habitats uh even though they share a nearby common ancestor um in in finance we can also observe this in that there's many failure investment funds there's many growth investment funds their models are quite closely related but they tend to specialize in different things because in acquiring information and in doing their analyses um it is beneficial to them to to focus on one thing um so uh let's put the strategies in uh in a simple form um in this case the strategy will be defined by an access demand function um this form is a form we borrowed from a classical paper by by cherella but basically what's going on is that the the excess demand uh of the agent is determined by some large term here on the left um uh which which is the demand part and on the right we have uh their holdings at the previous time which is their supply to the market so excess demand is demand minus supply um having just discussed the supply the demand is given by the net asset value of the investor times their desired leverage ratio lambda bar divided by the price this is multiplied by um a term here saying how much of the of their total leveraged wealth they should invest in the stock um the term between brackets here as you can see this is going to be bounded and there's this fi function um if you look at the paper you can find all the details but basically this file function is what you would call a signal function in investing um if phi is very large um you would like to buy the stock then this term will be positive and the amount here on the left-hand side uh will will be some large number uh which is going to be scaled by your wealth your leverage ratio and the growing market price um if your signal is uh zero uh you will be indifferent between the stock and the cash um this term will go to one half you will you will split your net asset value uh between the stock and the cash and if phi is uh negative and it is sufficiently negative um you will open a short position you will short so the stock leading to a negative excess events um so we had um a stop paying dividends um and one way to split up the perfectly rational strategy is to say that uh one strategy will do only one one task of uh failure going with the stock um and one task here being discounted with the dividends um so we have one value investor um who's able to uh discount dividends um the no uh required weight uh a required rate of return okay um and they're able to observe these different patterns and in in simulation time they're able to estimate the growth rate on this dividend and so they're able to make a forecast what i believe the the dividends will be in the future and what the price of the the stock should be at this moment um so it uses observed information um it doesn't have access to the true parameters of this different process um so for for this reason uh it is already abundantly rational but also it doesn't factor in the the trend in the in the dividends and but again back into the the framework of the investment strategy um we now have an estimate of what the fundamental value should be um if we take here the the difference between what our estimate is and what the current market price is we we can get this signal which basically tells us whether we should buy mainly if market prices are below what do we think it's worth or whether we should short sale which happens when market prices are much higher than the estimate of the fundamental value the other strategy we put into this model are the the trend followers um and they're basically able to uh look at israel prices and extrapolates those trends so uh our signal is simply going to be the difference between the most recently realized market price and the one before that um these types of strategies are from technical trading strategies and in this case uh it's not entirely irrational because of course we had a trend in the the dividend process so there's a physical trend in the investment and uh finally um we have the the noise traders and these are um sort of the market outsiders so these are people that come into the market in order to fill uh fulfill some liquidity needs uh but they're not that sensitive to the price you're paying and so the way we model this is that um that if you were to observe these these nice trailers on the on a short time scale it may look like they're trading more or less randomly um that their signal is is going to be very much like a like a noisy process but long time scales itself connected to the fundamental value and the way we do this is by connecting um this mean reversing noise process back into the fundamental value so we have some parameters that uh busher and colleagues estimate which is that uh it takes around six years for from market prices to half their distance to the the fundamental value so in in practice this means that this mean uh reversing term here the the row uh is quite close to one so so this will revert back to the mean quite slowly okay um as i mentioned the the market mechanism that we use um it's going to be a evaluation auction uh there will be a market maker uh which is going to choose a price such as the the uh excessive amount over all agents i here is going to be zero for that price um there's some limitations to this um so uh even in one dimension so with one stock um this means that a price is a solution is not necessarily guaranteed and it's also not always unique um if you restrict the strategies to those that we have then uh this is never really a problem but in the general case for arbitrary strategies this one work um this makes analytical treatment difficult because we have to deal with this multitude of possible solutions so what we do is we simulate it um but i should not however that alternative approaches exist but they need some much stronger assumptions namely in another study uh by bush's group for example they assume that there is uh a rational market maker who also has infinite wealth so that the market maker can absorb any excess demand that that isn't met um another thing you could do would be for example to simulate a realistic market such as the limit or a book the problem there is that those mechanisms are already so detailed that it's quite difficult to drive a rational execution strategy so something that leads to a competitive equilibrium leads to uh market clearing prices so in in practice if you if you do that then you find that very frequently frequently the market doesn't entirely clear and demands may not be met um nonetheless all of these market mechanisms are really interesting to look at and so we we have this software package that we use uh to simulate this these different market mechanisms uh for engine-based simulations and i will share the link with you later onto the experiments um what we do in all of the following experiments is if we we fix uh endowments um these are sort of arbitrary numbers but this means that uh our results will be comparable between the different runs of the model um initially we uh give all of the agents in equal amounts of cash and equal dollars worth of shares um the endowment is divided uh over the the individuals of different species but uh we keep track of the the relative share that we put between the different species of the noise traders fellow implicits and trend followers and uh we're going to attract this through the discussion um the the relative share is going to be this this triplet of uh how much was given to the noise trace initially how much did the value investors receive at the start of the simulation and how much should the trend followers get um this naturally gives us a phase space to look at our simulation um which is a simplex um the relative shares that get these very centric coordinates for example the the coordinates in the bottom left would be the one where the the noise striker has all of the capital so the the the noise rider here uh would have a high percentage and the other two would have uh almost uh nothing right here in the middle the percentages would be 33 for all three of them um what we do now is um to a fine scale we enumerate all of these possible subdivisions uh so just make a really long list of uh how we could divide these endowments uh initially and then we started multi-card assimilation for all of those different initial conditions um we then take a run of 200 years for this market and we're going to look at the mean annual return for each of the species um going back to the the syntax that you just saw take every every coordinate in there um we're going to color because each accordion is according to which strategy was the most uh profitable at this point and we then obtained this figure um so the the first thing we observe is that um uh for all the strategies there's at least one region where they are the most profitable um it happens for all three of them to be in a region where they're often not the most abundant consider for example uh the value investor in blue it would be most abundant in the right bottom corner but the region where it's most profitable is on the left so where it's actually not that's abundant um there's also something else going on here at uh at the top so since we're doing a simulation we're limited to a finite slice of this market and here at the top where there's many trend followers we find that prices diverge from the fundamental and this leads to massive uh profits and losses um it also depends uh a bit on the the random realization of the dividend process and the the random noise that an australian introduced um so this creates these large outliers that creates this this speckled noise here because at a cut-off of 200 years um that still isn't long enough over time spent to completely average out uh some of these results we obtained here and this is quite quite a chaotic region the the rest of the system is quite well behaved and the system also spends most of its design uh right here in the middle the this is in part by uh design so we we chose some of the parameters such as such at this point lies in the middle and this this unstable chaotic region and that this this is minimal the second experiment that we're going to do is um we're circling again from the different endowments but this time we will allow the investors to reinvest the profits and now um one simulation forms a trajectory through this uh simplex um the wealth is redistributed so let's take three uh initial uh conditions three endowments um one is the one in red starting over here this one starts out with approximately um 45 for the value investor 50 for the trend follower and five percent for the the noise trader and it starts as here at the plus sign and it slowly moves towards this central point which we identified um but uh just so quite slowly and the same thing applies for these other trajectories as you can see um these trajectories are quite quite rough um they fluctuate from side to side and they don't seem to move all the thrust towards this point uh if we look at the the 200 gear points so if you look at the cutoff point um it also turns out that we're likely to find the system in in the region around this mysterious points here denoted by the places and uh this is the dispersion that the the system has around uh uh that attractive fixed point that we have identified here um so how do we identify um the way to do this is to go first i'm not sure i'll interrupt you one second uh we have a question in the q a um which probably goes back to towards the beginning which is how our price is simulated is everything uh basically run through the uh the normal that you draw it every day basically and then it affects the dividends which in turn affects um everyone's optimal strategies exactly yeah so every day the market maker here tries to find this market clearing price and this is then announced um with the time discrete times level one uh trading day and in the experiments we repeat this for for 200 years so approximately 200 times 252 times and um and these simulations so ultimately if you start at the green cross all three populations are changing their wealth right yes yeah yeah this is still within the barycentric coordinate system where the coordinate represents the relative wealth of the three investors but essentially at every time period you draw one normal variable random variable that affects the dividends and and that affects the valuation of every trader and therefore the price um there's actually two in independence uh normal uh address namely the noise trader also has some some noise okay so but the difference in the in the noise trader that are noisy so um yeah for this platform for example the trajectory that you see um is 200 years so this does suggest that that in these regions at least the system evolves uh to this attractive fixed point quite quite slowly um we will not look at this in more detail so um we do this a bunch more times than only for for three initial conditions and uh we again do this as a monte carlo experiment in order to estimate the the mean the direction where the system is expected to move in um if you average out all of the noise so again on the dividend in the part of the nitrate and we obtain these flow lines so what is clear is again there's there's a fixed point here right in the middle and there's some chaotic reaction at the top um there's something else going on and this is uh visible uh by the the width of the different flow lines you know and this is that uh when the trend follower is abundant or i should probably say when the failure investor is absent then the system moves really fast back into the direction of these fixed points the lines in this region are very thick and they also move almost directly to this fixed point uh whereas on the other side so when there is more noise traders or when there's more value investors these lines are extremely thin and almost disappear here um the the units here is the percentage of wealth that is being redistributed between the strategies on an annual basis so this means that uh here where the lines are most thin uh every year there's only five percent of wealth being exchanged between the different species and so the expectation for this system even though it might oscillate and shake heavily in expectation it only moves really slow towards the the efficient point um so this leads to an inter interesting question why would an abundance of transformers uh often lead to massive losses from the printf because it looks like when you started here the system is ejected out of this region and so we drill uh down into this um before we only saw the mo we always had the dominant species uh the the expected returns for the dominant species um but if we now plot for different concentrations uh the returns in the top panel then will be here the returns for both the value and that's the trend follower we observe two things namely if the transformer the abundance of transformers increases so this would be along the x-axis to the left we observed it in panel b the returns of the transformer did drop off and they actually got negative quite sharply here um if if the trend follower decreases then it becomes profitable slowly and they seem to stop there um contrary to this for the value investor and this is the x-axis now in the opposite direction um if we follow the blue line and we move in the direction of more value investors we observe that the returns also decrease but they never fall below the risk-free rate of one percent here so there's competition among value investors but it doesn't lead to excess losses there's also competition between trends followers but large numbers of computation leads to extreme losses here so this is interesting in that uh uh crowding here works differently for trend followers than it does for value investors on top of this if you increase the concentration of trend followers in your market then you're likely to observe higher volatility in your returns also um so so this tells us why the system would move away quickly from trend followers namely with the quest uh and profitable there due to competition uh but but that isn't really the root cause and for the root cause we need to go back to how rational our uh invest investors are exactly um so recall that we put in uh an answer correlation in the dividend process and this was a a positive uh other correlation of 0.1 if you have a value investor who simply applies a dividend dividend discounting model so imagine the entire market is value investors we would be in the bottom right then the market should also show a miles positive other correlation because these value investors are simply translating this other correlation from dividends into prices and so this means there is a fertile ground here for transformers to profit if we move towards the equilibrium points however the controller becomes larger it starts having a bigger impact on prices in the other correlation and prices start to disappear so um this means that the transformer is slowly extinguishing its own signal and if we should pass the equilibrium point then the impacts that a transformer has on the market becomes so large that it actually starts inducing uh autocorrelation of the the opposite sign so it becomes so large that it starts thrashing the price in the opposite direction and this explains all of the losses for the trend follower in this region okay so let's go back to ecology consider for example the hair and the snowshoe links about live in in canada famously the hudson bay company collected data on uh appels that were collected by trappers in canada in the in the mid-1800s early 1900s um and they observed this curious uh pattern in uh the availability of these uh furs that were collected this is cyclicality um this inspires the lost guy for volterra equations and this in biology um is a set of equations that are used to describe population dynamics where populations comprise predators and prey mainly the links being the predator and the hair being the prey um the precise model here isn't so important but what is important is the following if you're able to nail down uh a set of equations that describe the dynamics of these populations um there's a tool in biology called the community matrix this matrix is used to make a characterization of how these species interact uh without uh without imposing this on the model but the way it works is by computing the jacobian um of the the population densities um so basically the sensitive sensitivity of um the population size uh of uh the hair to uh the size of the the other species uh the links so the the the what this community metrics tells you is whether if there's more uh linksys will will the population of harris increase or decrease and uh by which magnitude and in in any i think they try something in the uh uh body course as the the volterra equation so most of you will be familiar with them but the important thing is once we have this jacobian and we look at the the entries in this matrix uh we can look at their signs um so if we find a positive relation between species species a and species b so the jacobian a sub a comma b if this is positive and in the opposite direction b comma a is also positive one we call this mutualism um otherwise um if in both directions the community matrix has negative entries we would say that these uh species are competing with each other but then there's also other types of uh interaction which are much more rare by the way these also have names um and importantly um this characterization and this community matrix this can be used to analyze the stability of the system uh in our perturbations to the population so how do we use this to understand markets um in order to build a financial community matrix what we need is the the average return of the strategy and so in theory this was we had our 200 year simulation and monte carlo estimates for this and what we now want to build is the community matrix namely how sensitive is the the return of one species species eye to a change in uh the population size uh of unearthed species j um so this is the the financial analog to the biological community matrix um and we're using our multiplier simulation we're able to compute this um suppose we do this linear linearization near the equilibrium point uh the one marked by the large black dots in the in the previous spots and we we found the following matrix um the thing that is most important in this matrix is that all the diagonal entries are negative and all the positive entries are positive this means that at the equilibrium point the strategy is competing with itself if you were to increase uh the abundance of one of the strategies then um they would become much less profitable especially the the trend follower um if we were to increase uh any of the other strategies however um the the first strategy i had becomes more profitable and these are the positive uh off diagonal entries um so the this uh uh um robert's maze work shows us that uh uh the system is uh stable so um what we've identified near the center of the plot is a is a stable attractive fixed point around which the the system uh moves but um it's quite robust against certain changes in the population for example if a fraction of value investors suddenly were to withdraw from the market uh we would probably still guess that um the market is able to recover and move back to this equilibrium point eventually even even if it takes a long time um this isn't always the case however and um it is quite quite remarkable for financial systems and that um if we move away quite far from the equilibrium points uh then we find community matrices where these signs flip so not only do the quantities change but we also observe that all of a sudden there starts to be a competition between trend followers and value investors um when there's quite a few value investors here around 55 um so this means that there is much more going on um the example of the the links in the hair if if if a lynx encounters one one of these rockets then it's likely to always eat it in in the case of financial markets however if one fund encounters another fund in the market it might depend very much on the size of these funds whether they will either compete or benefit from each other this is what is called density dependence but um it means that the interactions between the species that we've identified is actually more complex more complex than the the biological one in biology we don't expect that if the lynx uh encounters one rabbit that's the way to ravage but if it encounters two rabbits that rabbits will win um which would be a density dependent uh effects in nature it's much more rare than in finance so for the trend follower i i would expect a little bit of um you know if think of cryptocurrencies where everybody is a trend follower uh you know the trend is up um if i'm a trend follower don't i benefit from other trend followers joining and making the trend even stronger or is this sort of taking averages over time where at the end of the day it takes into account the crashes that come out of it um in in your calculation here well um i've been a bit sneaky so in the in the unstable region um at the top where there's many transformers prices actually diverge on so well none of it on in human time scales so on multiple centuries so in those cases uh i think trend followers really benefit from from other trend followers and that the price will just shoot up forever in a sort of bubble kind of way is that uh exactly yeah and if you depend on marketing markets accounting and you don't actually need to consume so you don't ever have to sell your cryptocurrency in order to pay for rent or food or something like that yeah prices might as well go up forever um so that is quite unrealistic of course um another interesting thing is that trend followers on a short time scale they really benefit from trend followers that that are slightly slower than them because when the bubble reaches its stop uh when it loses momentum because people need to withdraw in order to consume uh if you're just a bit faster than the other print forwards you're able to sell at the top or at least not before the price has entirely crashed and so there's also this dependency but in this model we have really simplistic transformers that that operates on the same time scale uh for all individuals okay i have a few more questions would you prefer if i keep them to the end or or do you oh let's go ahead with the question here so um so we had one question um that was that was asking how would you how would you um represent a passive or an indexing investor in other words someone that just buys the you know an etf and is it is this something you've considered or or um oh yeah in so in in this uh framework um in this evolution setting one could just describe a passive fund uh as a as a fund that has uh more or less uh a consensus allocation of wealth to specific assets so in in the description of trading signals that we had before i would say that a passive funds or an index tracker or something of that nature would have a constant signal phi which basically just does allocates this uh fraction of your your wealth to the stocks so they would probably result in a constant uh here in in this space and so in turn this leads to constant demand and uh this also means that in this markets where demand is satisfied by the world ration uh uh auctioneer at every time step that it sort of uh uh filled uh you can cancel it out through the and i think it just dampens prices okay ah so a higher proportion of indexers would cause would be more stable rather like or it would it would dampen ever the whole system it would dampen the entire system um yeah okay uh and i have another question which is um from and exemplary is the number of agents using east each strategy accounted for if there is a large difference this might introduce instability as when the prey goes extinct um if i understand correctly is it i i i i made some uh omissions for for brevity there in that um when when uh one of these individuals goes bankrupt then they're bailed out and this is a reset um so so extension isn't a a problem here um on top of that um the way they're defined the the way their access demand function is different is that they're ball agricultural me so uh one fund holding 100 million in in the wealth operates on the macro level the same as two funds each holding 50 million each because there are excess demand functions uh uh are summed um these can be aggregated and stuff their net effects on the price is the same okay so so essentially you have three agents but you could think of the uh the trend following agent as multiple people uh that are following this strategy certainly yes all right uh that's all i've got for now okay um so i'm moving towards the end of the presentation um please somewhere if i'm short on time with it um there's this other cool tool from my ecology that we now can do that we that we've computed all of this information um so we haven't noticed some of the uh the binary interactions between species so if species are high and kind of speak okay what what happens is there a predator-prey relationship do they compete or do they ignore each other um in biology um if you put all of these relationships together you obtain something called a food web and so this is a network where all of the nodes are the different species and the edges are the characterized interactions between them and now we can ask ourselves well um which uh species is uh well this food this is a natural ordering uh called a trophic level uh and we can ask ourselves which species species has the lowest profit level meaning it doesn't prey uh on uh other species and which one has the highest traffic level meaning it predates on all of the uh other species and it can be said to be the the apex predator if it's at the top so in order to find this we can iterate the the following equation um where the the trophic level of i is one plus um the dietary fraction so how often does uh i that how much of the returns of i are explained by the presence of j times uh the traffic level of uh j uh j is allowed to be equal to i um this can be solved through iteration uh organizations initially initialize all these to one in this conversion the dietary refraction aij is simply um looking at the returns or so gi at a given abundance at a given size and how much does j contribute to those returns um let's go through this but during the slides for your reference it's simply the the fraction of how many of the returns of i are explained by the presence of speed species j and what happens if you knock j out of the system what happens to the returns of species i then um so unlike most of nature we find that um the traffic levels again change dramatically depending on the density um in in the the system of the canadian wilderness where the the hair is the the basic food source and the links is the predator uh almost uh always um here um the different traffic levels they change quite a bit um so so at and around the equilibrium point we find this ordering uh meaning that um the noise trader has the the lowest traffic level this is followed by the value investor and followed by the trend follower so what this really means is that the noise trader because because it's not really careful about which prices it takes it just takes liquidity out of the market and it's not so sensitive to pricing and it is uh vulnerable vulnerable to value investors um whereas this is a interesting dividend discount thing by which that they can better estimate when is the time to buy more and when is the time to sell or show itself um so in the sense uh like i said the value investor is a predator on noise traders for for most of the system and also uh for most of the time from most of the region where the system spends most of its time um in the second largest region um the traffic levels are undefined uh and this is because uh uh they happen to be all equal so there's competition amongst all three uh and uh uh one could say for example that uh all three of them are predators and they each prey on each other and finally explaining why the transformer is the apex predator and recall that it benefits from the other correlation in prices and that the other correlation actually in the real world only exists in the dividends and the transfer needs the value investor to translate uh the autocorrelation from dividends into prices so when there's quite quite a bit of value investors only then the transformer can be profitable um if there's many noise traders then this autocorrelation doesn't get translated so there's no way for the trend follower to be a predator on the noise trader um only on the value investor and vice versa there's no way for these other for these two strategies to counter a trench follower when it's trying to exploit this other correlation so um for massive observation it will be the apex predator um so now we question well um what can we do with this uh information um is uh uh i i did already said it before uh we suspected there is a connection to the the price impact that the different strategies have and um their density uh affects our results but let's again look at one final experiment um so we uh again take one uh simple uh trajectory here something from the middle which uh oscillates in in this region uh as the system typically does um the background color here denotes the the observed volatility and prices um what we're now going to do is um look at the market quality so the volatility of the the the prices on that on the running basis and the missed pricing so the difference between the the rational model of the investment and the actual realized market price um what we're now going to do is uh build a really simple linear model um of these two characteristics of market policy based on the abundance of the species so this is completely contrary to a classical finance where it is assumed that prices reflects all available fundamental information and so as surprising models are based on the fundamentals so if you compare this to farmer french for example um this is a complete completely different way of looking at the volatility the misplacing and the returns of the i said we do the regression on the relative uh abundance of the species here and uh using uh even uh a simple uh least squares regression we find a very good phase so what panel b tells us um is that using the top model here for volatility we have an oldest predictor at the bottom we have the relative abundance of of two different species so the the blue line here hovering around forty percent means that forty percent of relative wealth uh is with the evaluator if we plug this back into our linear model we get a prediction for volatility this will be the purple line and orange will be the default volatility observed in the model um so what we find is that this predictor works quite well so the the the fit is quite good and there's barely any delay between between uh changes in the markets and changes in the predicted similarly for missed pricing this also uh works the fit is slightly less good i would say and especially uh mispricing due to noise traders so due to um short-term um mismatches in in the months due to liquidity taking for example uh these it doesn't manage to predict but um mispricing due to a certain rising trend followers for example it does manage your predict quite well so wrapping everything up we've developed a simple model of heterogeneous agents with a banded rationality we looked at biology and we have developed some tools using the biological analogues in order to describe the relations between different types of progressives um so when we apply those we find that uh the markets uh actually deviate quite a bit from from natural systems and that the uh investments uh are uh multi-dimensional in that you're never always a predator you need to size your strategy appropriately otherwise you will still incur losses or become the the prey yourself and so we will say that financial markets are quite highly density dependent um what is useful about looking at markets in this way is that um we've seen that strategies have different impacts on market quality and on their returns and that we're able to characterize this even using a simple simple linear model this works quite well and we would say that um this approach of working uh offers an alternative to using things like department derived models which uh which which assume this rationality which automatically uh translates fundamentals enterprises instead we say um if you instead look at the holdings and look at the relative abundance of market activities then this will probably give you a better forecaster uh at least it does in this simulation and uh my next steps are to look at this in the in data in the real world um so that's all um feel free to reach out to me by email later my emails in the in the slides and these are some of the important references that i cited in the in the presentation thank you um if you have some questions feel free to put them in the q a um and and we have a an a a couple minutes i'll ask one question um so especially for the trend following um in my experience trend following is typically something that's done uh on a one month or six month or one year horizon in other words you know specifically when it's multi-assets you know let's say uh you know uh a universe of 500 stocks trend following typically means i take the uh the top uh decile that's that's performed the best in the last six months and i short the bottom the decile that's done the worst and and often at least the recipes that i've seen in the finance literature are sort of more cross-sectional type of uh of definition and and also on a longer time scale have you tried so like it kind of brings me back to a lot of the results you you have may depend on a recipe or you know how we define uh these things to be do you think it's very you know sensitive to that so for example the trend specifically the trend following ones that seem to be the most chaotic agents in in in your system yes so what is unrealistic about his model is that um we put in the trend through the dividends um this is mainly for for person money but um in the real world and if if i read the cliff as for example then um there's many different fundamentals driving uh trends uh in real markets uh on these time scales of several months um so the the reason why we're not well uh why we didn't do that is we're simply not simulating the real real uh financial reasons why a company's value should appreciate with a trend whether whether um trends in earnings for earnings for example is likely to continue um we're not not modeling this and so the the model is quite artificial in that way um if you want to make it more realistic then um one would really need to the the type of equity actually researcher people do in practice and say well this stock is is is offered by a business that is doing these activities and um it has these earnings and this model is this model that has a trend is like an explanation for why these earnings are going to continue for several months more um so this this would require quite a lot of extra steps to make it more realistic okay i thought the trend was just the one step ahead or the difference between the price today and the price uh yesterday in in in this model it is good for real world financial financial markets of course satellite factors is that there is a complete uh absence of uh uh short-term autocorrelation yeah yeah especially that's on the the one-day time scale okay all right well we have one last question uh from spencer dean he asks um how does this relate to the literature from uh low and co-authors so um i don't know if you've seen the oh yeah are you pulling up the link um yep okay uh yep um so um so uh andrew lowe wrote this book called the elective market hypothesis um how this work is different is that uh i don't assume that the agents are able to adapt their beliefs um this isn't to say that i don't believe that people uh adapts their strategies but um by um but how markets operate typically a fund manager will deposit a prospectus and uh it will say to clients we're going to run this strategy and there's real legal recourse if you if you deviate from that um so uh i tend to find that even though fund managers may have evolving beliefs and may have different ideas as time goes on and they the asset allocation process in in practice is much more mechanical in that these funds follow something that was outlined in the prospectus for decades on top of that many satellite effects in markets it's sufficient to have zero intelligence agents so much of the work i i i do is uh uh looking at how far i can take them but i i tend to lean towards uh less intelligence and less adaptive behavior in modeling then more however um in in our research group in oxford there are people working on the uh the evolutionary next step in in this ecological thinking about markets um so people apply uh evolutionary algorithms in a row to change change the parameters to a strategy in order to be addictive and do belief updating but also to innovate completely new strategies okay martin well um thanks a lot i mean i i really enjoyed your your presentation we sort of instinctively all know that it's a survival of the fittest but you you sort of uh your work kind of goes one uh one step into making this more concrete and and the mechanism is more clear so so thanks again for for presenting at the seminar thank you so much for having me thanks
