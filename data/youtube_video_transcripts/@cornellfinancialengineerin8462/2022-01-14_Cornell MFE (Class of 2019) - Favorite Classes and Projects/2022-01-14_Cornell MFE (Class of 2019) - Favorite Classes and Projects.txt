my favorite course this past semester would have to be optimization modeling by professor enniger um i think working on projects really gave us the right sort of education on where to use what we learned as well instead not just doing the usual assignments and exams so i think there was something different the project i chose was a qrs uh project that is related to portfolio optimization with drawdown constraint the reason i chose that because it's eisen continuation of the class of optimization modeling since i'm really fascinated with optimization modeling in finance so i would like to i would like to figure out how i can use the optimization model in the financial industry my favorite class at cornell was investment in portfolio management as it's it's a good mix of both engineering and management my project is treasury risk in city and it involves working on different fixed income and other securities and managing risks that i find very interesting my project is from ubs that the reinforcement learning in algorithm trading so i was really interested in it because i was doing e-trading during the summer i would like to see how the trading behavior is going to evolve in an algorithmic setting and in the long run maybe we can learn some insights from that i'll be doing a project with citi and the topic is treasury risk and the reason why i choose this project is because i'm really passionate about the risk management industry and it is really relevant to my summer internship and i hope that like by doing this project i can strengthen my understanding in the risk management industry and to better prepare for me in the future career
