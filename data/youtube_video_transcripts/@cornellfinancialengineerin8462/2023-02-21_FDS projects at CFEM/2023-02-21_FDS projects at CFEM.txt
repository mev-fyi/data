hi my name is Sasha stoikov and I'm a senior research associate at Cornell Financial engineering and I'd like to tell you about financial data science projects and how they work first and foremost these projects involve three stakeholders the company that sponsors the project a team of four to six students who are going to work on the project for a full semester and and produce a final presentation in a final report and the faculty advisor a researcher or professor at Cornell who works on and specializes in this field or in the in the project that is being sponsored ultimately companies uh can get various things out of these projects first of all it allows uh quants on at Financial companies to explore promising new areas of research without necessarily um uh taking too much risk or or putting too many resources in these areas so it's a very exploratory kind of project and it allows them to get sort of like a consultant or an outsider perspective on what it is that uh they're doing so of course this also allows companies to to get to know new talent and this often ends up in a potential hire for companies and uh and finally it's an opportunity to collaborate with uh Academia and Industry so we find it very interesting projects come out of these collaborations so students of course also get a lot out of these projects they get to apply uh all the things that they've learned into the real world they get to participate in research work in a group and ultimately while they're in their final semester looking for um for new jobs um it helps them to sort of put in perspective the the skills that they've learned so um in order to give you an idea of what these projects are like I thought I would introduce you to the last year's sponsors and ultimately all of them came to us with a question um in the form of how can we in other words typically these these sponsors have an interesting uh piece of data or data set and they want to achieve a goal and and usually we try to frame uh these projects in terms of achievable and deliverable goals so for example we had 10A at JP Morgan who wanted to use jobs posting data in order to predict uh the performance of companies and of course this was a very novel data set and um part of the project was to Define uh the key performance indicators that this that this kind of data allows one to to predict then we had uh Andrew at the at Alliance Bernstein who who asked us to analyze text or to use NLP to analyze Chinese news websites in order to predict the performance of China Asia's uh we had um branca at Odo bhf who had supply chain data and wanted to predict within groups of stocks um and which of the stocks will outperform their peers we also had Paul at euronext who who asked us how they could match market makers and Market takers and FX and this was a very creative project that involved the recommendation systems um then we had dark forests which is a crypto Market making fund who asked us um how they can make markets in crypto with the with latency in mind because of course these exchanges on which crypto is traded are are often far from each other and and latency can can have an important effect on Market making then we had virtue a hedge fund who uh asked sometimes the the projects involve a specific uh quantitative technique in this case it was reinforcement learning so virtue asks how can they use reinforcement learning to hedge their portfolios in FX and um the next sponsor was hedge Tech who asked us how to manage Capital across various crypto exchanges to provide quotes uh to their clients and so hatch Tech is is also a crypto Market maker um then we had TP at Goldman Sachs who asked us how they can use flows from the past from mutual funds in order to predict the kind of investment projects that their marketing department could be suggesting to their clients and then we had Deutsche Bank um Deutsche Bank who who asked how regime detection algorithms can be used to construct portfolios and finally we had another um crypto startup covario who asked how can um how can we use crypto order book data in order to predict short-term price moves so as you can see there's a huge diversity of uh of financial services companies some that are startups some that are established large Banks and um and ultimately um they they are all asking from our students to to take a deep dive into these problems and uh finally to give you an idea of uh what comes out of these projects I'd like to share with you a presentation that um the covario team uh gave at the at the end of our semester we have a little get-together where we we we do a short pitch with all the the highlights of the projects and their presentation was called mind the gaps short-term crypto price prediction all right well thank you everyone for coming um everyone on Zoom uh as well uh so part of our project we call it mind the gap short-term crypto price prediction um so uh sorry I guess the main goal of um this project was was laid out clearly kind of in the beginning so we wanted to seek uh to construct a robust predictor um or fair price estimators uh short-term uh bitcoin price prediction um so we for the data for this we used three months of uh high frequency limit order book data as well as trades data sourced from uh bitstamp um and kind of broad overview of what we did was uh utilize a bunch of different metrics kind of along the way to evaluate uh the predictive power of our estimators um and focusing more on the the one to 60 second uh kind of time frame just based on um kind of what kovaria wanted so first we kind of talk about uh these three definitions that we used um we looked at quite a few different signals um along the way but I guess these were the three that I just showed the most validity or we felt the best about moving forward so first one um is very similar to what uh um Professor stoykoff talks about in his paper on the micro price this kind of quote imbalance adjusted uh mid price uh sort of in a similar vein we also looked at a trade imbalance adjusted mid price um and then third and final is something that we believe might be sort of a new thing uh we haven't I guess found it in other literature but the volume adjusted mid price that we call uh fam um and I think it's wise to I guess explain that one a little bit kind of the way we constructed that was um first you would set um a liquidity level in our case it was sixty thousand dollars but we looked at a bunch of other liquidity levels and on each side of the book you would basically go work your way down the book until you hit whatever price where you accumulated that much liquidity and then on each side you will take the volume weighted average on each side and then take the mid price of those two and that is our van hopefully doing a similar thing to what quote-un balance does right um but one thing I think is worth mentioning is that in a lot of these crypto order books um they're not as well behaved we come to find out as uh Equity markets right like they're oftentimes huge huge gaps at the top of the order book um I mean in oftentimes even 10 20 dollars like tons of ticks um which kind of creates a problem that we found out uh but the idea behind Vamp was to hopefully capture this sort of thing where you are weighted um looking at these gaps right um so looking at kind of early like I just put up this decile signal plot if you read our report you will see more signal plots um this one kind of summarizes what we're talking about here uh and we can already see here that Vamp has sort of what we're looking for on this kind of instead of a strictly linear relationship there's this kind of curve that you're seeing there which more signifies that in the higher and lower deciles you see a more I guess hopefully equivalent change in our Vamp corresponding to like these large tail sort of event price movements seen in the data um and so finally our results uh we split this up into two categories that we thought kind of made sense so uh I guess before we really talk about this we kind of talk about like it's important to understand the motivation right like we find here that Vamp does a really good job in what we call binary actors which really is just you have two classes price moves up or down and we see how well do we predict this when the price moves up or down we'll present at the time are we getting it right um but I think it's also important to know that like sort of the motivation is if there is I guess for a combined model what we would think would be best would be a combined model that for one is does really well in binary accuracy but also does well in over here these two plots that you see on the right hand side are from a multi-class kind of classification problem where we're looking at one Sigma events up and down so a good I guess price predictor would be one that I guess does really well on most of the time right within those two one Sigma events and then once it signals a large price movement coming it can switch and hopefully capture that event um but kind of spoiler alert I guess not very climactic but um Vamp kind of performs well across the board we we thought Precision was the best metric to look at specifically because this tells when your model is predicting a large movement how often is it correct we don't want to look at something like accuracy because you could have a model in our case trade and balance did this where it just predicted large one Sigma moves way too often right so its accuracy was very very good but it's Precision what we actually care about for the purpose of this project it's not very good um but I think it's still a cool result uh as you can see there even at the 62nd time frame uh amp he has about 56 accuracy um in in all movements across the board uh we thought that was pretty good so um so yeah that's kind of the summing up that Vamp is kind of King and in our analysis but we think there's some promise I guess moving forward um only in more Bitcoin and understanding like recent more crashes or something like that but um also expanding this to other crypto assets and other asset classes I think would be really good um analysis moving forward but thank you all right so this was um Peyton's uh final presentation um Peyton Martin one of our our uh students from last year so um so here is here are the milestones and sort of the timeline for these Financial engineering projects in April companies uh pitched their projects to students in May students are assigned to projects and the project actually starts in Earnest in August with monthly meetings with the sponsor and weekly meetings with the um the faculty advisor ultimately in December the students give a final presentation so a much longer version than uh what you just saw here and they deliver final reports to the sponsor now I hope this was useful for you to understand uh how financial data science projects work um and if you're interested in participating in such a project um feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn I'm at Sasha I'm Sasha storkov and uh or email me at sfs33 at cornell.edu and uh and I hope this uh presentation has sparked some new ideas and new uh projects that you may want to consider doing with our students
