to three minutes okay great um all right everybody uh welcome to uh the last cornell city financial data science seminar of the year um of the year 2020 of course this year has been a big year uh with two big news won the u.s election the other the covet 19 pandemic and so i have a few announcements on both sides first you'll find that in our little chat room i've included a link to an article that um that describes a competition that a team of our cornell financial engineering students have won this uh student competition and the topic of the competition was uh you know the the prediction of uh essentially constructing portfolios of that will do well under democrats and republican wins which interestingly after the results of the election came out uh the students re-ran um re-run their models which involve looking at prediction markets and if you're interested in this kind of stuff i recommend uh reading the the little blurb we have um and um and the second piece of news of course uh in the context of uh the covet 19 pandemic i'm very happy to have paul besson uh give us a little uh replay of this year from the perspective of the uh the liquidity and the market microstructure so paul bisson is a a colleague of mine and he's a head of quant research at euronext and i've known him for several years one of uh he's often at academic conferences presenting papers but um but you know also one foot in the uh in the finance world in other words he's been working for a broker um and uh and essentially very uh active in the research community so he's in he's currently in uh paris is that right so i'm i'm uh i'm glad that we can sort of cross the atlantic uh you know through this uh seminar and anyways he's one of my favorite speaker at conferences and in fact has this year kept very busy he has uh sort of published a course um an online course on market microstructure and again if you go in the chat room you'll find the link uh to that as well as um his linkedin profile so you know this summer we had a an interesting we had a little survey of um of the seminar attendees and uh you know asked for what topics interest you and among the list of topics we had market microstructure and we had covet 19 so i'm very glad to have paul hit both of these topics uh today so uh paul go ahead okay uh thanks a lot sasha thanks for that thanks for inviting me and thank you cornell and thank you all for attending this presentation today okay so in this presentation uh the european liquidity and trading flows during the copied 19 we will look at how this health crisis changed market liquidity we will also review the changes that took place within the order books in particular we will look at bid ask spreads and available sizes on the first limit in this presentation we'll often refer to three main european markets france belgium and netherlands which are the three biggest in the six that manages euro next lastly in this lecture our goal will not only be to describe what happened uh and how european liquidity was modified during the covet crisis but also to put this into perspective as far as looking as back as the great financial crisis and to do this i've extracted some examples from the mooc i authored this year so that you can see how these changes relate to previous changes okay so that's uh that's the program so before we start we can just say a few words regarding here and next not specially because it's my thumb but also to describe the data which that we will study so euronext is now the largest european uh exchange we have uh six markets we've got portugal in dark green portugal france here in belgium netherland ireland oslo uh the norway and uh in two months three months time we get also italy as well that we've just acquired okay so we have roughly 25 percent of the stock 600 and we will say like more than 10 billion a day in euros that is trading every day on our european stocks okay and that is the data set who will present you and to see which flows and how flows behaved during this year in these european countries um that's it for your next now i'm going to skip this slide because it's just the history of this federation of european exchanges and now we'll get to the core of the first part of the presentation so just as a recap here we will first look at the timeline because as you know traffic crisis was different in europe in the u.s and in other parts of the world then we'll review the market performance we'll split this europe in four phases okay and we study what we'll study what happened in each of these stages so first the kavit timeline okay so the kobe timeline in europe uh here we have like four phases so the first phases we have like the here the large increase in uh the new cases uh okay between the 18th of february and 18th of march here we describe the main european countries that cover euronext okay so we see all these countries showing a very high correlation in the cubic crisis cases with this large increase during this period it is where you observe the largest market drop in europe okay then you have a second phase where the new cases recede okay after a huge confinement was put in place this is the second phase and it coincides also with the recovery of the market as you will see in the for in the future slide then there is a third phase which we call a plateau because in that phase market performance was relatively steady okay even if we saw an increase in the the second wave that was coming and then at the end of october we had like this phase that was really threatening harsh confinement that was put in place in first in ireland then in france also in a in belgium netherlands uh apart from italy and uh the fourth space which starts at the end of october until now where we had a recovery in terms of market performance and also the first decline here in new coveted currency in new covet cases as you can see first in ireland when they confined first then also netherlands belgium and france you can find slightly later that is for the kovid timeline now market market performances so for market performances here we have represented three main markets that we described with the main indices the cac 40 for france 20 the top 20 bedroom stocks ax the largest here dutch stocks and what you see is that during the first phase there was a huge drop but i would say rather like minus 35 drop in these main indices then there was the first three bands the recovery phase okay and then the plateau and then the surge the upsurge i would say 10 15 from the last day of october to last friday so now as the first result we want to highlight here what is the liquidity and how is liquidity split in europe because we know that fragmentation differs in the u.s from europe so it's good to just situate where what it looks like and how things divulge during this crisis the first here highlight so what we represented here is different form of equity trading first here in blue you've got the lit trading okay elite trading so either on the primary venues or the mts okay then you've got dark trading in white of butch otc the si okay and the periodic options which is a smaller a fraction okay so what we observe more or less is that like leak market represents some somehow like 40 percent 45 percent of the global liquidity uh inequities this fraction tends to increase during the crisis slightly we study this in depth but there was an increase in liquidity here and in the same time we saw a decline in other liquidity for example well otc tend to be smaller in this in this period in this period as you can see so that is just to give you an overall landscape of what happened during this specific crisis and then in terms of volumes just to give you like some main highlights in terms of volume like what was traded uh what was traded so here we represent two things we represent here the value in your for example your next stocks month by month that was trading okay so it is in turnover and you will see large increase during february and march where the worst of the crisis took place with the strongest market drop then the second phase and uh here an increase at the end of the recover the first rebound in june and then the summer which was experienced later volumes so you see that greater volumes as expected coincided with the greatest volatility and the greatest market drop we also represent here in this chart in dotted blue line the market share what we call the market share is here the the fraction of the lead trading that takes place at euronx on the regulated market primary market versus what happened on mtfs so competing competitors or other venues and here we see that we represent in europe this is the case for most european countries the market is much less fragmented as it in the u.s because regulating markets represent more or less 70 percent of the liquidity this uh this market share was relatively stable to over 20 20 okay just uh first fact okay so this is just to set the stage now we are going to look at uh with more detail at what is happening in the other book so first here the attendees are i've heard for some students who wouldn't know terminology what we we call depth of the order book which will be the average available sizes are the best bid and the best ask we call it depth or available sizes on the first limit and then necessarily the builder spread the difference between the best task and the best bit okay so first you will represent here the most liquid stocks of hero next most 120 mostly good stocks where liquidity providers have like special scheme to provide liquidity and we look at the bid ask spreads a daily bit of spreads over this 2020 period so what do we observe first i mean who is not surprising for anyone who is experienced with market market micro structure is that during the strong drop beta spreads widen enormously from i would say six to almost 24 bits in just one month okay this was extremely extreme extreme widening and then one market here during the second phase here during the first rebound spreads tightened again not fully but tightened again while market recovered during the plateau phase here spreads were more or less stable until now so this uh here widening is not surprising because as uh we will as we know in market as market practitioners spreads are strongly related to volatility as spreads represent more or less it is the classical economic interpretation more or less the gain from the theoretical market maker and when the volatility is created the risk for the passive market maker is greater and then for a greater risk you want to be compensated by a greater reward that's why usually it is acknowledged that spread would widen when volatility increases to put this in perspective i've extracted here from uh my 2020 mooch here an example and there were the same stocks from 27 okay 2007 to 2018 what happened okay so here we look at the great financial crisis at the end of 2008 september to september 0008 and here we see that during the great financial crisis b tax spreads here for example on large camps increased from seven to 13 bits okay so they doubled uh here during this current widening and then during past crisis in 2010 2011 which were large european crisis specifically for depth and great depth crisis where the euro was really in trouble here you have also some smaller widenings okay with velocity if you were to compare here current value during the worst of the drop the market drop here these are displayed by my pointer here we're looking at the orange dot the light blue or the mid blue we can see that spreads widened not as much as during the worst of the great financial crisis but not far from these levels okay this is also the case for uh large caps mid cap as well as small caps so it wasn't as extreme but it was somehow not too far then if you want to study a little more precisely this relationship the best question sorry um when you compute beta spread so this is a question from the audience uh do you take it uh 15 minutes before the close or an average throughout the day or how do you okay okay so there are several computations for being asked spreads here we do it's time weighted over the continuous market one simpler way of doing it is just to measure the beta spread when uh there are trends but we do it it's an intraday time averaged a bit ask spread okay likewise here in this chart where xr15 will represent the intraday volatility so here we take an estimator for the intro level activity with garmin class estimate estimate and we compute here on average the average of the daily intraday daily volatility for the 120 stocks here for the stocks and also here on a daily basis and we plot here the corresponding bid ask spread so as you see here in this example over 2020 when intra-level activity increased a spread daily spread increased as well uh you know almost in our relationship and you see that now i mean uh here at the end of uh october at least where we were here the the red dot we're almost we've almost reverted as far as the beginning of the year but not as much and this is normal because in fact what happens that the volatility is in relative volatility is still way higher than prior to the crisis so you see what is interesting is that this extreme relationship this extreme widening offspring is makes sense and it's related to intraday volatility and this relationship is not so much distorted it is almost scenario even when uh relativity was extreme so it shows a good functioning of the market and that uh long-term relationship still uh held the steady relationships so we have another technical question related to it spread widening do you um how do you average these things is it volume weighted in any way or or do you sort of uh yeah here we do it for like 120 stocks okay so as we just displayed how we do it stock by stock on over a day for example saying we have regis over like the 120 stocks we do likewise for volatility so we have this kind of measure here to represent what is happening on average on these 120 stocks to see over time on these stocks what happens when volatility the average velocity increases and in the same time do we observe a widening in the uh desk spread okay and so this is what happened over 2020. now if we step back and we look in this example from our much again what happens over here looking at the past 10 years from 2007 to 2018. okay here we distinguish black cap in dark blue mid cap in gray and small caps in orange if you represent the volatility portrait so here it's a little different because he wanted to get better results so we adjusted this way so volatility per trade meaning the volatility of each trade okay of each price movement between each trade and then the bid has spread and you will see again if you were to study one for example one dot for an average large gap mid-cap small caps over time when volatility increases bid f spreads also increase so this is a very strong result it is very well and in theory but it also holds true in reality looking at past 20 years of data like looking at 2020 okay it's a strong result that's really it's true in practice okay for this one okay so distinguish two things because you can do it either cross-sectionally at a given day what happens when stocks changes or here looking at a given day over a sample of comparable stocks what happens when things change over another day where you compute another average volatility and an average spread okay now let's move on to the available depth so the available dates is a little less well known than the beta spreads but it also characterizes the liquidity why is that the case because when there is fewer available sizes here on the first limits there is less equity that is tradable okay and it characterizes here a lack of liquidity so here what happens is that prior to the crisis on average on these 120 most liquid stocks in europe uh that is euronic stocks you had an average of 40 000 k euros available on the first image meaning that you could trade actually forty thousand okay okay with with just emptying the first limit not needing to empty further limits okay that was the case prior to the crisis with a low volatility environment then during the first drop what happened is that suddenly coincidentally with the wider england sprints here you saw a very strong decline a very strong decline in the available senses okay these available sizes dropped from forty thousand to almost fifteen thousand okay so you should drop while in fact you had a great turnover so meaning you had a lot of turnover in part the market was considered that it's very liquid okay because a lot of send over to plates but spreads widened and available sizes dropped severally during the market rebound here the available sizes increased from 15 000 back to 20 but we were still halfway from 40 and uh they stable they remain more less stable and did not revert to the pre-crisis level so again this raises questions say why is this the case how can we explain this so we can explain it easily market microstructure as well by the behavior of the one that is here providing liquidity and being the market maker so what is the problem of the market maker the problem of the market maker is that by displaying some quotes here at the first limits the market maker is incurring risk okay and the greater the volatility the greater the risk for a given credit side that will be posted on the first image so what happens if a market maker wants to control the risk and manage with a constant risk exposure when we let it increase to in fact uh keep this risk exposure constant you have to reduce the quantity you put on the first limit and that is the main explanation why we see this phenomenon and it is often and always the case as we will see later that when volatility increases in order not to have an overall exposure and risk market maker will reduce the size dipoles on the first limit so earning results in showing smaller available sizes on the first limit so this is what we what happened over 2020. now if we look at again in a different representation linking here on the x-axis intraday volatility computed just as we did uh on the first line so the previous example on for example when we related relativity with uh bid ask sprites here we do the same computation uh here on the y-axis we display the first image size the first limit size and what you observe is that when volatility increases you've got this kind of hyperbolic shape which here induces a decline in the first limit sizes according to a greater entry-level activity so this relationship is not linear it's not perfect but you still have an idea of how things are related between the first limit sizes and volatility during the worst of the crisis when volatility internal volatility was extreme around 100 you see that you had almost the 14 the 15k that we described and then we reverted almost halfway okay so this is what we saw over 2020 uh for this relationship now if we step back and want to study this relationship over a longer term period let's look at the mooc example and in the book example we did it over 10 years 20 2007 to 2018 here we represented things more specifically so it's the volatility portrait that really is the quantity that is uh for me that extends the most the risk of the market maker because it is at each trade by how much the market will change at each trade so if you plot and the x-axis the volatility per trade on the y-axis if you want to make things comparable you don't have to compare euros it's better to come to measure average threat size uh the depth in average threat size meaning how many potential trades will be and will be present on the best limits and it's measured in so in fact so that you can normalize different stocks using the same metric and what you see is a nice quite nice relationship because over time when relativity increases you have decline in the first image scientist that is also observable on a long-term historical database so what we can say that the reduction in available sizes on the first image is completely here consistent with long-term properties and the fact that we've reverted halfway is just because in fact volatility is still way higher than it was prior to the crisis meaning early 2020 so that is for this one now if you want to relate uh here are both variables together the b dash spread and the first limit size here you've got also a nice relationship on average uh here are the b desk spreads and the first limit size have this kind of hyperbolic shape meaning that for a larger hero over time when you have a larger bid ask spreads usually for the same stocks you will have a smaller available size on the first limit so this is a property that holds true again for the reason that we explain it that volatility will create a larger with a spread and a tighter a smaller first limit size so because of this uh relationship with validity we have this negative relationship between the first limit sizes and the best spread it is also something that you observe looking at past 10 years from 2007 to 2018 here where we have exactly the same phenomenon when there is here a larger bit ask spreads usually it coincides with a tighter with a here thinner first emit sense here in this property what is also nice that we can explain with this normalization because we are in this chart here also is that when you express the spreads here in tick in thick sides you divide the spread by the thick sides you will see that of course since the spread can never be tighter than one tick when the spread is here constrained by the peak size here the first limit size increases a lot as here are represented by these examples since in order to compete market maker cannot increase i mean tightened a bit aspect but they have no choice than to adding more limits on the uh existing limits that's why the uh available limits are greater when stocks have a bit of spread that is constrained on the pit okay it means that this relationship again that we observed in 2020 here makes sense and is consistent with long-term properties that we can observe over the past 10 years okay so that is a roughly like a summary uh for for these parts that uh whatever the market capitalization of the stocks when validity increases over time bidder spreads also widen well we can also observe it at the older book depth clearly decreases with increasing volatility as market maker makers reduce the risk okay and during the cubic crisis so no spectacular or phenomenon took place this if you were controlling for the volatility increase things were normal and here i must just say a word we had a lot of debate during the worst of the crisis with regulators different european regulators some of them even saying that should we shouldn't we close the market is the market behaving properly are market makers doing their job and it shows that yes the market was behaving as normal due to the crisis and the functioning was not here modified that much spread widening were consistent with a volatility increases okay so now in the second part of the presentation we are going to disclose flows many uh we're not just going to look at the other book but things how did market participants behaved and who are our market participants okay so here what we have which is uh great in europe because of our regulators sometimes we complain a lot about our regulators but sometimes it's good on the data side because sometimes regulators require that data should be extremely carefully labeled and this is the case so we know extremely precisely in all european exchanges if we are trading with an agency flow meaning for broker training on behalf of another client we know if it's a prop desk flow you know if it's a liquidity trader or retail flow we know this with no ambiguity so this is what we're going to study okay so first oh okay we've seen this graph just to recap in four phases because we will distinguish the drop the first rebound the plateau and the secondary band and we will review in each of these phases how market participants behaved so first here uh here we are going to look at market shares okay so here first it is something that was considered as a proprietary information not so long ago so not it's not available everywhere you can't find it everywhere this kind of chart so here you represent who is trading our stocks i mean roughly what's the market share of each of the participants so what we see before describing the changes during each of the phase what we see here is that you have like the largest category is prop desk and liquidity providers when we've aggregated here prop desk in light night blue propdesk and the liquidity provider that represents like two-thirds of the liquidity here most of them i want exactly which part but most of them come from liquidity providers liquidity providers are specialized uh trading firms that in order to benefit from uh here special fees have to fulfill requirements meaning they have to be at the first image for a given size for some uh being at the best best limit and providing liquidity to benefit from office so we can flag them very clearly okay these are usually the lowest latency the best infrastructure and they are the most well-known proprietary trading firms so you see these are the first category then come the global brokers so the global brokers are the global brokers like the largest primary brokers most of them being exclusively almost extremely large u.s brokers okay they represent i would say like 25 of our floats then come the regional brokers the regional brokers are the non-global brokers meaning either european-based or asian-based brokers that are not in this global category they represent a third of global brokers and what is interesting is that their clients are not usually the largest hedge funds meaning that their flaws is mostly made of directional players meaning fundamental fund managers that are based locally in europe so they have a very different training profile as for example watch the profile you will observe if you look at global brokers then and the last one is the retail the written market okay the retail market we can identify them very clearly because they put different schemes different uh different behavior and they more or less represent like six percent in uh all the ma and our market and we can identify them very clearly okay this is the broader broad picture now let's look at what is happening what has happened during each of these states so first during the drop so during the drop interestingly enough you had an increase in liquidity providers the market share rose here as you can see prior to the drop it was i would say around 62 percent it grows until 66 percent meaning that despite criticism when the market was in trouble times when volatility increased enormously market makers were there not only if we're the present but the market here increased in comparison to other times okay so the fulfillment mission they would not they did not retract when times were difficult so it's important to have this in mind and we showed this specifically to regulators showing they were doing their job okay while they have a bad reputation and everyone blames hfts without them the market wouldn't have behaved this way at this well then you see the global global workers in mid blue global brokers were tempted to be less present during these troubled times okay and they were compensated by a liquidity provider during the recovery what happened it was a little surprising for many participants also for us i must say that we had the rise of the retail the retail investors we were in fact really like more and more present and their market share increased as uh it has never increased in the past it can seem small here but uh rising from six to eight four to six percent is a lot in relative terms meaning that retail brokers observed many kind of new accounts uh that people wanted to buy stocks and never did before so there was a lot of participation from uh retail flows that we can invest we will see before while liquidity providers were less present in this recovery phase the plateau phase we haven't seen a lot of things and then we can what we can see the secondary band the recent free band that we just saw recently you have i would say global participants who are more present and you will see that uh they were the one that were the quickest to buy the market very recently early november so this is the first idea of how market here is distorted in 2020. again this might be very different in the us but it's kind of european view of the market so the first things if you want to look at the flows the most well-known made metric is the trading imbalance so the trading imbalance it represents the buys minus the sales divided by the total by percent if it's one hundred percent plus it means that you just had buys between minus one hundred percent you just set the sales and so this is an idea here how uh trading imbalances evolved over the 2020. okay so perhaps we go here it's a representation styling representation but as i think it should uh perhaps be a little quicker so just pass here on this view with an insta where you can see exactly a bar chart where you can see every period so we distinguish these four periods so what is interesting is that during the market drop here we represent the trading imbalance of each of the participants with this kind of bar chart while here with the dotted line we represent the coinciding market performance both close to close and the intraday chain performance for we'll get into this a little later so what we can see that interestingly despite the strong market drop we can see that regional brokers were buyers okay more buying than selling retail brokers were really buying with a very strong uh trading imbalance meaning that retail investors despite their small size we are really really interested in buying and where contrarian during this strong drop okay while global workers were not that by buying the market and stop desks were rather sellers okay this was something interesting in the second phase the rebound it was you also had like retail brokers that were strongly buying the market okay and during the last phase uh the recovery the strong recovery here you had some regional volcanoes that were buyers retail worth sellers and prod desks were buyers so this is a first view of a trading imbalance by market participants during each of these phases okay so what you can see here at first sight is that the prop desk and liquidity providers provided liquidity during the largest market drop okay during the rebound uh the ma the retail uh market share rose quickly and that during the first drop you can see that retail flows were still extremely dire and well uh in fact balancing the market against other participants that were rather heavily sellers okay just for this part now we are going to study something a little more complex but not too complex it is something how can we explain the performance with the trading imbalances okay so it's something interesting because theoretically we feel that when you have more buyers when you have a lot of buyers uh stocks would have to tend to perform or underperform when there are more sellers since also the market is completely balanced because you've got as many buyers as sellers in uh for example i in the in the market because it is the case is always the case so we will study the correlation between the trading imbalance and the performance okay something we will study we'll study it either using close to close performance or looking just at the intraday performance showing that looking at intra-day performance we can explain more precisely the performance because the performance during the day is more strongly linked to the actual trading where the overnight performance is not attributable to a thread that only takes place in the continuous phase so this is the first two uh questions we're going to raise and then we have also here we will address another question and this will be the last one it's called aggressive trading imbalance because as an exchange we can not only distinguish the flows meaning the buys and the cells but we can also distinguish the aggressive binds meaning the bias that took place at the ask or the cells that took place at the bids and these aggressive flows are more likely to impact stocks as we will see so we will also study this correlation between the aggressive trading imbalance and the performance also and with the cutting imbalance and the performance so these are the metrics that we can see here and so couple new questions um we have a couple new questions the the first one is um and i think it was referring to the previous slide does this imply that retail brokers were generally buying when shares were dropping in price in the first phase here yes it is exactly what we see because you see that original brokers here in mid green the trading imbalance was around plus 12 during this severe drop where the market dropped by i would say 30 percent looking at the right-hand scale okay axis so yes exactly retail brokers were heavily buying during this phase yes and we have another question related to slide 26 um which is do you have a theory why the market share change of global brokers is so negatively correlated to the prop market share so time yeah the drought global is it yeah yeah yeah well theory it's not a theory it's just pure math it stands since the sum of the all of them equals to 100 percent and since they are the two largest uh in numbers yes when one varies the other is more likely to absorb it that would be the mathematical the trivial explanation and then yes it is a bit i would say that the regional brokers are more steady because their behavior is less affected by very aggressive participants so that is one thing so since it varies a little less as well as the retail then the two potential drivers of these variations are yes the global brokers and the liquidity pointers i think someone raised the handle some is there another question session uh not for now okay good so uh we've been there so we are just explaining this matrix and now we look at the results okay so there we are looking at uh here for example weekly performances and we look uh let's take for example at uh here on the left hand side and here on this uh just these four parts here this is the correlation between the training imbalance okay here for each participant let's say the global broker training imbalance and the performance of a stock over a weekly period here so what we observe here is that on average there is a positive correlation between the trading imbalance of the global brokers and the performance of the stocks their performance of the stock so it is positive meaning that on average since these global workers represent a large fraction at 24 of our flows when they are buying tents that i would explain it as a market impact but it tends to show it tends to coincide with an outperformance of the stocks in with a 15 correlation this is less the case for regional brokers as they would represent a fewer smaller fraction of the flow and it is even less and this correlation is negative for retail burgers so here we see that and it is often a phenomenon that we always see retail brokers at least in europe have a negative correlation with the performance meaning that not they don't it is not the case that they don't impact the market but in fact that they have a contrarian views it is either by posting limited orders that for example have uh attractive limit orders and when the stock hits this level they find themselves buying the market meaning that it will be buyer when the stocks dropped for example okay this is a behavior that is extremely common for retail flows so this is something we see and if you look at the next four months here we study the correlation but not with a standard training imbalance but with the aggressive imbalance and then you see stronger results the correlation here is not i would say 12 but it was raised to 16 or 18 okay meaning that you have a better explanation of the performance that is coming from the aggressive flows because the aggressive flaws are more likely to impact stock performances as you can see clearly for all participants unless for retail brokers because they don't impact but in fact they find themselves buying a stock when the stock drops because of their behavior of posted limit orders so this is for the close to close performance but you have even a better explanation if you look at intraday performance because then the correlation is more tighter it's tighter and greater because then you don't you're not the performance is not polluted by periods that happen overnight where in fact trades have no impact so for example if you look at the right hand side here on again global brokers the correlation with if you look at the correlation of the aggressive trading imbalance with the stocks outperformance here which is almost like 24 which is quite large which is quite large and that explains show that they agree quite well with in fact stocks performance it is less the case for uh regional brokers and you still have this negative correlation for retail for little buggers so it's interesting to have this view and by the way this year is also quite telling because out of this as us as exchange we make and build product for hedge funds where we aggregate daily all these kind of signals with many many many metrics to see how are the most likely flow is going to be stuck by stock over the next day so i have a question about trading imbalance and how it's measured i was wondering whether you could give a sort of an intuition for you know if these correlations are negative does it for the retail does it mean that they're losing money or you know or we can't say that for sure i see and it's it's i mean if it was positive you can either say that you're you're trending following or that you are creating a market impact if you have got a positive correlation okay if you've got a negative correlation it is more that you will find that you are contrarian meaning that when you find a stock and you say okay i would buy a stock if this stocks drops by five percent then if there is a five percent drop you will find yourself buying this stock because you can wow it has now an attractive level and because they have such kind of behavior saying this is an opportunity when they see a drop okay that's why uh that's why we see this negative correlation it is not a causality it's just a correlation and to me it is uh caused and it's created by their behavior meaning that when they see attractive price compared to historical anchor levels that they've seen they think it is an opportunity likewise they would sell a stock that is usually more expensive that's what they see they consider as uh they're used to and so that's why they find themselves more selling stuff that are have outperformed but so if i'm buying during a big drop i would see a very large negative correlation and if at the close at the end of the day the price is lower than when i bought it that would be an example of a yes negative correlation or you put it on the days where the stocks dropped for example okay that would be an example okay so it seems nice to see this and now if you look at the trading aggressive trading imbalance because it's the kind of thing even even if this metric is less well known as the trading imbalance the aggressive trading is balanced it's more telling and here if you look at each of these spaces again you will see that regional what is interesting is that regional brokers were aggressively buying the market okay during the drop while global workers were less inclined to do so retail workers were also on retail flows heavily paying the market while uh hope desks were aggressively selling the market because here being a buyer or a seller is not the same thing when you're a patient buyer or a patient seller or an impatient one because when you're really impatient it is when you impact the market and it's also most likely it is where you have uh here for example a strong trading signal that even if you want to pay for a higher price you don't mind doing so because you have greater expectations so it is also telling to disentangle and to here disentangle these two imbalances between the passive one or the standard one and the aggressive one and uh again in the market rebound in the here the strong market rebound that we saw the last one the aggressive if you just look at the aggressive participants you see that this last rebound was mostly fueled by either global brokers i mean okay global brokers or protests while in fact retail where safety cautious for the high classic flows during the last period in november okay then in these few more slides i represent sector by sector what is what has happened during each of these phases okay so you can see the drop and the rebound okay i won't go there sector by sector but i think it's also interesting if you want to look at this and understand better how participants behaved okay so what we can say here is that i think to step back a little is that if you study correlation the one that cause already have a positive correlation with uh stocks high performance is uh by far global brokers this correlation will be stronger if you look at intraday chain performance in comparison to close to close and even stronger if you study like the aggressive training balance instead of the simple trading imbalance you will also find that retail flows at least in europe are heavily contrarian and it's not something that is that well known because some people would bet one hasn't seen the data that retail investors would tend to be trained followers they are not in europe or they don't behave like this with this metric uh that is also interesting and for us as an exchange just in order to i would say almost to conclude it's important that we have when we maintain the diversity of uh training participants because in fact it is without the heterogeneity of all these participants the market will not be as resilient as it is as balanced as it is and uh in fact everyone fulfills its role and you see that during this time drop liquidity providers took the lead and had a greater market share instead retail also were important in uh aggressively buying the market so it is a balance that we have to manage as her market here are managers and when we run an extent it is something that is really important to have in mind okay so for me i would be happy if you have questions because you've got uh i've got 10 minutes and if you had more questions you can always ask us or sasha and get back to me and i will be sure to answer each of them so i'm happy to get the floor to section so there are a few questions um that are remaining on the q a um one is interesting so it's have you ever thought of using sentiment data from let's say news headlines to explain the retail actions or do you have an explanation for their strong contrarian behavior well i must say i haven't uh unless for some specific like earnings enhancements for example where i studied things very clearly deeply i haven't connected such a thing i don't really know i haven't studied the behavior of apart from this because i study which really puzzles me and i think it's fascinating it's the connection between the flow and the performance for the next performance next day performance or the next uh behavior not going back to the root cause of where this behavior so i must say i thought this would be perhaps more for sasha for academics i haven't studied this it's not so much my thing but no sorry i haven't done it yeah i we have another question which is um do you have a view on the role of the algo algorithms or algos to the behavior of the different broker types okay hello here uh it's an interesting question uh what is really when you look at things uh and we should do and we even have products on these and daily things uh it's quite different looking at global brokers or regional brokers for one reason is that global brokers tend to attract many many like hedge funds because they tend to trade with the prime brokers and that's heavily represented in these flows whereas in contrast local brokers have almost no almost no very large hedge fund or no conference so they are quite different so yes i can say that this typology flows are quite different and regional flows are way more fundamental way more fundamental and quite different and the correlation between these two flows is not great at all and it's really interesting to have some kind of very different behaviors between two brokers right when the question is specifically the question is asking for the algorithms that uh lead the execution i would say that there is not such a big difference because in the uh algorithmic world i would say like three main types of angles dominate all the world which is the the v web the volume the implementation shortfall with these three types of files you get almost everything and global original brokers have this kind of analogous so it's not so much the type of the execution but the nature of the underlying execution i would say that distinguish if it's for example a quantitative trait that's done by a quad fund or if it's a fundamental trait by that that differs mostly rather than the algorithm itself and well within broker then of course hfts and equity providers have got completely different types of algorithms one another question that just came up can you comment on the direction of causality of the global broker flows is it the buying that is moving the stock prices up or are they buying when expecting a positive return hello i think that uh all of them well i would have to the question that i think all of all participants by i mean by almost all of them would expect a greater return unless economists would call it otherwise a non-informed flow meaning that when they have to pay for their car or whatever their expense and their the they sell stocks but apart from these specific cases when you buy it's because you've been you expect that it will be higher in the future so uh so this well but for the causality to answer the causality i think you've got it's hard to disentangle honestly because then it is one of the hardest question you can and most of the interesting question it's hard to do something else we know that it's hard to integrate between market impact and also buying and being a momentum trader i can't disentangle the the two i would say perhaps uh one thing that leans i would link the world by being steady or momentum oriented is that what is the case is that the order of magnitude of market impact is way smaller okay so for example if you have a large market impact by 20 bits it's a large amount of marketing bank meaning you've bought perhaps two percent of the adv of the stock okay it's perhaps it won't induce a lot of correlation whereas if you have like a momentum buyer you will introduce far more correlation so because of this argument i would perhaps lean towards the momentum style versus the contrarian and the momentum for for the global but i am unsure it's just i haven't studied it specifically enough okay um so we have a an interesting question about the retail traders so retail traders typically have weaker hands to that of prop desks so do you believe this correlation and trade imbalance could change if uh performance goes negative again like in march now that retail has added so much to their now that retail has added so much to their portfolio hello what i would say that for sure where there is a structural difference in these uh in these buyers okay these new participants and we heard it specifically even if it's not an ex who is like a broker themselves but we heard that there was many creation of new participants some even i'm not i'm not saying this uh as a rumor but some said that even because of confinement some people that didn't couldn't bet on horses or whatsoever or on gaming but took part and opened the account i think it doesn't reflect for the whole participation of the retail but it's true that i would say newcomers were absorbed on the market it is something that is said by every institution and all uh all retail brokers in europe at least so perhaps and that's that's probable when someone is a newcomer a bad experience or a first experience is really critical and perhaps if these participants were unhappy and i hope it won't be the case perhaps it would take them a while to get back in the market in contrast with participants that have years of experience and for them but bad market is something that they know how to deal with so yes i would be perhaps skeptical for these newcomers i don't know how they would handle a bad performance and what is a real experience of risk and knowledge yes so that's why brokers have to inform and people have to inform these participants what well they are doing and the risk they are incurring okay paul well uh thanks for this very interesting talk that's provoked a lot of questions uh okay and again so yeah thank you thank you all and if you got specific questions either like technical questions how things were computed uh in the mooc it's quite explained but uh it's not a problem i will be completely transparent because all these data i mean the data are public uh if you've got other questions get back to us when answer with pleasure yeah so uh paul besson you can find him easily on linkedin and he's active there so um so feel free to follow up there paul thank you so much okay thanks a lot sasha and thank you all thank you thank you then and uh have a great day in new york and sleep well in europe ok bye bye bye bye
