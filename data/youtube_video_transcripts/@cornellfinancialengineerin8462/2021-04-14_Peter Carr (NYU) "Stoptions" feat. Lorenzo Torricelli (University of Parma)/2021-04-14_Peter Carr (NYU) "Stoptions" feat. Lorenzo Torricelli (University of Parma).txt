to get it started okay so uh welcome everybody uh i'm really excited to have peter carr talk about stoptions today so peter is the chair of finance and risk engineering at nyu tandon and uh he was a a professor at cornell for eight years so uh he he we're always happy to have him back um he's been quant of the year he's been the financial engineering of the year he's worked at bloomberg morgan stanley has uh something close to a hundred publications and has sort of been a little bit everywhere in quantitative finance and so it's a great uh privilege for us to have him uh he's also co-author of mine and uh sort of the way these things uh came together is when i invited him to speak it to this seminar uh you know we he did a classic academic i'll scratch your back you scratch mine so i ended up um sort of uh accepting his invitation and we timed it so that it was in the same week so if this thursday uh you you want to see more of uh peter and sasha then then that's that's your chance so i've put in the uh chat at the top of the chat we have a link to our youtube channel um so we'll you'll see that in our um part two of uh the session today uh lorenzo toricelli from university of parma will be doing a mini presentation on um sort of the implementation side of of peter's talk and the second link that i've uh that i've included is a link to peter's weekly seminar at nyu tandon and i'll be giving a talk this thursday so uh that's at 9 30 on thursday so anyways uh thank um without further ado peter i'm very happy to hear uh your work about your work on stop thank you sasha all right um so here we go um you can please put questions in the q a and we'll deal with them after my talk ends so i'd like to begin by thanking many people including mike lipkin who i know is attending and um so what is this option that is in my title so it's a new financial contract and i think when i go forward i'm going to start to call it a new financial product uh because in math we use the word product to describe multiplication and let's say this is kind of similar so um anyway this this new contractor financial product is a hybrid between a futures contract and a put option so like a futures the contract has an underlying so it could be for example the value of a swap and i'm choosing that because i'm thinking that the value is real meaning could be positive could be negative um anyway there's a monitoring frequency in this options contract we'll use daily but it could be weekly monthly whatever and moreover there's a fixed term we'll use for example one year but i know i don't really care but it's finite and um so we're going to use daily monitoring in this talk as i mentioned um but all we really need is that you're able to look at the underlying price at the end of each monitoring interval so say at the end of each day so like a long position in the futures the owner of adoption accrues each price change in the underlying whether that's positive or negative but unlike along futures the owner of a stoption can avoid an unfavorable price change so as i mentioned this is a hybrid between a futures contract and a put and the put part of it lets you avoid an unfavorable price change and the kind of put is actually bermudin so um so the way it works is that you can exercise your stoption at the end of any day your choice which day and if you do then you replace that day's price change with a constant so you're basically swapping the last price change for a constant we'll call the constant a floor uh it's a real number and it's contractually specified and as you can see from the subscript i on the letter a i'm using to describe the floor the the amount you get when you swap on day i can depend on the day okay so you could have for example a rising series of floors a falling series of floors a sinusoidal series of floors any function of floor any function of time you like can describe the floors so um this option must be exercised once okay so you might say well why is this an option and it's an option because as long as there's two or more days in the stop shooting contract you have a choice of when to stop so there's flexibility as to when you exercise so that's why option is in the name of the financial product so when you exercise you stop the exposure to price changes so that's a way of saying that you can only exercise once and you must exercise once and um so so the as i mentioned the option in the words option refers to when to stop the exposure to the underlying by exercising and i'll illustrate uh this payoff on the next slide with a three days option but we'll also talk about one day's options two days options four days options etc and okay so let's do a three days option and i'm going to use little s to denote the spot price of the underlying security and s1 minus s0 is a real number and you can think of it as standing for the random value change of the underlying over the first day so we're you know we're trying to value on day zero and it's a three days option and um the first days price change is random and you know is a difference of the two price levels today's and tomorrow's so s2 minus s1 is also a real number and it's the random value change over the second day and um we won't actually need the third price change it turns out so there's three floors and they can be any real numbers positive or negative i happen to pick three positive numbers here and let's say i pick them in a perhaps unusual way using natural log of 3 4 and 12. but this will make the calculations easier later on in this time so so pick some for three days option pick some ordered triple real numbers and um you know if it so happens that the three numbers you pick are non-negative then i can assure you that you would pay a positive upfront premium because basically um like for example if you chose all three floors to be zero then you can you can um swap any price change for zero okay so you would swap a negative price change for zero if it realized and um so you know but the the you can't get a negative payoff if you were for example to uh swap the first negative realization so for zero so the value has to be non-negative and um so here's what you can do um for any three floors whether they're non-negative or not so you could exercise at the end of the first day and if you do then you receive the floor associated with the first day which happens to be log three in this example that's a positive number um or you could exercise at the end of the second day and what you would receive is log four so log four is the floor for the second day plus the price change over the first day so what happened here is if you exercise the end of day two it means you did not exercise the end of day one and so you just accrued the price change over the first day but if you exercise the end of day two you're basically saying i didn't like the second day's price change so i'm swapping it for log four and so the payoff is the first day's price change that you accepted by not swapping at the end of the first day plus log four that you get from swapping at the end of the second day but you don't have to exercise in the second day you could exercise the end of the third day and you have to exercise then if you didn't exercise on either the first few days and um and then what you've got is log 12 which is the floor associated with the third day plus what's written there is s2 minus s0 but you can think of that as the sum of the first two days price changes it's just that there's a telescoping going on so we can write it as the aggregate change over the first two days so you know in words if you own this option your accruing price change as they realize except that at the end of each day you can look back one day and swap the last price change for a floor and should you do that you get an immediate payment equal to that day's floor plus all previously realized price changes so the contract you know expires when you exercise and then and you can you know you must exercise once so that's the contract now does it actually trade no but uh should it trade yes uh you'll see why it's sort of a national contract it's kind of it is actually embedded in many uh financial agreements but it doesn't trade under this name and let's say maybe not explicitly so so why should we look at this contract if it doesn't trade outright and um well one answer is is it's an example of a contract with bermuda exercise style and um you know would say there's a fair bit of interest in anything with remute and exercise style because we have trading liquidly bermuda and swaptions and um let's say well those are easily valued numerically um and it's analytical understanding is thus far been lacking and perhaps this related contract called adoption can help us to understand bermuda swaptions so you know what's the difference those options are bermuda options written on price increments as opposed to bermuda options written on price levels so the let's say the fact that the underlying for a bermuda option is a price change rather than a price level means that the dependent structure uh is easier so we're later going to assume that price changes are iid and that's a standard assumption and um if price changes or id then price levels are actually correlated and um so let's say so it's actually easier to work with options on changes than options on levels and so when we do assume a particular dependent structure for price increments which is actually iid then we reduce stoption valuation to function iteration okay so you may or may not be familiar with the mathematical notion of function iteration but what it really means is you have a function whose output happens to live in the same space as its input so for example it maps the real line to the real line and um and then when you iterate the function you take the output of the first uh instance of the function and feed it back to the function as an input so output becomes input and you do it again so you so you just you know if you ever had a calculator when you were bored to death and high school algebra and then you started hitting the square root button repeatedly and noticed it it converged to one uh you know what i mean by function iteration okay so um so um we're going to um not only assume iid price changes but in the second half of this talk uh impose a particular distributional assumption on the price changes that have common distribution and um this will reduce stoption valuation to something called pseudo edition so i don't expect any of you to know what pseudo addition is unless you happen to hear one of my earlier talks and uh it's a binary operation that has the same algebraic properties as ordinary addition but need not be ordinary addition so an example of that would actually be ordinary multiplication that's not the one we're going to use there's going to be a third binary operation that will be it is actually fairly natural i would say as natural as multiplication that we'll be using so the um in the end we're going to use this this particular distribution this particular model um to determine the optimal exercise strategy and the replicating strategy for this option using vanilla calls and the overcharge free value of an npurious option and being any positive integer and all of those are given by simple closed form formulas so hopefully the six these insights can be used for the liquidly traded bermuda options okay so i've told you what an end a station is and let's try to now think about how to value them and we'll start with the simplest kind the absolute simplest kind are one based options and so what's a one day stoption so it's just gonna pay its fixed floor which is you know specified in the contract at the end of the first day and then it's going to go away so in other words it's a bond okay a zero coupon bond okay and um so we're going to actually assume zero interest rates and no default so the value of getting a constant a1 today under those assumptions is a1 so that problem was solved okay so now let's turn to a slightly more complicated station it's a two days option so it's got two floors and you know just to go through the payoffs once again you you have to exercise it's two days option so you get exercise either during the first date or the end of the second day and you have to exercise one of those days so if you did exercising on the first day you're getting the the fixed cash amount a1 as with the one days option but with the two days option you need not exercising on the first day you could exercise in the second day and if you did then you'll get the floor associated with the second day a2 plus with the price change that you ended up you know being forced to accrue because you did not exercise at the end of the first day so let's give a name to this um payoff at the end of the second day if that's when you exercise we're going to call it u1 i'm thinking of letter u for underlying and you might wonder why did i subscript it one when it's realized the end of the second day and well it's paid at the end of the second day so it's actually realized at the end of the first day because when you're at time one you know s1 you knew s 0 at time 0 and a2 is just a number in the contract so we're again assuming no interest rates and so the timing of chaos doesn't really matter and um so i've been saying that with the first if you exercise at the end of the first day you would get a one at the end of the first day and the exercise at the end of day two you would get u1 at the end of the second day but it doesn't since u1 is actually a known constant as of the end of the first day you might as well say you get it then so okay so um so if you looked at it that way then the payoff is is either that you exercise at the end of the first day and get a one or you don't and if you don't then you're getting you one okay and the value at the end of the first day is u1 it's a known number as of the end of the first day so it's random as of time zero um because when you're at time zero you don't know there's s1 that's in the u1 but anyway um so so what is this random payoff since you're sitting at time zero well something you might think of doing is factoring out u1 okay so that you'll make this path become zero when you do and then you would change the a1 payoff to be a1 minus u1 if you did that and um so so let's say the reason you might choose to do that is now you have the max of something in zero and let's say we are very familiar with valuing such payoffs they're called options and so you know a point of view is that um since a1 here is a known strike even on day zero and u1 here is a random variable you know the point of view is that this payoff in square brackets is a put payoff so you have it's a put written on u1 and added to it is u1 so that actually that payoff has a name it's called the married put and um so we can say that the two days option has the same payoff as a one day married put and the strike of the one day mary put or the put embedded in the married put is a one and um you know the underlying of this married put is a random variable and um you know the realization will be known at time one and we're calling it u1 and what is its price today so you get its price today by taking expected value under its neutral measure of u1 and um we're assuming everything is is arbitrage free there's zero interest rates there's no dividends so s is the martingale so the price today of these this underlying has to be a2 which is a known number for us so you know the price underlying as usual so okay so we valued let's say once you have a model for valuing a vanilla option then you can at least value a two days option um and um so just in general to value multi-day office options be they two day three days whatever you're going to need to value the embedded put and so you need distributional assumptions to do that so okay so we're assuming that the underlying security values are real valued as opposed to non-negative so i gave as an example that this option is written on the value of a swap so you know when a swap is first issued its value is zero and then the value can become negative after that and um so we're thinking of adoption on that kind of security so notice i don't call it an asset we call it a security and um you know we're assuming that there's no carrying cost interest rates dividends what have you they're all convenience yields all zero and we're also assuming no arbitrage so as is well known first final theory of asset pricing there exists a martingale measure we'll call it q as usual and you know under cue i'll securities prices evolve as martingales so that would include this option that would include its underlying and um so since its underlying is a martingale price changes or mean zero and um now price changes are allowed to um have statistical dependence in general and you know the dynamics are still recharge free but we're actually going to rule that out we're going to assume that price increments are statistically independent of each other m or over have the same distribution so this is a let's say a common assumption statistics assume i id for some sequence of random variables so the price increments here are assumed id under the rest neutral measure and um okay so under the these assumptions we're going to value uh two days options like try we've you know realized it's a married put but we haven't actually let's say figured out how to value married put and so we're gonna do that next and then we're also gonna do three days options and the pattern will friend based options will become apparent so just a reminder that the two days option has a payoff which is the max of a constant that you know because it's in the contract called a1 and a random variable that you don't know at times zero because it depends on another random variable s1 which is the price of the underlying security tomorrow so the um the you know this option payoff if you just think of it as occurring at the end of day one it's the larger of a constant floor a1 and a continuation value that's random and um but the mean of that random continuation value is this number a2 that's in the stoption contract so let's just sort of develop a notation for valuing a married put we'll use the letter m um with a subscript too to think of you know a value married put so the subscript is merely telling you uh how many days this option is alive two days and it's also a one day married put and um so you know since it's a two day stoption there's two floors a1 and a2 and as you can see we're thinking them somewhat asymmetrically a1 which is the known part of the payoff if you think of it as a married put so that's the strike is the superscript and then a2 is actually the price today of the underlying so the underlying is u1 and its price today's a2 so that's our notation and so we need to value a married put whose strike is a1 because underlines priced at a2 and we have this notation for denoting that so once you pick a particular risk neutral distribution for um for the price increment s1 minus s0 which has zero mean then you've determined the distribution of u1 and hence the value of the married put so you know the first choice you'd probably pick for a random variable with real support and zero mean would be normal with mean zero and some variance sigma squared that's a choice you could make but any real supported distribution uh is fine with me and um so anyway so you would value the married put and thereby value the two days option once you picked a distribution so you know you don't have to choose normal you can choose some other distribution which in general would have a parameter vector theta so maybe your distribution is variance gamma and has you know three parameters in it and um so um so whatever you pick the married put price would depend on theta the our notation doesn't reflect that just because theta is actually fixed across the different increments so we just won't reflect the notational dependence on the parameter vector describing the pdf of the price change okay so let's graduate to a three days option um so at the top a reminder of the payoffs but rather than read them all in words you get a floor plus um previously accrued price changes added together so um okay so you can use dynamic programming to figure out how to value a three days option so we're going to use the letter c v which stands for continuation value um and subscript it by the time at which we're looking at the continuation value so we'll call that i it's a positive integer and the superscript in brackets is just the number of um exercise opportunities that remain and um so um you didn't need it you know if it's a it's always going to be however many days the stops is alive less the subscript but i you know just prefer to have it so we'll put that superscript there in brackets and um and proceed so as usual with dynamic programming you start at the end and work your way back to time zero so that's also called backward recursion and we're actually going to start at day two not day three and the reason is actually like all the uncertainty that we need to know in this problem is resolved as of the end of day two so if you're continuing at day two then you're getting the floor associated with day three you can say on day three plus like the two previous price changes and um so which which telescope into that so okay so we're you know where you're going to set this is sort of like terminal condition we're gonna set the continuation value at day two with one exercise opportunity remaining which is day three to um this amount okay so that's what you're gonna get at the end of day three and you know at the end of day two so that's that's what you're getting okay so now we step back a day as usual when you're doing dynamic programming and um so now we're at day one not day two there's two exercise opportunities there at the end of day two and the end of day three and um how do we value well we sort of say to ourselves so the subscript e on one is the time we're at and we're saying we're at time one and we could exercise at the end of the second day in which case we'll get the floor plus this amount which is actually known as of the end of time one and um you know or continue and you know we've got a handy notation for continuation value i'll just comment that the continuation value is always convex and so you can always still think of cv as standing for convex function which it will be okay so anyhow um the um so the we've already calculated you know right up here what that continuation value is so we need merely stick it in which is what we've done okay so now we're looking at this this payoff at the at um you know which is realized at the end of the second day and we're at the end of the first day and um we might realize something which is that this um sum of the first two days increments uh is uh is the sum of the first two days increments okay so um so you know so you can do that math trick you know subtract s1 at s1 and uh the reason for doing that is now if you think of it that way then s1 minus s0 is in both of the arguments of the max so it's clearly there in the highlighted part and it's implicitly in there so so since it's in both arguments of the max you can factor it out so um that's the language i use uh so so you factor out that common known price increment known as of time one and um and this is what's left and you know what's left is a married put payoff so there's a fixed strike component and then there's a random component that you're maxing the fixed strike with and the mean as of time one of that random highlighted quantity is a3 so we've got a notation developed for value mary put and so we use it so okay so um so now we're let's say we need to step back all the way to time zero and compute the continuation value then so we're back at time zero which is the valuation date and we could exercise at the end of the first day and get a one or we could continue and get that amount which is what we just calculated so since we just calculated let's stick it in and once we stick it in we realize we're at time zero and the payoff is actually the value of a mary put its strike is a1 and what is the um mean of this random payoff so it's random because we're at time zero we don't know s1 so the mean of the highlighted part is actually the married put value as of that we calculated over here and you know so this is a known number to us as of time zero um it's an option value that we calculated let's say at time one but it um just depends on let's say volatility uh or other parameters affecting um the distribution of the price changes um so those parameters are known known as james zero and so this m2 a2 a3 is a known quantity not random what is random and what's highlighted is this one and so anyway we just use our handy dandy um married put valuation formula and we see that we value a married put with a strike a1 whose underlying is another married put with a strike a2 okay and um so you know clearly what we're doing is iterating a function it's got a parameter uh which is the strike and the the parameter can differ at different times but that's okay we're going to allow that and so so we've got the continuation value at time 0 and it's an iterated function and um we're not actually allowing exercise at time zero so i'm under this third bullet point so this is the this is the value the so we can stop here we can stop with the backward recursion for the stop shift okay so um so it's an iterated function as i mentioned and um so um and what we're actually the function we're iterating is um a married put a one-day vanilla married put value function european style and um so um you know so it's like it's i guess it's you know pretty well known that let's say bermuda bermudan options are there are sometimes called compound options and compound is like composition so we're composing a function with itself here and um let's say um you know so let's say maybe you shouldn't be too surprised that this is what happens and um you can work out what happens if it's an n based option where n is any positive integer and it's just an n minus one fold function iteration okay so for the three days option we iterated once uh let's see yeah okay so maybe it's n minus two i have to think about that okay anyhow um so you know that joke about mathematicians there's three kinds those who can't count and those who can't okay let's continue so there's um some functions that when you repeatedly iterate them you can express in closed form and um but a married put value function would never be affined so um so can we find a function that describes the value of one day mary put and iterates in closed form and the short answer will be yes and um so let's say um what we're going to do and this is a choice is um you know exploit something called the associative functional equation and um so um we take a slightly different perspective on the married put value function so instead of thinking of it as there's a parameter a i it's a function of one variable which is the price of its underlying we just think of it as a function of both the parameter and the value it's underlying okay so you know both interpretations are valid and let's say the associative functional equation is a well-known function equation that wants a function of two arguments and it's defined as this okay so if you ever um studied associativity as a property of a binary operation this would seem pretty familiar to you and um so so we're not now we're not we're going to drop the assumption that you picked a particular distribution and so we're sort of going from where we're going to do is we're going to directly value the married put value function by demanding that it solves this associativity functional equation and um that will determine the risk neutral distribution thanks to the sort of breeding linsenberger results that second derivative of an option is the density so um let's say the reason this associative functional equation is is attractive as a way to pin down the mary put value is this guy axel proved in 1948 that um you know the structure of any solution of the associativity functional equation has this form so there's a function g of one argument called the generator and you use it as indicated at the bottom of the slide so so the gist of it is you started with a function of two arguments you you demanded a property of it which is associativity function equation and you finish now having to determine a function of one argument g so okay so um and let's say there's an interpretation of the married put value so we're now saying that once let's say we've picked a g um that's a function one argument and it should be invertible then we've got a merry put value if you just pick any old function g that married put value might have arbitrage in it so we'll come back and fix that up in a minute but anyway for any function one argument g that's invertible this highlighted quantity is also thought of as a pseudo sum so we sort of think of it as well you know there was originally two arguments in the function m and we're combining them somehow okay and um you know so if if g were the identity map then we'd actually be adding them if another example that's um is that g is the exponential function and then what's highlighted here turns out to be ordinary multiplication okay so ordinary multiplication is an example of the pseudo-sum we're actually going to pick a different g than either of those two in a moment and anyway but pick a g and um then you've got a married put value function and then iterate it the right number of times to get the stoption values okay so that's the spirit and um the um let's say this option value ends up being a repeated pseudo-sum um because the pseudo sum binary operation is associative you get to drop brackets and so that's the point um so this is sort of our you might call it abstract valuation formula for an n-based option it's a repeated pseudo-sum of the floors and let's say to make it concrete you need to pick a g which is a function of one variable that's invertible so that's called the generator and moreover to make it arbitrage free you need to pick g carefully you need to have the married put value vr charge free and we'll come to that problem shortly so um so the so now we're going to deal with let's make everything arbitrage free so we're demanding that not only the married put value be a pseudosum of its two arguments but moreover be representable as a risk neutral expectation of its payoff so so the question is you know how to choose the generator g so that this risk neutral measure here and this representation that's highlighted exists okay okay and is there is neutral probability measure so the perhaps surprising fact is that if you're working over the set of reels as we are um the only choice for the generator g is um is um a log so so natural log so you're allowed any base oh sorry i said natural log so that's wrong so uh it's a log of any base not necessarily e so the generator has to be a log with any base so we'll call beta the base and i just find it easier to work with natural logs so it just turns out that well-known properties you probably learned in high school if you're going to force change of base from beta to e you can do that by multiplying by the natural log by a quantity little b related to beta and the actual relation is that b is one over log beta so so we're going to think of it like that that the generator of the arithmetic is forced to be um a scalar b times natural log so the scalar b has to be positive and um so so that's kind of where we're forced into bino arbitrage it's kind of remarkable and um so so then you say okay fine you're forcing me because of no arbitrage to make the generator be uh a log um so then the married put has to be evaluated appropriately so for g there at the beginning of what's highlighted we'd use v times natural log g inverses will be exponentials and there's some married put value and i know that if i differentiate twice with respect to strike i'll get a density so what's the density so it turns out the density is the zero mean logistic distribution which you'll be hearing a lot more about in lorenzo's talk so that is a you know a real supported distribution we're centering it at zero and um it's got a single parameter to describe its width and it's it's b okay so um so the um this b is not literally the standard deviation but it's proportional positively proportional to it and um the so the sort of what we're what we've backed into is that if you sort of demand thinking of married put value as a pseudo-sum then uh the only way to be overcharged free is to make this generator of the pseudosum be a be a logarithm and then the implied supporting risk neutral distribution for the price change is logistic and um you can do the converse if you assume logistic then the the married put is a pseudo-sum and um with log as the generator so okay so we're you know basically going to make that assumptions because we want things to be overcharged free and we like the ability to sort of represent um an iterated function as a pseudosum so um so the formula for the married put with a strike a1 and an underlying that's logistically distributed with mean a2 is given by this simple formula okay so we'll just call that log sum exponential and you know you interpret it as this notation indicates as a type of pseudo-sum so you know there's kind of a interesting uh play on words available here so you were taught in high school that um a product of two factors the log of a product of two factors is the sum of the logs of each factor so now you've learned that the uh exponential of a financial product with two underlyings is the sum of the exponentials of the underlyings what's the financial product and the financial product is a married foot okay um so okay so we've got a binary operation that is not ordinary addition not ordinary multiplication but has the same properties they do and so each of those has a neutral element for ordinary addition it's zero for any multiplication it's one what is it for our new binary operation it turns out to be minus infinity so okay so we've been operating with real numbers up to this point but we wish to include the neutral element in the set so we're going to expand the set that we're working on to be the sort of extended reels where we've extended merely by adding minus infinity to the reals and um so so from an abstract algebra perspective we've got this binary operation and it's acting on a set which is um extended reals and you know it's it's associative by construction and it's closed and it's actually commutative as well has a neutral element so it's called the commutative monoid and um so so you know the main result that a co-author doug costa and i have shown is that the algebraic structure of a commutative monoid is um [Music] is like you know that comes about from arbitrage free option valuation um only arises if the price change is a zero mean with just a grand variable so this logistic random variable is symmetric just like normal but it has exponential tails unlike normal so these tails are heavier and so that's a good thing because whenever we look at data we see heavy tails compared to normal so we're just working with the logistic model for the rest of this talk and i know i only have about five minutes and this logistic distribution is extremely friendly friendlier than normal in my opinion so the cdf is explicit and here it is uh you might recall that for the normal the cdf is not explicit it's the integral of a gaussian which cannot be written in any simpler form and so the you know so we can um just as we speak of a standardized normal by subtracting its mean and dividing by its scale we can do the same thing for a logistic random variable and um so the numerator here is mean zero and uh once we divide by b which is the scale the new random variable z has unit scale and um so that's called a standard logistic and um let's say it's convenient to work with that as usual so the um you know there's this scale just you know controls the width of the logistic random variable and you know a point of view is that the scale is a increasing function of the time to maturity of the option under that that we're talking about the married put say and um so to connect this to time you know you just you have to pick a function b of t which we call bewilderment function that um you know connects the width of the distribution of the logistic random variable to the length of the time horizon you're looking over which first establishment would be one day in the example i'm going through so um and so let's say the if you want an intuition for this scale parameter which is not the standard deviation it turns out to be the value of an option to exchange one logistic random variable for another uh where the two random variables that are both logistic are iid so you know let's say we're you know it's a standard intuition that let's say uh the width of a distribution is somehow connected to option evaluation and here that we've made that very precise and um so okay so we're in this logistic model the cdf for a standard logistic is that is that simple function um consider a binary put strike price k which is real because the underlying is also real the underlying is logistically distributed let's let it have a mean a2 and a scale that depends on the length to the time to maturity of the binary put so you have to specify this function b of t and then if you add the value of the binary put but you would basically use the cdf so that and would be the value and now if you want the married put value you do some standard calculations let's say and the merry put value is a log sum exponential um so this is a married put whose strike is a1 and the value of the underline is a2 and um okay so now let's say we're going to value adoption using logistically distributed increments for the underlying and they're also iid so um okay and we've established that a two-day stoption is a one-day married put and that in the logistic model that's the valuation formula so it's illustrated so say that the you know the way that this the spread is connected to time is such that over a day the spread is the number 0.5 it just needs to be positive then um say that the strike of the married put is log three say that the value of the underlying is log four then you know what's the value of the mary put in this model so the answer is log five and um so i've actually exploited the pythagorean theorem there it turns out to come up and um so now we want to value a three days option and um you know we continue to assume that the width over a day is 0.5 and we have three strikes in the contract and say they're locked three log four log 12 like they were at the beginning of my talk so now we need to value this option so it's a log sum exponential of three floors and when the smoke clears you get log 13 but the interesting thing is that you could actually use the value log 5 that we had for the two days option and just because we've added a third day you could exercise you just pseudo add the the associated log the associated floor which is log 12. so okay so the value goes up um you know obviously log 30 is bigger than log 5. and um you know by extending the maturity we added optionality and we literally as a calculation pseudo added the floor that's it so you know for n days the valuation formula is just given by this simple formula and you know that is the value of a bermudan stoption and uh within floors and with the scale captured by b so a common let's say a base case for the floors that would be natural to choose would be all floors are zero and that way you know you basically can swap a negative return for zero along the way but you have to you know and you have to exercise once so the evaluation formula for let's call it an at the money um stoption is nothing but b log n okay so we knew that as you increase the maturity of a bermudan option the value goes up but here's an example where the value goes up in a very simple way like the log okay so um okay and i'll skip some of the stuff for lack of time but let me just say that everything is explicit and everything is simple you can calculate uh when to exercise optimally in closed form like there's a critical price change and you can also figure out hedging so let's just summarize so i give time for lorenzo's video so we introduced the new contract it's called this option and let's say by assuming iid increments the valuation reduces to iterated function evaluation and basically if you further assume a logistic distribution for the common increments you then further simplify to a pseudo sum of a particular kind called a log sum exponential function so um you don't need to conduct the analysis in the setting we've done so then you know i've been making the underlying the uh securities prices real and of course you might think well what if i do this for a stock you know would that be wouldn't that be insane to think that the stock price could go negative and the answer is yes so because of limited liability you would want the underlying to have a non-negative price so this can be extended to that not a problem so you would make the domain not be real numbers anymore including minus infinity but the um not negative numbers and um basically what you have to do is redefine this option contract so that instead of um the way you accumulate things is instead of accumulating price relatives you um you multiply up sorry instead of accumulating instead of adding price increments you multiply out price relatives which are ratios so you know let's say it's a change of arithmetic and everything goes through so the distribution that would support a positive random variable turns out to have a name and it's called conjugate power digum and um it's a heavy tail distribution again um and this time it has negative skewness in the way we traditionally define things and that's a good thing so okay so there's a lot of future research but and for lack of time i'm not going to read this slide i'm going to wrap up so um let me stop sharing and um let's see did i get any questions yes yeah we have a few uh a few questions which um i just i guess i could have interrupted you but i figured uh since they're sort of applied problems i wanted you to focus on the math okay the first question we have from mike lipkin is do you want the payout to be cash are there any shares exchanged in this product yes i want the payout to be cash okay easy then we have marcos carrera who says given that we want to look at price increments what a contract with time to maturity one or two years and a frequency of 1.5 months synchronized with fed meetings hinges and fed rates be a good practical use yes it would uh that's a terrific idea i want to thank marcos uh for that idea which uh i will definitely run with okay okay yeah um then there's our freight forward agreements aka ffas included in the available underlying assets uh yeah um so um you know so i don't know much about freight forward agreements but let's say if the value is any negative any positive or negative number so then it's in what i talked about if the value is instead non-negative we you know we have that extension or that version um it's not in the talk but it's in the paper um that you're about to see actually okay okay so then we have a pre prithvi ramesh who says aren't euro dollar future options somewhat similar except for the fact that you're allowed to mature unexercised there are also daily exercise options with payoff max of uh future t minus future zero minus x yeah so if the t there is um like you know the time you exercise then it's a different payoff than i'm doing um so you know my underlying is uh in like a daily increment say and here if t is varying then you know if t is one day that's a one day increment of t is two then it's the t that's the sum of two days so um so it's you know and that's actually like a lot harder um just because for varying t's these possible different random variables have dependence between them under the standard assumption the increments are independent so um so it's let's say harder to deal with um and um so let's say we would you know try to do that next but i'm not saying that's an easy extension okay okay yeah so i guess uh you mentioned already that uh stuptions don't exactly exist and i'd like to kind of take marcos's question a little bit further uh how how do how does one go from writing a paper and you know making sense of a type of option to then having this be adopted by a market and traded and you know from your experience in practice yeah does it take all right well so the reality is i did a zoom call earlier this week with the head exotics traitor at bank of america i'd rather not say his name and um he wants to buy it okay so um so i just need to find a seller and we have a product and i would say and he agreed the natural seller is let's say an insurance company or a pension plan which tends to look at things over a longer horizon where let's say uh considerations under p real world probability measure you know become relevant so so um you know so i've actually got a zoom call planned next week with a friend of mine who worked worked for an insurance company so we'll see if i can get a deal to go so it's possible yeah interesting how these things work you do have to find the buyer and a seller um okay well thank you so much peter for for this excellent talk um the next step i guess is uh you know uh go to our youtube channel and smash the subscribe button and and uh and we'll you'll be able to see this video in the future in our future videos now uh i'd like to go on to the uh to lorenzo toricelli's section which uh essentially digs deep into this logistic the implementation of the daggum and uh logistic um distributions so um peter thanks again let's let's let lorenzo speak hi and welcome this is lorenzo richelli from the university of parma and this video is a short introduction to financial models based on the logistic distribution i have some slides with some theoretical background material and then we will jump to the mathematical code where we can see the logistic distribution and the associated processes in action the talk is based on this process sorry on this paper additive logistic processes in option pricing which is available at ssrn and will be shortly updated so what is the idea to generate logistic security underlying marginal processes the idea is to start from valuation equations so we proceed we start from uh no arbitrage uh option functionals a call option functions which is supported on the real line and a function for valuing the merit booth so the max payoff which is supported on the positive reals so s and b here so you have an excess uh a normalized monuments here and uh um two term functions appearing s and b which provide which gives described intertemporal behavior of the options prices and of the underlying price distribution as well so so long as s and b this terms function are 0 and 0 are increasing and b is bounded you can verify that c and m are decreasing in strike uh convex and strike and increasing immaturity which is all you need to establish that this formula formula are arbitrary free once you've done that you just take the derivative with respect to k and you generate and then by the you know the famous remark by britain litzenberger you can obtain the implied security price distribution what are the the cdf in particular what what are they for the real valued underlying coming from the log sum exponential function it's just a logistic function for the positive price process coming from the merit put positive valuation equation you have the so-called vegan distribution which after a log transform is seen not to be nothing else that skew logistics distribution so another form of the logistics distribution with a distortion power here appearing which gives you the negative scheme so these are the log returns of the positive price process coming from the merit put evaluation uh nowhere else those uh distribution are infinitely divisible so those of you familiar with theory of levy process might wonder uh then can we do then with a levy process associated to them well in principle we could but it turns out that this is not the right thing to do but it would not support such a process the evaluation formula we started with so we have to do something else we have to consider this infinitely divisible as a time family and once you've done that you can apply a theorem which um grants the existing of an additive process provided that the law that you have chosen that you are starting from uh satisfies some technical assumption on the levy structure which in our case turns out to be the case uh and that's all we need to verify the existence of an additive process which means uh stochastically continuous with independent increments supporting the uh implied price distribution underlying security distribution which in turn determines the formula we started with an additive process is what you get if you relax the time homogeneity from a levy process okay and also it turns out that these processes in our specific case are pure jump these are technical details on the levy structure of the log returns of the positive model and the returns in the models which has logistic distribution so log logistic skew logistic and logistic return all the processes once you've done that we are basically in business because uh what the bit missing is that those processes must be markets and they naturally are why why because we uh obtain distribution starting so a class of time dependent distribution starting from no orbit evaluation from them in the first place so you can verify this mathematically but financially the reason is what i just mentioned we call the two uh two modulus cpda model conjugate power taken additive and the second model uh it's a logistic additive model which has uh in addition a cell similar specification taking the term function has to be sigma t h now for numerical tests i'll take b so the bounded term structure in the the cpda model to be something which look like uh the self similar uh specification in the ssla in the in the logistic model when time is small or something like this sorry if you do the taylor expansion you see that okay so we have a model with all this that you go through then these good desirable properties which supports some very simple pricing formula which is basically what we start are starting an input going to the code uh i hope you don't mind too much uh uh the terrible coloring uh so what i'm done here is i'm implementing some formula from our paper and so here you have the specification for the term structure i have the formula i implemented the formula for the option cpd and ssla vanilla options spots and calls and also i have the distribution logistic and skill logistic so log returns for the cpda returns for the ssla so the formula and their instantiation in terms of the price of the of the term function and there's these expressions for the cumulative structure for those models which can be expressed as a functions of the riemann zeta and the polygonal function so the first test i'm doing is uh density comparison i want to compare the density of the logistic uh pricing word with the you know the standard uh the standard normal models that shows in bachelor what we have so i'm comparing of course the log returns of the cpda the dagum positive model logarithms are skew logistic versus the normal normal uh so the logarithms in the black shells models which are which are normal with the variance sigma with variance sigma square t and uh mean minus sigma squared t over two so uh i'll just drift adjusted in order to expo when you exponentiate you have a macro to have martingale relationship so what we see here is that as time progresses the normal distribution just you know there's a variance increase of course and there's a bit of a location shift back with location shift but the shape does not change which is in contrast when you consider cpda model what you see is that the skewness the shape of the distribution changes with t and the left tail becomes progressively heavier than the right one so you see which this this of course doesn't uh does not happen in the normal world and this is a remarkable fact which has implications uh for a marketing relation when you look instead of the comparison of the normal and logistic distribution once you variants match them so in the left in the left plot i haven't done variance matching here in the right hand side it must be much easier i did do that and you see that you know the in fact the the distribution are quite similar but kurtosis can be clearly appreciate okay so the blue line is the logistic word and the purple line is the normal word the normal plot so you see the double crossing here which indicates skewness for logistic distribution heavier tails and a more peaked distribution around the mode so i have so that i also have is cumulative system structure i am plotting the cumulus as a function of time for blue again the logistic model and i am benchmarking again a linear revolution of the term structure which is typical for homogeneous models so levy models and what i observe is that i can generate much more flexible shapes in particular an exploding variant here and you know a short-term very steep increase of the skewness okay so this is not really black shorts these are not black shorts these are homogeneous models i should write here um that shows you symmetric so it should the line does not exist anyway so you see that there's a very very uh is a high rate of increase of negative skewness which indicates possibly might be connected with a steep a short-term volatility skew because of symmetry of the distribution also the kurtosi has crystals this is a very interesting flexible shape moving on so for the logistic these are these are plots for the cpda model so log returns in the positive model the returns in the real valid model the ssla models have uh show a similar pattern for the variants and the wholesale kurtosis which is a known fact for the logistic distribution it does not depend on scale and therefore it does not depend on scale function in our case so finally implied volatility to the surface this is just an implied volatility finder normal not normal i have two models which is producers for the cecile and cpda models volatility surfaces for some even model inputs i have 225 here 225 options i do a speed test and i see that this is very fast because the option formula are explicit known in close form and much simpler than even than that shows by the way i should mention when we look at the volatility surface we see that we have for some of an implied volatility skew is present in the skewed distribution the positive one the cpga model okay so the log returns are skewed and this is reflected in unimplied volatility skill as you can see the deep in the money options are come at a higher premium compared to their uh out of the money the part of the money counterparts this is you have you still have as long as mile in the logistic distribution because of kurtosis but there is no uh there is no skew because the logistic distribution is symmetric and besides you see that the more the modal parameters also impact the volatility term structure in a similar way two parameters are not very orthogonal um so maybe there is some work with the something can be improved in the parameterization which i have chosen so that's all i had um i'd be happy to take any comments uh or questions at my email address thanks uh for watching and the code will be uh uh made available publicly i understand so thanks for watching and i wish you a nice day yeah just to conclude we we're gonna make the code available on github and i thought it was pretty impressive how flexible these volatility surfaces can be right it seems just with a few parameters you can sort of uh make him smile make him frown uh make him do yeah so the um the number of parameters is one okay so it's the same number of parameters as in the black souls model uh or in the bachelorette model uh so there's one parameter it's only one yeah okay yeah and so um so you know the let's say let me talk about this conjugate power daigum one because let's say you know for a positive underlying that's the one we're proposing and um so the one parameter uh which lorenzo called um b um it has to be between zero and one it turns out because if it's above one the moment the mean does not exist uh because it's a heavy tail distribution so you can't give it let's say too much spread but but when you translate from b to all terms i've done this it's uh you know be as comfortably within the range of volatilities that we see in practice okay so okay and um so anyhow um so the one parameter simultaneously creates like more width if you raise b and more negative skewness if you raise b okay so it's it's you know there's only one parameter and let's say so how did he get the term structure to sort of uh yeah okay right so uh i was thinking for one maturity cross strike when i say there's one parameter so so as you're going across maturities there's as many parameters as there are majorities okay so the term structure is completely flexible um so we yeah we can accommodate any you know turn structure at one strike that you want okay say at the money and um but so i'm just saying with the in the opposite direction across minus there's only one parameter right now so you know so it either you know fits the market or it doesn't by like when you tune the one parameter you know optimally let's say you either fit the market or you don't okay so if it's an upward sloping graph of implied ball against strike you know this is not going to be a great fit because we actually produce a downward sloping graph okay so so what do you do in that case you have to move go beyond like the way we think about it is we think of this type these types of models as sort of alternatives to you know for logistic models and alternatives to bachelier and for this conjugate paradigms and alternatives to black shoals and um you know and just as neither the first models you know work all that well we anticipate that even though these would work better they're still not going to be good enough um so you know every extension that's been done for quite a few years now of those models you know can be also done for our models okay so basically you know black trolls and bachelor are both based on the normal distribution one way or another okay and um you know admittedly you take you know so the log in black souls the log of the price is normal and um so we're basically saying starting elsewhere we're starting with the logistic distribution and you know you might wonder well what's the basis so so besides close four formulas let's say and um so i think of it like this so yes we know that you know the sum of normals is normal and yes we know that the product of log normals is log normal but what makes those two binary operations special okay they have similar properties and they're actually uncountable infinity of other binary operations with those properties and so you know there is a binary operation uh not ordinary edition not ordinary multiplication which is like you know the right which is like connected with logistic okay so so the um the um you know so basically in the interpretation of this binary operation is financially natural it's choice it's optionality okay so um so the you know this option is repeated choice so repeated pseudo edition okay and um so let's say just because statisticians decided that you know for applications of probability that they don't know about we should focus on addition and multiplication because those are widely used in practice doesn't mean we can't come up with our own binary operations that have special importance for the field we're in which is finance okay and you know look at distributions that are sort of friendly to you know with the closed really under those binary operations so so that's basically the spirit of what we're doing so um you know first treating optionality between a strike and a single like a european option as a as a single pseudo-sum of strike in the valley underlying and then um in my talk we were you know saying there and there's closure so we could do you know repeated optionality as repeated pseudo summation okay and that's bermuda the remutants option that i went through so it's a bit you know let's say philosophical you know in choosing a distribution you shouldn't i guess the perspective is there are more than two binary operations ratio so keep that in mind you know yeah all right cool well thank you so much uh for coming to the to the seminar and i look forward to seeing you at yours on thursday yeah same here all right thanks a lot for having me
