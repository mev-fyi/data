recording well hello to our viewers wherever you are my name is Victoria Alberta and today I'm excited to speak with two senior professionals who agreed to share their views on hiring and quant finance and FinTech it is my pleasure to introduce Radhika rora who directs technology recruiting and sch√∂nefeld and Nate Resnick managing director at open system technologies myself as a director of master financial program I am always thinking about what type of jobs are available to our students and how we can best prepare them for their long-term careers this summer with Corbett 19 sending everybody to their home offices helping our students finding answers to these questions became even more urgent and essential and that is why I am really thrilled to have radical Nate who built their expertise in corporate and agency recruiting respectively and can offer sort of inside and outside views so without much ado let's kick off our conversation and learn from the experts and why don't we start by you guys introducing yourselves and tell our viewers of a few details what it is that you do Radhika would you please yes right absolutely well first I want to say that I am also carnelian 509 and very proud of it I work at schoenfelt's for teaching advisors we are a multi-strategy multi-manager hedge fund we've been around as a company for about 32 years in the hedge fund space for about four or primarily a global equity fund I started as Schoenfeld last year and I head up our global technology recruiting which means I recruit across multiple offices in all areas of Technology I prior to that actually I made used to be my boss so and I would that open system covering pretty much a very similar type of thing so covering hiring technologists for primarily by side clients that's where I found the more type of rules I wanted to work on Nate hi Sami Resnick and I'm one of the partners at open systems technologies and you know we're recruiting agencies so we work with many different types of clients you know across primarily the tri-state area and mostly within finance and technology so we work with quite a long client list and I've been there about 15 years now and handle recruiting and you know a number of clients as well as you know day-to-day operations well thank you both as I was saying to you before we started reporting I think our viewers in for a treat I'm going to learn a lot today so not to mention covered 19 too many times but it felt that financial industry was doing fairly well before this spring and many of our students are now young alumni are asking the same question over and over again is the finance still hiring will there be a lot of hiring in quantitative finance so if you were to think about which industries are you know within finance hiring hedge funds banks eyesight advisories what do you think Nate from your outside you know on things yes so there's definitely a pause like a slowdown in April in May somewhat and since Memorial Day I definitely seen things pick back up I don't think there's one industry specifically that's been hiring a lot but there are a lot of companies that are still very actively hiring and I think it took some time for companies to work out the virtual interview process and there's a lot of headaches with virtual onboarding and so I think it took some time for that but a lot of places have worked it out and you know there are quite a few hedge funds that are still actively hiring and we work with a number of banks that are still actively hiring broker-dealers asset managers and a decent amount of FinTech are still bring forward everyone's being a little careful because hiring virtually you know you want to make sure you're still finding the right person so I think it's moving a little slower than it has in the past but yeah there's still still a lot of opportunities out there and I think it's uh I think it'll continue to pick up actually over the summer and into the second half of the year that's reassuring radhika would you please willing to add something to this any particular sectors what do you see so obviously i'm being on antibiotics and really only speak investment management but I would say March was a little bit tougher for the investment management industry than a lot of us expected it to be obviously a lot of volatility when Kovac just happened but I think again most of us and if I off I mean the hedge fund industry have adapted quite well and I would say we're doing better than before or as well as the January and February were looking I know Schoenfeld is actually doing quite well this year despite you know Koba 19 so I would say in general to echo what Nate was saying people are hiring there is quite a bit of hiring going on there's just some you know minor adjustments that had to be made as we got adjusted to hiring worked completely virtually hiring during Kovac as well as which I'm sure we'll talk next where the hiring is taking place so why don't we just thank you you just living right into my next question so firstly I'll I'll take it of course meant obviously you can join in so I would say be because of covetous of market volatility the first area to get a huge jump has to be risk right the risk is exactly what investment firms determined to see how I guess how risky has to use the same word can we be with where we are going to invest you know can we take chances on certain stocks or certain areas and that's determined by your risk of heart but you know the the models that they've created and so on and so forth but there's a lot of need in that area as uh volatility in the market continues to say there's also a lot of need for data analysis you know I think the reason why there was some struggle in the investment management industry is because this was so random and therefore they don't really didn't really have the data at hand to be like okay how can we use what's happening to really ensure that we're targeting that my company's so on and so forth so there's a lot of need in the data analysis and data side of the world as well I would say there is less of a need on the trading side just because unfortunately there have been some investment managers that have to close or haven't done as well but I do think there's always going to be a need on the trading side because thankfully trading is one of those things where you you can't really have too many traders because it is an individualized role in some way so you can really always have a need for great traders and I would say we want to go into that a little bit of the skills that come into it and of course we can touch on that later also really makes the big difference when you're doing it all the trading photos Thank You Nate is there anything you want to add to this maybe on the FinTech side yeah I mean I think you know what rodica brush down like we see a lot of opportunities for data engineering know getting known for data analysis or getting data to you know data scientists or the Quan team so and there's been a lot of newer technologies in the last couple years so a lot of people are building new systems or upgrading and you know so business knowledge is very important and understanding how everything how the data should look and what the data is so that's definitely been a big push for a lot of firms in the last couple years just add ons I really quickly sorry I would say that usually people actually think a lot of data engineering and data work happens on the co-op side of the house which makes sense you need data to build back testing systems and a lot of Kwan's need a lot of historical data so they to go 20 30 years in the past to figure out their models but I would say there's been a huge push recently on the fundamental side of the house as well who have been traditionally looking at data but don't necessarily need people to analyze it in the same way that they've used more traditional analysts to just you know be become experts in an industry but now they're actually looking for more engineering focus as well because they they want to be more optimized and how they gather and analyze data as well well I'm very glad to hear that because our program has been pushing fighting financial data science very much we were the first ones to offer financial data science certificate back in 2016 and our students are fairly strong so I'm glad that their opportunities for data scientists within financial industry are expanding so if your name maybe you know one or two skills technical skills that people should have what would it be I mean revolving around data I would say Python is probably the most popular choice and there's a lot of technologies associated with it that are becoming increasingly popular depending on what you're doing you know I think the ability to code is becoming or has become much more important let's say in the last 10 years and I you know I think a lot of people are being tested on it who wouldn't have been tested on it in the past and there's a lot more coding challenges in code tests even for roles that aren't necessarily that coding intensive sometimes so I think it's you know along with other object-oriented languages but you know for around data Python is certainly and is very popular and there's a lot of new open-source technologies too which are readily available that a lot of people are utilizing thank you I would say for skills there are three main buckets I put skills in so the first obviously one a just touched on programming I would agree Python is probably the most common programming language used on the quantitative side of the house today and again from not only like a numpy and pandas perspective but from an enterprise application perspective as well follow very closely by C++ so if you have a strong PeopleSoft background that's also useful I would say to a lesser extent you have are there some people who still are a little bit more old school and like using are but I would say that's a distant third eye the second bucket is kind of just overall mathematical and staff attitude I would say even if you're not necessarily doing modeling yourself or doing research yourself the ability to understand math and staff and that logic is really really useful and then lastly and I think this one I would say probably the closest near and dear to my heart as someone who is a recruiter who sort of understands technology in the quantum space but it obviously isn't as in-depth as the people hiring for it or even your students I would say soft skills are extremely important and it's actually a great way to really just stay wish yourself from the path because from you know the types of projects are doing the types of courses you're doing you might be alike in compared to some other people in your cohort by soft skills I think makes a big difference so having strong communication skills being a team player being receptive to feedback you know having good decision-making skills can I handle this on my own do I need to reach our time manager so on and so forth that's thank you very much for highlighting that I totally agree that you know aside from programming and statistics the real way to differentiate yourself is by ability to communicate in a mature professional setting so since we started talking about you know soft skills and interviewing skills hiring managers looking maybe for different new characteristics in their employees is the soft skills more emphasized now what what anything has changed since work shifted to remote environment and when you know when you interview whoever wants to start first only well no I usually always want to jump it at the start first you don't give them an option so I would think there's nothing new per se but there's definitely a different emphasis I think your ability to communicate and that you in different mediums is very important right so things are virtual which means that if you do not have a strong communication style in email or on a dual call such as this one then you unfortunately will not be as strong as someone who does you know there used to be people I think who would maybe not have as much of comfort interviewing on the phone but they were like once I get in person I'm fantastic however unfortunately you don't have that opportunity anymore you know you can't rely on getting in person to really make the big splash or impress people you really have to be able to do it at every single communication point so whether that's email whether that's a quick phone call whether that zoom you really have to ensure that that you are emphasizing how you communicate and that's not necessarily meaning communicating more and that's not what I'm advocating for I'm advocating more from communicating better Thank You Nate yeah I think a lot of this you know a lot of the same things probably still applied to interviewing virtually I mean you still obviously need to dress appropriately and show up on time and you know your communications for the you know the interview need to be you know professional and I think you know when we talk about communication skills it's you know being able to really clearly describe what you do and answer questions you know thoroughly and and keeping in mind that you know whoever you're speaking to really has very little knowledge of your background besides the resume so being able to really get across what your strengths are and what you know what you've accomplished is really you know still kind of paramount do you feel that the two-dimensional interviews allow for better screening of soft skills or they're just more difficult I would say they're just different I think honestly it's a little too early to tell what the actual impact is going to be and you can really only tell the impact of the interviewing process once people have been hired and started and then you kind of evaluate okay did the person excel in the places we thought they were going to excel at they struggle in the places we thought they were going to struggle because of our evaluation and you can really only tell that once they are in the role six months down and doing that kind of check-in so unfortunately it's just a little too early to really tell if it's if it's being as as good of an evaluator as we are used to in person and in general I think and I just do want to mention this even though we are going all virtual with interviewing I think we're still trying to meet people and trying to be creative about this I know we suggest to someone who lives in Manhattan hey you mind doing a socially distant like ten feet away Central Park hello so you could at least talk to the person and then say hi so um you know that's kind of why what we're trying to leave get it because ideally you do want to meet the person in person right I think it gives you a lot of body language inside that you just don't get in this as you mentioned two-dimensional way of interviewing but I think there's going to be mistakes and mishaps and we're learning and when you rely solely on technology you kind of have to comes with the territory Thank You Nate I don't know if there's anything you want to add to this you know remote slash maybe try you know six feet apart interview process how does it look for you know recruiting industry in general staffing solutions companies anybody anybody in person yet but you know everybody's if you know everybody's in the same boat experts I'm sorry I'm interrupting but you guys are experts at networking so that's how I view industry you are experts at networking how you know how how you are just thing - you know everything being virtual I mean we were I think you know a lot of what we do is on the phone and no initial you know we do meet plenty of people also but a lot of its on the phone initially so you know we've switched over to doing these videos also and you know again there's it's not there's no really other any other option right now so everybody's just kind of making do and um but we've had plenty of clients you know extend offers and make hires and on board virtually and so far it's been going pretty well I think there was you know kind of a hold up when HR was figuring out how they can actually get people on board and now they're shipping laptops and fingerprint scanners and you know those types of things when they hire people but I haven't heard of any mistakes yet I guess I'll put it that way go uh I would also say like that as you mentioned onboarding it's a little bit harder because the laws have eventually caught up right because covetous is so recent so from an HR perspective you're actually supposed to see a candidate I nine in persons like when they they feel that they have the ability to work in the United space if you ever see that in person the video count I don't know does it like is that really seeing it exactly so we we actually have to do a lot of chatting with our legal department to be like well the law hasn't updated it's probably not going to update because Cove is not going to be permanent right we're not all permanently just working from home so what do we do we don't want to go run afoul of the law but at the same time we want to be aware that we're not going to be able to meet someone in person and show it so we have been using it for video but again depending on how conservative your company or the field isn't it obviously being in finance we're with the SEC and everything we're quite conservative we really just had to double check and make sure from a legal perspective we were also covered and didn't have to do something X person so sort of like speaking about onboarding and you know once one thing is to get over the hurdle of interviews but then let's say you start your job what do you do I mean unless your boss tells you hey I want to zoom with you and here's the meeting idea Monday at 8:30 a.m. what else can you do to integrate yourself and become part of the company so I would say the first person foremost ask your manager who your main stakeholders are so who do I have to interact with impress etc and then be proactive about setting up calls with them so don't wait for your manager to set it off ask him or her okay should I be talking to risk should I be talking to compliance should I be talking to operation and then find out who you need to talk to and set up calls on their calendar and then uh you know take part of the call I would actually even make sure that you're doing it on regular basis for having regular touch points with your main stakeholders and the cadence of it will change right so as you get more and more familiar with the company maybe something that was a weekly call will now become a monthly call but it should still be there enough how someone a year and a half into my farm I still have changes in my cadence of my main stakeholder meetings and you know some of them have gone from weekly to bi-weekly sometimes they went back like initial Kobus situation I had a monthly meeting that actually turned into a biweekly meeting because there's so much more to talk about so that's kind of always up in the air of how you want to do that you should just also be sure you're asking for help if you need it everyone knows remote onboarding and remote working is very difficult when you're just out the door and that doesn't matter if it's Pavini dirty or not in any new company people are struggling so I you know we are hiring people who have multiple years of experience and they're having the same issues kind of integrating into a work environment so it's the idea that ask for help if you need it because everyone understands that everyone wants to help use internal messaging systems for things that aren't that important I would say send summary emails making attest to this as someone who used to be our manager I have a habit of sending a lot of emails so if you kind of get a little big when you get 10 emails from one person so ensuring that you're getting the questions across but maybe like more of a summarized fashion so you're like hey Tom I have five questions I need you to answer here are they this is a rank of importance do you mind getting back to me that way you're doing a little bit more work up front but you're more likely to get answers and help thank you name anything you can add maybe have some success stories from people you recently placed or not so success you know maybe somebody shared the things that they wish they've done differently you know for the most part I've walked people through onboarding virtually and most companies right now are being very flexible and well and then just asking candidate like people hire to be patient as they work out the kinks because you know you may not have 40 hours of work your first week you know as they kind of figure out how they're setting up their structure and stuff like that so most companies have been very asking for patience but but at the same time like they're still hiring and been very accommodating for candidates also and you know everybody's some people it's easy for them to work at home and some people it's really challenging so I think again just communication and you know working things out and you have to prove yourself and really you have to be available as much as you can working from home obviously but at the same time like communicate if there's issues well thank you both I don't have any other questions or topics to bring up if you want to you know share maybe a few closing comments if you feel that there's something else should be mentioned please I do have a few things so I would say this first being um be aware of where you're targeting so for example if you want to go to a big bank or a bigger firm know that they they actually will have better processes in place because they're bigger you know they will have a lot of teams that are dedicated to certain things that a small prop shading shop probably won't because it's a team of 20 total so you know compared to like a JP Morgan where it's 40,000 people so I would say you're you should always be aware of where you're going because that's going to definite tell you a lot about what your career will look like so bigger places have more processes in place um they they are better at training so they actually so for example let's say you aren't as familiar with programming or such you know they they will have a lot more mentorship programs that are formalized formalized training programs so on and so forth a smaller shop will actually require you to wear a lot of hats and probably will have less training so they might expect you to just know way more in a and DEF focus than you would a debate I will say this personally a stop job hopping you know just think about what you're learning why you want to switch how you're honing your skills I think there's a lot of people who are chasing the money into every couple of years they're going somewhere else but they're really not thinking about what they're going to be able to contribute long term if you stay at a company you get more political capital the longer you stay there Nate as 15 years it open systems when I have to open systems I was six years in when you've delivered at a place for a while you are able to work on things in a much different manner than if you're right in the door in the first six months and many people can tell you that usually the first six months to a year are some of the hardest times because you're still adjusting into everything so if you can see it places longer than you're really able to redeem the fruit of your rewards more and then the last thing is make sure that when you're interviewing I just remember that you're not the only one being interviewed there right so you are interviewing and evaluating the company just as much as they are doing so for you so make sure that you really want to join the company and it's the right type of culture and environment for you to succeed you don't want to just get a job because it's a role you really want to make sure that the company in the environment is setting you up for success thank you so much very sound advice Thank You Nate yeah I mean similarly I think you know we we get a lot of opportunities or you know we don't do a lot of it you know that much entry level but we start seeing a lot of opportunities you know for one or two years plus experience but I think at that level you know you're second or sometimes even your third job is very important as far as how it directs your career so you have to be at that point you really have to think about where you're gonna end up and what you're gonna build and how you're gonna kind of establish yourself if you like radhika said if you end up you know jumping around every year and a half or two years it's hard to actually you know build something or accomplish something significant that you can about on an interview in five years so you know a lot of especially as smaller companies and on the buy side you know they're looking not just at your technical skills but like what you've actually done and can you talk about you know how you build something and how you design something or how you you know whatever it is but they're looking for something of importance that you've actually done and and you have to you know really by the time you join a company its most people don't but it takes a lot to learn the systems and the you know the new place it takes three to six months to do that anyway so if you're leaving after a year you know a year and a half it's not much time so I guess the that second and sometimes third role and everybody makes mistakes it's understandable and you have a story but it's you know just something to really consider and I've seen people you know decline the right job for you know money where it shouldn't have been a decision factor and you know some people you know it's I don't have a choice it you know it depends but it's um that second or third job usually is very telling is from a career standpoint do you guys believe that second or third job is more important that in the first job but somebody was coming you know sort like fresh minted graduate right don't somebody who's had years of experience and then decided to switch into a new industry but more of our new graduates I think it depends I think a lot of people choose their first job and it really depends I think after your first job when you have work experience and you actually know what you're interested in and what your passions are or maybe the type of company you want to work at you know a lot of times we talk to candidates where they end up taking a job at the Medibank because it's a great you know institution and it's got a great brand and they pay pretty well and then they realize that they actually would do much better in a smaller environment and they want more ownership of you know and wear different hats you know that sort of thing and so that you know that sort of change is certainly understandable you know and I think some people if it really takes after them to figure out what they want so is why some people switch jobs but I think it really depends we think the first job is definitely important and can dictate a lot of things but no one has a know knows what their future is going to be like and things change over time also so right yeah I don't say if it's the people who are asking you are asking because they're terrified of making a mistake and going to a company where they're afraid that it's going to follow them for the rest of their lives like I would say definitely don't have to worry about that you know everyone like everyone has a story of you know someone they know that chose the wrong for a job or you know didn't you know didn't even have a first job in technology or finance meant hard to switch in and so on and so forth and I think there are success stories all around of where that works so I think what what you have to make sure is that you're more self-aware and you you ask yourself what you want to do because everything is ok with ok you went to a bank the banks not for you told you want to be in a smaller environment or buy somewhere so maybe you went to a smaller coffee shop and you realize I need more structure and I want to go to a bigger company that's more well known fair you know up to you but I think the issue comes in when you keep on making similar mistakes so if someone goes ok you had seven jobs in your career let's say you're a 30 or veteran you guys have been done in your career and all of them are very very similar why are you changing your mind now or even less if you're 10 years in your career you've had four jobs that are very one-way what is making you change your instinct now so it's much more forgiving as Nate said for your second or your third job because by that time hopefully you understand more about yourself where will I find success what what motivates me what am i passionate about and then you can kind of design your career that way that being said I will also say I have hired multiple people who changed careers you know there's someone I hired in technology that used to be a bartender and decided you know that they want to switch career so I think it's still possibly even there and then it's what it boils down to again is the things that are more nuanced but you can't answer and it is more case-by-case basis of how you present your story how and why you're interested right so I think sometimes people struggle to tell interviewers HR managers everyone why they're interested but if you get that if you're able to really have that come across I think that will not only helps make you stand out but also personalize you but you're not just another resume and not just another person were interviewing you are Victoria and we now know Victoria that's where the soft skills come in right you cannot go out without strong communication skills and have a good you know statement about what it is that you want to do well thank you both very much I think that this was like I said this was a treat I really appreciate I know how busy both of you are and zoom cooperated with us nobody froze in the last 30 minutes so again thank you so very much and I really appreciate it we will post it for our students and also probably part of the Big Data finance conference that was posted thank you
