oh [Music] do you know somebody okay okay all right everybody uh thanks for coming this is uh the third uh and last uh uh quad seminar of uh semester and um and our focus this semester has been on um sort of fintech and and of various nature so we started with um with machine learning then we went into a blockchain and sort of now we're at robo training so we kind of like to keep our eye on all these fresh new topics so i'm very happy to have uh adam grealish from uh betterment with us today and uh he's gonna talk tell us a little bit about uh his automated methods for investment and uh many of our students will be familiar with uh portfolio optimization problems but you know it seems like today you were going to have a focus on tax implications but possibly give us an overview as well of what frozen trading is about thanks for coming and i'm very much looking forward to this thank you thanks sir thanks for having me here um just a quick show of hands i'm curious how many people have heard of betterment before this this kind of came up so okay maybe like 20 30 percent maybe uh maybe 40 could be generous well just to tell you a little bit uh about what betterment is we're an automated online advising platform uh we take a goal-based approach to an approach to investment management and our goal ultimately is to use technology to deliver higher returns to our customers through basically automating optimal investment strategies it's worth noting that betterment is probably most known for its direct to uh customer business where people like you or i could invest we also have a white label technology platform for financial advisors and 401k business so we're spanning uh three different lines of business so just a really quick background um the term that betterment often gets lumped into um it's been popularized across the the press is the term advisor and i found one definition that describes it as roboadvisor provides financial advice or investment management online with moderate to minimal human intervention they provide digital financial advice based on medical rules or algorithms executed by software i'd say that's a pretty accurate description so we're doing both financial planning and investment management it can be completely hands off you don't have to talk to a human ever we also have human advisors on the ready for people who are interested in delving a little bit more and we are by nature because it's being deployed through software it's all based on algorithms based on math so i'd say that's a pretty accurate description and if i had to sum up kind of what betterment's doing in one graph that's perhaps a little bit nerdy it would be this one um this is uh simulations that we ran of our portfolio management strategy versus more naive portfolio management strategy and the irrs of this strategy over time you can see that this distribution has shifted shifted to the right of a more naive strategy and i'll go and through the rest of the talk it's kind of discussing how we go about doing that but the broad overview is by keeping costs low by offering a diversified global portfolio doing tax optimization and encouraging good investor behavior so um a little insight into how we think about investing here at betterment and the way i'll try to walk over here as well a little bit not to ignore you all um one way that we think about investing i would say is a little bit different than what you'll probably hear at most investment management companies if they're giving you their pitch and that's we like to think about uh uh how where we spend our effort in terms of uh how deterministic it is and uh getting a good outcome for investors so um we can think about this as a hierarchy as things that we do that will definitely help you achieve your financial goals to some that are much more probabilistic in nature so down at the bottom is keeping costs low so the more money you have in your account the more likely you are to reach your goals the second is taxes if you do certain tax strategies at the end of the day you will end up with more money after tax after you've paid uncle sam the third is trading and kind of in two ways one keeping costs low in trading it's a you know kind of goes part and parcel with cost low overall and then secondarily if you can trade in a more intelligent way you know perhaps there's some um alpha to be extracted there and then the last two that are the least uh deterministic in terms of uh you're reaching your investment outcomes are security selection and asset allocation so it's really hard to say that i think japan is going to outperform the us over the next six months you know year whatever time horizon you might say it's equally pretty difficult to say i think this fund is going to outperform that fund what you'll find interesting is that when most asset managers are talking about things they end up talking about the top two and spend little to no time on uh the bottom three and we tend to think about it in in the opposite direction spending most of our efforts thinking about the things that are going to be most deterministic and investor outcomes of course we spend a lot of time thinking about allocation selection we'll go over that in detail here um but uh we're thinking about the whole picture and how they fit together so uh jumping right into uh uh kind of the first piece of uh automating a personal investing equation that's risk management and rebalancing so before we get into that we should probably take a quick step and talk about how we get to our portfolio overall so we start with the globally optimized portfolio this is probably what it looks like across all different risk levels from zero percent stock to 100 we're achieving this in a black litterman optimization using robust optimization techniques so um i kind of figured everyone here is somewhat familiar with that so i i didn't dive too much into that but happy to you know field any questions and actually later on the talk show a little bit of how we're harnessing the black litterman framework with views to think about uh taxable taxable investing and expressing after tax returns in that framework so the resulting betterment portfolio this is something probably everyone's seen a million times efficient frontier um you can see in blue our efficient frontier for all of our portfolios uh plotted in gray are just randomly constructed portfolios inside the efficient frontier uh select assets inside the efficient frontier and 80 20 u.s portfolio so we're pushing out on the efficient frontier by optimizing across asset classes across the globe so we have an idea of a 101 portfolios that we can possibly choose from from 30 stocks to 100 that's our menu of stock options that we stocks stock portfolio options uh that we can choose from the next step is uh we help you choose exactly how much risk to be taking based off of uh your specific investment goal and the time horizon around that goal so this is a screen you'll see inside the app where we give you advice on how much risk you should be taking we're advising in this case 63 stock risk we give some projections about what that might look like over time and from there we have your allocation set and from there that's when kind of the computers take over perhaps so to speak so uh how we're managing your target weights um through daily monitoring with our with our platform so we're doing this across close to half a million customers uh and uh each cost not every customer has one goal some have multiple goals so it's closer to six or eight hundred thousand individual portfolios that we're monitoring on a daily basis and we're doing two things we're managing we're monitoring how far they've drifted from their target allocations and secondarily we're looking for places to rebalance tax efficiently with cash flows so that's anything from when we uh are taking fees out of the account to when dividends hit the account i'll talk a little bit later about some selling we might do with tax strategies and using that as a tax efficient way to rebalance as well so we think about rebalancing first first and foremost as a as a risk management tool that's the reason why it exists overall but we also view it as contributing in a small way to generating alpha and this is an interesting paper in the journal of wealth management from bushi 2012 that talks about holding holding two securities that are growing through time that are uncorrelated with each other and rebalancing will actually give you a better outcome than holding the security that grew the most over that time period um this is just taken directly from that paper where um it's showing what happens if you were to to buy and hold all apple versus if you had held in starbucks because this is a matthew group this is how he decomposes that um that growth uh to help you think about it so starting with um just a compound growth equation where we have um average return of the portfolio mu minus the drag from volatility um so that's the growth of a dollar you can decompose that into the growth of the portfolio where the first term is again the weighted growth of the portfolio but then we're exploding out the portfolio volatility and you can see that the two pieces here are the average uh average variance of the portfolio and the portfolio variance so as long as two things are growing and they're uncorrelated with one another it presents the opportunity to rebalance and uh extract additional value out of that portfolio so an additional piece that that we're thinking about in the rebalancing equation so uh the second thing is that risk uh profiles generally need to change over time uh as the investor is evolving through the life cycle of their goal so we are giving uh advice on that and also uh if customers turn on the feature we'll do that for them so um the first thing to think about i mentioned earlier is that risk the risk level that we recommend will vary by goal type and horizon and what i mean by goal type is actually something fairly specific it's more or less how you plan on using that money uh when your goal term is up and two two very specific examples uh a major purchase goal say i want to put a down payment on a house in five years well i'm going to invest for five years and five years i'm taking all that money out to put the payment on the house versus retirement goal say i want to retire in five years well once i hit that five year goal i'm then taking out a small amount of money from that account over the next say 30 years of my life so the liquidation profile is one of the the main pieces that we're thinking about in uh differentiating goals and given that liquidation profile we're then building out a uh a glide path based on how long your horizon is so like you can see here we have the major purchase glide path on top you can see that as we're getting close to the end uh the end of your investing term you're basically entirely in in cash in like low risk bonds whereas in retirement when you hit your retirement at say 65 you're still 55 percent invested in stocks right because you got a while to go you still the last dollars you might spend might be 30 years from now so that's a little insight into how we think about the advice then we do this for you so if you were to do this on your own you might revisit revisit your allocation say once a year that seems like a prudent way to go about it in the meantime you have all your money moving towards towards that particular allocation sort of a stepwise function um we're adjusting this on a monthly basis and that does two things one when we're moving your target allocation that means every marginal dollar going in is pushing you closer to your target allocation as opposed to um you know it gets pretty extreme at the end i would be putting all my money into this portfolio and then the next day i would you know have way too much risk right so it creates an opportunity for cash flows to get you much closer to the correct risk target without potentially having to do a rebalancing trade where you sell things to de-risk um so before i move on to the next topic i guess i'll just stop there for a second and check in with any questions we'll have time at the end to chat as well but you know before moving on to the next topic i want to stop there for a sec see if anyone had any questions uh since you are using black detriment as your optimization tool how do you ensure that you are doing uh accurate estimation of the yeah so we do a couple things um the first is we are doing our black litterman optimization uh with broad asset classes right so we're doing this with u.s stocks international stocks e.m stocks and their bond counterparts in those regions so we have very broad somewhat fairly mutually exclusive asset classes with long histories so that's kind of step one step two is we're employing robust optimization procedures around our covariance matrix so we're taking long histories of monthly returns data and using robust uh covariance estimation techniques to try to get a more stable covariance feature so it's not individual assets it's more like etfs or that represent these segments yeah yeah risk so great question so uh super broadly when we think about our asset allocation our strategic asset allocation we're thinking at the asset class level uh we're thinking about broad market cap based asset classes like the broad u.s stock market the broad international stock market um and that's that's what we're doing our optimization on uh from there we're we're actually expressing expressing those positions with funds we have to select funds which is the next the next step with etfs so our portfolios are entirely based on uh broad market cap based etfs so the idea here is we have we have an optimization where we're trying to optimize our exposure to risky asset classes that we think have risk premium associated with them and then from there we're trying to get exposure to those asset classes as cheaply as possible through etfs is there an optimal time interval to rebalance yeah that's a great question so we've done a decent amount of thinking about this and the way that our rebalancing algorithm works is not time based at all but trigger based so uh we're measuring the drift from your target allocation and once it gets too far away we're going to rebalance so you know time is somewhat an arbitrary construct here what we care about is managing risk so it does you know in a time when there's a lot of market dislocations and market movement we're going to be rebalancing more frequently markets are calm we we could go years without rebalancing right so yeah that's a great question so you were saying earlier that portfolio managers are not really talking too much of uh cost versus uh next was trading is that uh what's he was you know what's your education the explanation of the reason that doing that was the thing that's doing this yeah i mean honestly i think most of the reason is uh most of the stuff you're reading is for institutional investors and institutional investors don't think much about taxes if you're talking to a good financial advisor they're going to be thinking about this quite a bit and i think there's a big disconnect between uh people who know a lot about finance uh who might work at a hedge fund or so on and so forth and knowing a lot about personal finance and and that part of the equation uh in part of our 401k business we have some hedge funds on our platform and we'll go in and talk and oftentimes they'll know a lot about the security piece but a little bit less about the individual individual investor piece of it i think that's part of it a lot of what you read is um tends to be geared more towards the um uh someone solving an institutional investing problem institution tends to pay sort of less tax in that sense yeah it's just a different different tax regime than like uh individual investors so yeah um yeah for the personal investment uh the transaction cost or trading costs right now has been dropped yeah so uh fees on etfs have continued to go down and down and down right so that's been a great thing and betterment has been well positioned to take advantage of that so one real distinction between betterment and a lot of other robo-advisors is that we're independent we're not tied to an individual fund family right so like schwab has a a robo advisor vanguard has a robo advisor and these are basically distribution platforms for their own funds right whereas we're running this is a great segment from your question i'm going to segue into the next topic uh we run a quarterly fund selection process where we look at the entire investable universe of etfs and rank them not only on their expense ratio but the other factors that one should consider when when thinking about investing in an etf um the one that i'll point out is tracking errors becoming increasingly interesting to look at in a world where uh the fees on the funds are going to zero so and then trading costs have started to go to to zero as well um so that's that's another piece of the equation so yeah great moving on to fun selection um so as i as i mentioned before we are doing this uh quarterly uh as part of our investment committee review we're starting with the entire investable universe of etfs uh filtering out ones that don't meet our criteria in terms of getting broad exposure to the asset classes we're interested in uh and then ultimately we score them rank them and then uh there's a kind of a a systematic step where we're doing this and then a human step at the end where we see the short list and consider any other external factors so um this is kind of what our our filtering step looks like it's removing it's kind of whittling down a number of etfs and this is our sorting criteria so um what we what we ultimately care about is the total annual cost of ownership or something that we sometimes call taco the taco score which has two component parts the cost to hold what you incur every year as an investor for holding this fund expense ratio is usually the biggest part of this but also tracking error tracking difference is the other big piece and this is how closely does it track the index that it's uh it says to be tracking so this is where you capture uh all the other things that that could cause the fund to perform well or not versus an index how well they trade what they do at their securities lending so these are two ways that funds can not charge an expense ratio and still make money right they can trade poorly or get get paid to send their order flow somewhere uh and they can also uh run a securities lending program and pocket some of the the um the money they make from that as opposed to plowing it all back to the benefit of the of the shareholders in the fund so costs to hold um cost of trade this is the liquidity piece this is uh in-house market uh market impact model uh that's considering uh average bid ask spread and volume or liquidity in the name so we're considering that piece as well and um there's kind of a look under the hood like this is part of the report that gets generated so this is for broad u.s u.s stocks you can see we're looking at expense ratio the spread we we think about adv we rolled up into a cost to trade number we're looking at tracking difference and then the taco score so you can see that vti vanguard's total total total u.s stock market funds on top and that's our primary name in the in in the portfolio and this process results in keeping costs very low so the overall cost of our portfolio ranges from six basis points to 17 depending on what risk level you're in um yeah so that's kind of the last step there i'll stop for a second take any other questions before we move on to perhaps everyone's favorite topic taxes um i have a question about the life cycle law issue uh do you take into account people who uh think of part of their capital as permanent right yep that's um that's a great question so the answer the the short answer is no we don't have like of the quest goal might be might be what uh you're thinking about um that's something that we've thought about in the past right right it's a it's a good idea um the way that someone could could still use that is ultimately give recommendations on where your asset allocation should be but we you know you can always change it right we could tell you hey listen like we think you should be in a 50 stock portfolio and you go you know this isn't for me this is for my kids like my my time horizon's actually 50 years out so i'm gonna i'm gonna change it um but yeah definitely an innovation would be creating a separate goal for bequest yeah absolutely yeah um so we're generating our capital market assumptions are expect uh particularly expected returns from the reverse optimization from cap m right so we take we take our robust covariance matrix and we take the market portfolio and then we reverse back out what expected returns look like from those two inputs so that drives our expected returns and then generally when we're looking at a strategy we have a monte carlo simulation engine that operates at the tax lot level so we can test our tax strategies to give us an idea of how a portfolio would perform and how any new innovations or tweaks to a portfolio or portfolio strategy might perform can you give them any thoughts to replacing etfs with individual securities or is that thought to be too expensive no it's um it's uh definitely on the short list of of things that we think about right so um i broadly think about as a way to kind of disintermediate the the fund industry right so um in theory there's nothing stopping us from just holding um you know the thousand largest securities in the u.s and saving a couple basis points right so uh in reality there's a lot of operational costs associated with that um so it's it's not as simple as snapping your fingers but you know it is an interesting thing to to consider one because it unlocks a little bit more of a tax harvesting opportunity and two it adds an another dimension for for personalization right so um um you know someone who just can't hold something because they they work somewhere or they just have preferences uh for against certain companies but yeah that's a great question so the the you list uh each individual cost right are steps and then you have a total cost it's sort of uh addition and subtraction of those a few ones or it's more complicated yeah so this is the very stylized version of that of this um the way that we weight these um is um i mean it's like a linear combination of these so uh costs to hold we think about um basically it's uh uh the expected cost to hold throughout uh through a year um i think like to think about as a bit of a bayesian problem where like i have a strong prior that it's going to cost the expense ratio and i want to update that prior based off of uh what i observe around tracking difference like all like you know no no extra pieces to consider you should just under perform your your index your tracking by your expense ratio right it turns out to be a bit noisier than that in practice but that's that's the way we think about that piece and then cost to trade uh yeah we have a internal market impact model and then uh the way we combine these two terms is we basically take the expected like uh amortized turnover of uh of a customer and and weigh that in because people are trading a lot you know people are trading a lot less than once a year um you know our turnover is less than once a year so we would need to weigh these pieces together so yeah what's the size of the portfolio uh yeah uh the average balance at betterment is about forty thousand dollars so we have uh about 20 billion in aum and close to half uh half a million customers so what's the median that is a good question i don't know it off top of my head yeah but uh it's probably skewed to the to the left all right great uh thank you for those questions that was awesome uh managing taxes so yeah as a retail investor taxes are a huge consideration um taxes can cost anywhere from half a percent to two percent uh of a dragon annual returns depending on portfolio turnover tax bracket and other considerations um it also presents one of the best opportunities to outperform and differentiate um in the retail investing space and to be honest it's substantially easier than beating the market so let's dive into it we we we do this with three main strategies tax loss harvesting asset location and lot sorting go into each one of those in a bit more detail starting with tax loss harvesting so tax loss harvesting is selling securities at a loss to realize that capital loss for tax purposes um and then you generally in a tax law servicing strategy are going to buy correlated security to keep your market exposure the same so the goal is to basically keep your portfolio as similar as possible while capturing losses and here's why capturing losses is good you get to defer capital gains you can shift short-term gains to long-term gains in certain cases uh one important thing is that you can take uh three three thousand dollars of losses and uh rate them off against taxable income which is a nice piece and then for any losses that you've accrued that you you haven't used netting against uh other games or reducing your taxable income you can just carry continue carrying them forward to future years and it can result in permanent tax avoidance in certain situations like bequest or charitable donations so uh here's a basic example of how it works say i bought um this is a em ticker dwo say uh i bought uh some shares with the basis of five thousand dollars it may have gone down to uh uh if you know 4700 something like that i sell vwo i realize that tax loss and then i buy an alternate ticker that's also giving me exposure to em stocks just to set up this problem a little more formally for the group we want to maximize the losses harvested within a tax year while maintaining our target risk allocations we're looking for opportunities to harvest daily and we want to determine when to harvest versus uh the wash sale lockout period so i'll talk a little more about that in a second we also want to avoid wash sales so uh what's what's this wash sale constraint so wash sales end up being a pretty big constraint in this process um the irs basically says hey you can't just sell this and just and buy it back right you can't just churn your portfolio i can't sell i can't own coke it goes down i i sell coke and buy it back four seconds later iris is like hey i see what you're doing here you're just you know running up losses um but uh and they define that as a substantially identical security which they've never ruled on what that actually means at betterment we interpret that as meaning as long as you're not following the etf isn't following the same underlying index that they're different enough some would argue that's an overly conservative interpretation they're just different securities that might be enough but that's that's where our legal team landed um and you can't purchase purchase that security 30 days uh up to 30 days after you sold it or 30 days before so um you can't buy it ahead of time uh you know you couldn't you couldn't say okay i own coke at a loss i'm gonna buy more of it and then i'm gonna sell the the depreciated shares right so um there's a 30 day window before or after where it's considered a wash sale if you buy something similar so one way we solve this is by using alternate tickers that i mentioned that track different indices so that allows us to put these put inflows into a secondary security one thing you want to avoid though is blindly switching back into the primary after 30 days this can actually increase your tax liability the simple example here is i've held something for a while and then it goes down so i have a i can realize a long-term uh capital loss uh say of a dollar a share and then i buy a secondary and then it just rips up over the next 30 days is up four dollars and then i blindly sell ba sell sell my secondary security to buy back into the primary security i've now uh realized one dollar in long-term losses but then four dollars in short-term capital gains so this is like negative tax arbitrage um so we really want to avoid that so well that's the example i just talked about another thing to consider is that the qualified dividends only kick in the qualified dividend lower tax rate only kicks in after 60 days period so another thing to think about as well so there's all these things of just churning back into the primary really quickly can hurt your tax efficiency and here's an example so there's a back test we ran where uh if you did tlh with an automatic 30-day switchback versus staying in the secondary um so you can see that that switch back in that uh okay that the times when you can have negative tax alpha really uh drags on your um the annual offset that you pick up so this is how much uh uh how much tax uh loss as a percent of your portfolio you you've picked up in new strategy so choice of the secondary is important obviously should have a high correlation to the primary security comparable fee sufficient liquidity so when we're running our total annual cost of ownership analysis we're doing it for primaries and then also secondary and tertiary tickers so we want to be comfortable that um if we're in the secondary we're okay being in that for the long haul um so the second question comes up of when do i choose to actually harvest so this is like a fairly non-trivial question uh because after i choose to harvest i'm now blocked for 30 days from from from doing anything else so um ultimately you know what happens if security continues to go down well there's like opportunity cost costing that i harvested too early right so uh setting a threshold we have to consider two things the uh expected benefit of harvesting should uh be greater than the transaction cost of doing it and then the opportunity cost since we can't harvest for for 30 days afterwards so um considering the transaction costs for very low volatility assets we're just generally not going to end up tlhing but the second problem is a little more interesting and we can borrow options theory to kind of help us parse it so harvesting a loss is similar to writing a 30-day put struck at uh the harvest price of the security um if you think about the payoff diagram if the security continues going down then it's it's a negative payout for us um so you know here's the hockey stick graph right so harvest price the security keeps going down in price um this is where we're worse off than than we could be right so what does that mean we can kind of structure this as as an options problem in a way so we want to harvest when the base minus the price the harvest amount is is greater than the value of a put struck at that that price with the time over the next 30 days and like the big thing to pull out of this is that volatility is kind of the biggest driver here if we're tr where we're trying to set our um our our lost our harvesting triggers so for securities with lots of volatility we we could guess that we're going to want to have a larger threshold before we want to harvest so putting this all together this is a back test of what annual offsets or annual harvest amounts as a percent of the portfolio we end up getting offsets uh 11 out of 14 14 years annual offset was close to 2 percent and there are no negative offsets over the period through no negative tax alpha which you you can if you're allowing risk management to be your primary driver you can potentially you know still end up end up doing that a little bit um and then the back tested results ultimately are showing that tlh is driving after tax alpha so this is um this is actually applying those those uh those losses through time and then liquid liquidating the portfolio uh at the at the end of the liquidation period we have to pay some tax so it eats into the overall benefit you don't just pocket the whole loss at some point you eventually have to pay some tax the main advantage of tlh is to writing off some against your ordinary income and two deferring taxes and growing that deferred tax account so kind of to cap off um some innovations and tax loss harvesting or you know if you're thinking about this for your personal account and don't want betterment to do it for you is you want to stay in your secondary after your harvest don't blindly switch back your decision to harvest should contin consider transaction costs and also the opportunity cost of future wash sales so that means that your decision to harvest should be conditioned on the volatility of the asset um you should rebalance with each asset with with each harvest so i sell something i now have cash you shouldn't you don't necessarily need to just buy all of the secondary you should this should go into your your standard rebalancing equation um you're immediately going to be pretty underweight the thing you just sold so you're probably going to buy a lot of that but you know you might also be buying some other underweight assets um you're go you want to consider all accounts that all beneficial accounts so if you're married that includes your spousal account so you can't be so clever as to you you sell the security and your wife buys it back that the irs has caught on to that um uh and then something that honestly if people really want to get into we can chat about it offline but um there's some special rules around ira accounts where if you realize a wash sale in an ira account that loss is permanently disallowed just like a very bad thing so we want to avoid any wash sales in the in ira accounts and that's why we have iras and 401k accounts so that's why we have a tertiary ticker that that makes sure we're never washing anything the tertiary ticker only lives in high res and 401ks and it makes sure if we're trying to buy an asset class and if we were to buy the the primary security we would uh end up with a wash sale we'd buy the tertiary instead too to avoid that and then um we're continuously monitoring this um every trading day what assets are these rules applied to sorry which assets what asset classes yeah individual stocks these are uh the rules these apply to uh all securities that i'm aware of the the irs rules on it i don't know i mean what i said classes do you apply oh do we need yeah all our asset classes except for uh the super like super short duration bonds that just don't move around a lot so but you know the majority of the actions happening in the stock etfs right um great yeah so the next uh strategy uh to employ is something called asset location which um can broadly be thought of as putting tax inefficient investments bonds in tax efficient accounts iras and 401ks so certain assets are more tax inefficient than others bonds are tax inefficient international stocks that aren't getting uh qualified dividend treatment of course accounts have different tax treatment roth and traditional iras and taxable accounts are kind of the three that we have to play with so setting up the problem here we want to allocate our assets uh across all these accounts to maximize our after tax return subject to um we preserve our target our target allocation our portfolio and the account balances are preserved because you can't if i if i have 10k in my ira i can't and that's the most that i'm allowed i can't just add another thousand dollars to it if i'm maxed out right so there's hard constraints there so we have to respect the uh the balances that are there and we have to respect uh the the risk of the portfolio the target weights um so just a a quick overview of secure of tax treatments for security types so two things to think about is the dividends which happen annually things are taxed at an ordinary rate are most bonds and foreign stock that doesn't get qualified dividend treatment preferential rate are most domestic stocks they get qualified dividend tax treatment and then municipal bonds um have no tax on the dividends and then capital gains if you sell something so ordinary rate securities short term capital gains anything held less than a year um preferred rate uh securities held for more than a year long-term capital gains and then no tax is if you're transferring to a charity or uh on death to uh to your state okay so non-tax located looks like how we might create a naive portfolio we say i have three accounts i don't know i want seventy percent stocks in each so each gets 70 stocks got it that was pretty easy to understand um but you can still keep that 70 allocation but move things around such that uh the inefficient stuff is in the efficient uh efficient accounts so in this case blue are bonds and green as stocks so we can see that we're moving almost all of the blue into tax tax advantaged accounts with the exception of one and does anybody have a guess with that with that one bond that we leave in the taxable account might be communities yeah exactly so um and yeah so um this is a process that we can we can that can be optimized we can set this up as a mathematical problem right so some things to consider in doing so one thing that's great about setting things up as mathematical problems uh automating them as it forces you to think about all the inputs the problem and how they how they interrelate with one another so the simple way to do is say are you a bond you go in the other account right that would be like the simple heuristic way of doing it but if you're trying to get a computer to do this you might want to think a little more deeply about it so going beyond rules of thumb one we want to consider the growth rate of the assets because if i get if i have a roth account in play uh this money can come out right tax free i get taxed on the front end and not not on the back end so if something's growing faster i want to put it in that account so considering the growth rate of the asset and the dividend yield considering uh part and parcel of that is considering the tax drag from dividends and the dividend yield in considering the liquidation taxes and then also considering qdi ratios so not all dividends from stocks are the same and this is uh kind of setting up that problem we chose to set up as a linear programming problem um but ultimately it's setting up the exact same problem that we we set out before where we're looking to maximize the uh expected after tax return r times x subject to constraints that enforce our balances across accounts and enforce our limited drug from our target our target allocation um so yeah just to sum up this one how is it different or better um we're considering uh annual the annual taxes that you incur and liquidation taxes we consider qualified qualified dividends consider the growth rates on assets uh and then we're solving this this problem uh basically constantly for uh people who have this feature turned on where any money that's coming in we are putting it through this problem and trying to constantly asset locate them in in a more tax efficient way trying to constantly maximize their after tax after tax return and so what does this look like we ran this through our monte carlo simulation that i talked through before and we see it's adding about 50 basis points a year uh annualized of of return to a strategy that's not employing this so you know this is a good example of something that you do you just end up you're doing things that are you just end up in a better spot by doing some of these tax strategies and finally tax lot management so one interesting thing is that if you go to your brokerage and tell them you want to sell security the irs mandates that by default they use fifo lot sorting which is first in first out so that means the share of apple you bought 10 years ago is is is the one that they sell not the one you bought yesterday um so that basically by nature almost always guarantees that you're select it's you're selecting the lot that has the most appreciation in it which is the opposite of what we want to be doing so um you can also tell your broker exactly which lots you want to sell but you have to actually tell them uh at betterment we're doing this for you so we are we have a lot management program where we are sorting whenever there's a cell for security we're sorting all your lots and we're selling the biggest losses first and selling those down and then once we're on to gains we're selling the smallest scans first and so on so um yep um and just a reminder losses are useful um you can add them against capital gains write them off against income carry them forward um and then finally uh thinking a little bit about managing uh tax rate on uncertainty um so one thing that's a little bit challenging about doing this is tax rules can change under foot how do we think about this um particularly in the case of how we're selecting our allocation our our allocation to more tax efficient versus less tax efficient securities right so the example i'll give talks about muni's we know munis are more tax efficient but we don't know what rates are in order to figure out the after tax return we need to know tax rates right and those tax rates might change through time so how do we kind of how do we kind of address that so we address tax rate uncertainty through our black black litterman process so we incorporate after after tax outperformance as a view in black litterman it allows us to specify level of confidence around it and to add one more level of robustness around that we're also doing a robust optimization on our posterior returns so um how are we doing this uh uh let's see yeah we're we're just added we're adding in adding in the after tax performance view we're adding an uncertainty into that matrix this is a better slide so yeah we take our our our prior expectation of return that comes from backing up the cap m model and then we're putting relative tax efficiency as our view uh we're giving a confidence level uh and then working that through to get our posterior distribution once we have our posterior distribution we're doing a robust optimization on that so we're drawing from our our joint posterior distribution we're constructing an optimal portfolio out of that we repeat that hundreds of times well we we write down what that optimal portfolio looks like we repeat that hundreds of times and then we average across those two to give us some more uh robust coefficients that are a little less sensitive to specific capital market assumptions how often do you do that portfolio so we're revisiting our capital market assumptions and our kind of strategic asset location on roughly an annual basis it's just we have a strategic portfolio we don't have um uh tactical views on one thing versus the other so you know generally an annual cadence is right to just incorporate changes in covariance structure and so on and you know the most meaningful difference here is incorporated in muni bonds so muni bonds have a meaningful meaningfully better after tax expected after tax performance in a taxable account so this is the increased allocation to this is the weight and meaning bonds um compared to our ira portfolio so our ira portfolio is not taxed muni bonds don't make it in but you can see they make it in up to 20 percent weight in our in our taxable portfolio so this is the result of of that process okay and then finally i think we have six or seven minutes left is that sasha is that right yeah uh to go over the last topic which is behavior which is uh pretty interesting and uh um uh pretty interesting topic but i'll pause for one second just to see if there's any any questions on the on the tax piece um uh so you couldn't do this because okay so it didn't allow you to do uh asset location because you were yeah i mean the yeah i mean if you have fewer fewer assets you're gonna have less harvesting opportunities um it's just kind of your at piling on constraints right like there's a limited universe like if there's limited accounts um interestingly for a uh someone even who's just using a 401k if they have the access to roth and traditional if they have assets in bolt they can do some asset location between roth and traditional 401ks or rotten and traditional iras so that's that's one place that you can also do asset location so with robo advising as i understand it it's more for passive management and not as much as active management so you see that as a limitation especially uh in the light of taxes that it has to be a lot of qualitative analysis that needs to be done well so i i guess there's a few things that say about that one is i mean you can see here there's a lot of active things going on even though we're investing in market cap market cap weighted securities right um um we spend obviously a lot less time constructing views on which securities or regions or all the number of ways you can make bets which ones are are going to uh you know pan out better that said like this this kind of platform works with active investments we recently partnered with dimensional fund advisors which is a well-known systematic active shop to um get their funds on our platform we also have a smart beta portfolio um where so this is you know kind of active or active light funds that so we're allowing these funds to produce some alpha in that respect while still benefiting from the platform that is managing risk is rebalancing is doing tax strategies and so on um cool so i'll jump into behavior and then we have some time at the end to field any other questions so um uh one of the biggest thing that hurts uh retail investors is themselves they tend to invest they tend to sell when the after the market is dropped and buy after the market's gone up we'll go a little bit there's some studies that try to quantify exactly how much that is um so there's a number of things that we're doing including setting smart defaults uh automating as much as we can using uh investor biases against one another to get to better behavior there's an example of that in here and also just generally being goal-based in general sense to help um if you know i i i this money's earmarked for 30 years out it's a little less scary when there's a 10 drop so first is fighting market timing um so investors it's it's a well-known fact that investors underperform a buy and hold strategy uh there's been a number of papers on it um that estimate anywhere from from one percent to four percent of annualized underperformance from um just uh uh in investor behavior and trading trading too much um one of the one of the most famous papers is called trading is hazardous to your health uh hazardous to your wealth so that's a good title so we find a betterment that a minority of our customers market time so there is still some but about three quarters of the accounts uh uh are not market timing uh are not doing engaging in in uh uh bad investing behavior um and those that do uh the gap tends to be lower so um we look at this pretty closely to try to make sure that customers are doing the right thing with their with their money on our platform uh one thing that we found is that there's a monotonic relationship between the number of allocations unnecessary allocation changes that they're making and uh the negative drag on performance so um here's some stuff that we're doing to try to try to combat that um one is um as subtle as just how we use certain colors so um our use of the color red is is very intentional um and very different than what you might see in a stock trading app where stock trading apps make money by you trading more so they're incentivizing their design to have you trade a lot uh you can see a very different design patterns at betterment where we don't care how much you trade we just want to build your wealth right so um you can see here i picked a period where there's negative returns in the app there's no red here where there is red is where you're off track to meet your goal and the difference here is that when you're off track to meet your goal there's things you can do about it so the main call to action here is to open a goal forecaster which is this screen and this helps you figure out how you can get yourself back on track um you can set up a recurring monthly deposit you can set up a one-time deposit you can change the the the uh time period of your goal so these are things that you can do uh to act actually change uh the status and get yourself out of that red red state um also uh times of downturn or obviously a time when there's more unrest amongst investors and certainly amongst our customer base like any and one thing that we do here that i think is is very different from a traditional financial advisor is we have a platform where we're generating tons of data and we're able to run tests we're able to analyze that data run tests on it and see what happens to improve investor outcomes that's something that the average human advisor really is not set up to do and certainly and that's enough to do at this scale so one thing that we tested was uh long ago in our history was okay the market's down what do advisors usually do they reach out to their clients so let's send all our let's send our whole client base a thoughtful email saying hey like don't worry the market's down but you know um you're in it for the long haul so and so forth uh the outcome of that email was horrendous it caused people to log in to de-risk to pull money out so on and so forth so what did we learn from that we learned that most people were blissfully unaware that anything was going on the market whatsoever and we sent them this email to alarm them so the first thing that we learned was uh concern about the market should happen where people are seeing the concern in app so they come the app market is down they might have heard that the market was down but they go in app to see how it's actually affecting them that's where the first thing we learned is have the interventions there and second we have a platform now to once they're in app we have a platform to test different messaging and understand how it works understanding if an intervention in app helps or doesn't help then these are some of the results from from one of that from as you can see a little while ago so what we were measuring is a series of negative out what we consider negative outcomes so did they defund their account did they change their allocation did they withdraw and positive did they um did they deposit you could see that uh a notification decreased all the bad things and increased the one good thing at the bottom so there's more detail on this that's on the slide but we tested different messages and we generally found that any of the messages any treatment tended to move things in these ways and um different ones were more or less how is the deposit growth related to you alarming them that they're not on track which would naturally happen if the market goes down so sorry what is what's the how are they related so the previous thing yeah right [Music] yeah portfolio was going down yep they are off target now right you alarm them about that yeah they make a deposit you're basically collecting much higher fee yeah i see what you're saying isn't there an ethical yeah i mean like ethical and yeah no that's a good question like i mean uh you know in terms of incentive like we're incentivized to gather aum right to grow the authors um you know i would say that like on the margin like a cynical interpretation would be that yeah that's that's what it's doing um um you know i would say that this only switches over for people who are in a bad state who are close to being who are on the margin anyway right so there's people who are off target will continue to be off target there's people who are on target and have enough buffer goes down that they'll still be on target so it is a narrow band of people are kind of you know on the on the precipice like that is to say i think if our goal were to um extract uh uh you know to gather more assets um there's probably better ways to do it than like get the narrow slice of people who happen to be like just on the razor's edge of being on track or off track um and you know the the motivate you know two ways to do it is through through savings and deposit one is by changing your your goal plan another that we we um that we move to a different screen is changing your allocation you can take more more risk in certain cases that might help you right so you know there's a couple of levers to pull but you know generally one of the biggest problems in financial planning is people are not saving enough so while it's helping gate assets onto the betterment's platform generally one of the biggest problems is people are not saving enough for retirement people are not saving enough this thing so um yeah but you know your point is like i hear what you're saying yeah how how often do people log in to the platform without any blues it's um the distribution is very it's very skewed right like so there's uh you know a medium-sized group of people that are logging in at least once a week and then there's a long tail of people who aren't logging in for months or even years so um yeah um okay and then uh i think this might be the last piece and then hand it over for for to you guys for questions this is one of my favorites is that we're pitting biases against one another so um people hate taxes um and people hate taxes almost in an irrational way some people are almost willing to pay two dollars to avoid one dollar of taxes um people also get very you know scared when the market is changing and want to change fiddle with their allocation so um one feature that we have is uh before you finalize an allocation change we surface something called tax impact preview which shows you in the moment before you complete your transaction what our estimation of your taxes are for doing this transaction so it does two things one it takes information that you almost certainly should know before you make the decision whether to transact and it gives it to you right at the moment so that's really helpful but secondarily it has this effect of people just say taxes i didn't know that was part of the equation just abandoned completely whether or not this was you know a good call for them or not and we see it's fairly effective so this is the completion rate of people who are looking to make an allocation change uh and we see that any when there we show them an estimate of taxes um versus no estimate it's it's down and not only that as the size of the tax estimate increases the completion rate drops off precipitously so kind of an interesting case of of one surfacing valuable information at the moment when it's useful but secondarily there's a little bit of behavioral thing going on here where people or people are repelled by taxes and just abandon the process completely so that's it thank you for listening to the talk and uh we're doing questions till 7 30 but thank you very much yeah it's a people list the rover advisor as one of the top uh application area of ai in finance yeah i think you know obviously there are other other areas i mean how much intelligence you see actually actually those uh tons of ai masters all their yeah you know there's it's it's an area that we continue to look into and i honestly think some of the first places that we'll see ai is is um in robo advising and fintech space is uh in probably not like the headline things that you would expect but um automating some of the peripheral and and yeah i guess peripheral pieces like for example um one problem that we have where we we have some ai technology is uh people will aggregate uh we'll link an external account like a 401 k and sometimes we don't know uh like it's not a publicly traded security but it's uh there's we know properties about about that security like for example his name might be u.s stock fund and you know it might might have other characteristics with it um we can't map it to a ticker and understand what it's like but we can take the information we have about it and try to to use some you know ai or machine learning to map it to things that we do know about and find a proxy ticker for it so that's one area another area is betterman is moving into kind of the cash management space checking savings more more people's everyday financial lives which gives us a wealth of transaction data on their everyday lives right everyday spending habits and it it's a rich data set to to build more complex models for advising people of how much cash they should have in their checking when identifying when they should be moving cash from a checking account to a savings from a savings to an investing account so you know those are a few areas that kind of are i'd say a little bit tangential to uh core investing problems um uh and the use of ai there so i mean that's how some of the way that we've been thinking about it recently do i still need to file my own tax return you do have to file your own tax return yes that's uh something that we've considered though is is more becoming a tax preparer as well right that would be it's kind of a natural step right and uh a lot of the super high end financial advisors they will work they will either do that or work closely with so you know broadly i think about betterment's long-term vision as kind of kind of twofold one putting a financial advisor at the center of everyone's financial life if you think about the center of most people's financial lives it's a bank whose job is to basically extract fees and you know build value for for shareholders whereas if you think about how the very wealthy if you ask you the the center of their financial relationship it's a financial advisor who they're paying to do the best thing for them often they have a fiduciary relationship so part of betterment's longer term goal is to put a uh fiduciary an advisor at the center of everyone's financial life uh secondly is kind of borrowing from that like what ways can we make take technology to make things that previously were just done by ultra high net worth and institutional investors and make them broadly available and you know that's where tax preparation could come in so your treatment of taxes seems to be very important i'm guessing is just federal u.s federal yeah is there any move to individualize or is that too much change going on um there yeah it's it it uh makes the problem space a much much more complex right just in the set of amount of rules to to manage um uh one kind of off menu item at betterment is if you call in and ask for a state muni instead of national muni fund we have that option available for new york and california so but it's just not it's it's uh it's a challenging option to scale and then also interestingly if you look at the after tax yields on uh state munis versus national it's not always obvious that being in the state is the best one and so and that's something that's why it's not on the menu is because we don't monitor that like that you know that we you know it's something that we could add to a roadmap and add but that's also why it's a little bit of like a off menu item but yeah um it's real estate property or any real estate whether they like raise or any other security types party over asset class uh so reits are incorporated just through holding um broad equities so brought equity into industries to market cap weight so that's that's how real estate gets in um in that specific way but uh not in any other way for people who have other real estate holdings you can you can link external accounts um and also add in uh a manual so if you have a house that's like a big part of your net worth then you might use uh you can use betterment to to display and track your net worth you might want to put that in there but it's kind of a manual process right now yeah so let's say if i invested in real estate fund yeah can betterment provide like a risk return sort of view for type of investment at a very high level but yeah does tax treatment affect even your construction of your investment university level is not like high yield in there even at all do you start thinking about taxes all the way up um no not not at not at that level we have we also have an income portfolio which which does that we've built in partnership with blackrock that does mo it's entirely non-portfolio so it is moving the lever on credit quality um so yeah you know broadly we we're looking we're thinking about asset classes um so it doesn't really come in at that high level yeah exactly so it doesn't come in like we're not precluding an asset class simply for for tax reasons um yeah so robo investment is getting more and more popular so what betterment what is batman doing to be unique to do you know yeah yeah so i would say there's two things i mean there's a lot um a lot of it's in this presentation very few robo advisors are doing all the stuff that we're thinking about but you know at a head like also very few people come to a presentation and try to understand each one of these pieces so like more headline level i'd say there's two things one is our structure being an independent robo advisor as opposed to being just a distribution arm for other fund companies so that that aligns us with customers in a way that is different from many others and the second is pushing further into people's financial lives into their everyday transactions banking checking so that's that's a big piece for us as well as becoming a a more full service financial advisor in some ways and you know you can imagine that trend continuing in in all the different dimensions imagine through time for uh for the platform and the ai implementation that you that you use any aws or azure api so you're using custom internal stuff um so and what's your observation if you have used any of the kind of public yeah so we run a lot of stuff on aws we ai specific not not a lot we run aws for just a lot of our more computationally intensive research things like our monte carlo uh simulations are on aws um some of the back tests around uh so we'll build yeah we'll we'll build a model like a perhaps uh more complicated cash flow model and then we'll back test it on on aws um yeah i mean we're like a like a a moderate user of aws from research purpose and then um i'm the wrong person asked about this but our our our technology infrastructure i think sits on sits on aws i'm interested in are there some efficiencies so for example if i have an account and i have a certain portfolio and i buy something and someone else with another portfolio is selling something is there there's some netting of trading or as everyone's account their own little island yeah on its own yeah so there's a great question so um like order flow internalization can we just yeah you're buying i'm selling can we just like you know strike it at market mid and never enter the market so before i joined betterment we were doing that and then we found out from regulators if that made us an alternate trading venue and and subjected us to a lot of regulatory surface area that we were not totally prepared for so that got shelved and is on the back burner for a little bit yeah what was your execution platform um so we run we have our own trading desk and then we are executing through apex who also clears for us apex is there anyone over here been looking forward to church you charge just the the investment fee you don't charge transaction costs that's correct yeah just the flat platform fee uh node trading trading piece you you don't charge a transaction cost that's correct correct so how what how do you deal with with the customers who want to trade frontal lobe like they're very expensive they potentially could well they're bond etfs first so it's not not super expensive um i mean so you don't you don't transact with the individual policies no it's all etfs yeah yeah and you know people are trading fairly and free like you know it's not like a brokerage platform you're like i want to buy this i want to sell this like the way that that trades happen is either we're rebalancing for you or you're telling us that you want a different allocation we have to to trade to get you to that different allocation so um you know trading's not happening all that frequently um because of that yeah so it asks classes when you say asset plus asset cloud etfs in different asset classes yeah nothing else so it's equities basically securities traded public exchange the vehicles and etf the underlying economic exposure would be bonds whatever yeah okay that makes sense these are bonds even if it's an ep yeah because they pass passes through right so if your fund is all holding bonds like you get the tax treatment so it's confusing because we'll have a bond fund it'll pay you a dividend and what's that dividend is the coupon payments from from the bonds inside of it but that dividend you got from bond fund is treated like a uh is treated like bonds so your tax savings will show it's night of the fee of investment oh yeah oh yeah we do yeah all yeah we're turning yeah we're aware we're everything is net of betterment versus expected return how how is that actually calculate the track because you show the graph where you're expected to return always higher than benchmark or yeah that's because of the tax saving or you see a normally seen actual return versus expected yeah it depends on what you're like they're they're two different worlds right expect to return your last return so some of the stuff was realized returned so simulation so some of it's expected so it depends on the thing you're looking at yeah um all right we in chat more though yeah we go oh um oh oh uh a um media portfolio that's built in a partnership with g-stamps um um no thank you no it's good like i would say is knowing and then the second piece um so right but like you know i think like overall
