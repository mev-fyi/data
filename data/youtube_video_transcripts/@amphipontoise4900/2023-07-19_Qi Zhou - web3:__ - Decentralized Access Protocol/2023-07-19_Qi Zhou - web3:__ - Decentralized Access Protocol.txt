[Music] thank you hi everyone I'm Jamie Zhang from either storage team so our founder chisel was supposed to be here but I'm um here on half of him so yeah it's like nice to be here introducing the 3 access protocol so first let me briefly introduce our team we are a team of about like 10 members and our founder chisel he's an active blockchain developer and also an ethereum ecosystem contributor so he authored our code for the several eips including eip4804 and before this he also worked at Facebook and Google as a software engineer and all other team members they are very experienced in this field for years so after two years of research and development we received two grants from the ethereum foundation so one is on data availability sampling research and one is on either storage which is a storage solution that I will introduce later in this talk and also we just want the first place at um at conspore demo this year so what is web 3 access protocol so it's HP HTTP like URL but instead of locating centralized resources hosted by server it's locating the centralized data hosted by smart contract so it's also defined as eic4804 and which was developed by a the storage team as well and this one was finalized this February then why do we need web3 access protocol so the original motivation for us was that more and more nfts are coming to be fully Unchained and to name a few like you know cyber Brokers nouns boom boards and art blocks and there are more nfts are coming fully on chain so um when the nfcs are fully Unchained there are more features and they can play with and they can do a lot of more things than just being a simple image and also nft owners they don't only own the token URL with the token ID on Smart contract but they also own the corresponding data they will never disappear on chain so cyber Brokers they spent about 2 million US dollars to store their data on ethereum but they still use third party like ipfs to render image because there's no other way to render image directly from the network so what we are trying to do is to allow users to browse the content content directly without any third party like DNS HTTP server or ipfs and how do we use web3 access protocol then it actually inherits most features of HTTP so instead of an authority it has a decentralized Authority which is a contract by address or name and there is also a way to call the contract which is called data and a format to return data to display the data so it can be any type of files like Json file JavaScript or a native web address picture so any type of files can be displayed using this Victory access protocol and there are a lot of examples and one good example is our website itself so when you go web3url.io our website it's actually hosted using web3 access protocol already and it's running on top of ethereum so how do we access event with 3 access protocol so there are three ways so one is Gateway the current Gateway for ethereum is now w3th.io so if you see the examples on the screen the link you add the URL contract as a sub domain of the Gateway and our Gateway now supports lots of major blockchains like Ivy Trump optimism PM between polygon appliances score so we are adding more blockchains on our list so like if you want to add your chain or want to do some kind of cooperation you can contact us and the second excess way is Chrome extension so I prop the link get up link right there so it has all the details like how to install how to use this extension so once you install this extension in the URL bar you just type in web 3 keyword and whether you're a prefix will just be automatically filled and you can type the rest and the extension will interpret all the three URLs in its own service worker and send requests to ethereum Json RPC service like metamask and the Third Way is a native browser support so the current native browser is actually developed by our community members and we are working on more support from native browsers like Chrome Firefox or Opera so there can be a lot of applications one good example is on own chain nfts like cyber Brokers so they upload all data on chain and compose them using smart contract and we deploy a contract to render the data and register like cyber Brokers meta.eth and points to the render contracts that we deployed so we've done some experiments using Victory access protocol and one example is vital explode so we uploaded the whole Vlog to Arbitron Nova and this contains about like 40 megabytes of content and it costs 0.13 ethereum so using metric access protocol the upload content on decentralized network can be rendered directly without any third-party Trust so this actually got lots of feedback and comments so the discussion is ongoing so you are all welcome to join our discussion and we are doing all other experiments as well like for example Stanford blockchain review upload and others so you can check out more details and there are more applications as well so one big case is dynamic website with multi-user interactions so for example like decentralized blogger decentralized Dropbox email GitHub even Craigslist or any anything going on in web 2 can now benefit from Battery access protocol so this list on the screen is already live on our testness so you can visit our website and check out those so it's good that that um we can do a lot of things that we couldn't do before using Victory access protocol but there are still limitations in infrastructure level so the critical issue here is that storage costs on ethereum is super expensive so um maybe using ibitron Nova with the AC my lower the cost a little bit down like we did with the vital explode but we still need a better own chain storage solution so that's why we developed either storage so with a test Stories the major goal is to reuse ethereum security properties and extend ethereum storage capabilities so key idea here is that building a storage specific role up versus evm specific rural so we try to reduce ethereum storage costs by 1000 times lower and scale storage capacity to petabyte level but we still reuse either remaining security and still pay storage fee in ethereum and this is a permission list as well so any node with the minimum required storage capacity which is four terabyte they can join the network so you might ask what's the difference between it storage and even specific Roll-Ups so the biggest difference is the incentives to give the storage providers so it's in ethereum and it's more for them to store data and skipping all the six rows in in the last row if you see this storage proof all those users to verify on layer one that there is a large amount of replicas about like 100 they store data of chain in the layer 2 Network so there's no such enforcement in the current events yet and then another frequently Asked question is that what's the difference between um if the storage and all other decentralized Storage Solutions like firecoin are with so there are two major differences one is that um either storage is designed for hot Dynamic data with high value on top of ethereum so fire coin r with those are more like cold storage with the only like static data and second difference is that if the storage is highly incorporated into ethereum ecosystem so existing ethereum tools like metamask solidity waffle those things can operate in the storage data so to achieve these goals we need lots of Technology Innovations first we need to solve decentralized data on node problem with ethereum's data availability or EIP 4844 and Bank charting so in this specific area we are working with ethereum Foundation as we receive the grant for this area so we are trying to make it happiness as fast as it can and the second is um when after the data is Unchained we need to ensure to purchase data with with the required redundancy so that we make sure the data is secure on network so that's exactly what it storage is doing and lastly we need to retrieve data in a decentralized manner and that's why we why we built this web3 access protocol so now with all these possibilities it's like we can now create a better future Victory environment so with the storage we can scale dramatically and also lower the cost and with web 3 access protocol we can retrieve data in a fully decentralized way so the whole layers are decentralized so here's our roadmap so we are actively working on eip4844 devnet with um ethereum developers and we recently launched our libraries to support new OP codes enabled by eip4844 and we are also building a snark approver and a verification contract so when the eip4844 is ready and test net is ready we'll be able to deploy the whole system into the ethereum network so we believe that like we can now have lots of interesting and different applications using these Technologies so here is our website um so for web3 Access protocol and it is storage for HTTP version and also A3 access protocol version so please join our community on Twitter and also Discord because the discussion is now really active and contact us for more questions through this email so uh thank you for your attention and I would be happy to answer any of your questions of the stage I'll be around so yeah thank you [Applause] [Music] thank you
