let's go hey everyone so this is adrian from cismo and today we're going to talk about art stations and what we call web 3 cookies it will enable a lot of things in webtree so we're gonna talk about that how to leverage your data so first let's give it let's give a definition of attestations so it is a user data that added is related to a user that is certified by an issuer and we will see a different kind of issues and that is provable to a third party the third party can read the attestation and know that it is legit so like there are a lot of examples you can think about like national ideas uh your age more crypto native stuff a big dedicated without participate in governance and generally like any user data so it can be web 2 that are also your twitter followers it can be yeah national data or wall3 data so i think it's interesting to to think about the two main ways to create attestations the first one is centralized issuance so i'm a third party i'm the nation states i give you your passport your passport is an atta station so this could be digitalized and that will create an accession uh it's interesting other stuff is web 2 companies for instance twitter they have their private database and they can certify uh something about their data so your number of twitter followers or or things like that the way it works is that the issuer in this case the tester signs a message i certify that this data is valid and i'm the central authority that gives it its validity so so yeah the other way to create attestations and i think it's even more interesting is user generated so as a user i have public data on my gid on my address and i'm able myself to prove to a third party something about me so in that case the issue is actually a smart contract that verifies user proof and the issuance is trustless in a way the the mechanism is just a smart contract that verifies a user proof about its own data so you can think about again governance participation asset ownership and it's based on the public available data and there is more and more publicly available data so what are they used for they are very great to be used as reputation into inside your app okay you did this you orbit delegates you have a big i don't know github contributions on big projects and also as access control it's the beginning of the notion of web3 cookie is okay i want to get part of my app to some specific users i require them to bring me an attention that proves something about them and identity creation so now application will use that decision as a technical tool but how a decision that i told you about that was theoretical how are they available to applications you have the two main standards that you must have heard about verifiable credentials in this case it's an off chain api where applications can fetch at the stations and third parties that rely on them verified that the attestation was well signed by the issuer of the association so it's really an improvement from web 2 because currently apis they just give you data they don't certify anything but it's still in the web 2 language in the way that there is communication with the central party that that sign things so it transl big improvement from web 2. but seems the other way to make attestation available to applications is using tokens so you can call them badge non-transfer tokens solvent token in any way it's using a very common standard the token standard to use as a as a store of data so by doing a badge let's say a badge that proves that i'm a big delegate in ens in ens dao by making it available as the nft what's great is that on-chain apps can use it air drops governance and anything that any any smart controller can access it but also option applications and sometimes we forgot about that but like the evm is read by tons of web to apps so that makes it very well accessible it's a standard api the token api so the way it works that you receive on the wallet a batch a non-transable nfc sbt and behind that there is an attestation and so by proving your own the accounts like without signing with ethereum or yeah with the signing with atrium you can prove you have the badge or the sovereign token and thus prove the underlying attestation so now i think this is the most important part of this is why accessions there's three main things that are interesting is the data liquidity granularity and aggregation so data liquidity it's really giving you power on your data you have data here i don't know you have a reputation and defy reputation as a contributor in in projects uh you have a lot of data spread a bit all over and with attestation you are able to move them from a place you are defy wallet to maybe your social wallet and so basically the idea is that i have reputation somewhere i want to to import it somewhere else or i want to prove something about myself to third parties and generally where two companies like are not built in this way like they don't give you power on your data and so attestation can give you really disability to yeah to have your data liquid your reputation your history the other part is granularity i think this one has more to do with consent is that on my national id there is so much information and i should be able to just give the exact information that is required by the application if if i need to prove that i'm more than 18 year old i should just prove that or similarly in a way three native case if i just want to prove that i have an nft i shouldn't like share my wallet address with tons of information in it the other part is the aggregation is okay i have idea of it everywhere maybe on different wallets maybe on different chains and i should ask the user it's my accounts i should be able to have an aggregated view of all of that and if you add the granularity part it gives you really sovereignty of your id i can agree i have the aggregated view i need to access an application i give them just what they need so you need zika for granularity if you want to extract some part of that of your wallet you need to find a way to to prove that you have let's say an ft without giving you a glass we're doing this that is moment with zika snacks aggregation is the same way how do i prove that i have let's say 10 nfts from several wallets without giving you my wallet we do that in snacks too and liquidity actually you don't necessarily need zika so attestations are more than just dk2s or privacy tools it's really a way to control your data and make it [Music] readable in a way by applications so that you can really leverage your data that is yours so for instance you have on your code wallet all your assets like all your networks is there but you just need to use your data you just need to use that hey i have a good credit score and maybe you want to use that from your hot wallet so just generated an attestation of from a cold wallet to a hot wallet that have a good credit score can be useful because it increases the liquidity of your data so now web3 cookie what it is it's this concept of attestations delivered under the form of sbts [Music] if i'm able to i don't know have a big follower account on lens and have a good credit score on rv if i'm able to generate just hey i'm a good lender and have a great reputation and putting this on another address just to access a service that is gated for these people like i'm kind of created with three cookies like yeah i yeah so i generated from my data the attestation needed and just them that can be consumed by any applications and we did it in a very interactive world trustless and reasonable way because in the end these are tokens i still control the addresses on which it is and you have the power of smart contracts you can do so many things you can get your ad drop to to this attestation you can do governance instead of judging do of doing just talking voting you can do token voted weighted by reputation or stuff like that so here again it's liquidity it gives you the ability to leverage your full data so yeah just want to say one thing that often like granular it's yeah granularity is understood aggregation is understood but the liquidity part i'm talking about a lot about that today is that we've been raised with web 2 accounts and we never felt the fact that we never shared our data between twitter facebook airbnb uber and it kind of constrained our imagination i think and by being able to transfer your data and control all your reputation there will be crazy applications even in web 3 we are still wallets centered address centric and we still think one account one usage one human one accounts but this is the vestige from from what to if you're thinking about it's like well it should have like hundreds of of addresses that are just technicalities anyway [Music] and if i showed us this uh if you think about centralized finance you have many accounts in many different financial services and what defined proof is that with one account you have tens of protocols integrated and if you think about it uh i'm short on time but the erc20 is what they are actually they are attestations in fact like i told you somatizations are centralized issue issued by central authorities that is what is usd and usdt usdc is the notification that there is some usd somewhere in the bank account and so this is not assumed that you have a usb value dye is user generated proof of usb value it's ownership activation that you deposited in like a a3 curve it's a native station that you deposited value in rv and curve and that's what made d5 so interesting that this liquidity but not just liquidity of financial capital is this liquidity of information like i did this and then i can reuse what i did and indeed it's easy because everything is financial and it's native i don't know how to say it but now imagine you can do that between financial data and social data and professional data and work to that and rational data and that's what we we aim at we want with attestations to really release this like be a bridge between all your data there is more and more data available and chain and available on your ids and let's break the data sealers we are so used to data series from my two but i think that you should be able to have a group chat with your twitter and facebook friends you should be able to have a better rating loan a better interest rate on your loan because you're a good uber driver or airbnb host and i think that with attestations if we do it well if you think about lens protocol for instance there are social a source of social reputation with defy with governance i think that we will be able to have like really innovative applications that are amazing so that's what we aim at um we built as is more but generally i think the whole ecosystem is thinking like that a bit we're trying to create this new primitive that lets anyone um yeah control its identity and make it more liquid so since we are an association protocol we are the home for many diverse attestations we we are basically a registry of many associations and we make that we make them available through our products to all the applications so it's once is more it's easy to use this decision to get your service or as reputation so yeah that's it [Applause] i don't know if you have time for one question or yes yeah so the question was let's say that i'm able to generate an association that that for my good credit score what makes me what what prevents me from selling it right yeah that's actually it's everything is programmable so if you think about it it's on smart contracts or maybe at the same time that you generate the attestation maybe you have to lock some capital or even better you have to lock some of your reputation or you use some civil resistance at a station too that proves that you are a human so you can do it but only once or you can you you must also prove that you own the destination account flag in the end the attestation will be owned by an address so you prove ownership of this address um here again we're trying to open the design space and i think like there are so many solutions with these kind of programs that that's hard prevention yeah for exports this one what we did is that you prove ownership of the private key of the destination so if you have a net station there yet that means that you own the private key so you can sell this private key but it remains weird and [Music] if you um attest that you have a good credit score and then later your credit score gets bad does the attestation somehow update or is it like once it's there yeah to be honest the credit score one is is good for the vision but i think it's pretty far down the road because it's it has this kind of complexities but there are ways to solve it by looking some reputation or by by using resistance or you can then you can also like you have a notification with your credit score then you can have a association that you did well with your credit score that you you can think about systems that are great some of them yes but there are some dynamics yes excuse me yeah so some are delivered as verifiable credentials and hours are developed as as delivered as sulburn tokens so badges non-transferable token so you have a badge and behind there is another station thank you guys [Applause]
