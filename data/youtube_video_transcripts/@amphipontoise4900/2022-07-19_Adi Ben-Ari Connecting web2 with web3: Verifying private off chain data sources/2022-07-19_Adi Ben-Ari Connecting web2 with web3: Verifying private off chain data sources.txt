hi my name's addie bernary i'm the founder and ceo of a company called applied blockchain i'm going to present you today connecting web 2 with web3 and how do we verify private off-chain data sources i don't know about you but i've been to a few different talks today and i think this is officially the hottest room in the entire building so if there's so many of you here i can only assume that you're really interested in the subject so i'll try and make it worth your while and just a little bit before i start apply blockchain is a company which develops blockchain applications so we're we're a software development shop i started the company in devcon1 in 2015 and we're close to 100 developers focused primarily on different types of dabs blockchain applications and so on and we have two two products that we've developed ourselves as well one is called silent data and the other one is called london bridge and i'm going to focus on silent data today and describe a bit more what we're doing and why um so first of all um i'd like to keep things a bit interactive let me just how many of you um would say you know what an oracle is okay can someone volunteer to just tell me what what you think it is okay i'm not going to get that so i'll tell you um essentially there's two two types of oracles that we see oracles are for connecting data from outside the blockchain bringing it into the blockchain in the blockchain in general we have a very trusted environment where we have cryptography and cryptographic primitives and a cryptographic secured history and so we can trust everything that happens inside the smart contracts if there's any data from outside the blockchain then then by default we don't trust it and so we typically have an oracle application or infrastructure that enables us to bring data in and to be able to trust and act on it um i think of two types of oracle services one is for public data which is generally pricing so in many uh d5 and other blockchain applications we need to know the price of assets and the price of an asset might come from external sources as well as sources on chain so that's your very typical uh oracle data oracle um but the other type we've been exploring ourselves uh is a privacy preserving oracle right and there are some types of data that you might want to use in a blockchain application which belong to a user or which belong to a company and so you probably don't want or they probably don't want that data shared in any way with any third parties let alone with a bunch of validators who are validating a blockchain now those external data sources i've got a few examples here but we think about open banking so i put plaid on here as a source for bank account data credit scoring um zero company invoices um instagram to prove that you're maybe the owner of an instagram account maybe some kyc checks and so on so there's a bunch of different external data sources that you might want to verify uh in order for your dap for your web 3 application to function generally we see that these fall into two categories or two use cases the first one is tokenization right technical issues here in in d5 let's call it 1.0 so what we've seen in the last 18 months i'll just shout most of the focus is on native assets what we think we're going to see more of as the technology prevails and and hopefully the next wave will be more real-world assets um and for those real world assets the assets are originated and anchored and they have part of their value comes from the external data sources from the real world that means that we need to be able to import that information into the blockchain and where that information is sensitive so it's about a company it's about an individual and so on that's where we need a privacy preserving oracle um so tokenization of real-world assets and the second is verification of off-chain credentials so identity obviously anything to do with identity is super sensitive we don't really want to reveal it on chain at all so we need to be able to prove things about it without revealing so these are the types of data sources that we've been integrating with now there's an unsecure way of doing this and there's a secure way of doing it the unsecure way is what most people seem to do by default which is i'm building an application it's got a web server component so it's got a web 2 component um i'll integrate with different web 2 data sources through that and then i'll send the data to the blockchain right i'll send it to us problem with that type of application or that type of integration is you are the third party or whoever is hosting that web 2 application is the third party they have to be trusted one to see the data and not to reveal it to others or not to abuse the fact that they can see the data and two they can actually change it to the original data source and therefore the the blockchain or the smart contract application has no way to know whether this is original data that's come from the original api or whether it's it's actually been fabricated or interfered with by the by the api layer right um the way this is solved in some oracles is to decentralize that api layer right which basically means we're going to have a bunch of these integrations hosted by different participants that's better because then instead of one party that can interfere we have a group which is a bit harder to to for them to to actually interfere and default the system but they still all get to see the data and if the group is small enough so if it's not very decentralized then obviously they collude to interfere with the data as well so in general that's we wouldn't recommend the this type of approach because it carries a lot of risk and if in your smart contracts you've got valuable assets you don't want those assets to be moving based on data that isn't as secure as the blockchain itself so the the way we solve this we've built a platform called silent data silent data uses a technology called hardware secure enclaves right specifically we use intel sgx now i know that in the crypto community not everybody is a is a huge fan of the technology because there's a there's a hardware manufacturer there's a corporate name behind it in practice uh the technology itself is is is fairly secure it has some known and published vulnerabilities just like any any type of solution including any types of cryptography um but it does have some super interesting properties that allow us to solve this problem very well those properties are two primary properties it's a hardware secure enclave so when you put data in there the data isn't visible to anyone right it's not visible to the operator of the platform to the operator of the machine to the administrator of the machine and so on so nobody can actually see your data and the way silent data works is the enclave itself the solution in the aircraft calls out to the web 2 apis using https so there's nowhere in the middle where we could intercept or see that data it goes straight into the enclave encrypted once it's in the enclave we can query it and then we can produce a cryptographic proof improving some properties of that data which we can then send to the blockchain so we have privacy the second super interesting property of these of these hardware secure enclaves is the attack station so the way it works is we put the silent data code into the enclave the enclave itself has a unique key which was put in there by the manufacturer that signs our code and we send that to intel we send it to the manufacturer manufacturer comes back signing that saying it's one of ours and we attest to the fact that this is correct and they can't fabricate that because it's based on the original keys that they put in the enclave right so they don't get to see our code they just get a hash of it and they they really have no way of interfering in this right the only thing they could potentially do is maybe not respond to us so we get an attested version of the code now that's very interesting because we can then take the output from our enclave and we can prove the calculation that's been done there right we can prove the source code that we use to query our data we can prove where the data came from through tls so through https we have a certificate of the server from the bank or from wherever we pull the data from the web 2 api so we can prove where the data's come from what query was run on it the fact that it was queried in a in a privacy preserving environment and it hasn't been leaked and we can take that that proof alone to the smart contract and the smart contract can verify that right in a very concise way so we can basically extend the the we're effectively extending the computation logic of the smart contract into a privacy preserving environment where we can query these web two data sources does that make any sense okay um so i guess the the the overall uh benefit of that is we can integrate with web2 apis those apis don't have to change right so unlike um unlike other types of ways of keeping data private such as zero knowledge proofs in zero knowledge proofs you typically have to take the original data have it exposed somewhere and then generate the proof which means that the data source would have to adopt the technology or it would have to be revealed somewhere with this type of technology and with this solution with silent data the apis don't need to change the data source doesn't need to change so we've connected directly with open banking for example in its current form and we can get the data from there and prove that it's that the actual bank account data has been queried and not modified in the process an example query for a bank account might be i want to prove that someone's got more than 100 pounds a month a 100 euros a month income right and they've had it for the last three months but i don't want to know anything else about the account well i want to know they've got a certain amount of funds in the account or they want to prove that to me and so these are things that can be used for things like credit checking additional background checks if you think about d5 protocols you want to look at on-chain data but you might also want to augment that with proof about off chain credentials and this is how we do it another example otherwise social media so we've got an application that we're building where um we want to be able to prove people are using instagram accounts to sell we want to be able to prove that the owner of a wallet is actually the seller right so the owner of a wallet is actually the owner of the instagram account so we can use an integration that we have in silent data to enable a wallet to be linked to an instagram account and to prove to provide the proof to the smart contract uh that the link is there without us actually having any access to that account or to its credentials or anything like that so they're not revealed to anyone any questions yeah so i mean the enclaves are built by the manufacturers right so most chip manufacturers today intel amd um even apple have enclaves in there in the chipsets and so it's a standard technology in the chipset for silent data we've used intel's because it has some some more advanced features that we rely on um but it's a feature of the uh of modern chips basically um i mean there are some vulnerabilities known with these enclaves enclaves are everywhere by the way i mean i have it here my apple pay is secured by uh an enclave that's on the iphone right um one of the the known vulnerabilities of side channel attack so if somebody has access to the hardware they can try to listen into the energy levels and try and guess what's going on inside the chip so some people have managed to uh to do some types of attacks and there's ways of protecting against those as well so it's not a perfect technology but it has a lot of really important really useful features that we can bring into a blockchain environment how close are we to web to financial services wanting to integrate with something like side data say equifax and credit checking yeah i mean the way equifax works is it kind of collects everybody's data into the middle right and and kind of acts as that honeypot and has all of that data we're kind of thinking about more of a decentralized world right so we think the actual financing happens on chain because that's where it's most efficient and then there's really signals that come from off chain that can then be brought to the smart contract now ideally from a privacy perspective that's not one place that's gathering that data right you're going to different data sources that the user is enabling right he's giving access to those go into an environment where nobody not an equifax or anybody can actually access that data there's some proof that comes out that says this this is good for a d5 loan for this type of and the smart contract verifies that and that's it so the data doesn't get revealed anywhere right it's just with the user or with their original web 2 accounts right so data sits in the bank we can't help that right for now um but the original data source is the only place the data is ever exposed yes exactly so so we have we have open banking that was the first one that we launched with that works in europe uk us we have for example an nft platform which takes as well as crypto payments they take fiat payments and they use the open banking to verify if someone has the fear um amount in their account in order to build a bid for a high value nft for example right so there are there's uses for open banking already um we've also uh the next one that we're releasing is instagram so i mentioned that we're doing a proof of ownership of the instagram account that'll be released in september um and we have a kyc into aml integration with unfido as well which we're preparing and really the next stage for us is to open this up so people can build their own adapters okay um yeah have a look silentdata.com you can see information papers and so on please take a look or very quickly we've also also built on the intel sgx and enclaves we've got a token bridge which were built between our ground and ethereum to enable liquidity between those two blockchains and we'll be integrating with others as well but we use we use the attestation feature of the enclave to make the bridge more secure so again as a as a bridge operator we can't interfere thank you very much [Applause]
