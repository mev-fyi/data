site to have a captcha that is that is solved outside of discord and he provides a one-time use link this way here you avoid scammers actually getting into your discord ahead of time and then if you just have a random link that they can join that's an infinite invite they can join your discord you may have like to pass capture once you're inside but they have your entire member list and can immediately start spamming everybody that is in your list and they already have that they know that they're a part of that server therefore it can be an attack vector so i don't really i really like this and i don't prefer these other options which a lot of people want to use which are really convenient this thing takes a bit to set up but i've also got links to this this one's by mirin daniel i really like what this is uh what this is doing so in other words other places you could just use like a a custom discord vanity link so that's great to have that just to like identify your branding and everything and then uh what you'll want to do is use the captcha bot of course so the capture bot does have some downfalls uh just because it's in kind of like a non-setup so if you haven't completed a capture from before you're if somebody else comes to claim yours and actually ask have the captcha come through it won't actually uh it'll still wait for the other one to get completed so you either have to clear it out or they it's really annoying that setup so i have a few quorums with that um yeah then uh it's just simple things too with uh just like having roll selection so if you just want something low if it's a pretty low chill server just have like a roll reaction bot that can set up rolls so when people come in at least you know that they're human and they're not just bots uh other tools to help your community safe anti-spam bot i love this one from from dangel it just runs in the background i'm using it across sushi layer 0 and stargate it runs across 600 different servers 60 different servers are protected by it and there's over a million users in the database so this is keeping track of anybody that is scammers if they get banned on one of them they get banned across everything so it's a really really wicked tool to just that's running in the background of course a ticketing bot this is something that i brought in with uh stargate and layer zero and really liked how when you have somebody has a question you have them go directly to a ticketing channel where they have direct contact with the with either your moderators or your team so they know that they are getting direct support and that it's not you know just dms or it's not just like wide open in a channel because a lot of people will end up again scam vector so i'm really tight on security i really want this to this is where a lot of this is coming from and even auto messaging bots uh just something as simple as like with security best practices like what how many people here have seen like people give up their seed phrase just randomly giving this out i hope nobody in here has done that but i'm so many people in the early days of this were just like giving up their seed phrase even an auto message bot they could just be repeating that repeating that repeating that don't give it up don't give it up that might be enough just to prevent that person to be like hey wait a second i shouldn't do that so i like uh all those things to help with security so growth and fostering so now we're going to look at a bunch of the a bunch of places to get bots so top.gg is a fantastic place for all of these tools for for bots and whatnot so me six and the jagbot those are really big popular uh multi-purpose bots i don't use them a whole lot personally because i'm trying to find specific use cases for bots that do exactly what i want but these are really great for just uh uh generic things generic slash commands to have your community engaged with sesh.fyi fantastic as well for calendar reminders it can remind you like on the daily the hourly the 10 minutes before and at the event and you can even tie it into your google calendar so that's a really cool tool and then translation bot for uh someone like myself that's only speaking one language natively um yeah it's uh it's a really helpful tool if i'm going to go into a different different channel different language channel and want to be able to see what's going on tweet shift fantastic to bring in all of your tweets so people can actually see what's happening on your twitter feed and get alerts about it so that they can go and engage there so you can take them to twitter as well web3 data infobots also cool to have uh have that up in your yeah right hand corner of your discord where you have like your member list you can actually have those bots up there that are displaying that kind of information so things like your gas prices or the price of your token or how much volume you've had things like this that you can bring in uh really cool because now i'm not like leaving i don't have to like go to block native or have to go somewhere else i can just be in our discord and know oh hey it's gas is cheap i'm going to make some transactions oh uh and also miss the uh and then the last one here is just like member list bots where you can pick up the all of your members that are within your list and perhaps use that in conjunction with some of the things uh up next year so identifying your engaged invested members collab land guild noble all really great tools to connect web 2 to web3 so you can now see what each of your members has in their wallet when they connect with it so if you wanted to have token gated certain channels or certain communities or whatever you needed this way here you can say does this person have this amount of tokens in their wallet or hold this nft or something like that that way you can like build role-based things for them and yeah be able to grow your community that way and know who is an actual holder or an actual believer and has conviction and then again i touched on this earlier with the sushi samurai but like finding engaged community champions and empowering them that was the sushi samurai was a really great like it's almost a case study i feel at this point with like watching community members grow into uh actual like team members and are like protecting essentially protecting the sushi community so i really like what's happened there with them and absolutely love them so if you're ever in the sushi server and you've got a problem you're looking for a samurai even just reach out to them in general yeah forums and engagement tools we've got a lot of you are probably familiar with discourse that's one of the oldest ones a lot of a lot of diversity allowed with that one and a lot of different ways to engage with it sorry like with different um trust levels and and whatnot it's uh it's it's worked really well but i really like commonwealth to be honest it's a new one here it's up and coming it has web3 login um so immediately you're logging in with your web wallet that was like the first thing that attracted me to it uh of course you can have token gating so now you know that hey someone that is actually a part of your protocol they have tokens you can actually set that up to have to have those topics token gated so you don't just have spam messages and then of course the cool thing with this is that it can actually tie the snapshot proposals back to the the actual topic or the proposal that was created in commonwealth so now you can vote directly on commonwealth in snapshot so it's connecting all this stuff really like that tool and it seems to be working well with hardware wallets as well uh snapshot uh is of course the voting platform that many dows are using and uh multi-chain strategies uh it's really great so you can have it just across different networks and the um ability to tie it back to your forum wherever it was before wherever your forum was you'll be able to tie that back to um uh yeah to that that original post and then of course uh the end thing here is the i voted po app i really like how if you voted i really want to see engagement in and i really appreciate the engagement behind voting so the i voted poep thing has been uh has been super cool which ties us into our next thing here with uh poap the proof of attendance protocol um absolutely love what poep has done and it's been a huge engagement tool for us um for me and and for all the communities i've been involved with so if you've been to any one of my events in the past it's chances are that you've heard me speak about the djen bot that has been keeping track of you after 15 minutes and then this is a tool that will actually deliver the po app to you after you send it uh you either go claim it in a channel or can send it to you directly so shout out to the bankless guys that have been working on that and have kept that going um yeah the po app delivery uh great for just like on-chain actions that you've completed and being able to uh receive a po-app for that and then raffles is really cool too to if you've got like a whole bunch of people within your community then you just want to give out a few things uh really cool to have a rappel raffle based on the po app that are that they hold in their wallet and pull up that art this is like one of my favorite engaging things that i've done uh was to host this party um actually we held a couple of them with sushi this one was for last year for the birthday of sushi and it's allowing you to paint one pixel per per second depending on how many po-apps you have so yeah we had a ton of engagement with this as well because it's bringing in other communities you can see so many different uh projects involved in here and other names of things so it was really cool to bring so many different communities together and you can even use some of their pull apps to provide access to this as well and finally uh just poet polls if you needed polls that were based on certain co-apps these people have centered in a certain event this way here you could gate it to uh to specific people uh some media and content um this d-work is another web 3 basically trello or kanban board i guess i should say great because it ties in with discord and i really like this aspect of it too because you can now when a new task is created it'll actually prompt you over in discord so you know that it's coming in direct web wallet payout is a wicked feature as well because you can pay on any network in basically any talk well several of the networks i was actually quite impressed with how many have been supported and payout in any token because you may want to be using your token as compared to just uh um you know a random token or sorry a more generic token um so big fan of them uh notion a lot of people are familiar with that more web too a lot of teams using it companies protocols it's great but you know i kind of like this of course coming back to anything that's web3 and of course trello easy for kanban boards shareable things like that and finally here with the discord channels stages yeah again this is one thing that i'm using regularly absolutely love stages it's great for hosting events with uh with having your guests be able to come up on stage and it leaves the audience muted essentially so they have to request to come up so you don't end up with hot mics and things like this uh where it becomes kind of a disruption for your uh you know for your event um again this is great because the threshold on it as well you can have so many people in here as compared to like a voice channel where voice channels limited to like 100 they're good for quick chats and you can screen share with it but the audience isn't muted by default so you have to pre-set that up ahead of time so it just takes a little more configuration to do that but i really like the appearance of the stages and that's what i use for the most part radio and radio music channels we've also got like the lo-fi bot so if any of you have been to my events before you may have heard the lo-fi bot playing ahead of time and afterwards but i do like having a channel where you can just come in and chill listen to tunes such as the low-fi bot or bring in any kind of youtube channel now for actually working on your content bringing your content in so online broadcast software obs that's a great way to record and live stream through this so it's got uh you're able to tie it in with youtube twitch and then restream and the restream is the key part here where things can get really interesting so basically you can build out your whole scene of what you want to look like on when you're sending it to youtube or to twitch um and then of course having a mic and mixer just get yourself an xlr mic just do it get a good one that has phantom power and get this road caster pro i don't mean to shill anything like this but since i got this thing this has unlocked a ton of oh like basically this next part that i'm going to be chatting about the road caster pro has unlocked it because of its bluetooth features and nvidia broadcast is great for it is only for pc because it requires that nvidia graphics card but the noise removal is unbelievable absolutely insane so you really want to use that one so finally here as we talk about the ultimate event aggregator and this is something i finally put together i've been wanting to do this for ages where you're able to host an event in discord host an event in twitter spaces those two are able to communicate with each other then you can have this in obs the online broadcasting software build your scene in there where you're pulling in discord pulling in twitter so you can have the audiences of both of those and then you're live streaming to both youtube and twitch right through the use of restream now with restream you can also have the chat aggregation as well so it's supporting discord twitch and youtube so basically you no longer have to think oh where should i have my audience personally i like to host things in discord and that's where i make my my uh i guess main presence but now you can actually reach every single audience on any of these platforms and they don't have to be opting into having to jump over to one or the other i particularly don't like twitter spaces and i hope that they hear this and that they get a better system for their uh for their desktop but um yeah for a desktop app but this way here we're able to bring this all together and the key thing here is using obs and that road caster pro mixer because it has bluetooth and it allows you to connect to your phone and then you're able to speak through that so i've got a whole documentation on all that uh which you can find afterwards here from my uh from my link tree but in conclusion uh communities are growing they're not going anywhere uh i'm seeing like a massive amount of growth with this the tools are improving constantly it's it's incredible to see like how many like web 3 and dow toolings are coming out so i'm really excited for the future here as we i don't know as we just continue to build out our communities so uh yeah basically thank you all so much for listening to this talk uh there scan my link tree if you want right now you can actually connect with all of my socials and i've got the this whole community tooling page here as well for all of the resources if you want to check out on anything that we've talked about and more so anyways thank you all very much questions sorry if anybody wants a po-app afterwards stick around and you get one from me so is there a question any if no questions no big deal go ahead do you do some quests inside your discord so i know the quest social quest i haven't really got to quest yet but i know that there's some great tooling for that as well um i guess like rabbit hole or um there was another new one here recently i started looking into but uh are you guys with some quest stuff or yeah question below sure yeah and other questions there's like a lot of similar discord copy like tool or for web3 like what do you think of creating more web3 native stuff like do you think would love it yeah uh whoever decides to build the web3 discord uh uh i'm fully on board so please reach out to me i absolutely want that discord works great would love to see that in web3 because that's what this is all about okay thank you awesome thanks [Applause] thank everyone
