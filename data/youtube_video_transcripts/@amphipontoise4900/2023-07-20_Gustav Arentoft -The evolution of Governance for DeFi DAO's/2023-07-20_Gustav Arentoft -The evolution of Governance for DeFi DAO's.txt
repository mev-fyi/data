foreign [Applause] [Music] okay yeah okay now we are we are finally ready sorry for the the short delay there was a couple of technical problems um yeah my name is Gustav ahrensoft I'm the co-founder and CEO at stable lab and today I'll talk a little bit about the evolution of governance specifically for defy daus uh that we we have seen in in the recent years um I'm the co-founder of stable lab we are a professional governance organization um we specialize in in governance participation right now we work with over 20 protocols the places where we we are present are some of them at least what you can see here in the screen we're delegates and active participants in most of the major D5 projects we also work with some of the the bigger l2s we also sit on various councils and committees we also governance facilitators for example in Euler so we have a pretty broad access to the current high-level uh like defy dial ecosystem as well as some of the l2s like kind of like being present in these protocols we we have a couple of uh first-hand takeaways and experiences I'll I'll be diving a little bit more into today so really appreciate you all coming and again apologies for for the delay um so first off um where where is governance really today um since the start of the bear market we've actually seen a pretty big increase in the in the focus of decentralized governance I think one of the the main things that kind of like uh came over from the bull market was that a lot of the dials they had taken on pretty big spending budgets I think maker is a pretty notorious example here all of a sudden you had to take hard decisions right you had to cut costs you had to you know downsize what you were doing inside the Dow as many centralized companies were doing as well the biggest difference of course with with Dallas what all of this was happening in an in an open space um and this really kind of like heightened the focus on dials I think there's other reasons as well we've seen uh like an increased regulatory pressure as well which you know some Protocols are trying to speed up that decentralization a bit or at least have a bigger focus on it um because of this as well so today we see there's like over 20 dials with over 500 million in tvl that are progressively trying to decentralize we have four dials with over one billion dollar in treasuries and this is current numbers so we we still see a lot of uh Capital inside kind of like what can be spent on not just governance but as a doubt budget in total but of course as a Dao has a big budget they need to create Frameworks and processes of how to actually be able to allocate this we see over 30 dollars a day with 50 million dollar plus and treasuries and the spending just in the first half of 2023 we see like the top three D5 protocols spending an average and 1.2 million dollars on on specifically governance so we see like even though you know a lot of the market is down we actually see like a pretty big increase in growth in the specific governance vertical of the space I think another thing we've also seen is that you know like a lot of the l2s that are coming in in contrast to the the l1s are actually deciding to opt in for kind of like early stage protocol governance as they as they launch so the current landscape right now is that like the most activities happening within D5 um we see some activity within the nft in the gaming space I personally believe that this is a vertical we'll see grow a lot um I've been involved in especially like The Gaming Community since the early days of of web3 gaming um and it kind of like feels like they're like a couple of years behind D5 if you look at kind of like where the the the growth trajectories took off it was around two years after after D5 really kicked off um so like nfts and gaming is something I definitely believe will see like a lot more in right now I would say there's like only like a couple like eluvium and also apecoin uh that that has like a pretty big Focus there um ill ones we still see very low kind of like uh like governance maturity within the the blockchain or like the L1 space whereas we're actually seeing like the l2s taking like a much more like aggressive approach with both you know teams such as like optimism arbitrum and also Stark net really pushing kind of like governance Frameworks from almost from the get-go ride they want to establish processes they want to build out these um especially like grants programs where they're trying to allocate their resources um but still yeah the majority of of the governor's activities happening within uh the the D5 vertical of the of the space um one of the main problems is is voter apathy um I think like the most like successful model we've seen is kind of like the the rise of the delegates um if you've got just go like a couple of years back the only protocol that really had any like meshable success around like you know delegates participating uh was probably maker but today we see like almost every single project that actually has like I wouldn't say a thriving governance ecosystem but at least like a more like well-oiled or like more ambitious governance ecosystem has delegates we see like really big impact if you look at like the beginning of like the governance of these projects and then until like they actually have like a well-functioned delegate system I think to give like two examples we have like for example Mark seller who previously worked under the other Foundation moved out and started the other child initiative um since uh he started the the amount of proposals has increased around tenfold for arba um you can then you know argue whether it's good to just have more and more proposals coming in we of course want to make sure it's the right proposals but it is like the increased level of like uh activity and also like the ability to actually execute on that activity is definitely like a quite positive metric we've also seen one inch for example where when when we started there where there was like really no delegate activity they've had around like two proposals in the kind of like the the month the quarter prior to to us joining and now a place like Arvis it's around 15 to 20 proposals per quarter so like getting like delegates and especially you know kind of like what the delegate in tiles is like to get actually like a committed governance participant if you're just relying on like Community participation it's really really difficult to get kind of like committed people um then there's also another thing which is you know I've mentioned this before in previous talks but there's really like no correlation between people who holds the token and people who want to do governance so really kind of like whenever we look at like governance systems you kind of have to make the assumption that like people who hold your token they do not want to participate that's like pretty pretty kind of clearly clearly proven now uh this is also like one of the reasons why we see like less than 10 of the circulating Supply actually voting uh off that 10 that actually votes um it's typically majority is coming from delegates and sometimes team members um but but really like you know you and especially also like if you uh we talk with some of the the earlier projects like starting out this journey and they also have this perception that like oh like our investors like our VCS will participate like they will not like none of the VCS really participate uh on very rare occasions they do uh but you really want to have like committed like governance participation then you should look like elsewhere um another thing which also this is kind of like rise in in like the the delegate part of the space has has created is the the establishment of professional delegate organizations you know which we also are ourselves um we also see some of the others like gfx flip side llama where you basically have teams where rather than just being like an individual you bring together a team who has like a different skill set who can really like contribute on like a much broader angle of the dial and kind of like tries to create at least a business around it and this is all kind of resulted like a pretty big like activity increase across the board so like the the rise of like governance participation like prior to kind of like the bear mugger kicking off and like the rise of these like especially like professional delegate organizations in contrast today has also increased manifold um another thing that we have experienced a lot inside the daos is kind of like another one of these uh yeah you can call them trilemmas um where basically um we see like there's like a really big difference between what the contributors of the dial wants so this is often like the delegates the governance participants uh people often who are like appointed by the foundation to run or like at least like try to grow the the governance operations then that's what the foundation wants and then that's what the community wants so especially like between like the foundation and the Dow contributors we often see like a lot of friction that's kind of like you know where the foundations want to take the project and then there's where like the Dow actually thinks it should be taken um also about like what the the that our contributors thinks that the scope for what they should be paying for for example um so we sometimes see you know kind of like proposals coming from the foundation um or from teams that are very aligned with the foundation coming in and like the dial contributors being like you know what is this really like should we really be paying for this uh there was also the pretty uh yeah I would say like famous example that happened with with arbitrum Foundation where they kind of like had um already taken a really big budget where the Dow was like when it came like hey like is this really what we should be paying for uh so kind of like the Assumption from the foundation is often that like the Dow treasury is something that they quite easily can like access and distribute to what they want but especially once you start having a little bit more activity in the Dow creating like its own culture and understanding of what they should be doing um this this friction can kind of like arise then you have the community the community often displays itself as like you know someone just coming in and making like a single Forum post or like a single like sharp comment about something that is being proposed in there so it's like a little bit more sporadic it's not like a constant friction but it happens like a little bit more sporadic but again there's kind of like often like a lack of alignment between like what the community you know might want to like have from the dial compared to what the dial itself thinks that it should be be pushing um we're doing right now quite a lot of work around Dow constitutions and scoping um I think this is like one of the key elements that we have been lacking um before and also like what I believe kind of like in the end ended up triggering the maker End Game Plan uh the mega end game plan was basically uh this kind of like very big change to to make her I'll go a little bit more into it later as well but basically you know when like maker didn't have a scope before right Mega just said weird dial and everything is possible you can basically do everything you want um this resulted in too much stuff happening uh just created like a lot of operational friction uh you know even if you're on board something which you know seamlessly seemed you know seamless seemingly uh is kind of like some low effort activity for the dial it's still new stuff you need to vote on it's new stuff you need to pay attention to it's Focus that it's taking away from the core contributors so like right now we're really making like a bigger push for trying to create more like structured and and clear understandings of what the actual scope for the dials are so we can you know kind of like make sure that you're like have an understanding that like you know this is what we will be paying for this is what we're responsible for so anything that kind of like Falls outside of that scope we actually don't want to be governing that um you can say a little bit the same with like you know politics it's not like the government should be governing everything right if you make a comparison to maker you could also say that like you know us governing things such as throwing parties or you know creating swags for conferences is maybe something that should fall outside of the scope of what the Dow should actually be paying for right and also governing um another thing we've seen a lot is that there's some of these like more like formal standards that are starting to uh materialize within the protocols um kind of like through this like gradual decentralization Journey a lot of people are taking like a more like structure like centralized approach in the beginning where you use a lot of like councils committees and working groups to execute like certain actions um I think also like with the counseling committee model it kind of goes back to what I mentioned before is that like you're basically creating this like not just in some cases like has a small compensation but you're creating this kind of like social responsibility for the people joining a council right like compared to if you just hold the token you don't feel a lot of responsibility necessarily for like participating in things or voting even if you're just like a normal delegate I would say like not a recognized delegate you still don't have this kind of like social contract of you actually taking on the responsibility but you know if you join a council or if you join a committee then all of a sudden you yourself accepted the responsibility of what it is that you're supposed to do so we've seen like yeah like the counseling committee structures be something that like the dials are like trying to implement to really be able to facilitate this kind of like um like stronger commitment to actually executing and doing the work for the Dallas um then the next point is kind of like this Step Above just normal delegates but which is you know recognized delegates um again here we see a a pretty big difference between people who are just the delegate and the people who are recognized delegate it might seem like a a very small change you know almost just like a small formality that you know you have to make an application and you have to get voted in but again it creates this kind of like strong social contract that you've actually accepted the full responsibility of what it means to be a delegate so compared to you know I think we we saw like some of the the l2s they kind of use this you know claim your ad drop you have to do a forced delegation it was very popular for like a lot of people to say oh I'm a delegate now um but like afterwards you kind of got stuck in this situation that these a lot of these people you know maybe in the moment thought oh well it's pretty cool to kind of like get like a lot of people to delegate the ad up to me but then when it actually came to like executing the work um I wouldn't say everyone there's definitely some who stepped up uh but there's there's definitely like a pretty big lag between like what you want people to actually achieve with being a delegate and then to what we saw some of these individuals actually be doing um we're also seeing a pretty big increase in governance compensation um you know I think for like a long time the dials were very happy to spend a lot of money on getting the best talent within all the fields of the dial so one of the best tech people one of the best BD people in marketing you wanted to do big campaigns you want to give grants to Smart teams but then when it came to governance which is you know actively one of like the the cornerstones of actually being able to facilitate any of this compensation was lacking for like a long time this is something that's changing now and I think also like over time we will see that you know the the top protocols that really wants the best talent within governance as well they will be able to attract the best delegates the best you know people who set some various committees councils the Specialists from the ones who you know arguably you know is like lacking a little bit on the compensation so similar to how we have kind of like this like market for for General Talent within the web three space you know where companies and Dows are poaching the best talent from each other we'll be seeing the same on the governance side um then there's also this kind of like whole problem about like you know what if we do like a lot of things that you know doesn't work um this is something we don't really we haven't really seen it that much yet I think uh you know something I'm really excited about I'm also mentioning this in a later slide about the things I'm looking forward to uh it's basically like we're seeing like now maker going through this end game plan basically saying okay all this stuff we did before didn't work so let's try something completely new so it's like it would be like the first time where we see a major uh protocol um you can argue whether Mega dollar is a mature Dao or governance system or not but like let's just for for the the sake of this conversation say that they are one of the more mature um they're kind of like revamping the entire government system from scratch so this is something that you know I also speculate that we will see like more in the future basically like dials ending up in a situation where they can like have trapped themselves in and and like dial operational model that simply doesn't work and therefore have to do things completely over um some of the main problems we have I'll talk a little bit about like the the triangle before so there's like the alignment between the different stakeholders inside the down there's the participation aspect the voter apathy again how to actually get dedicated people to participate um and like of course like you know in some of the systems we are we're maybe you know like five or six dedicated participants clearly not enough so again you're also one of my kind of like over time at least make sure that you have more than just like a handful of people participating then there's the the resource allocation for the dial uh I think this is right now one of the the main things that we're dealing with we see a lot of the dials kind of like building the entire like like governance model around grants allocation and treasury management um so how to actually like make sure you get like the the right resources inside the dial you could say to execute what it is you want uh then there's like the clarity what is it that you actually should be doing the direction whereas that you want to be going towards uh is another thing we want to try to work with this in in what also mentioned with the Constitutional work but like most of the dials today they they maybe start out you know thinking oh like we we want to go towards decentralization right but like what does that even look like I don't really believe that a lot of us know this right now um and uh of course this is also try taking like my last point which is Success right have you really seen any like protocol governance being widely successful for me personally I think like one of the places where I see um maybe like the the kind of most well-functioning governance at least with the scope of it is a place like curve you know where you have like just pure economic mechanisms driving the governance there's no real need for like discussions there's no real need for like a lot of topics uh to be debated or people to be executing things you're based it just like having people uh you know using their current voting power or in other cases selling it to other people to basically uh you know move the emissions around so I guess like at that in a pro in a place like curve you know we're kind of like removing the human element from it which might be why it works a little bit better um then we've seen like a lot of teams kind of trying to solve governance as a technical problem there's so much Dow tooling being built so many different things out there that can give you insights or help you vote or you can set up a Dao in two transactions and all of this stuff what most of them are lacking is just that governance is not a technical problem it's an organizational problem it's an operational problem so to really solve kind of like governance today we need a much bigger focus on the operations we cannot continue to think we can just throw more technology at it and then it will kind of like solve itself over time this will just not happen um so okay some of the things for for like the the younger protocols um there's kind of like just like a deer you know like build it and you know they will come like this will just like not happen you really need to be very proactive in getting governance participants you need to talk with your community you need to talk with people you want to have coming in you need to create this kind of like relationship with them where they actually will be a dedicated right so this is a lot about being proactive um not saying that you should steer the entire process but you should really try to to kind of like Get get the the right people coming in you also need to be very realistic about like where you are I think like a lot of projects and doubts you know they kind of like you know overshoot a little bit their their capabilities or you know like uh what they're able to do so yeah like be like very realistic about it and then the participants they really matter a lot um and then yeah you know like the the Dao you want and the Dow you'll get is often very very two different things um so it's also not something that you can just kind of like initiate you need to like constantly uh work on actually setting setting it up [Music] um yeah I have very little time left so I'm just quickly gonna go through like the last like two slides some of the things I'm excited about they make your endgame plan I'm also really excited about some of these newer projects that are taking like a more like governance agnostic approach like Anya is a it's a novel device setup uh boring a lending Market uh no governance no oracles so there you can create governance mechanisms around other things but you can kind of like have a protocol that works with like a governance mineralization and then we also just see a lot of growth around dials moving towards decentralization so like in the coming years we'll really see like so many advancements and so many good things happening within the Dow space um yeah so if you want to get in touch with us uh our website is here my email is here Twitter um we are actually right now looking for new delegates to join our our delegate team so if you want to come in and join the market leader within the active Governor's participation feel free to reach out to us um and yeah thank you so much for joining today [Applause] yeah sorry because of the small delay we have no time for the questions yeah thank you [Music] thank you [Music]
