hello everyone since thanks for being here today for the first uh for the first time at the sec um we have organized uh like a complete legal track to address uh the main legal uh legal challenge and legal issues that uh the so we will be together uh all this morning until half past 12 until the lunch and um and we will have the pleasure to welcome i mean a lot of legal experts from all around the world and also each time we will we will have also a project like builder will come from the product the idea is to it's really to share and to share the view and to show the feeling about regulation um rejection about the legal track because what the legal challenge uh the crypto uh so i hope that was not so not so wild so thank you to be here sorry actually uh industry and this regulation is it is very interesting it's all the regulation waves come during actually the market and the crypto winter and uh what what we should stress out is that the crypto ranger or the bear marquez uh actually fuel the the regulatory activity uh we saw uh quite recently the last maybe one or two years we saw the rise of a global stable coin which way is actually a very strong and very interesting political and legal challenge especially if you try to do not have the view of the people here are i think really like crypto and tech savvy but if you understand the regulator and actually the rest of the world on stable coin so it's something we will address today um the other very strong phenomena that that fuels regulations we see like uh an unbelievable massification of the crypto and the crypto has arrived in the in the in the retail market um i just i i will just give you one one one figures about only the french market but we have the studio for all the european market and probably uh uh um everywhere in the world uh there is a racing studio from kpmg in france who show that seven percent of the french citizens the french euros have uh have crypto it's absolutely massive it's something like comparable to the people who have stocks directly and it's not uh not true like a return plan and so on so the the the consequences of this is that crypto and d5 is not an issue it's not something like like like something secret around a bunch of geek it's becoming something something at the level of the regulation at the level of the states so that's why the regulation is coming so quickly and the last uh very strong very strong things we have witnessed like quite we have uh we have witnessed that the uh unfortunately unfortunately it was it was very very predictable actually the industry is not able to regret itself we saw that of course defy defense if i i'm not in the same bag but anyway in the eyes of the regulator and the eyes of the of the of all the other people who are not in this building today like the crypto industry have made people lost some money and that the only thing the regulators uh is able to look at this point so we'll talk about this in detail during the the next three hours but this this three um these three phenomena have two has to be keep in mind regarding the legal track it's it's uh it's a it's a very simple um it's a very simple india last year um like there was a very brilliant legal talk we were disseminated in all the track around the otc some of the people who will be there for some of the people from last year will be there to today of course so the idea and the idea is just to gather these people so to have something like more may be true with other legal challenges that can be addressed and also of course to uh to share the view so that's why we have uh we have we have uh we have organized a succession of panel to to let to to allow uh to allow uh like like like yeah sharing between project and legal expert and between different legal experts from different places of the world all speakers today are very knowledgeable about tech they are very knowledgeable about law and they're king like daily basis with builders so of course i would like to thank them for their participation and we are very glad to have them today and i will continue to ask you everything you need to know about the regulation because we will try of course to have a to accept as many as questions as possible from the from the room i will i will i will i want to end this presentation like a positive note uh regulation it's a very anxious topic on the crypto industry most of the people i i see in the crypto industry and especially on d5 because it's a little bit less regulated that uh for instance the exchange of the c5 players so this legal track we want to to give you like a very distressing uh distressing message which we will try to be positive because two things first of all you will see that there is a lot of people like i saw in arabic that are just here that was very brilliant and they are working to industrialize innovation and evolution so you are not alone and uh and the other thing is it's just it's not like uh the end of something we have maybe it's maybe the end of the i don't know the first era of the of the of the of the crypto like the so-called jungle but now the the view of the game are just changing and how good is this legal track is to answer your question about this new game rules and give you maybe some advice to uh to play with with the new rules that that arrive and that will be in place in the next next maybe 12 to 2 to 24 months so we'll try today to push forward this idea and i will say thank you for for being here and thank you to all the speakers [Applause] maybe maybe if some of you have some questions at this stage or if you don't any uh
