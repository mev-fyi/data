okay hello everybody nice to meet you guys bonjour my name is michael labraja i'm here with the tigar art collective and um i'll be speaking on how the web3 community can help humanitarian crisis in africa so for uh past 600 days over 500 000 people have passed away uh due to a genocide occurring in 2022 currently the u.n the united states and europe have often have remained relatively silent while discussing and releasing press releases consistently about statements of urgent attention and action need china uae turkey and saudi arabia have have played a role and provided drones weapons and other means of support to to support this conflict and you you have to ask like why so you can take a guess about what i'm talking about and uh unfortunately you probably won't guess i'm not talking about ukraine i'm talking about tigarai and tugarai is the northern state of ethiopia the conflict in ukraine began in late february 2022 while the this genocidal war in ethiopia began november of 2020. so you gotta ask why is there war so ethiopia has an ethnic federalistic federalism resulting in different states due to ethnic divisions but it has those individual states have their own local government while parallel to the federal government working together so each ethnic group has its representation in the national parliament historically uh the leaders of tegra have been in power of ethiopia within the last two decades and that power and they have been blamed for for corruption and human rights abuses previously to this war so um the current prime minister um was recently awarded the nobel peace prize in 2019 by opening the borders between ethiopia and eritrea so a little history eritrea was once a part of ethiopia but there was a civil war in the late 90s that led to a a divide so the current prime minister won a nobel peace prize by unifying and opening the borders between ethiopia and eritrea which hasn't happened for over 25 years so this was a major step and a shift in the change of hands and with forgiveness in the air ethiopians were promised a very peaceful future so unfortunately the prime minister of abi abihamad chose to curate a plot to seek justice from the previous leaders of tigarai alongside the eritrean president isaiah salforke who has a grudge of against the people of togar because of the conflict that occurred in the late 90s that led them to have independence so in november 2020 the government ethiopia began attacking and blockading the tegra region and demanded the imprisonment of the leaders of the tplf so what was the greater impact currently ethnic tensions at our all-time high resulting in racial segregations of to grinds all over ethiopia not just integrai many people of tigra have been removed from their jobs regardless of where they are in ethiopia interrogated at work arrested and or detained for their identity and killed just for their identity in many regions of ethiopia here on the left you see an image of young men and children being rallied up and being well you don't see it but they're being arrested and eventually this clip is them getting thrown off a cliff and shot the picture to the right is um them burning people alive unfortunately and i i didn't want to play any videos because i just a little um vulgar and um hard to watch so as a result there's a humanitarian blockade for the 116th for more than 600 days the ethiopian government has systematically destroyed the infrastructure of tagray all hospitals cannot function in full capacity electricity and telecommunications have been completely blocked off and shut off and worst of all ninety percent of food aid has that is needed has been blocked for 600 days so that's 18 months so global awareness the international community has remained vocal without any action and any accountability therefore words without action has led to the starvation of thousands of people here's an article the united nations has released urging them to do action and pushing the government to do a ceasefire here's another article al jazeera has released hundreds of aid trucks have failed to return from tigarai for them to be refilled and driven back into the region on the right the pope vatican has appealed for the end of violence in the region of tegra because outside of the unhcr and the un the catholic relief services is the only other aid program that provides aid to ethiopia so when it comes to global awareness the africa community the african community has shown support to the government to end the conflict but has remained silent when asked about human rights abuses in the and the violations at the hand of ethiopian government so another thing that people don't know is that the african union hq is in ethiopia so african leaders it's really hard for them to say something because when they are in the african union for these assemblies they are in the country where these atrocities are occurring mind you no one has access to tigray all the borders are blocked people from i cannot go home from anywhere in the world so currently ethiopia is in turmoil so we must ask what other what are other ethiopians saying about this conflict since tagurai is one of the smallest populations in ethiopia this war has divided the people like i said earlier ethnic tensions at our all-time high so majority of ethiopians are supporting the government and what i mean by that is this they're supporting the isolation of to grinds in ethiopia and outside of ethiopia what i mean by that is they have labeled to grinds who are pleading for the war to end right because mind you the tegran regional government is fighting against the government of ethiopia so there is a conflict right they're not just attacking civilians they are fighting against to grind civilians and their local militia so to grinds who are pleading for peace are being labeled as people that are supporting terrorists such as myself on twitter on social media and instagram i get antagonized all the time for my advocacy that i'm doing all over the world and ethiopians have curated counter protest movements against what our message and our narrative of china either when it comes to raising awareness providing to our twitter campaigns or even our protests so they are spreading a narrative that what we are saying is not true or it's fake news and as you see in that image there's ethiopians and eritreans together protesting saying that bbc is spreading fake news about ethiopia so just imagine while we're protesting about stopping famine and stopping drone strikes on civilians people that we considered family brothers sisters neighbors cousins are saying that what we're experiencing is fake and it's a complete lie mind you our population to grinds in ethiopia is about six million people while the ethiopian population is the second largest country in africa of 110 million people so we're a minority amongst people that are telling us our what is occurring is a lie so is the crypto community aware about what's going on yes and no cardano founder charles hoskins has striked a partnership with the ethiopian government in 2021 so for someone who is an advocate for human rights an advocate of democracy and decentralization right has partnered with a government who is actively killing and starving its own people so major players in the crypto space are very much aware and have said nothing because they don't want to ruin their relationship with a government right or or the people he is working with have convinced them otherwise of this war being justified and or you know not to the extent of what is actually happening with this humanitarian crisis another example is jack dorsey founder of twitter and also major bitcoin advocate who has been lobbying significantly and working with startups in ethiopia since 2018 before the conflict to embrace bitcoin adoption in ethiopia right i have no problem with jack dorsey but this is what i have a problem with the fact that you are still silent and working alongside a government that is actively committing genocide currently and i don't know if you guys were aware but in the summer of 2021 during the olympics a lot of people saw eath trending due to him tweeting about it people thought he was supporting the ethiopian ethiopian athletes during the olympics but in fact he was just trolling the ethereum community most people you know whether he took it or not that's what it really was so eth with the ethiopian flag was trending for about a month or two me seeing this i was thinking oh maybe people are aware about what's going on and you know maybe this is a plea to kind of raise awareness about what's going on but in reality look what you see right and in june of 21 he is tweeting saying hashtag bitcoin in ethiopia about a project being released a partnership with the ethiopian government so is this ignorance or is this you know selective activism or is this racism you know not saying he's racist but just in general right i mean it is really unfortunate but this is what is this is what is happening and how could we change this narrative how can we educate and help people right how can we kind of stir up not just awareness but action so um in march vitalik tweeted ukrainians are far from the only one suffering of war also people in yemen and ethiopia are just as human as ukrainians and as you are this is not a valid excuse to not care about ukrainians today but it does mean that we should self-reflect and extend our compassion to others too so you know vitalik notable leader of ethereum has made a statement and you know i would like to you know make this statement as well to not just our community but to the greater world is how can we all come together and help so how can the crypto community help crowdfunding and to push aid into refugee camps in sudan and eventually into tigarai so currently people that are to grind that are actively fundraising and helping out the only way we can help is by sending money and sending aid to the refugee camps about 600 000 people have fled north because the guys on the northern border of ethiopia fled north to sudan so that only way we have access to people is to sudan everybody else integra our mothers our cousins our grandmothers we have no access to no communication no telephone no electricity so the only way we can help right now is at refugee camps and eventually when the borders open up we can help out so another thing we can do is help raise awareness using influences in the crypto space and beyond right notable leaders of having discussions maybe even virtual conferences to kind of get the word out and working with different organizations to kind of you know use funding in a different way another way we can use fund is to get the message to politicians and key figures to help food aid and get into idp camps in ethiopia so what i mean by that is for for an example this week earlier yesterday the u.s government passed a bill saying that the use of food insecurity as a method of war is going to be deemed illegal and ironically you know they are very much aware about what's going on right and there are other bills being trying to be pushed for the american government to push actually put troops onto the into ethiopian soil and like basically stop this from happening and opening the borders by force but since ethiopia has very close relationship with the american government it's very hard for them to enforce that without stepping on you know anybody's toes so this is a very subtle political move of them attempting to do that but why do we have to wait why do we have to wait to feed people why do we have to wait to give people medicine and our community can help another thing that we can do is generate a campaign around nfts for good to continue the global mission so various blockchain organizations provide a hand by distributing emergency grants for displaced refugees as you all know there are many many different types of grant programs you know we've applied to them but and it's kind of hard to get people's attention until you know you get a stage and a platform like this to kind of speak in front of people um another thing that we can do which we already have been doing is educational grants that can be deployed [Music] so basically since this war has been going on for 18 months all the children that are refugees haven't been out of school for two years right so uh we are sending raspberry pies to fuel education remotely with services such as internet in a box and what internet boxes you basically get a raspberry pi you download a whole bunch of content onto it and you know basically you can have access to that content uh without having the internet um as long as you have a monitor you just plug it in and you have a generator and you can you know as long as you have electricity you can have a classroom and you can be teaching another thing is due to identity crisis created by displacement we can use the new soul-bound token standard to provide refugees the opportunity to have a digital identity right so moving forward we can implement a lot of these new features that we have within the space when it comes to the wallets and um you know basically like improving identity we can test those things on refugees and people that are displaced actually need those services right and to continue our long-term plan would be funding and educating and creating banking solutions for those um and eventually you know create a dao to help you know the create the sustainability of tegra uh whether tegra becomes its own country or you know or it stays a part of ethiopia we need to rebuild what what is destroyed you know the infrastructure mind you again hospitals destroyed the banks have been shut off no electricity no food aid getting in people are starving you know business has been destroyed bombs have been air strikes have been all over major cities and to grind nowhere else in ethiopia but in the region of tigrad so we have to garner not just our attention but our energy to rebuild systematically what has been completely destroyed and a lot of global leaders and influencers have spoken out and even donated money as you see a picture of the weekend who was also ethiopian but he's not to grind but he knows that it is the right thing to do he's donated over two million dollars but that money he's donated has not gotten there because of this block hit right so it's like all right even when people are trying to do something positive it's being blocked right so i don't know if you guys are familiar i mean a lot of people in this room seem a little older but back in the 90s late 80s michael jackson and a whole bunch of other artists created the we are the world campaign to you know created a song and all that money they partnered with usaa usa africa to help feed people and guess where it was in ethiopia why there was a drought but that's not why they needed to create a campaign that's not why there was a famine in late 90s or eight late 80s into the 90s there was a war in tugrad right and guess what the government was doing blockading and preventing aid in the midst of a drought one million people died then and now we're facing the same thing so how can we prevent that is creating another global campaign getting a group of really famous artists to kind of take the stage and do a music festival recreate a song whatever it's going to take for the world to pay attention you know is what we have to do so our end goal is to partner up with major crypto organizations you know host music festivals maybe conferences to educate people and help what's going on and increase global awareness you know i i truly believe that with the the the advocacy and the um the awareness that the crypto community has when it comes to being empathetic towards going on um we can really make a big impact so um to wrap it up our first steps that we've made is we created an art collective uh called to grind art collective it's our twitter that's our ether address and that's our instagram check us out it's a group of artists from all over the world and we actually have a gallery around the corner about 10 minutes away from here we're going to be open today tomorrow and also saturday check it out it's open gallery we have prints nfts and then also original pieces from the artist those are the two founders uh gabrielle and mahadi and i'm the nft expert on the team and last thing i want to say is i really want y'all i'm a big dragon ball z fan but the reason why i put this up here is um if you guys are familiar with dragon ball z the only way goku could have ever defeated frieza is the energy of the world the people that came together and gave him his energy and that's how i feel right now i feel like goku uh moving around trying to get people to give me the energy to give me their blessing to give me some sort of positivity to help me push this message and help save people my people of took her eye so thank you for thank you for the time thank you for this opportunity i really appreciate it [Applause]
