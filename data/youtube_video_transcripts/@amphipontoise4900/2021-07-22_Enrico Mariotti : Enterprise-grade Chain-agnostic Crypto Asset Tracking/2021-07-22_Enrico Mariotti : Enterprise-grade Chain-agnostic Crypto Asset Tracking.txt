[Music] hello welcome in the afternoon uh my name is uh michael uh there is enrico we are co-founders of skytel which is quite fresh ventures from berlin germany started in december last year so um if you are coming from crypto first of blockchain first companies you know that there is a lot of problems when we need to deal with the crypto assets especially on operational and daily basis because simply you still need to work with different tools and different platforms and exactly this is the problem because you need to spend a lot of time in manual transactions how to consolidate them from enterprise point of view how to prepare them for example for tax reporting and auditing proposes uh there is a problem that when dealing also with different pro different like for example wall addresses etc there is a huge opportunity to make mistakes or fraud so this is also something we are addressing with skytell so what is skytel skytel is a business analytics platform for companies to deal with the digital encrypt assets first of all we try to combine uh a tracking tool uh where you can simply under just one roof uh see all your crypto holdings from different sources like crypto exchanges uh called hold wallets d5 protocols mine liquidity farms etc we combine these also with a classification and categorization engine which practically do automatization of some of the works for example it classifies in automatic way different type of transactions but at the same time you can manually add different labels to transactions so for in the future it's very easy from anybody from a company just to find our identified transaction at the same time this is powered by enterprise great security and with powerful business analytics so what are the futures and benefits for for companies who are dealing with crypto assets as i mentioned first of all uh you have a one-stop shop under which you see all your company holdings all your company transactions uh we we really ingest the data from different crypto exchanges uh for now we have up to 12 top crypto exchanges integrated we also ingest data from decentralized exchanges d5 protocols and also of course from golden hot wallet then you have this classification engine it is a possibility that you simply imagine a search engine which is really enabled to you to find a transaction based on some parameters you define this is partially done by machine learning algorithm so you can definitely already have a list of transaction based on some category but also you can manually add some labels to transactions for example this was the invoice space to my supplier you can also attach the file so it's very easy when you will be exporting this data for example for for accounting or tax purposes we prepare also the way how to integrate to most popular bookkeeping tools like for example uh quickbooks and xero we are working on some others also in europe like dative in germany so you really spend a lot of time uh you save a lot of time uh instead of really consolidating clearing the transactions so uh even like your accountant or cfo and your company has no clue about the crypto can simply you know just click on one button export all this data directly to your bookkeeping tool the last one uh the data analytics uh part or layer so you will have a dashboard where you can also again based on some parameters check and see all your company holdings uh your history what did you do based on some parameters like for example the data source different different different time period etc so which kind of market we are addressing we are addressing uh the market of all the crypto assets under management so of course in the in the a couple of months ago was more than 2 trillion from that based on our experience we believe that almost 200 billions are spending on operations from crypto and blockchain companies uh and this is a global market so we mainly focus on eu uk and switzerland because we believe that this is especially geographies where all the major part of customer segments are coming from because our ideal customers are coming from crypto blockchain space so they're normally the adapts layer for developers they're also the blockchain companies because they are really dealing with a lot of transactions on daily basis imagine for example like airdrops they are distributing imaging like the salaries they are paying to their people every month etc but also of course some some first and yearly investors small investors in crypto and now right now there is an opportunity especially in germany which is fresh like uh from 1st of july there is the special funds so call institutional funds who can enable to spend up to 20 of asset and management they can invest in crypto so the product roadmap this will be explained to you by enrico yeah in the very beginning of this year q1 we built a safecast dewalter integrated with powered by ethereum uh offering a first restful api uh however i mean we delivered the first proof of concept in march then we started talking with uh customers and during the customer discovery that we realized that the most important thing for them wasn't yet another self-custody wallet in the market was more about hey how can i track all my accounts in a single consolidated view that's the reason why we uh slightly uh tweaked uh shifted our uh value proposition to offer more uh tracking tool for external wallets how well basically um we delivered the very first mvp uh in april may uh integrating with the most important exchanges so we integrated with up to 12 exchanges think about coinbase binance kraken and in the meantime we continue supporting of course ethereum at the end of q2 we were able also to support polygon and what is going next the plan is to launch in the very first in the in the next week's integration with binances machine phantom and we are already able to track a specific transaction related to defy think about how to add liquidity remove liquidity staking yielding farming landing borrowing so all the information related to defy farms and pools because the and the end goal of the ultimate vision is that to offer a search engine a classification engine a filter engine able to classify on the fly and offer a consolidated view of a specific wallet um filter by for example a network or a specific crypto activities think about hey give me all the uh the other liquidity uh requests regardless the network so think about uh querying across all the networks supported by us in a single view you can you could see all the other transactions and then you can export in a csv file or import into quickbooks q4 will be the turn of more research and development the ambition is to build the classification engine as i was saying by identifying and classifying on the fly any possible transaction think about how many are drops we daily receive not requested by us so how to identify a possible scam or how to address a transaction to a specific department for example having a contact list how can i address a specific transaction to a specific category think about transactions for leisure for traveling and so on of course we are not the only one playing in this game there are other players we in the very beginning we took inspiration from multis which is a pretty famous critical banker here in france also there is a gilded in north america crypto and and more well we believe that uh we are in a strong position compared with our competitors mainly because the very first important thing we offer an api we offer a restful api that means we have a revenue stream more than our competitors so proposing ourself as a white label solution that means that this is not just a solution for b2b this is also a solution for b2b to see market that that means a product company can offer our solution to their end user integrating seamless with us offering a solution to the end user without leaving their platform what will come next next year we will support a payment workflow think about uh sending a transaction sending a transaction for a company is still a pain because of who's going to validate a transaction before being fired across the network or how can i send in a single shot a transaction to multiple recipients think about token distribution and of course we will also support more and more defy services next year uh going in deep in the technical side in the architecture this is the way that we structure our back end basically our middleware is already integrated uh with an exchange connector able to communicate with up to 12 uh centralized exchanges and we also built a chain explorer able to um ingest data from any possible network so far we support ethereum polygon next couple of weeks we will launch a binance machine the ambition is by the end of the year to support 25 chains blockchain different blockchain in the network storing all of those transactions into our internal persistent cache our transaction storage and fetching data querying data from our storage that means in a millisecond we will allow our user to see their transaction filter by any possible query parameter um very important um in order to speed up our development fees i mean we started only six months ago in order to to speed up our development fees that we integrated with magic link which offer a password-less authentication service that means uh without typing any password our user can sign up login and authenticate through their email account going in deep in our api we offer an api for transaction but also for aggregated balances that means this is the very first step for a pivot table think about a pivot table how could be possible to cluster a transaction filter by a specific query parameter and then how to cluster those transactions into balances divided by different tokens you see here synthetics value of ether and bitcoin here you see a quick overview of our demo and here you can see a live demo this is our mvp we are already able to fetch data from polygon ethereum uh three different exchanges and we also did the very first step into defy we are really able to detect any other liquidity uh requested to sushi swap and to quick swap as i was saying this is just the beginning for us we have a curated list of a possible decentralized exchanges as i was saying sushi swap quick swap farms and pools so in a matter of days we will be able to launch multiple decks integration farms pools integrated with the network the networks we support what you see here is just a flat list however the plan in the next future is to offer a real search engine to our end user by defining specific parameters they could for example isolate a search only for a specific defy action think about all the transaction related to seeking or to landing on to borrowing regardless the network and the pharma and then we allow already allow the user to calculate their taxes through the integration with quickbooks and also the opportunity to download all of this transaction in a csv file importing it into a spreadsheet uh this is the next step our research and development phase in q4 we will be much more focused on building a classification engine able to classify and deflect any possible transaction as i was saying addressing a specific transaction to a relevant team a department or identify a possible scam also identify the possible risk score of any token on top of that the ambition next year is to build a real recommendation engine also to recommend the user for a specific investment instead of another um on top of that the ambition is to have ultimate goal as a strategy engine uh able to offer different strategies uh for example more aggressive versus a more uh conservative strategy on what to invest our meta search engine is connected to the exchange connector i was showing earlier and with the chain connector able to fetch data from any blockchain this is the team i'm enrico um coordinated up to 35 engineers 10 different verticals 20 years of experience in the engineering field uh very recently i was a vp of engineering at upvesta blockchain company in berlin and yeah and this is me michael i'm also more than five years in the blockchain space i was head of innovation at a decent group which was a number six ico back in 2016. we have also the team of our developers and we are supported by venture startup studio called next big think from berlin of course our team is also growing so we're also looking for talents here we're also looking for business partners who are interested to integrate and to better test our platform which is real life and definitely we are happy to talk to you here also the discord channel you can definitely join uh where we can have a much more detailed discussion also a link to our website yeah thank you for attention very happy to reply if you have still some time for questions any questions adapt okay or if not thank you very much [Applause] next big
