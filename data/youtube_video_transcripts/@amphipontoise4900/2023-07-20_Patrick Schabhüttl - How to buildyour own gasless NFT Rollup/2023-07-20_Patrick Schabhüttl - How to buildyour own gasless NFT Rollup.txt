[Music] thank you [Music] hey everyone nice to meet y'all um I'm Patrick from gelato and today I'm going to talk about how to build your own gasless nft roll up so kicking things off maybe a quick introduction I'm leading BD at gelato also doing Partnerships feel free to scan this nft where you will basically get your own sort of nft for this talk maybe as a quick intro question to all of you how many of you already did like mints their own nft already on like some sort of chain maybe quickly raise your hand okay um because I think that that's like um very important for this talk that basically sets the stage um because thinking about nfts in general and for those who of you already did go through the painful process sometimes augmenting your own nft especially on mainnet you can really see why some nft collections have some problems in like gaining mainstream adoption and two great examples for that have been like the most recent men from azuki where they basically took a haircut on like their market cap by like 50 percent um just by like creating the same sort of art for their second nft drop um and they did raise a significant amount of if with that second drop which obviously affected their user base um and the second thing that you can see here are the sort of guest statistics back when there was like the a mint from yoga Labs on the other side on Eve and there that was like on the height you had to pay for like a normal token swap on Unity free almost 4K USD to to like to a normal token swap which really basically impacted the whole chain and made it like unusable for a lot of users since they basically had to pay back at 10 1.5 feet to do like a simple transaction so the main focus points within the talk will be about like the current state of the nft markets about like the complexities of user onboarding and why so many nft projects fail especially in the upper market and then ways of how to improve that sort of user experience that we currently see within the nft market so maybe just to talk about like numbers you can see here like the average volume on marketplaces and what you can see here with this beige um but here you you can see that there are that with like the launch of blur there has been like a significant increase in volume on on nft marketplaces in general obviously they did an airdrop that impacted it but with blur we really saw a real competitor popping up to openc um and they're now having like the majority of the market share of nft volume in general and they are continuing to grow but what this really shows is nft volumes have stabilized even though a lot of people on Twitter are talking about like nfts are dead they're still like a steady influx of of new Traders and existing Traders trading their nfts which obviously results in volume that can be leveraged for a lot of projects looking more into the user experience side of things I think all of you guys are like quite aware of those sort of screens you can see that there are like a lot of problems when you do your first transaction like even before that you need to write down a seed phrase you need to remember 12 words and if you don't do that then you're basically lose all your money um and even then after you did that after you successfully created your wallet you still need to figure out like what are those sort of gas fees how do they work how do I like um submit the transaction successfully and how can I like improve to like not pay as much as as I need to but rather like just make an efficient transaction without really needing to care about gas fees so summarizing the sort of problems that generally are there within like nfts but also web free in general you can really see the problem of like self-custody of how like how we onboard users right now that they basically need to figure all of this out themselves metamask already doing a great job of onboarding their users and educating them but still it's like very clunky compared to like onboarding on within like web 2 um and then there's such a thing as if that you need like an actual token to like pay for gas fees so basically users need to figure out like how do I get Eve onto my wallet remembering when I first like made my first transaction on Eve a few years back I didn't really figure all at first like how much if I actually need will need to have for like doing a swap on uni swap so that's like something that online providers are tackling right now but that still needs to improve and then generally speaking about how to make a transaction and you also so like worrying about gas fees you you actually need to figure out how this whole like gas consumption Works how to submit a transaction and what transaction finality is and that you that your transaction can actually revert after you hit that button um as well as then obviously front running you can be exploited even though you don't know it doing a swap on uni swap you're basically get it front run especially on ethereum and other people are profiting of your like lack of knowledge at the start and as a result that basically makes or sets the stage for like web free being like right now only accessible for like a few users like in the grand scheme of things because if you really want a Target web 2 users you basically need to abstract the way all those complexities and you need to make it like easier to to onboard them but I think that the greater referium ecosystem already knows that and there's like a lot of things that are right now now in the works to create better infrastructure and create better ux to onboard the next billion users which everybody obviously wants to do um and first there's like obviously a big need for like a secure data availability layer which ethereum can provide and ethereum by far has outpaced like all the other l1s and other solutions that were on the market and we are now in the face where we see a lot of Roll-Ups um gaining market share and also exceeding ethereum in terms of daily transactions which is great because like the theory from ethereum or their tactic with like scalability through roll ups really comes to life right now and we see that with arbitrim having a very vibrant defa ecosystem by now as well as other protocols and and ecosystems really scaling ethereum as a whole and other examples include Now app chains basically with first dydx starting on a different stack but now chains that build on op stack like for example base that just announced their own determain net as well as Zora who basically build a home for nfts on top of op stack and arbitrim is working on arbitrum orbit and polygon is having their supernets Avalanche Chester subnet CK Sync has their own tax tag for app chains and that basically gives us an additional layer of scalability because apps that get too big for L2 can then scale into their own separate L2 or even their L3 depending on which Tech stack they use and we at gelato we think about it also to like how can we improve the user experience as a whole and some of our products allow you to for example have gasless transactions and we see this as like a big tendency in the future because if you're future future projects that are basically deploying on those l2s or l-3s will only pay like a fraction of the gas fees that we have today and we we're gelato what we want to do is basically abstract the way that sort of complexity from the user and rather let protocols sponsor gas fees which um in any sense doesn't really cost them that much thinking about user acquisition costs because they would probably pay 10 or 100 bucks per month on those l2s or l3s to serve gasless transactions to all their users because we're talking about an average gas fee from like probably a fraction of a cent especially for additional roll-ups and obviously another big Catalyst that is coming up with erp4844 on on ethereum basically Proto dank sharding and won't go into the weeds here because it shouldn't be too technical but basically it will allow ethereum to scale further and we will also allow to basically have higher throughput as well as lower gas fees which not just impacts ethereum but also obviously impacts the greater roll-up ecosystem that is built on top of ethereum and that will allow us to have lower gas fees overall and make like the user experience generally better but then we don't really like with lower gas fees we didn't really solve like the issue we saw before with like metamask um but we can do that with gas abstraction and what does that mean basically you can do gasless transaction that is that is an example from Phantom they're using gelato and what they basically did they integrated gelato relay to have gasless transactions and as you can see here there were like two metamask pop-ups but on none of them they actually paid gas fees they just signed something to authorize the spending that's like the first uh thing that they need to do and then they just say hey I'm okay I want to buy this nft and then gelato basically takes care of the rest and like that they just need to basically approve the payment to actually buy this nft but they never really touched the actual chain as a user so they really have like in that case they're really abstracted the way like the blockchain complexities that users normally face maybe to to quickly explain you how this works uh basically what we do is we focus on like uh decentralized back-end services and with gelato what you can do you can really think about it as a module on those chains to allow you to access automation often computation or gasless transactions and in that case that we just saw with Phantom they basically just took gasless transactions integrated that into their smart contracts and now basically users don't really need to care about those sort of low-level blockchain complexities anymore that we see in most apps today and we also do that like in a decentralized fashion obviously we're in web free we want to do that and we're then taking care of those executions on behalf of the user so users don't really need to figure out how gas fees work anymore they can really rely on gelato to take care of that in the case of Phantom and and also other Protocols are are now expanding into that Direction with the notion of something like account abstraction um as well as like with smart contract wallets there are multiple opportunities for us to improve that user experience um that basically summarizes the sort of products with off chain computation Automation and gases transactions for protocols that have already integrated gelato is like a bigger ecosystem we we have like all the cool D5 projects as well as like or including beefy maker synthetics quenter as well as gaming projects so if you're adapt developer and you want to do something like that just reach out to us on Twitter or just talk to me after the talk here and that already includes like over 400 projects so there was like a small section of the projects that actually integrated with already more than 5.1 million transactions executed on all evm chains if you're interested that's like the QR code to the website not another nft um so um yeah in case you're interested in building something similar or you're building something for the hackathon later this week uh reach out to us and we can help you uh creating a cool project yeah that's it thanks everyone [Applause] if there are any questions just like raise your hand okay awesome cool yeah that's the way to go cool thanks everybody [Music]
