foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you hello everyone I really hope you enjoyed vitalisquinoid that is very tough hack to follow but I'm going to try and today we are going to be discussing this taking economy and what do I mean by that now I'm guessing that everyone who is here and is here in this conference understand that staking is blockchain security it is a foundation of everything we are building here and everything depends on this and it's what makes it all just work but there's another side to it it is actually an economy it has a different set of actors Solutions goods and services big players small players and we are going to be talking about all of that today but first of course I need to make some introductions my name is Gabriela I do research and Analysis for ethereum at course one and course one is a professional node operator that is here in Europe and we provide infrastructure and seeking solutions for many networks including and for me most importantly ethereum so in this presentation what I'm going to try to do is follow like a linear timeline into stake in with a focus on ethereum starting from the past where it all began with proof of stake present status and a view towards the future and when I think about ethereum and the future of ethereum I don't think about it in terms of like just like the next days or the next years I'm thinking about it in the term of all the decades to come now the hard part isn't given this talk the hard part is making it last 15 minutes so let's get right into it first I want to say that human economic relationships has been based in the same basic properties all throughout history's history guarantees and obligations underline all exchanges of values so of course this idea also applies to distributed systems and digital assets and that's when we start with staking proof of six systems requires takers to lock up their phones to participate in the consensus validation it's a public service which allows them to earn rewards and the idea of staking has been around at least since 2012. with early examples such as Bitcoin it was later popularized by the tendermine white paper and of course the ethereum proof of sake idea which was already in the ethereum white paper but the reality is a proof of stake is growing very rapidly right now it represents a combined market cap of 342 billion dollars and it was clear from the start that ethereum would move to prove a stake so obviously users will want to stick and participate in security and secure in this network however there were several problems to be addressed like Capital requirements liquidity issues and all the risks that comes up with log state no native red allegation models things I could keep a very small validator set and these were very big concerns at the time that people thought that the big centralized exchanges and players would capture most of the stake in Market by the time with roles actually happen but there was something that eth had that separated from others and that's what they have separate validator key from withdrawal keys so these actions could be performed by different parties so that you needed let's say this trusted party who could be like a node operator and back then there was only one way of staking it was native staking either yourself or delegating these coins to the professional not operators and they're aware of some networks that had in protocol delegation mechanisms that make it a little bit more like accessible to in protocol as they can without custody and Michelle chose like a different route like we all know they launched a bit on chain in parallel in 2012 2020 which I see myself as some sort of like incentivized testnet that run for a while under SS history now as infrastructure providers we have been focused on having the least open opinionated approach to running these networks and focused mostly on like our performance and delivering better services however there are some influence that we can have because we have to make some decisions and we need to do that while remaining incredibly neutral and that has worked so far but they're also wearing that many ways in which you could express your preference in the past but now this is changing let's see the present State also of the ethereum is taking who are the players right now when I look now what are the differentiators or where the lines are drawn uh like we talk a little bit about Native staking in comparison to like liquid staking so let's go a little bit more in depth into this and one thing that people realize in relation to the risk that I mentioned previously about sticking was that you could create a system where you will receive what is called like a staking voucher that represents the E that is staked and then you could be able to find someone who is in the market let's say willing to bike buy it and so on I say people it wasn't just any people actually liquids taking as a concept was first presented by course one by this guy my co-worker named Felix Lodge he called it delegation vouchers and later we presented like the whole design of League was taken in this liquid second report all the way back in 2019 which was inspired by a work in the ethereum because in the cosmos ecosystem at the time and essentially this this representation of a position would function as a received for state eth and you could use that you could trade it in unislab deposit it in our maker whatever you want to do with that but coming back to this the other line that can be drawn between these different kinds of types of taking let's say is custodial versus non-custodial or South custodial and there's some overlapping here happening between like liquids taking non-custodial and Native and custodial but there's also some node operators like course one that offer like native staking that is also known custodial and finally there's another difference that exists between retail and institutional stake in and this is more related to which are the customer segments that you're trying to Target and how best to serve those customers and for example there's a huge number of users which you can actually don't reach you can't reach if you don't have a custodian and makes taking very simple like using the existing wallets the exchanges either because of convenience or because of compliance now speaking as a solo sticker myself but also as a node operator it the second rewards Market is very volatile and kind of difficult to navigate a lot of it it also has to do with like the dependency of staking providers that they have on like the asset prices so we think also how can can be abstract data and keep things going whether it's e is like a hundred dollars or ten thousand dollars crossing my fingers now everyone sort of expected a significant increase in stake ease as a result of the last upgrade and with withdrawals finally being enabled and there was certainly that was certainly like the bed we were making of course one and we were right with ethereum significantly the risk and that's taking inflows have definitely searched as you can see growing by over 10 million dollars per day in some cases I'm making this like the closest to a risk-free rate that you can have in crypto but what happened is that now in our Market ethereum is suffering a little bit from success if the validator Intrigue is perpetually at capacity like a for the next nine months you could see the size of the active validator a let's say active validator set grow into like two millions and that's the second it's like like picture like you can see there and that can have like very significant effects on the peer-to-peer layer that a the protocol has but yeah those are some issues but then what is the composition of this stake so the rated team a estimated that 6.5 of a people that are sticking or like entities are like solos or solo stickers that are on the set which is great like most of the decisions that ethereum has taken in the past has been in favor of this so it's nice to see like that exist some diverse and distributed set of validators that provide let's say a strong backbone to all the network as a whole but the market structure is very dependent on liquid staking actually if the demand of staking remains as high as it is right now it is possible that at some point SD flips it in the near future and I don't know about you but that's not the flipping that I was expecting so let's talk a little bit about that thing that we're all thinking okay what is this LST Market structure well there's two very oppositional sides that exist let's say on one side there's like institutional staking and on the other side there's self-stakers and in the middle exists everyone else and everyone else is taking with light on and there are strong very strong Network effects in liquid staking and I think we've all seen like the return to scale that this brings it has many reasons one is the liquidity of a liquid sticking token which not to be redundant liquidity of liquid sticking but it is it it's how useful this can be and how instant can you use it the order the other one I guess is the obvious opportunity cost of staking so from the perspective of the protocol that is creating token you want to make it as useful as you can and the more useful it is the more people will use it and then it is a chain effect that is in the end the power and I guess the biggest power that brand and Trust has since taking which is also part of why we find ourselves in this situation now the question is does this result in a winner takes all Market good question what I'll say is this to the degree that a token is used as money it behaves as money so it has the network the Network's effects of money in some networks where that doesn't happen then this is not the case and you don't see those effects but it is actively used and the network effects almost always win now don't be afraid the outcome might not be as centralized as you think but it will be very concentrated for those reasons that I specified but there's still like a big social layer to stay in and in the ethereum ecosystem that is always like their whatever happens in that case and I think for myself it is very important that it remains a very distributed system on a very secure system and for that to happen I think one of the main things you need is the ossification of the layer below it to be able to unlock that authentication in the above level because if you can don't have that then it becomes very difficult to create products around staking and that is something that we've seen at course one we have a product called obus and we got well that is like depressing but this is like the fun part what is like the future of staking here's a few cool things and we're getting to the end of this but there are big three areas that I want to separate okay so one of them and all of this is what I would call like infrastructure level Innovation that is happening in ethereum when it comes to staking now getting right to to the big things Mev is a design by product by product of block building scenes like the correct blockchain doesn't have like rules that exist for the content and The Ordering of the blog a lot of things and a lot of Minds have gone into this topic even in this conference there are so many so many chats too many talks that you can see and so I'm not going to explain like the supply chain economics or any of those models here but as takers we can now take a more opinionated approach to Meb through memory boost with things like relay selection location and more and going deeper into going deeper into this topic and optimizing it further makes sense as a node operator which is what we try to do our course one and I think we've been kind of successful so far we can see here and we will be actually publishing more on these results in our website a kind of soon so watch out for that and maybe there's other ways to make your more predictable in the future like I may be born but that's for other talks in the conference and we have two other things that are the last things I'm going to mention and Roll-Ups on DVT is one of them I put these two together because they are scaling solutions to both the size of the stack the consensus as an execution and with DVT we are looking to increase the staking setup with high availability without making any security compromises that could lead to slashing and you can only do that with DBT we are very interested in the effect I think it's like oh well we'll have on performance and also the effect it will have on the capital costs of running another operation and something that is called The Lazy validator problem which is why we're actually doing experiments on this on mainnet right now we have a main and oval node with other node operators and yeah that is other things that we're doing experiments with staking and finally saving the best for last a liquid second Innovation and risk taking first we have this role of light operators and we are very much looking forward to the sticking router and how what that can do for the modularity in staking and then what they are trying to do is like moving from some node operators to hundreds of node operators which will hopefully be on net positive for the network and with risk taking this is a whole thing I actually wrote a report or a piece in our quarterly report about this topic it's called expanding the ethereum is taking ecosystem you should be able to download download that from our website very soon but in the staking World rehypertification terms of terms of shape of free staking and as we'll know if validators are a very valuable asset and you can leverage that to perform other activities on be accountable through slashing I guess to the degree that this helps compete on rewards and not operators will move there as long as I guess their risk reward Matrix makes sense and then stakers will also want to participate in that and the protocol that users taking will also do that and improve that the differentiator I guess in the second Market and the risk of this is what everyone is concerned about I'm with you I guess this is like another topic but for me there's two pressures going on in ethereum one of it is like the pressure to change and keep growing in Innovation and the other is the pressure to stay the same I guess to also fight this base layer but yeah that is like a different idea that I want to leave you with but I think it's almost inevitable that we will see more liquidity markets built on top of it different levels of uh mistaking leverage and so on that happens here we all know what that could look like but I think all in all all these topics are testing the limits in regards to open Innovation happening at the second level in ethereum so yeah those are the projects as they happen in parallel and the interesting thing will be when all of these come together and how they're going to interact together and when we we will have to do upgrades on all of this simultaneously and how that will look like us not operators I'm very interested but yeah in the end the point is how do we align and how do we work together in sync as a as an economy does analysis taking economy now to close here I think we're seeing like this taking and this is a centralized Market happening in real time in front of our eyes there is like all these open Innovation that is happening is taking maybe some of you thought that staking was a very boring topic and nothing was happening there for a long time well now a lot is happening and we are very hopeful on what that this can unlock and well we'll be heading into progress head on I guess and I hope like that the community can also solve all the apostles that we still have in front of us I have full Trust on that but yeah I am fully on time a 15 minutes is not a lot but yeah that is kind of like my Telegram and we are a cross one get in touch talk about staking this is also us so yeah thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you
