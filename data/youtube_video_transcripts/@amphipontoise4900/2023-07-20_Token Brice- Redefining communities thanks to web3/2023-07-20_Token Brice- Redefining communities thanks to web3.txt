[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] Ty building in the age of web3 as I call the talk and the idea is to dive into what it entails to try to build a community living up to the standard we like to promote around here so transparency accessibility inclusivity and so on so this talk is of course uh informed by my own experience building the community of D5 friends and we try to do things differently and review things along the way um but yeah I guess first the main question before we dive into the solution is what exactly are we trying to solve for what's the problem here um there are several ways to frame it but essentially um that's kind of where I would go the the question goes more like how do you expect to really truly build decentralized protocols if you cannot even decentralizedly organize a party let's say you know let's start small let's start with um we go to the theater together or we go to a club and we organize this in a in a truly inclusive Manner decentralized and then if we can figure that out maybe we move up the stack of managing some money together outputting a stable coin doing all those fun stuff so this is here where you have um essentially the four main um the four main points that we're trying to work on are D5 friends so having a system that is transparent running as much as possible on the on-chain mechanism so everybody can audit it A system that is resilient obviously it's not a D5 product or we're on social stuff here or Etc facto accessibility is is probably the biggest one for a community so a community where everyone can join everyone can participate and everyone can eventually become someone important of that Community if they if they do enough contribution and the last one is kind of tight but also a bit different the ownership of the community by the community so its ability to take decision and essentially craft the community impact the the future of it so yeah it's a bit of a core question is how do we build a community that is credibly decentralized so it can output protocols whatsoever there will be themselves interesting in the approach and um yeah I cut down on that but essentially to go to the broader context keep in mind that in D5 we pretty much still at the Stone Age of of how we take decisions so most Protocols are still uh one token one vote uh you can come in one minute before the end of the vote and vote with 15 million votes and all of them will be implemented instantly so they have like very little filtering on top of just the base brutal prehistorical logic of one tokenical equal one vote Maya my weapon is bigger than yours I wait more essentially so I I think we can go much farther as kind of also to have in this context of how can we introduce more element into that computation essentially to make it more relevant to Community Building so okay that's a problem now let's talk about the scope what is essentially this community governing upon and so here um we go more into the specific of all solution at devices I believe there are other ways to do that but yeah yeah so This Is How We Roll so essentially as kind of like the C sub PCS of the Dao if you may that we we're looking to decentralize here so there is an idea of a ranking some form of measurement of the contributions of the member there is a question of moderation you know you have to indeed move message around question of curation what content do you put forward in the community the social presence so there is a Twitter account potentially lends all the stuff the internal governance of the community they take some votes they decide and all of that is run by an infrastructure the community decide on and operate so it's also uh one of the core question so this is a bit of a zoom essentially on the previous one to kind of show you the main questions that goes behind each topic um but yeah all of them can have a relevance and it's not just for the third of it so you know for instance ranking uh you might be like okay why do you want to rank in a community or whatsoever the goal is again to be able to use it as a tool to take better decisions and essentially give more influence to the people that are the most committed to the community um so in that sense you know it's a it makes a lot of sense um so yeah let me go straight into the system because I'm not sure about the time here so how we implemented it at D5 friends essentially and and how we go about this approach so um at D5 friends essentially everything is built on top of a Discord board and that's the first thing is we try to essentially integrate everything on top of Discord so we hear where the conversation is already happening or the members are already and we're not adding friction to to the interaction with the community so here it's uh yeah sorry the slide score but essentially it's an overview of how it works to propose something through entirely the discard on D5 friends and and how how the flow goes so essentially you have Community member that will suggest an idea discuss an idea in a channel um and and through a specific command they can formalize it into a vote so usually it goes with a big of back end Force you know it's not straight from hey guys let's do that and then people watch straight on it it usually has you know feedback input and eventually uh it's kind of refined into a proposal and then members can react with a scroll Emoji to kind of Express their intent to put this as a word and always Basin on the scoring the damage about keeps to kind of it's all based on threshold so as long as there is enough uh Quorum of play as we call it uh the the discussion is put to a vote into the proposition Channel and then from here uh committee members can simply vote Yes No ponderated Again by their ranking and this gives us a clear um a clear result on the decision so everything that is blue on the graph is is essentially on Discord so you can see from a member perspective it's all on Discord of course there are stuff that are outside Discord so the execution of the popular itself might require other things like moving assets so online business is safe and every proposal is documented of course so this is another output to git book you see at the the bottom part but yeah the goal was really to make it as easy as possible for uh for the user for for the the community members to get involved and um yeah they can do it straight from Discord which is really cool so uh can I had a preview on the previous one but this is how uh Demeter or bot run so it has this kind of play we call it wheat in English and internal currency essentially it's just a point system it's not transferable it's not a token and the goal of it is really to achieve this ranking we're talking about earlier the way it works is it's uh inherently social so like you can't Farm play on your own uh it's more about other people reacting to your messages that will give you blame and it really depends it's weighted it's a bit like a quadratic approach or it's weighted depending of how much play does the person interacting with you has so typically to give you a use case I guess everybody will understand a guy that is totally new so zero play at all but comes in and put an amazing contribution in a channel and gets let's say Sir diziac right here quite quite the whale to to react to him to say thanks man you did a really good job give him some emojis it will get a nice Blade transfer on this interaction because you got like a blade heavy person to signal that it was a positive member and there is also another interesting thing which is a Decay so essentially DK is quite fast with a vision to essentially you know you might be a good member now but you cannot essentially do nothing for a year and still be a massively influenced I'm a member with massive influence a year from now so it did get quite fast and we saw quite a movement on this one so this is just a zoom on the system maybe a bit too much but it's easily the use case I was uh telling you about no it's a bit different but essentially it's a guy saying thanks to Nolan one of our early member in a special Channel and he got quite a few reactions specific reaction so essentially this guy found quite a bit of play especially for the person that is quoted in the message here so the the big winner here is Nolan getting tons of play but apparently he helped a guy recover a wallet and it's not the first time he did that so I guess it's a good thing he's getting some some play right um so it's just a zoom on those Emoji based systems they kind of work for quite a few things and this is just kind of going through so for instance we use them to move message around to uh just to simple Emoji uh same thing with a threshold people can move messages so here you have for instance a newcomer um sorry yeah a newcomer asking a basic question in a more advanced channel the community can just react to move this question to a beginner Channel and the bot will implement the the action automatically as soon as the threshold is here it's also used for for creation so you have this little floppy disk reaction that creates a just essentially saves a message in a specific channel to make it easy to to find again so this works the same way okay for moderation and for governance can I walk you through it so I'm just gonna go uh a bit further to the result essentially I guess um you have quite a few docs on D5 friends online anyway if you want to see a bit more The Proposal past a lot of it is in French but you know it's a French community so sorry not sorry um but yeah so I guess you know the whole goal of this was uh decision system organization so what have we done with two two years roughly of that system running what has been achieved so there are quite a few things the first one we're quite proud of is a decentralization of meetups we went from organizing only in Paris to an organizing in five six cities there is even D5 friends Belgium so so we're growing we're spreading we had quite a few community-led initiatives depending of the moment some some related to tokenomics uh one was like a D5 dictionary walking groups of all sold and we even have some infrastructure Focus projects so the limiter itself was upgraded so for instance at first wasn't able to manage the Twitter account and then we voted an extension of limited to Twitter and implemented it and now you can literally manage the device Twitter account through directly the Discord so like little core Edition in terms of how it works concretely uh I think what we're quite proud of is the accessibility so we saw quite a lot of essentially newcomers emerging through D5 friends through the place this time and other things and it's quite dynamic in terms of the top holders it changed a lot and it really usually reflects the people that are active in the community right now so in that sense it's it's pretty positive now of course what can we do better we have two main two main shortcomings right now so the first one is um you might have heard you know about Discord git book and so on so you're like okay this is fine maybe it's aligned with web Suite values but it's still you know a good or web to company hosting most of your infra so definitely you know migrating to lands finding another solution for Discord and certain channels we can truly own will be a step forward but it's obviously hard to replicate the same level of Integrations we currently have on Discord on a more decent trade solution the second point is probably like I guess the main one it's uh what type of decisions you're trying to take with this infrastructure and we run into the the limit kind of of realizing that this works really well for um you know for for organization of meetups for instance or things that are quite targeted that have a goal and are not too long-term and strategic but when it comes to um more strategic decision for the community it's really hard to reach a consensus with a system this horizontally and inclusive and so there are some topics where we kind of hit our heads against the warn or when for instance we're trying to articulate a yearly budget for for the sponsoring sponsoring of the meetups so essentially why there will be a budget collected once by the D5 friends a group Association whatsoever then distributed to all the organizer we failed to reach agreement and we're back to the all solution of every organizer collecting their own sponsorship themselves for every event so obviously not ideal but kinda we were enabled so far with this structure to find a proper solution for that so yeah that's it for me today I have some time maybe for the questions one two tonight yeah any question I think we have time for one maybe you mentioned there's a budget if there's a budget there's money and you know this is all about money right it's defy um how do you in the context of D5 France how do you manage money is is it is that related to blay is that are there certain key holders is it a multi-sig I think maybe you put up the gnosis save how does it work yeah I mean no surprise uh here it's it's mostly ignosis safe but um we don't have that much assets to manage at the end of the day it's mostly air drops or or I don't know where the actual assets come from but it's not uh we're not talking of a big treasury but in that case we're mentioning of essentially collecting a yearly sponsorship budget and then redistributing it to projects so that would have been a bit more info on that front yeah but it's a safe and uh the signers are elected by the community essentially and and they renew them maintain them remove some of them when they want thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Music]
