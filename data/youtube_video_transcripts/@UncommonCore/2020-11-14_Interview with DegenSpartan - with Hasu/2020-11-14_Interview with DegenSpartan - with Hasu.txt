welcome to uncommon core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles today i'm not only joined by a very special guest but the format of this episode is highly unusual as well i interviewed the man who goes by the name at legion spartan on twitter and who is one of the biggest and most enigmatic fifa investors there is i have wanted to have him on for a long time but there was one problem legion spartan or d essential is fully pseudonymous and did not even want to have his voice known so we looked for a solution and ended up doing a text interview instead then i got patrick mccory who is ed pettypisa on twitter to speak the part of ds in the final recording while i spoke my own part at this point i want to give a huge thank you to everyone who reached out to us on twitter and offered the help to make this episode a reality i get that this isn't your average podcast episode and you're free to go and read the text interview instead if you want but i think paddy did a fantastic job sds and the final product came out great so please enjoy first of all thanks so much for coming on the show diaz i always thought you're not just one of the most educational but also one of the most entertaining people on crypto twitter thanks for having me on um i've been listening to your podcast since it began and i'm a really big fan so it's pretty surreal for me to be here right now thanks thanks so you have an incredible story um from starting out as a retail investor who bought the ethereum top in 2017-18 to becoming one of the biggest default investors in the world how did you manage to do that and um what set you apart from so many others coming from the same place um i i doubt i'm one of the biggest uh perhaps i'm more um i'm one of the more prolific participants that is actually retail rather than professional i have a finance background and i was pretty i was a pretty active investor in the traditional markets before i switched over to solely focus on crypto so i think that sort of background gave me a pretty decent edge when thinking about the various cryptocurrencies as investments or even just working out what strategies do you employ in the market to make good money without doxxing yourself too much is there anything more that you can say about your specific skill sets and interests that you had before finding this space i'm thinking in particular um what made you see the potential in crypto and d fire to begin with and um form the level of conviction that is necessary to become a full-time investor um well before coming in the crypto i was just your typical retail investor i was looking at stocks bonds raits all those typical things you'd expect a regular joe to be dabbling in while they work out their long-term investment strategy to retire you know one of the concept concepts that were really popular at the time was the idea of income investing which is looking for businesses that can pay out a steady dividend or interest income and that would be the core part of helping you you know fire was this popular idea these days to be financially free retire early by having income exceed expenses so so one of the things i was you know particularly sensitive to was a yield investing and i'd searched high and low to find investments that could give me a decent income or dividend uh without my capital being at risk and i say that most things end up with roughly the same kinds of returns you'd expect you know like six percent pa or even lower for that you know the safer stuff and one of the things i first noticed when i joined the crypto space was the rampant mispricing between exchanges and the in arbitrage opportunities you know i just kept comparing the numbers and just doing the math because i just couldn't believe it there were opportunities where you could use a few thousand dollars to make fifty dollars in net arbitrage returns and i saw this happening you know several times a day on several pairs you know sheer fifty dollars net that isn't very much but you can do that a few times a day and the markers are open seven days a week well you know i just did the math and this blew my mind that you get arbitrage versus amazing returns and keep in mind you know this is all manual and by hand i wasn't using bots to do this and then you know after engaging in an arbitrage for a while that was one of the things that really you know solidified my view that the crypto market search was extremely inefficient and this inefficiency also meant profit opportunity and i was just really you know motivated to come into this space and hustle mm-hmm yeah to to go back to um to the start of your answer i love that you started out as fixed income dividend investor because i always said this hunch that basically despite this kind of degen brand that you have created for yourself on twitter that you're actually very prudent risk manager below the surface um so we we do have to touch on that for a moment so why why did you choose this as your alter ego uh perhaps the prudence spartan where you brought in in the future might be an order uh but no one actually believes i'm a d-gen anymore um i guess when i was deciding my alter ego you know i didn't really want to restrict myself to being this permanent cheerleader for off any pacific coin or project so i purposely avoided including something like bitcoin in my name you know i wanted something uh a bit more natural but i also wanted something that could remind me myself that uh like crypto is really just this crazy space and anything can happen uh so i guess it also worked out well that my djan branding can also serve as a very obvious warning to others to consider the stuff that i talk about you know i never really expected i'd be able to get such a following on twitter and sometimes i do hope that the newer followers uh that they're you know like the newer followers who are not aware of my insight jokes and humor you know that they just don't take everything that i said face value um i guess as well it worries me sometimes that when i make jokes about buying or selling something others just copy that because you know i meant i'm an influenza you know aka this influencer uh you know pun intended there uh i think i've managed to prevent a lot of that kind of copy trading behavior to a minimum but i constantly just rolling out these you know psyops uh campaign so that followers can think a bit more before they even the things based on based on basically what i say on twitter the spartan bit um i guess the spartan bit just came about because you know spartans are pretty badass and cool aren't they so uh yeah that's why um yeah you know i love the way that you use psyops on twitter um because it always makes me think for sure and that's something that not a lot of accounts can do consistently but what i've found most impressive about your performance is that you are not defy yes man like so many others are and you were extremely early to defy but you were also one of the first to say um guys i think as an industry we are growing too fast right now and um i think we are seeing signs of extreme exuberance and i think i think the top is in how did you manage to do that and what were those signs um yeah well i i guess the defy top was in late august uh that was just a really really crazy time for me with all the farming going on i would say the start of the defy hype was probably the lunch of comp and basically since that day you know i've been sleeping three to four hours a night just trying to stay on top of everything i i've been in this space for a while so i think i have a pretty good stamina as a participant but this was just going on for weeks and weeks uh the thing was though it was just really that the quality of the projects popping out we're just starting to deteriorate at a very quick piece oh yeah uh yeah we had we had yam and then we had a dozen yama inspired food clones we had wifey and then again we had a dozen more wifeys inspired these fair lunch clones and these cycles just kept repeating and every new thing just got shorter and shorter as people realized that you know the optimal strategy here was really just the exit earlier than others uh basically front run other people and everyone was trying to front run everyone else on the way out you know initially the yam game that took i think what two weeks to play out the last of the food farms that i was looking at were collapsing within a day or two um i mean i guess of course you know as a heavy defy user aldos is pretty active throughout this entire period alice's moving farm the farm is an honest farmer um being on the front lines and seeing how you know how much worse you know every new project got was playing out and that was basically a tell for me that you know this insanity would eventually have the end uh personally i actually felt the sushi swap was the top uh sushi swap it was you know it was by far the riskiest type of d5 farming that had come on the scene uh previously the only time you'd be taking risks and other than this malicious or you know smart contract risk uh would be if you were braver i guess silly enough to participate in the pull tools of the farming projects and sushi swap pretty much has forced all of these you know farming participants you know most of whom have never done liquidity provision before they all suddenly just injected hundreds of millions of liquidity in the uni swap and one of the problems with these d5 tokens until that point were uh where that these you know these d5 tokens which is pretty liquid and now with sushi swaps is incentivizing everyone they provide liquidity it just created this huge opportunity for anyone looking the exit to finally swim out to this massive ocean of liquidity and i guess at the same time uh you know while all this was going on i was just printing a massive amount of money every day you know by just participating in sushi swap it was just so surreal you know i kept saying to myself this is this doesn't make any sense now what could be more silly than this i was pretty much scared of how ridiculously rich i was getting each passing day and that made me stop and think you know i should probably get out now uh the last time i had these kind of ridiculous thoughts were at the 2017 peaks uh you know what that didn't really end too well for me so um i learned my lesson from that um so you're saying not only would basically the the the the prices of these tokens collapse when the subsidy ends but it also provided extra liquidity for their largest holders yeah yeah pretty much um yeah i sort of had guessed that stuff like you know yam and wifey you know there'd probably be more sushi style clones popping up they really use these uni-swap lp shares as farming assets in their pool ones uh what we did see with things like sashimi and you know moonswap but it's just like how all these uh other projects collapsed really fast you know that basically happened there as well uh so my thesis eventually became that you know none of these clones could provide as much liquidity as sushi swap during the initial reward period and that shrinking liquidity would just cause larger holders to head for the exit you know while the liquidity ocean was still available to them um i guess basically everyone was formated hundreds of percent of annual yields for the past month or so you know how many people would want to send those assets back to their native protocol to be used you know as intended and probably earned either massively reduced returns you know relatively speaking or some of them earn no just nothing at all so um i guess it was his confluence you know uh the ever increasing sediments are revolving around the d5 farming situation and uh the thesis that is going to be pretty hard for anyone anything sorry to uh top sushi swap as a d5 farm and that made me think that we'll probably be heading lower once reality sets in that this has got last forever you know we didn't invest in some perpetual free money machine based on digital food farming you know so um yeah eventually had the end yeah so how do you manage to to keep enough distance to these investments that you can actually sell them after they have made you a lot of money because i mean as we know investors tend to get pretty emotionally attached um to those investments um well one of the things i do i guess rather differently than other traders or investors is that i never actually have a specific price target for me the decision to buy or sell should really be based on the sediment uses regarding that project if the price had gone up uh but there are still plenty of disbelievers or you hear comments that people have only just dipped their toes in i'd assume that there's more sideline fire apart to keep the party going i think it is pretty much a question of you know who's going to buy these coins next and is there anyone after that but it's definitely more an art than a science um i mean what you could also do is you can always just sell a bit and then another bit and just see if things are still going well before you start selling again you know every peak has a leg on both sides uh but some people seem to forget that you can also sell on the right side post peak as is going down as well so as long as you don't have this mental stigma of you know oh no but i'm not selling at the all-time highs i hold you back from selling um how do you measure sentiment i think that's just really hard but it's also one of the reasons why i use twitter so much you know you get these sneak peeks of things happening in the nukes and crannies of our universe people having conversations and what they did how they felt what they plan to do next all in public view i use all the different social media to spy on and to chat with other investors on how they feel and then just trying to figure out what i think the different players want to do next it's probably probably a pretty trust way of doing things i'm sure some statisticians would cringe at what i just said and roll their eyes that i consider this method even useful by any measure but i just don't know any better way to do it so um that's that's what i do i mean i i know that i always trust the practitioner in that case um so how how would you describe your approach to investing in general i mean you just mentioned sentiment but you have always struck me as someone who pays a lot of attention to the fundamentals as well so what do you watch out for and how long do you usually hold a position and maybe do you trade long as well as short um i think my cryptos so far my approach has been to play the contarian finding a pretty unpopular thesis an investment is just trying to suss it up if it actually has the fundamentals to shake things up it basically means i try to work out in the niches that the pros aren't looking at and the attention really isn't on it that means i'm not competing with smarter and more talented people that would beat me in a fair fight and win him by playing a game that they didn't even know was going on this makes my job as a capital allocator easier since i don't need to compete with others when they accumulate in my positions and they don't bid on my average investment price as well of course um i'm not just looking at on love segments the idea has to make some sense as well you know combine a rather unloved project with improving fundamentals to back it up and i think that's the rest of me to get a high profit multiple i'll hold the decision for as long as i think there's still upside though i may pair down his size as it becomes too large relative to the rest of my portfolio almost never short because i'm just really terrible at it and given just how irrational the crypto markets are i think playing the short side of things is massively difficult and riskier i don't think it is worth it unless it is some really obvious play and i have the collateral liquidity of the openess short i think it is definitely you know this is a lot easier to be a bull rather than a bear and crypto you know during the recent d fight drop i felt really uneasy being bearish the whole time and i kept thinking to myself you know when can i just get back in and just post british nonsense so um yeah i mean i guess the kind of like the danger of short selling was really uh indeed in particular was really emphasized when um we had uh basically people on twitter getting together and chasing like the large shorts trying to liquidate them and some of the tokens like yfi and and so on that really like had hundred percent increases in price from the bottom and that was really unexpected for me as well um but next i'd love to learn how you think about a few different of the projects that we touched on so far and more than than any other project you have become associated with synthetics you're known as their quote-unquote patient xero who brought many other big investors in can you describe for our listeners what is synthetics when did you find it and um most importantly how did you recognize its potential zero that this is hilarious yeah i know that one before yeah um i suppose synthetics is best thought of as as a derivatives or synthetics protocol uh it basically allows you to go long or short on supported synthetic assets uh since the positions are synthetic you know the assets aren't they're not really restricted to just erc20 tokens but you know they can cover a wide range of non-ethereum based crypto outsets like bitcoin and ripple and also known crypto arts as like precious metals and equity indices um pretty much the sky's the limit as long as there's a price fee somewhere it could become a static asset on the platform i think um i think if booty's just dumb dumb luck to be honest you know synthetics was originally heaven and that was a decentralized stable coin project that had the idea of tagging protocol fees every time a transaction was made but then you had these centralized stable coins pop up like you know gusd usdc and of course tether you know usdt uh pretty much killed that idea of a stable coin that could charge fees every time you move it um i viewed the pivot the synthetic assets as a hail mary that actually was successful but as i understand it it was actually more of a mindset change for the community regarding the path of the project you know rather than a technical change uh because it still leverages the you know the pooled debt model that the original heaven was based on now they just really figured out that the pool that could be used for so many more things and i guess i just got sold on that pivot as well um i think it was easier for me to accept and digest the pivot because i understood technically why it was possible to pivot on what they were trying to do with the new direction but i stayed really well to still credit myself this is some dumb luck uh mostly this uh the synthetics team's big brain realization that they could pivot to something something larger as the main reasons why you know snx turned out to be a good investment for me um yeah i do remember reading about haven uh as well back in the day and thinking that their model of you know charging fees on transfers that that would probably not be sustainable um but i mean it's i guess it's a really easy mistake to make that when basically you see a project and you you find some something that you see as a terminal flaw then to write that project off and not pay attention to it anymore without realizing that i mean this is the teams can actually pivot in crypto right as well and um and many of the the projects that we see uh have success today actually are the result of such um such pivots um how has your view on synthetics changed since then and are you happy with the current direction and um and what what maybe do you think is the end game for them because again in my mind so the biggest in my mind the biggest question would be when does synthetic stay comfortable issuing shares on our chairs but issuing synthetics on individual u.s securities right i would you say that is the watershed moment for the the d5 synthetic space in general um perhaps not many of the current communities share this aspiration of mine but i really you know i really want to see synthetic stable coins outside of usd being used outside of trading purposes and as an alternative to official digital fiat currencies synthetics is unique in its design and that it could actually bootstrap crypto versions of various fiat and it really does overcome the liquidity problems that any custodial stablecoin would have been interacting with the rest of the market you know perhaps one day far in the future that could happen um i guess the general end game that most of the community does share is to become a multi-asset version of bit max allowing traders to trade on a variety of assets long or short you know with the option of using leverage um about individual u.s securities perhaps that could come after the project can further decentralize itself from regulatory accents i think we are fast approaching the point where the team does not have control over everything i you know is you know sufficiently decentralized that you just can't run up everyone in a room and say okay guys stop treating you know stop being deep gen but um i mean overall though i guess i actually feel the watershed moment will be the perpetual swaps and layer 2 of leverage not really these are individual us securities okay um so the way trading works on bit max for listeners um is they only match external market participants with each other right so for every customer's long position there's not a customer who necessarily holds the short position to that as a result bitmex doesn't occur any balance sheet risk no matter what trading occurs on its platform but synthetics is different from that in that the ethnic stakers they take the other side of every synthetic that is outstanding so for every susd in circulation the the essence takers are short usd snx for every sbtc they are short btc snx and so on um do you see any material risk from that approach and what do the current stackers do to hedge that risk yeah i mean that's why the perpetual model to me is the watershed movement that will be when the protocol is aware of the imbalance of positions and the funding rate could exist to get people uh to get people to balance out the positions and there's always been a concern that i've raised up early on so i'm really eager to see that upgrade when it finally goes live i'd expect that would make the risk exposure of synthetic mentors to be squeezed into a narrower bond you know really reducing the risk of them being costly really offside by large winning traders on the platform and as well you know hedging is pretty clunky right now in fact i thought people don't really worry enough about it but synthetics has rolled at uh stopgap measures of paying for shoulders through staking inverse synthetic positions and btc or eth and since that program has launched the skew of positions and the risk that mentors take on has reduced drastically at least from my perspective i'd consider it a small success for now but uh i really think it is not very elegant at all um yeah right i saw that you can now get um snx rewards for minting and staking ibtc and ieth with just these inverse synthetics um and the reason they do that is because it helps de-risk the exposure of uh the stakeholders somewhat so i i agree that's definitely a step in the right direction um speaking of of haven and susd though another project that um both of us have been vocal critics critics of in the past is maker can you say more about why you don't like it oh boy i'd say that my main critique is their design which i feel is inadequate because it lacks the ability to go negative and the charged you know die holder for stability or from another perspective is unable to incentivize die supply creation another design issue that i have the maker protocol is their three-party system you know there's these three parties you have the die holders you know or the user uh the dye supplier the the cdp owner and actually the maker holders themselves i think their three stakeholder system creates a weird you know tension in every situation and the decision making because it always seems that one of the three parties is made a loser at the benefit of the other two parties my last bit is less about the protocol i'm more about their you know token value acryl design uh i don't really like buy and burn models because you need to assume you know you need to assume going concern on a secondary market bid i prefer fee collecting and strict distributing models because it is straightforward and self-serving but i suppose this could be a security avoiding slice tax decision to have things done this way um what do you mean by going concern um that it continues indefinitely to be able to realize eventual gains when you eventually want to sell as opposed to a fee distribution model that if it ceases operations at least you've recouped some of your investments from the fees distributed until that point so after the march events um and then compound yield farming um after those had um catapulted die to trade consistently above a dollar and five cents i thought that um maker would reach would for sure reach a boiling point and um that they'd finally be forced to uh integrate the negative interest rates that we both have been waiting for for so long um but what they did instead was to to flood the system with centralized stable coins um that they can't even charge stability fees fees on i mean to get the pack back down um what do you think of that and um and maybe also their what do you think about their focus on implementing um real world collateral compared to issuing more synthetics than just die from the trustless creditor that we already have i always thought that these were would be the two obvious routes to to choose between yeah i mean i think accepting the centralized sierra coins as collateral really hurt the you know the whole diet as a pure decentralized stable coin narrative that had largely enjoyed yeah you know a lot of the strong yeah yeah a lot of the strongest supporters had to do a lot of soul searching to decide if this is the direction you know something that they can really support i felt their community fractured quite a bit since march and i mean it has given uh it has given rise to like competitors like like reflexer yeah there's the bitcoin ray right there no one had even like dared attack maker uh and becoming more trustless before that point yeah um in fact i'm actually tempted to put on my tinfoil hat and said that everything they have been doing was planned all along and that it'd be too easy for their supporters to tear apart to be honest i'm not really sure what their end game is their holders seem to be out of touch with reality where it took them months to accept link is collateral why mana was collateral all along i don't get it i don't know what they are doing i pretty much be maker makers entertainment at this point you know what's their end game i have no idea okay okay um the last project um i want to talk to you about is urine finance um you you have been like maybe one of the most prominent skeptics in the past and you did not buy into the hype at all so why were you skeptical and and when when when when when wifey did this spectacular run up to 40k dollars did that make you question yourself at all oh i mean my skepticism was from day one i was familiar with y-curve and the iron products for a while since i've always kept it close and i've always i've always kept close to my yield seeking roots i almost didn't even want to farm wifey tokens because i was thinking you know what would they govern what products streams are they are they governing where the fees being generated that they can vote to redirect the token holders but of course the price of the token was going nuts so of course i i farmed them hard um i cannot understand why people were buying into the tokens now did andre pinky promise that he would do some pro bono work for all the wifey holders exclusively until he retires to be honest i was perplexed that andre kept releasing things under wifey umbrella uh on banner at all um for example why you know do y vaults need to be y vaults to me they could have easily you know they could just as easily have been andre vaults and andre himself collects the fee for maintaining and managing the valve but i suppose he wanted a body to be able to recognize themselves and do that instead i did not expect andre to keep building things and injecting them under the wifey umbrella it was also just excellent timing of the universe that curved lung crv shortly after y vaults and you know directing the vaults to farm it was as ridiculously profitable for everyone involved everyone was euphoric about the cash flows coming in from the vaults but were these cash flows sustainable in my opinion you know not by a long shot you know yield above 20 there's an anomaly in this world that would be cracked sooner or later of course seeing the token price run up there was always a thought of dom if i had held until now i could have made x much more profit but fundamentally i couldn't do it i couldn't just buy back in the mouth didn't make sense to me it still doesn't i can appreciate it as a fun pair you know fun trading pair when i started thinking about the fundamentals it just falls back to narratives of a magical future and the numbers just don't make sense to me maybe i'm really off side on this i guess i'll just have to live with it you know you can't catch every single run on every crypto even if i was in wifey i'd never have the convention the conviction to hold it which is why i sold it when i did when i did have it yeah um i i i think your arguments make a lot of sense and i i too would be really surprised if the yield farming opportunities don't compress a lot in the future especially for large pools of capital uh that run completely transparent strategies right that that the market can just copy for free um but since since you mentioned the the governing capabilities of wifey um that brings actually to the final topic that i have planned for today um you have been one of the more vocal skeptics of governance talks in general would you say you're that you're a governance minimalist um i never really thought about my own classification but yeah i guess um i would say i'm a governance minimalist so look at the real world you know governments can be a mess and do more harm than good the whole idea of governance tokens be invaluable because they can vote in fees later this doesn't sit very well with me could could maker be a good example of a governance token that's having a hard time voting in fees for his token holders and i guess maybe it's not really seeing strong value a cure to his token uh i feel that governance token holders that extract rent uh are free writing quite heavily in proportion to the value that they create you know does hold and wifey and rubber stumping governance proposals create value or are the builders that operate under the wifey umbrella the ones that create the value the flow of who is creating value and who is earning that value seems strange to me perhaps tying governance tokens to more you know quantifiable work than just voting for proposals may be a better way to get holders to be value creators as well instead of inviting just free writers that's a that's a fantastic way to close this off this was great yes thanks so much
