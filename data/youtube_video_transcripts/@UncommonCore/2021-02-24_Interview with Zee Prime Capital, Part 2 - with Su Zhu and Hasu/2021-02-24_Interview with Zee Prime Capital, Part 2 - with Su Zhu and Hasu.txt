welcome to uncommon core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles this show is hosted by suzu ceo and chief investment officer of three arrows capital and me hasu a crypto researcher and writer this is part two of our conversation with mati and fiscantis of the prime capital while the first half was more philosophical in nature this time we talked exclusively about different blockchain projects and how they might connect to each other in the future i believe that with gas fees in ethereum being as high as they are right now the advent of sharding and layer 2 solutions and the first credible ethereum competitors like polka dot cosmos and solana coming to mainnet this topic has never been more relevant in this episode we covered why z prime invests in polka dot and its ecosystem different approaches to interoperability finance smart chain and what role bitcoin and ethereum will play in a multi-chain future i actually i want to talk to you about polka dot because um polka dot is a i think it's is it top five i haven't checked for for like a week or so but um it's a it's a product that's very high in the rankings um it has a very large community but nonetheless it is um quite difficult to find good information about the state of its ecosystem and um as we covered in the first part these investments are actually all about narrative and the memes and so the community is always like a really important part of thesis for me when i want to invest in something that's why i think it's great to have two people here who like have a lot of experience with the polka dot ecosystem and can tell us something that we might not be able to learn on on twitter necessarily from what i know you're one of the one of the bigger investors in the polkadot ecosystem can you quickly summarize how polka dots architecture and vision differ from that of the ethereum because we have a lot of listeners who are very intimately familiar with ethereum but may not be with polka dot yeah maybe just let me give you a brief kind of um intro to polka like how did we come across polka so for me it's more of a personal thing so um i actually read the the paper uh the what i don't know it was the first white paper i think it was like december 2016. uh like crypto was a new thing for me back then and um um actually the the first crypto fund that i was involved with um like kevin i was an advisor so throughout 2017 and 2018 i had the privilege of of you know talking to him and um for me it was very much also like a personal bed so i i saw this person i know that gavin you know like he gets like a um he's a bit of a controversial figure so um but i saw this entrepreneur and for me you know the way he talked about the project the way he talked about polka dot was something that you know sort of instilled this conviction uh within me so i i was lucky to to be there early and to kind of see the um uh division very early on and and gavin saw it um i i think he even discussed it publicly is kind of the original vision of ethereum and um that was something that stuck with me and um i for me was a bet on on the on the founder of the project from from from from the get-go and um then as you know thing kind of progressed um i saw that these um these visions are are materializing and uh when i mean when substrate you know this this kind of um you know the tooling um for for polka dot was released i mean it was clunky and all that but when we had you know some of our deaf friends uh have a look at it there they were impressed so um so it was you could say that you know i was lucky to to be there uh early on um and to kind of had this bias instilled in me because i was around this this founder um and then it kind of funny thing is that we actually z prime founders co-founders and you know partners we have all first met at a polka event that actually i um sort of i wasn't running well i i sort of created this event in in bratislava slovakia it was like mid to late 2018 it was before web 3 was even doing polka dot meetups it was actually it was polka dot ocean protocol and hive.1 event um so and and we all met there i mean we we didn't sort of like i think fisky uh he thought that i'm some kind of polka shill and he was very skeptical about me first and it was like actually jacob um that that kind of connected us later on because we we we also met there so chance played it role there so i don't want to say that maybe if i was closer to a i don't know cardano founder i would have a different bias or something like that so um it all started with a chance um but then you know the thesis was kind of confirmed so i'll let maybe fisky to kind of elaborate on that no i just i just add that i'm still probably the most skeptical um guy when it comes to dots from our crew so i i still you know try to poke holes um i remember just reading the white paper in during the ico was it 2018 or 17 i don't even remember but uh you know it was like huge buzzword bingo they they made up a lot of terms like fishermen collaterals and i was really confused and i thought it's it doesn't make any sense so i i passed on that um and it yeah and when i met mati you know it was interesting but you know cardano seemed much more interesting to me technically for some reason during that uh that time um it was only like what uh one year one year ago when i really started to appreciate uh the tech and the vision behind it um i remember eat berlin 2019 you know when polkadot had its own com and uh cardano held some sort of a small event somewhere uh with community and you know the community were like three guys in a suit who looked really beaten down and tired and and polkadot was this lively ecosystem of of really smart guys and developers uh even from ethereum and elsewhere who were really like um eager to to build something on polkadot so this is where where it first kind of clicked for me um i'm also very interested in governance experiments like i wrote an article about governance where i where i kind of uh duck deeper into dowels and and some sort of it's like experiments on on decentralized consensus layers and and smart contracts and i think like one of my bigger criticisms around polkadot is that its governance seems a bit over engineered especially so early when there is no real validation that it really works and you know they they made it a bit more complicated and i kind of feel that you know they may be focused more on like this power structure and and like this governance side of things and then some other aspects that are maybe more important uh on the other hand especially you know being close to uh to guys from hydra dx i i see a lot of uh unique features that substrate and polkadot offers that other um like layers or platforms really don't offer and are nowhere near uh offering so i'm i'm getting more bullish on it as time time goes with some reservations of course and yeah being being part of z prime you can't really be too bearish and poke a little because you know you wouldn't last too long i'm just kidding um so yeah so that's my personal experience with it so far maybe to kind of um what what people often um i don't say don't get but when starting to explain polka dot um i don't like being at frame as another l1 or being a ethereum killer um i always kind of try to explain it as like layer 0 because it is it is a layer i don't know below or or above but it's um like ethereum could be a part of polka dot i mean in in theory um so you have this this this kind of relay chain that is kind of connecting the uh the universe of polkadot then you have different sort of what they call parachain um being on top of the on top of the relay connected for relay which kind of allows you to to have this um joint security or this um uh kind of um big um i think fisky how did you put it like it's a it's a nato or something like that yeah yeah i i have this i mean it's analogy and analogies are usually like pretty weak arguments but i like it because it kind of explains it pretty well um ethereum in my eyes is like centralized empire with one loss one consensus layer and you know everybody tries to build businesses uh within that empire and maybe have some colonies like some side chains or layer twos outside of it as well um cosmos is another like extreme where all these like app specific chains called zones in cosmos they are like independent they need to bootstrap their own security have their own validator set and they then connect freely via some sort of uh let's call it trade agreements so they are like independent nations uh within a free trade zone uh but they still need to uh figure out their own like security and rules by themselves and polkadot is somewhere in the middle where um you have this like semi-independent entities called parachains where they can build their like layer from ground up but then they uh if they want to be connected to the overall polkadot ecosystem they need to uh be part of this security alliance something like nato where they pay some some tax or some tribute to the ecosystem in forms of uh dots paying for parachute slots or like bonding dots in parachute slots and for that they get shared security and like better composability would be with the rest of the ecosystem uh what some people don't understand about polkadot is that you can have your own blockchain built on substrate which can then communicate with maybe rest of polka dot maybe with cosmos ecosystem or with ethereum and you don't have to have parachain slot so it's it's an option so let's say hydra dx aims to be a parachain of course but if we if we didn't get it somehow um if if hydra wasn't a para chain uh it still could serve as a independent substrate-based chain with its own validators with its own security and it could still work quite well it it wouldn't it doesn't have to be like this part of this inner circle if it doesn't want to but it brings a lot of benefits so obviously we and like almost uh everyone else in the polkadot ecosystem tries to be a power chain so the way i understand the power chance is that you don't just have one application prepared chain right you might have one defy ecosystem that is one parrot chain yes so and you're saying that hydra hydro dx is a project that you're incubating it's a decentralized exchange correct me if i'm wrong so what is the logic there to getting your own power chain instead of joining some pre-existing d5 power chain i really wish like some some more technical uh guys would be here from from hydra but uh there are some parachutes that are generalized so you can they are like ethereum there are smart contractor friendly and you can build stuff on top of them something like moonbeam and actually i think sushi swap is uh is extending uh itself into moonbeam to be part of polkadot ecosystem this way without needing to be a parachain or anything like it um but when you design something which which is more complex let's say and which is probably which aims to be an integral part of the infrastructure i think it's very beneficial to build built it from the ground up to design your own consensus and to kind of run your own chain because then you are able to tweak a lot of parameters which you wouldn't be able to tweak if you were built on some separate base layer where you inherit all the flaws and design choices of that base layer like ethereum is a good example you can't really mess with block time right if you are just building a smart contract project on top of it but when we are building hydra we don't think about it as uh just another dex like some i don't know some uni swap clone it's it's very different from it it's the design is much different and we think about it as a liquidity layer for for polka dot ecosystem and maybe maybe the future of finance in the future um so so for that reason there are a lot of things you can really play with one short example is that when when you when you have a an exchange you can have multiple types of transactions some of them are just simple trades and others maybe let's say liquidations and when you are building it from the ground up you can actually differentiate between these type of transactions and you can let's say prioritize them in a in a different way uh you can you can just uh you you are not forced to just you know accept them in in a simple order you can play with it more you can maybe assign them different fees or different uh auction parameters or something like that i just wanted to add that basically that this means you don't have to compromise the use case because of the underlying attack right you build the tech for a specific use case and um you know if you're building this liquidity chain parachain hopefully you know you can you know these critical issues defy critical issues can be prioritized say on a consensus level so um you know increasing chance of um executing even in harsh condition etc so um it it allows you to um yeah to sort of to custom build a technology uh for for the specific um applications that hopefully will emerge on top and yeah there is this larger point maybe you have read the article from multicoin capital which is basically their solana investment thesis which says that like you know the world computer should be architecturally centralized meaning that you know all the all the projects or the defy or like crypto financial projects should have like common uh shared uh layer you know below them and it should be like super fast and scalable and all the all the jazz but uh i i i mean we are bullish on solana we are investors in solana and we really think it's it's a great uh ecosystem and it will be a big player in in the future um even even now it already becomes one but we or i don't think that uh this is how the world will like unfold or the world of crypto i really believe that uh there are enough reasons for for projects to build their own application specific chains and they may connect to cosmos they may connect to polkado they may you know choose some other way but eventually we will see like all this heterogeneous future of uh some big single specific use case chains or maybe some generalized chains like ethereum that will be used for launch parts as a launch pad for ideas and for a quick bootstrapping of ideas and then maybe this this uh d5 protocols which are built on ethereum they will span multiple ecosystem they will try to i know uh bootstrap their own validator set and become their own chain and kind of basically what i'm saying is it won't be neat and elegant and unified one layer and then multiple apps on top of it but it will be a huge mess of all these different kind of solutions for various reasons and you know like even financial use cases there are so many of them and they are so sometimes specific that being constrained to one layer and its rules even though the layer should could be super fast it's still very limiting and it doesn't you know unlock the full potential of of what crypto offers so two things that i've become very skeptical about over the last years one the first thing that people get the solution about the scalability right when they realize that scalability is actually distinct from throughput and it's not actually scalability if you scale the throughput while also scaling the need to consume resources for example making it harder for people to run notes in the network and then you immediately realize that all these transactions per second numbers are actually completely meaningless right that that that all the new projects quote that specialize in that but the other one and that's kind of where this hooks into our topic is um interoperability it was a very popular narrative for the last years that like interoperability between blockchains will be possible it's always right around the corner and i feel like like your entire thesis around polka dot kind of hinges on this idea that pirate chains can communicate with each other like in a seamless way and for example it's not enough right that you can communicate with like uh a one-minute delay or whatever right that's already not not great because it breaks the atomicity of transactions so i'm kind of interested how that works and if you have actually seen any like any real proof that communication between pirate chains is actually as seamless as they say yeah well i will start with the first point um because that's it will be a quick one um we are seeing even now the generalized layers uh even even though they they could be scaling like too high tps um if if you have too many daxes on on top of one layer and haydn adams pointed it out recently on twitter there will always be arbitrage opportunities and you know that means that the more taxes you have the more like price differences you you occur the more trading activity happens and on ethereum right now it seems like like it looks like a cancer a bit like there is growth uh in a number of dexes a number of of trading pairs and trades but the growth is killing the host it's not healthy anymore the the marginal new decks that is launched on ethereum is harming the space more than it's like helping anything so this is one of the reasons why even though you may have like um super high tps you know you will you will reach this limit sooner or later like even binary smart chain it's basically ethereum with uh with much higher throughput because it's like centralized but even there if there will be too many like uh taxes and too much trading activity going on you know it will it will consume all the block space nonetheless and there is no easy redemption for it just to separate you know the various use cases on their own chains and validator sets and kind of make them talk to each other in some way maybe some of them won't won't even be like fully composable with everything else maybe they will be partially composable and they will have delays in some cases not just for for like scalability reasons but also from the perspective of being secure because a lot of these things are less secure because of composability and i will let mati answer the second question about polkadot interrupt yeah so um the xmp the sort of the across chain message passing is is still um not launched so um this is a critical component that will be released um hopefully very soon uh first probably on kusama um and uh then on polka dot as well so that is that is that is a feature um that uh sort of enables relay to to to function um natively um and and there's a difference right between having a sort of this this relay having this cross cross chain message passing and and having a bridge because because bridge is something that you have to build again right and uh um still you know we have a very few working trustless bridges and crypto um so it's i mean integrable interoperability as you said is always around the corner um but i believe and it is this year when we actually see this happening and uh and i mean polka dot in a way is just a um another take on sharding um where you have you know these power chains being sort of their own child their their own charts and um it's you know all of these are just different kind of framing of the same kind of solution and we don't know how it's going to look at the end right and what i believe is the future is like very kind of flexible stack um so layered stack and very flexible so i can imagine that um there might be application that will be using different layers and you might not even know what layers you're actually using what kind of middleware will be involved in that and uh yeah that is also part of our kind of middleware thesis so um but intro interoperability is uh um i believe you know this year um we'll see uh big things we also have ibc from cosbos being rolled out finally with stargate update which uh which i mean i'm just starting to play with cosmos ecosystem right now as well to see how it works you know what is the state of wallets and and the ecosystem in general and i think it will be maybe even less than a year maybe six months and we will be sure if it's working or if it's if it's like if it needs another couple of years and then we can go back to some like shabby bridges you know bridges are hard to build everybody uh everybody early in polka dot ecosystem was like saying yeah someone will do the bridge and we will just bridge it and it will be fine and now people realize like bridges are hard and yeah there's probably only one really decentralized bridge between two smart contract ecosystems and that's uh ethereum and near protocol um and the set setting is that the rainbow bridge yeah yeah yeah i i think that one is uh is ahead of anything else everything else is much more reliant on some some centralized parties how does it can you remind me how it works again um not really right now i i would need to dug it up but i remember reading it that that it was it kind of uh it uses smart contracts on both ends that just you know lock assets and and it kind of works well together um but uh but the the thing is that near doesn't have nearly as much traction as and hype as other ecosystems so we may not see see it being too used very soon i hope it will get used and tested in practice because that's always what matters you know everyone has this like cool technology uh put in the paper and maybe even on some proof of concept production but only under heavy load you can see what really works and what doesn't yeah and there are also like different concepts of you know of building bridge like you could you can i think what they say is that the you know bridging two proof of stake system is is easier right than bridging ethereum with uh with near or with polka dot um but um you know i i think that if we go back to cosmos uh as fisky was was mentioning um you know most teams that you know most i don't want to say capable teams but the most capable teams that that we saw we we invested in building on tendermint have no allegiance to cosmo's ecosystem like there's no cosmos ecosystem i mean maybe uh there is but like polka dot with its first like feb free summit like you could already see that there's a there's an actual kind of identity of you know polka dot and um but you know where do you know do you even know that you know tor chain is is you know like took tendermint and like completely changed it or booked you know these are very technically capable teams and um granted i mean tender meat was there much much sooner than than substrate but then again like i don't know how much i mean i know that a lot of effort went into sort of changing the kind of the core tech that they took from tendermint right so um that's a big difference right that um like i think cosmos is kind of trying to replicate what polka dot has done right now because they realize that their approach probably wasn't um i don't know whether there was an intent to create a community or not but polkadot started as this identity um and uh now they're sort of trying to they're now not technically bridging these these different projects within the system whereas cosmos just i mean didn't really have that like um as in you know the tendermint and and cosmos wasn't as much connected as as a substrate and polka dot i mean that's that's my perspective so maybe maybe i'm wrong but this is how i see it one way to look at it is that cosmos is a bit less coordinated but a bit more decentralized and grassroots because it's it doesn't have this it doesn't have a shelling point asset like dot it has atom but you don't need atom to start being a part of even inner cosmos ecosystem um and it doesn't have uh you know such a big backing of entities such as web3 foundation uh and parity um so so it's it's a bit more grassroots it will take a bit more time it will be much more messy i would say and like let's not kid ourselves even ethereum which is right now the like the pinnacle of everything um it it it got pretty bootstrapped uh like pretty much bootstrapped by by joe lubin and and consensus and they they poured a lot of money into the space to build a developer tooling which is one of my other like strong opinions that you know tps and all the js doesn't matter too much if you don't have like really good developer tooling so developers can build cool stuff very quickly experiment and roll out new features very quickly on your chain um which like ethereum is like light years ahead of everything else and that's why we have seen like binance chain being built on tender mint not getting too much traction and then they built binary smart chain which is basically clone of ethereum so they can copy all the dev tooling and all the or the smart contracts from it from ethereum without too much like hassle so oh i didn't even know that binance pivoted from the tendermint chain oh they yeah that makes a lot of sense i mean they it's it's kind of messy they still have both so they have like binance chain and binance smart chain for example if you interact with torche and you can do it via bep which is like the tendermint chain but a lot of this a lot of this new stuff like pancake swap and all these like um clones of unisvab and other projects which are popping on binance chain now are popping on binance marching so they have two blockchains one is tender mean and one is ethereum clone yeah and and when we talk about tendermint it's also kind of unclear right because um you wonder what the play is there because i think paradigm is invested and tender means we can say that cosmos ecosystem has a major player backing them uh but i don't know what the play is there so uh it's it's pretty interesting to to to see it play out um they they from from what i understand they realize that uh for any for any concrete chain to become a hub or this dominant player and to accrue value they need to have a deep liquidity um that's why uh atom and or cosmos the chain is also building bee harvest which is like liquidity protocol for for cosmos and you know there is store chain as well which is like um which is uh part of cosmos ecosystem loosely set so yeah liquidity i think liquidity is the key for all of these projects and you know um it's it's kind of it's it's cliche to build a dex now you know there are so many indexes with so many flavors and even with hydra we kind of feel that we are already in a pretty red ocean however we are proud to say that hydra is like very different from anything else and we really believe that liquidity is one of the key properties of decentralized finance and that the best solution should should accrue a lot of value and and this is the backbone of of d5 like having deep and maybe even like capitally inefficient and redundant liquidity i just wanted to add that it's very interesting how you know like 2017 was kind of or even slightly before that was there was a lot of macro bullshitting like you know fed protocols i mean like it for for the time was like great interesting right but um it was like sort of replaced by this very kind of particular i don't want to say micro masturbation but you know you know d5 very specific things amms etc and um it's almost as you know like an over compensation from like these you know like depth free you know general thesis to like very specific things and now we're trying to maybe you know perhaps correct and uh try to get into you know like find a balance there um so it's very interesting how how it evolves and uh like you know even understanding mms and you know the the very kind of nuances and and and and and the small differences between all of them it's um it takes a lot of time and uh you know you have to have some pre-existing knowledge of of financial markets and et cetera and the promise is with something like polka dot and cosmos right i think it's it's that um if anyone launches a token even if it's on a different part chain then they can still natively access that token on your power chain right so every token is available on every power chain yeah i think that's the end game but there are some reservations to it like i said earlier the sometimes the composability is not desired in every case uh for a hundred percent of uh of what you can do with it like there may be like parachains or cosmosomes that will for any reason they may um like restrict composability for example they may um just white list some some assets that are already proven and that are not toxic or they may like um restrict the way how smart contracts uh from other uh like chains uh operate within within their own parachain or or zone just because they want to they they think that maybe the security is higher priority than full composability right now in on ethereum you don't really have the choice too much i mean you can do some things but um sometimes you know being fully composable means that you are exposed to all the external risks you cannot really control and then you know when something big fails there is this cascading effect of of shocks inside this system which which you cannot really escape and that will affect you um with with fees growing liquidations uh some prices may lose back and stuff like that so um so so i'm not saying that we should abandon like composability no like i think it's one of the biggest features of the space but there will be trade-offs and some of them won't be like 100 percent skewed towards like the most composability i would like to go back to what you said a bit earlier about the future or the endgame of um of blockchains kind of being um that there's like one relay chain and doesn't have to be like the relation of polka dot or of ethereum 2 or whatever but the idea that you have a lot of depth chains around that right because the developers really want to control the experience and as i understand it substrate is basically a blockchain builder it's almost like plug and play right where developers can select from different features and parameters and kind of build their own blockchain and control the experience of their users much more than they can today on ethereum and i increasingly think that ethereum is going to go in that direction as well so we only mentioned polka dot and cosmos um but i think that ethereum is going in the same direction due to roll-ups so there is this there's still a very prevalent um narrative that the roll-up game is almost like winner take all right it's it's like there will be one big roll up and um the projects that coordinate on that roll up right all the projects will be on there in order to like maintain their composability with each other um but i think there's also this completely opposite view of how it could play out and that is that roll-ups are ethereum's version of app chains where many apps will have their own roll-up and they will be able to customize it and i actually like after learning more about um how roll-ups work and what actually their like kind of drawbacks are especially with regards to the security model i think that um i think that's actually the far more likely variant um that it's going to play out that way i'll be interested in hearing like how you how you apply like these views to ethereum from my like let's say business point of view i'm not sure how to call it better um there is not really that big of a difference between um side chains alternative chains and l2s like all of them require some sort of bridging some sort of some way how to interact with with the chain you start start off from and then you know there are different technical tradeoffs and scalability features and like uh all the things you can you can kind of develop on top of them and you know it's it's probably more of a semantic divide like if the particular thing is side chain or l2 um x die chain works quite well it's pretty centralized but you know it's it's good enough for like some projects to to kind of scale into some some of them may even spend multiple ecosystems i may have optimistic roll up uh bass and also be on on moon beam or or on polka dot like i can see i can see this developing further like some definitely some applications will will span into multiple directions at once and then they will just you know see what sticks um but but yeah definitely ethereum even even like without ethereum 2.0 vision without this like full sharding which would be very close to polka dot um ethereum can remain a dominant player just thanks to rollups just thanks to side chains and bridges to other networks as well and like even if like polkadot or cosmos like that's a version of the future will will be dominant um there is still like a good possibility that major player will still be ethereum it will it will become let's say a major cosmos hub right with a lot of activity a lot of liquidity on top of it and if it bridges into cosmos ecosystem it can it can like suck out a lot of activity into it um and just you know it already happened it's already happening today there are some projects which are already being used on cosmos ecosystem like terra and tera is bridging into into ethereum and the stable coins that terra offers and some other synthetic assets are also being used on ethereum right now so so from my understanding you know if it doesn't mean that when when we say that you know this is the future like polkado is the future like it's bearish for ethereum it will change the landscape but it can change it in a way that even helps ethereum to take off to take off the pressure from the gas fees a bit while you know maintaining the things ethereum excel that which is like quick experimentation with a lot of highly com like interoperable and composable like projects i think that as as i said before that you know like all these um you know whether it's polka dot cosmos or or ether 2.0 like these are just like they're i think they're in essence sort of converging on a on a similar vision right and it's just to raise uh i don't know if you remember but there was a controversy with afri uh when he once tweeted like uh serenity or e 2.0 like the or polka delivers what what the eats 2.0 should deliver right so basically he was right in a way right like these like these are very similar um set of goals and in a way you could think of it as a as a as a race right like who gets there first and who offers this interoperability scalability whatever you want to call it first so it's going to be interesting i i don't know how how it will end obviously um i just think that um like they're like these ecosystems are not like mutually exclusive right it's not like it's gonna be one or the other um i i think that uh the problem with ethereum is that you know in a way it is a victim of its early success right because there's a you know ton of infrastructure or you know sort of apps value on it right locked in in ethereum's d5 etc so and i think that you know that kind of you know not only adds pressure but um sort of um you know do these upgrades you know break sort of composability or you know the uh break existing kind of um infra um existing smart contracts etc so i think that uh for them it's like for ethereum it's very difficult to kind of um to experiment at this stage right so polka dot cosmos they probably sort of you know can be more take more liberty with experimenting rather than um just being very careful with regards to l2s there is one thing i i forgot to mention and this is like zero knowledge proofs in general i would say that they can change how this all this works very drastically in a way that are very hard to foresee right now but you know all like every like opinion and theses i personally have about application specific chains and layer ones i think it can all be like change dramatically if zero knowledge proves will uh will be more developed and uh we will solve the computational intensity of them um so this is this is like let's say um black horse of of scalability and infrastructure uh a topic of blockchains like if we somehow um make some breakthrough in in using zero knowledge proofs we can maybe we can throw all the rest of the stuff we are like talking about right now out of the window so this will be interesting to see in maybe next three to five years yeah i mean it's gonna be it's gonna be interesting to see because there's a lot of different things going on now in i guess what i would call like deep tech primitives in crypto where we don't we don't know how it's going to play out because it's it's the narrow band phase of defy so like everything is super narrow band we sp we're really feeling the narrow band of ethereum now and we can kind of all imagine how great it would be if it was just broadband but we don't know what broadband will look like and we also don't know how valuable accrued to the things that bring broadband so like you know if the you know the fees weren't really high and now all the layer ones are going up a ton because people are like well if these things can bring scaling if these things can can um help solve then that would be great right so you know avax near kusama and and like cosmos as well you know the past few days have been doing extremely well off of that um and i i do agree with you guys too which is that it's actually better for ethereum in the long run if sort of many other smart contract chains are trying to solve the issue of scaling uh because they can one learn a lot from these approaches right i think a lot of the e2 roadmap has changed from seeing what has been explored on other chains uh yeah and i also think too that it just gives it a lot of vitality and it gives it a lot of um like robustness to the process um so right now it's really interesting to see on each layer two where you have like optimistic roadmap and then you also have like the zk uh synchro road map and the trade-offs there are like quite different um and i think a lot of teams are now like looking at polka dot they're looking at cosmos but it's still very early days as well so i kind of see it as like it's very difficult if you're if you're trying to build an ethereum right now and the frustration is real among a lot of the application teams like we you know we've invested in app teams where they have to delay mainnet because there's just absolutely no way they can get users to to kind of interact with it right and there's you know there's this big dark horse which is i mean i think the real dark course has been bsc right where you know they've just come and said okay you know like even though it's basically a poa it's basically proof of authority but they said well it's almost like it's almost like ethereum it's almost like d5 and then a lot of people are going and playing with pancake swapping kind of things and you know i think andre he said during a clubhouse um talk he said like you know if you're a d5 builder today just build on bsc like don't wait for layer two like don't do this just put it out on bsc and then at least you'll have something that people actually use for now uh because you know it costs you like 15k to deploy smart contracts on ethereum right now and you know the the the paratrain auctions they're still ongoing and you know it's in terms of the spirit of like the grassroots experimentation my my fear is that ethereum will lose that for a while and so hopefully with later two it'll come back but um i do agree that i think zk uh would be a very strong approach in the long term but there's the tech is still very new um so so i do generally see the next few months as like kind of a a very volatile period uh in the whole application layer layer one space uh you know there's somebody speaks to that predicting dot flipping of eve there's others talking about you know solana flipping of ethan all these kind of things i mean i generally don't buy into this kind of stuff as much because i think ethereum has a massive network effect from it the from the erc 20 uh network effect and just from the uh meta mask and usability and composability and developer mindshare i think that's a massive network effect and i think ethereum actually benefits net from the idea that blockchains are actually useful and that people are actually using web3 uh it's actually the biggest beneficiary like of it uh i think to to to even the detriment of bitcoin um in that sense yeah right um i mean i think ethereum can maintain itself for a long time by being like a a place a settlement layer and a layer for very high value use cases but that shows very nicely how ethereum benefits from all these other chains because if ethereum is only for high value use cases then where is the place where people actually use a blockchain for the first time or developers actually deploy a blockchain project for the first time it can no longer be on ethereum maybe right i mean maybe it can be on a layer too but more more likely it will be on something that uses basic is basically a copy of ethereum um but it's more centralized right something like bsc um so it seems like bsc is going the route that kind of tron tried to go and kind of failed at it almost a little bit right i mean it feels like they are realizing this vision a lot better at the same time i think we see now like didn't didn't we see um a decentralized futures exchange launched straight to layer two i forgot which one that was but um there must have been a couple months ago and they are actually posting pretty nice volume yeah i think you are talking about perpetual protocol which are which we are like also an early investor i think we are the first money in actually well that's actually great so can you walk us maybe through like their thought process and the challenges of launching straight to layer two yeah sure i mean i they they didn't launch straight to layer two they had a maintenance ethereum contracts as well uh they did an lbp and then they uh then they wanted to like launch straight away and they realized the gas fees are especially for trading use case they are like untenable even it was like last year september or something i guess um and they realized that you know a lot of these d5 defy use cases right now are more passive you provide lp maybe you trade some spot from time to time you yield farm a bit but you know when you want to do some some more active trading with leverage which you are usually doing with leverage you are more active then you know the fees will be pretty cannibalizing to your p l um so they were researching a couple of options uh optimistic labs as well and they were discussing with this with me and then they went to xdi chain and the reason is that xi change is also a copy of ethereum uh it's something between proof of authority and proof of stake right now i think it's more leaning towards proof of stake um there are a couple of validators it's like it's not really too decentralized but but it's good enough for like some proof of concept uh kind of bootstrapping of fast uh fast defy experience it it was working well even before binance smart chain was working well i remember experimenting with bina smart chain like last year in summer and the experience was so awful i i like three times i thought i lost all my money somehow so i ran away from it and maybe you know i have a negative bias towards it right now because of my past experience maybe i missed out on it like in recent days but uh xdi chain was working quite well there was some uh there were some other projects porting to it some nft projects uh that are using it right now um meta cartel is also like proponent of x die chain for for some low value use cases so um yeah so so they just basically tried it and so they made it pretty easy to kind of start trading there um they and yeah they are seeing pretty nice volume they are actually i think protocol is actually now like [Music] responsible for majority of x die chain volume already um and yeah i mean they still like they want to attract more users so they will release some trading incentives so the real stress test i think will is still ahead of them but i would say that they are one of the best experiments on how to breach native ethereum into some other side chain which is very similar and i'm not sure i don't think they will stay there forever forever i think they also will move somewhere else in in the future or maybe they will expand multiple ecosystems as well um but yeah i think they are they are early example of this like being viable they are doing between 30 million dollars or something uh and i'm not sure now if if it's like 30 million or or what a day but yeah i need to figure it out but yeah they are they are pretty they are pretty successful in it um i mean the biggest challenge is to get users using it on the other chain right where do you guys see the role of bitcoin in a world of increasing interoperability i think that you know when people talk about bitcoin and talk about d5 like this somehow it's still framed as sort of similar or adjacent but i think it's a totally different thing like bitcoin is a defensive technology it's something completely else um and um the future probably something like you know like like bran has shown or some other bridges probably that is the is the only way to connect it and um i think the d5 is trying to do something else like bitcoin as i mentioned is like a defensive technology it's it's going back to the sort of um um like the uh i don't want to say austrian economic uh foundations but it's sort of it's revanchist in uh in that respect whereas diva is trying to kind of ride the wave of of the uh current kind of monetary environment um and um it's it's it's pushing the boundaries and it and it's it's going to get increasingly kind of disconnected so we still we still will see uh bitcoin in d5 but i do not think that it's related at its core i think i think it's more connected i think the narrative is like you know still um kind of disrupting uh traditional finance and bitcoin is let's say disrupting gold and monetary policy of central banks and maybe fiat a bit defy is disrupting all the rest like you know financial services uh leveraged products um all that jazz so i would say they are kind of connected in a way but you know they have very different core values and i think it's good that they do because we need both i would say we need we need to have some pet rock i would say something that doesn't change too often that is really like super simple and super stable and it's here for you whenever you need to just park money somewhere and just i don't know be super sure they are there uh five years later um i think i mean bitcoin has some long-term problems with with like uh with subsidies and stuff but other than that bitcoin tries for this value for this like being hard to change being reliable for the long run being simple um while all the other stuff is like you know it can change under your feet it moves fast you know you don't know what the next big thing will be so you are trying to like cover everything and and just you know diversify whereas like bitcoiners they they don't really need to diversify they have this one one simple truth the one big story that they believe in and and i think it's an important story to have and and to kind of to be able to go back to if let's say everything else fails it's like it's like a backstop and yeah i mean we see tokenized bitcoin on like being used in d5 quite heavily as well so um i don't think it's going to change too much but i mean it's clumsy it's not something that that is super elegant but it's happening and market demands it so you know market will provide i think that the fact that you know like bitcoin can get accepted much sooner than d5 is also kind of key uh because you know i have come to realization that that bitcoin is like has become like a pascal's wager for for many i mean for the you know finance industry in general whereas defy is something you know like completely divorced from uh you know like it is almost a mockery of of financial system in a way and um and it's re like even you know think about it how long did it take to like you know some of the more legitimate um uh in investors like traditional investors to to to accept bitcoin it was it i mean still there are only few in but d5 i think that's uh and and i still think that even there even when they're in bitcoin they still don't understand bitcoin um so it's purely a basic uh pascal's wager for them and um and then try to understand defy uh and try to explain d5 to someone who who doesn't even understand bitcoin i think there's a there's a huge leap so that's why i think they're they're totally kind of i don't wanna save divorce but they're they're they're separate things but i i definitely think that you know bitcoin will exist in d5 the same way it exists in c5 right so um but i wouldn't kind of think that uh like uh like defy on bitcoin and that sort of thing like that's i don't know if that's that's interesting one one sad realization i had a couple of weeks ago was when i realized that bitcoin is actually very uh c5 friendly it's it's something that that needs centralized infrastructure to to kind of work well and to get adopted and you know now all these banks are realizing it as well and instead of bashing it and calling it rat poison they are actually uh like onboarding uh bitcoin custodial services and some other investment services to kind of uh profit out of bitcoin even without needing to fully understand it because it's it doesn't allow for like independent uh you cannot build independent infrastructure on top of bitcoin right now and everybody was super hopeful about lightning network and how there will be laps like lightning applications that will be decentralized on top of lightning and i don't see that happening anytime soon no there is like three years you know later and we still don't have any meaningful use case for lightning network and partially that's problem of incentives like you cannot really make too much money running lightning note and farming on lightning like you would do on d5 but i would also say that the tech still has some challenges to overcome before it's really usable for for like the mainstream so bitcoin as it is right now is pretty it the product is pretty finished it's digital storage value it's it's simple to understand banks can like offer it as a service to uh to their customers and i don't think it's necessarily bad but it's definitely not what we are here for and to see full potential of crypto and decentralized consensus we kind of need to also look elsewhere while being able to go back to bitcoin when we need to when there is some you know when there are hard times or something like that and maybe one thing that i kind of um i didn't say is that you know they're obviously i mean we do see like um some kind of legacy uh players like market makers coming into d5 right so um there definitely are specific players that do understand the uh the nuance of it and uh um and and yeah so it's uh there there are some um sort of uh c5 players uh that that do get defy but i still think that this might be a pascal's wager on this side as well um you know coming into the fire and trying to you know like uh be on top of these you know uh amm uh experiments etc so um yeah um so do you think that bitcoin is already mainstream i i i think i saw you tweeting something about it or maybe it was our discussion yeah i think it's actually very close to if not already mainstream in the sense that um i think just a few weeks ago i saw something where more people thought bitcoin could could double within a year than people thought tesla could double within a year so i think there's you it'd be hard for you to find someone who doesn't know what bitcoin roughly is these days um including the the latest narrative as well for bitcoin which is as a store valued which which has a fixed supply i think pretty much everyone knows it and i think that for that reason like bitcoin has a really has a relatively safe positioning over the next few years just because that um it has that kind of inflow of people who say okay like you said the pascal's wager where you know they think stocks are expensive they think you know the the things they see in the real world are expensive so this as a piece of digital scarcity it it seems like it's fairly priced or it seems like it's accessible to them and they need to put some percentage in um but at the same time like i i recently kind of thinking a lot about the um kind of the idea of like of of the mises regression of money of of uh of how monies compete and thinking about how ether you know it it is really trying to go at it from a very different angle at this point right where you see massive amounts of ether coming out of exchanges almost every day uh you know the the amount of eth on centralized exchanges at all-time lows and kind of uh you know at the same time like the transactions being paid on ether uh on the ethereum network have gone you know to incredible you know to incredible levels the value transacted on ether has recently flipping bitcoin and so like at the same you know i kind of hold these two truths at the same time in my head and it's i i often debate with you know the three arrows isn't about like how is this really going to play out because all because also you see in the backdrop of this kind of bitcoin uh mainstream news you see if they're out performing relatively and you see people really get excited about using blockchains and transacting on blockchains and and so you know there's some part of me that wonders like is the mises regression not over right like where we are still regressing what is the base money and you know people still you know because because ultimately it doesn't matter what og's own if a billion people come into space and they all buy a different coin that's going to be the money right and that's there is a demand for digital store value so i think that it'll be power law it will definitely not be maximalist as it has been since 2017 uh but i think that that bitcoin ether kind of back and forth is definitely not over uh if you just see how the two approaches are evolving i think that was a great um way to end it thank you guys so much fisky and mati for the discussion and sue for joining us thanks guys thank you pleasure it was a pleasure it was really a pleasure guys have a great one bye-bye uh alright guys that was all for
