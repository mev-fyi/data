so welcome back to episode two second half of our top 20 on the biggest defy projects um i'm here once again with sue and arthur and if you haven't listened to the first part where we introduce arthur and talk about all projects uh index category and spot landing and synthetics lending and go back and listen to that first otherwise welcome back today we will cover kind of like ah we call them token bridges so basically bridging um kind of assets between different blockchains or between bank accounts and blockchains basically tokenizing stuff and then we have a category that's uh sort of money games which we get to and then basically the the three things three three projects in the top 20 that didn't really fit into any category of their own so we have yearn and nexus mutual and blueprint so welcome back you two and let's let's start with the bridges so the first bridge i think that we're going to talk about is uh ren uh or the india flagship uh [Music] asset is a red btc so ramputc uh rent was actually initially called a launch ico i think in early 2018 as a republic protocol uh initially you want to do like a dark pool for uh decentralized uh trading but i think after a while they pivoted to uh like instead of doing like a like a like a trustless uh asset bridge for other assets like studying for bitcoin and also like they have other assets as well but i think the bitcoin the red bdc is the most successful one right now and i think that uh the approach taken by them is uh is a very uh it's just a very useful and pragmatic approach because i think that there's a huge demand to use uh bitcoin in the d5 ecosystem uh or just in the ethereum ecosystem in general and uh the other solution uh when they were launching is uh rapid dc which is like a centralized solution which i think you guys talked about in the previous podcast and so reputation is supposedly the more decentralized version of of a bitcoin on ethereum blockchain and and is is done using like uh what they call a cryptographic method called secure multi-party computation uh smpc uh to to to solve this to make it trusted so you can uh like verify that there is a real bad coin backing this ram btc uh yeah or using the cryptographic method so uh i think this has been fairly successful since the launch uh the ram ptc has probably like the the second uh highest uh pdc uh like synthetic midi uh red pdc on ethereum blockchain and the first one is red ptc uh and it's getting it got it into the curve pool and uh gotten quite a decent amount of liquidity and it's kind of interesting that how uh rampage seems like the favorite coin for the a lot of the d5 hackers to get away with they usually convert their games to ethereum then to run ptc and then convert from ram btc to the real bitcoin and i'm not sure what happened to the do that afterwards but seems like quite a number of the hacker exploiter of d5 have used that rock to get their money out from the system um yeah and beyond that i think that the the value capture is okay i think that it's decent but uh i think that the number seems like it's uh because it takes a certain percentage of fee for every uh conversion like if you can wrap your bitcoin into a red pc you pay like one basis point and vice versa when you're unwrapped so uh the key challenge is what will happen to the fee if a lot of the ram ptc is just not gonna go through back and forth i mean once they enter the ethereum ecosystem that's gonna stay there and not gonna be converted out anymore so then the fee capture value capture on this part will be a little bit fake in that sense and there was also some uh controversy about the the current stage of decentralization on trustless i mean i'm not the expert on this but there are some who say that that currently they are not really using the real smpc yet uh it's like probably not like peer review or open source i'm not again i'm not expert on this but i heard some about this uh but yeah but so far that it's been doing pretty well uh among all the cross chain or bridges project i think it's definitely doing uh it's probably the most successful so far if you count uh rap btc out yeah yeah i agree with the characterization as a wbdc competitor also because they sort of disagree with the characterization of it being just this um so i'm also not an expert on this but i think that the right way to think about multi-party computation is basically just an implementation of multi-signature right so it's sort of like a consortium where you have different machines in the ren office or wherever they store it but controlling or holding all the the actual btc in custody and then issuing wren run btc against that on on ethereum but uh yeah i mean they they can kind of change change this at any time i think they have full control over it yeah so i don't uh i don't actually see this as just as i see it right now is fully custodial uh which might be totally fine right so you can it tethers fully custodial right but it's it's value proposition it's regulatory arbitrage and that's kind of the bracket where i put rand btc into right now um and it's kind of proven by yeah all the hackers using it to cash out their their btc and so far the rent team has never stopped any of those withdrawals although they could and that alone shows that it's custodial they do want to go i think in the future into a direction that's a bit more like tbtc so you have kind of fidelity points right so for for the different notes that that custody the key shots of those bitcoins so you would then have a protocol that watches watches the behavior of the custodians and they have to put up a bond and when they misbehave for example they deny a withdrawal or they withdraw coins that don't have authorization then their bond would be confiscated so that's that's i think a possible direction for for rent to go but it it has this trade-off right if you want your custodians to put up additional bonds then that the system will become more expensive to you so i actually think it's it's necessary for them to start with this custodial way because if if the system was expensive to use right from the start then i think it would be way harder to build the necessary network effect and liquidity for this token so that users might eventually be willing to to pay like this kind of up charge for additional security does any of you know much about terra yes uh so yeah uh i i'll talk about error i actually have a pretty decent understanding of it uh so i think terra was actually uh also like uh it was ico launched in 2018 uh actually they raised a fair amount of money and i think one of the reasons is because like the the co-founder one of them uh is like a fairly successful entrepreneur in the courier e-commerce market he launched one of the biggest uh e-commerce startup in korea called team on ticketmonster uh and yeah so i think that gave gave him a lot of credentials to launch this and and to launch like a decentralized stable coin protocol built on a cosmos sdk so you can think of them as part of the cosmos ecosystem and uh the concept is a pretty similar to the first initial design of pavement actually uh the precursor to synthetics basically that uh what happens is that the the user of the stablecoin will pay a fee to the terra token holder to pro providing this stability services uh yeah so yeah i think that that concept as a whole is very sound but i think on the like a detail on it like how do you maintain the price stability and the pack we won't go too deep into this but uh there's some some small challenges into it uh but basically i think that the general concept sound that you're paying the the terra the lunar token holder uh for sort of providing some backstop to the stablecoin but also providing the stability to that so but in in a way you can think of it in a real-world circumstances on a payment uh when you're using visa and mastercard for payment like numbers should get are paying like two percent for to visa mastercard for helping them to process this transaction so the logic i think on that level is very sound um i mean in a blockchain i guess i get why you can't do it kind of with in a regulated environment with resa and mastercard but in a blockchain environment can't you just wrap the the payment token and then transact with that so the underlying kind of terror coin or whatever it's called doesn't move yeah i think that is uh definitely a way to get around it but again that i think that uh the the crust is like the negative effect of the yeah the original stable coil is so strong that your red version will not be able to overcome it so there's definitely a lot of effort that you need to go to build the network effect and the distribution channel for that original version of the the terra stable coin so that even if a person wrap it you will not get accepted anywhere and the main use case of terra stable coin has always been in the korea common scene i think mainly some e-commerce so they actually if you measure it by some metric they have the largest amount of fee paid to use a protocol because uh they have a child app that in korea you can download the app and use it to pay for a lot of e-commerce services uh i mean they have some way to get around it so that the users are actually not using the stablecoin uh but in a way that they are using the stablecoin i'm not sure the exact detail i don't really use it before but uh that actually lead to some new feed generation for the terra uh validator and sticker so uh the generator of mlv and the daily user is pretty impressive i think that they have more than one and a half million of total register user and uh daily user is like i think fifteen thousand each uh exact number but uh it's probably the most successful if you measure it by real world adoption in terms of payment so uh the current user uh through the chai app are using a tera protocol for the payment services and interacting with the stable core in some indirect method um but i think that uh uh and they are trying to get into d5 right now i think that uh what they realize and they spend a lot of effort to build the eco the commerce adoption in korea and actually they want to expand to southeast asia as well uh but it's the real world move way slower than the crypto so i think that they're recognizing that right now and they're actually trying to move into the d5 space by doing some i think they launched a new thing called the mirror protocol i think they partnered with some of the other cosmos ecosystem project and i think that with the launch of the cosmos ibc they might be able to interrupt with each other uh so i i think it's doing very well um it's just that their approach is not so crypto native uh compared to most of the probably all the other d5 protocol that we are talking about right now so yeah it's i think that it has a good amount of success in the mainstream space something i didn't understand yet so the the terrorist a bitcoin is it backed by dollars in a bank or uh is it what is it backed by it's actually backed by the lunar token so it's a little bit synthetic yes again i'm not expert but i think that's how it works and the fee uh that go to the lunar token is what makes the luna token valuable i see i see okay gotcha anything on terra sue yeah i don't really consider it the five per se i mean it's definitely uh like crypto and then finance but i'm not sure if it's full d5 just because of the way that it uh it's not really interop with with anything that's currently in d5 and then also i think i mean there's the way that the the original token sale for tara was done i think it's um it makes it quite a different project i mean it's kind of got this interesting thing right where it's a korean project but then it has this like very long list of investors that are like like like standard crypto funds uh it's just it's just kind of i never quite understood that but but i think maybe that's a product of the time that it was conceived in um but with that said yeah it's impressive the adoption that they have i'm not i'm not sure the business model for the [Music] for the idea of the coin is is is that proven but but we'll have to see thought chain i think it's it's it's a bridge like like ran btc but also has some elements of an exchange like uniswep it both tokenizes different coins and i don't really know how it works and then you can trade these coins on sort of an off chain exchange or is it not actually option because they do have their own blockchain right yeah so again okay i'm not an expert in this uh i try my best uh to explain how it works i think that how it works is like uh i think from a user perspective uh this you have a key group of validator that they're actually putting out more more roon the native token of torching as the collateral to backstop the interoperability of it so that you can actually go from the native token to the native token directly without using the red version so let's say you want to change from bitcoin to litecoin you can actually use torture to do so like it's a little bit like uh like a shape shift uh a decentralized version of street shift uh like launched by eric he's a bitcoiners ogb coiners um and i think how they actually is using the economic guarantee like there's always more room backing the collateral being uh like because they're using an ammo but they have their own version of like a clp model of am that are providing liquidity for this but there was always more room backing the mm asset so that uh you are not that worried that you will be like corrupted or what or might be attacked because they have more to lose if something happened uh but yeah you can change from like a bitcoin to litecoin or to like a bitcoin cash directly using uh torturing i think that is the vision like it save all the rapping hassle and the value capture is supposedly very strong like uh you all the fee will go to the roon token sticker and validator yeah i think that's my understanding of it and i think that it has a very strong community as well uh quite similar to synthetics in a way that propel it to a very monstrous game this year uh autophagy is still in the test net but yeah it has been fairly successful if you measure it by a price action and the performance of the token so far yeah i think rune's an interesting project um definitely seemed a bit a bit hype centric when it first came out but i think that the bridging liquidity design that they have is is definitely unique and they have a first mover advantage there as well it just remains to be seen what it'll actually look like in mainnet so so i think um it's hard to really speculate about it as a project until actually you can actually play with it and it works okay um so moving on to the final asset which is uh reserve i think one thing the most impressive thing about it is actually they spent a lot of effort at an earlier stage of their protocol to analyze all the different uh pros and cons of the different stable model and in the end they figure out that all of them have some key issues so that they come up with their own model they adopt a gradual decentralized asian model where initially i think the reserve uh the stable point the isv is actually backed by an actual dollar in the cash but they plan to gradually decentralize it to make it backed by the reserve right token itself um and i think one thing that set themselves apart from other stablecoin or bridge protocol is that actually they they actually want to push forward for the adoption in the developing country first and actually i think they spend a lot of effort in venezuela to get the user there to adopt stablecoin for pretty noble mission i would say because we all know how what how situation that venezuela is in right now and they do need a stable currency and i think they've been spending quite a fair amount of effort to penetrate venezuela in terms of getting their stablecoin become like a de facto currency instead of their own venezuelan bolivia i'm not sure how successful successful there has been but they definitely have a very impressive list of backers uh yeah uh earlier on so yeah that's what i know yeah i'm just going through the documentation right now on the other screen and it says the the protocol is supposed to have three phases so first the centralized phase where every token is backed by a small number of collateral tokens each of which is tokenized us dollar then a decentralized phase where reserve is backed by changing basket of assets in a decentralized way but it's the like it's it's more than 100 backed in every phase than the independent phase where they want to launch their own unit of account so it's no longer packed to the dollar okay so that's a pretty ambitious goal to build a network effect for that yeah and and their backers are like the probably the top investor list uh in crypto for the civic interest look at the investor list like they have a peter view they have a sam outman they have a lot of the top silicon valley uh investor in their in their list i guess that they changed their goals or their architecture pretty radically because this what i just read is nothing like what i first read about them in like 2018 when i looked into them so it's it's interesting to see them still stick around here yeah but i think that they are probably the well also what a few d5 protocol that don't really consider them d5 i mean i have never seen them trying to interact with other d5 protocol uh or like trying to work together with any of the d5 protocol that we have mentioned so far so now next is a category that's uh has a bunch of different things so let's uh let's hop i guess into urine you're in a sort of grassroots grassroots ecosystem with the main goal to allow users to deposit coins and then invest those coins in a way that the user can just sell and forget i'd be curious to to hear what you think about them i think that yen is the different i think among all the different d5 protocol that emerged this summer it's definitely you can say that it captured the most amount of attention and also have the most material price action uh on the way up and also when it comes down it helps it's also pretty uh wallertown uh and i think that uh the key i think that it's just that uh when when you put in the d5 perspective it's a little bit like uh i don't i don't want i'm saying this not to like offend the bitcoiners but i do think you shared a little bit kind of like a genesis with like how bitcoin was being born like it was a fair launch i mean yes andre connie is he's not a non but the whole fair launch method has a capture a lot of people's imagination on how a d5 protocol can launch without the like a vc involvement can be a pretty grassroots and community run car for d5 protocol and still be fairly successful and i think that if we were just focusing on this aspect and they've been fairly successful in that and i think the coin distribution right now is also fairly distributed uh we actually know a few big uh wi-fi farmer uh that found more than 1000 wi-fi and actually sold most of it before it hit 10 000. um so uh so the distribution is actually i think quite distributed right now and i think uh half of the supply is actually in the central exchange right now so i think a lot of people have actually just sold and bought it uh on and off again so in that sense is you can say it's a little bit like a bitcoin of d5 out of that it's not money the founders say it's a worthless governance token but everyone know that it's not really worthless because you people are going to pay 22 000 for one wi-fi um so uh i think that is interesting the first version of the product is really to be a new aggregator uh because there's so much new uh like you coming out like you have rv you have compound we have also a curve as well so like for average users it's very daunting to just interrupt all them alone so that you usually you can just solve all of your issue that they just help you aggregate and find the best view for you and uh the founder build is to use it himself and obviously he doesn't want to govern the project he launched a token to decentralize the governance process and i think that um that proj that product has been quite successful for the first one to two months and after that i think there's a new other other they they did not move fast enough to catch up with the new new farm so i think that i think the new some other new you farming uh vehicle actually takes some of the pvr away and i think that even right now i think that they are still trying to figure out a scalable way to run this new aggregation strategy because uh when the u is lower than a certain level people are just not gonna do it anymore because they actually you need to pay a performance fee and management fee uh for using the uh year and wow and i think that right now is the key challenges is that if you're talking about this new aggregation strategy alone the key question to us is is it even possible to get a market neutral strategy that is also scalable at the same time but yet achieve like a probably like a double digit apr consistently i think this is actually quite challenging and difficult uh and i think that version of the product um is uh i think that right now it's like it's doing okay it has like a 400 million of tvl but uh it has not really been growing for some period of time uh but they are trying to go for like a more ecosystem play method they're like collaborating a lot the other d5 protocol that some one of them we mentioned uh in the previous podcast which is sushi swap and uh also a lot of other smaller ones like pico and uh others as well i can't really recall all the names so and i think it's shaping up a little bit like a king maker of uh of d5 in a sense for especially for the more fair launch a non uh grassroot community driven coin they can actually when to collaborate with the coin and i think they can bring a lot of value to the table on how are they going to run the dial and the whole protocol and some synergy they can explore i think that kind of become like a not so pure play anymore that actually there's more to year right now i mean and they can become whatever the community wants to become in a way so i think it's a pretty special program but it's also make it quite hard to value right now um and it's even among the d5 coin it's also among the more volatile one and it's it's kind of like a trainer's favorite like the traders really like to trade it around because it's very liquid and it also moves i think that's the state of vienna it's definitely one of the top d5 protocol but um i think that it's quite hard to define what it is right now yeah yeah definitely wi-fi i think uh more so than any other coin of the d5 summer uh definitely a uh a kind of a zero to one moment really where uh i kind of heard a funny phrase today which was that this coin is so fair that i had to ape in as early as possible which is kind of ironic to me in the idea that you know it's it's like it's like you know it because it's so fair it's such a it's such a good buy at an early stage and and i think that like wi-fi really created this fair launch meme um the the idea that you can have a d5 protocol which uh 100 of the coins are going to the users by some pre defined metric and then see what happens and i think there's a canonical we're not canonical there's a cardinality effect that it is achieved by being the first to do that properly which is that like like arthur said it's like the bitcoin on d5 it's the it's the bitcoin on on uh it's like it's like you have the 30k cap which i'm glad they did because um that was contested for a while but it gave it a very commodity like trading style where you know that there is never any emissions so in theory if all the holders now just believe it's worth a million dollars it's going to go to a million dollars right that'll just happen mathematically but in practice a lot of them will sell as it goes up so it it has that commodity fixed supply thing that makes it very good to trade um and it has the kind of mythical uh genesis story which gives it a litter that is harder to replicate even if you have a project that does the same thing but kind of um is launched after wi-fi so i think i think it's got that but like others said you know it yield aggregation is a tough game in in the longer term because you you don't really know what fees will be paid and how those will be received and also like longer term if you don't have inflation then it will become harder to incentivize people to join the network because they would have to buy coins to then have a governance vote as opposed to earn them so you could have some issues with ossification from that i guess you could use your cash flows that it has a lot of cash flows right you could use those to buy supply from the market yeah you could you could do that you could do that there's a number of ways you can do it i mean i i think wi-fi holds a holds a central role in d5 so people use it as a d5 etf as well so that's why you see the trading volumes are enormous on binance on on coinbase and um but it's also very much a bet on andre as well uh because andre being the sort of uh volatile mythical figure that he is kind of uh is the embodiment of wi-fi himself uh so so it's definitely embed on him and and continued uh continued innovation and composability uh so i think you know when when people first analyze wi-fi they looked at it from the pure yield aggregation play perspective and they didn't really understand why it had any value because you could just do the same thing and they kind of didn't understand the the cultural context of of that project as it was launching so i think i think that prestige is actually it is very bitcoin like in the d5 ecosystem and i think it will likely to retain some of that prestige value uh over time uh just just a matter of like what what innovations will they bring to also give cash flow values uh to the users and to the holders i've been going through different stages with yearn in terms of like liking or not liking it i liked it a lot in the very beginning because same as compound it brought a lot of new innovation to the default space that when it's one of those projects if you tell people from outside of d5 about it then that's kind of what makes it click for them the things that you can do right this whole kind of super fluid collateral thesis um where we touched on this in the last podcast as well but where yearn was consistent of so many layers of basically tokenized balances that you could earn yields in several different different protocols at the same time all in a kind of set and forget nature so it's really highly capital efficient and at the same time it's completely like trustless and auditable and i think that really highlights the power of of the things that you can do in d5 and that you can that you can do with composability but then after kind of this like first match it kind of wore off then i saw that the people working on urine didn't actually care about the user it felt like they cared more about like tinkering like different stuff constantly rewriting how the project worked and and that's when you saw that like you kind of noticed that in there were like huge yield farming opportunities in d5 and they just didn't offer them for their users even though kind of the market demand was there and and it was huge and and projects like harvest went over like a billion dollars of uh of deposits when when urine was like at 200 even though yearn was had the capability to do this in a trustless way and and harvest was actually for like and almost until the end was completely custodial right so it was controlled by a single admin key like a billion dollars right and there was this fun exchange between i think you sue and the founder of harvest about stealing a billion dollars and they said like who needs who needs a billion dollars as the reason why they would have no incentive to steal it um but yeah i feel that was actually where i got really mad with them and actually sold my coins um when they just refused to adopt new faults and new strategies um i think they now are at a point where they have started to add new strategies and kind of move a bit faster um but yeah that's kind of the downside of this super fair launch approach where you just have no people really incentivized to to work on it and and the governance sort of so decentralized that um it's really becomes really hard to innovate yeah i i need to add one thing though i think that the core grow contributor indeed in deep form about yen um and they are actually getting paid uh for uh working on dirt as well right now but i think that uh even for a decentralized launch protocol you kind of still need a person to act as a leader i'm not sure who is the leader right now it's probably bad tech or i'm not sure there's still andre i don't think he is i think without a leader figure is when you come to some difference in opinion are you gonna go for voting every time i think it's not not the best way of resolving some key uh issue especially if only the insider know it better than anyone else so i think that's also probably one of the challenges like a decentralized community run protocol yeah exactly exactly so that's kind of the managerial role that was kind of missing from yearn because i carried kind of my what i thought was constructive criticism to the team and the answer that you got was if you want it then write it yourself that's what we tell everyone and i mean that's not really how you run a business um yeah right so they didn't really care what the user wanted they they had their own idea of what was interesting and fun to work on and that's what they did so but i think they are really turning it around right now so like the criticism that i brought forward i i don't think it's really valid anymore just giving my perspective on what really soured this this protocol for me for a couple of months so moving on to nexus mutual it's one of two or maybe one of three big insurance protocols the other two being cover and then there's one asian one that i don't know all that much about so let's talk about how how nexus mutual works and and what it does sure uh so i think nexus will show uh is very straightforward it's like a uh it's a mutual uh which means that it's a member based uh a pool and it's being an insurance pool that every members contribute uh the capital and uh have a claim on the capital pool by also providing uh the coverage for people who want to insure against them and as a in exchange they share the premium proportionally to how much capital pool they contribute so it's a fairly ancient concept it's uh and just applying it to d5 and i think it works uh in a sense that if you want to purchase any insurance for the d5 protocol or the smart contract interest nexus militia is insuring yeah you can go ahead and do it and it works so i think in that sense you can say it pioneered the approach of providing insurance for a smart contract which is definitely a big issue in d5 and in ethereum as well and i think it has been quite successful in getting that objective achieved which is to provide insurance coverage for users who want to interact with different smart contracts um i think that uh yeah you can definitely say it's fairly successful and the founder the team also is fairly legit have a very credible profile they work as actuaries and were in an insurance space before um yeah definitely a very solid uh insurance protocol but i do think that um recently it's losing i'm probably not the right way to describe it but uh i think that the way that the whole pricing model is designed in the bonding curve uh it's actually there's a lot of second order effect on the price and on the people who contribute the capital to become a nexus mutual member because uh at 100 percent mcr like well of course mcr standpoint minimum capital ratio i think uh you can't redeem your nexus virtual token for the capital which is eve anymore so you will have your capital stop and the only way you can sell it is you wrap it into a red nexus special and sell it on exchange and that is actually uh a lot of people don't think it would happen but it did happen and it's still there it's currently it's still 100 which means that you can't redeem your nexus future through the morning curve and as a result right nexus pressure track and rest substantial discount to the actual nexus motion i think it's around 30 or more i think 30 plus percent right now which um which i think is affect the confidence of some of the members because uh in a way that uh they didn't realize that they can actually get trapped inside the capital pool or they want to they need to sell it at a 30 to 40 discount on the open market and i think that actually this issue is it's not an issue if you're coming in from a user perspective of using the protocol because yes you still get your insurance coverage and you still get a payout if uh your claims is the right claims um but from a member perspective i think that i think that kind of make a lot of people will think twice before uh providing uh the capital in the future especially for bank holder because it's actually quite liquid and it doesn't give them the flexibility to really enter and exit uh not even in a short time but it made over like a more reasonable medium time frame yeah could you describe for someone who may be interested in getting insurance on some d5 protocol that they are using how does the claims process work who decides uh if you're getting paid out or not i think right now uh i think for nexus mutual it's a it's a bit of a debate uh and a little bit of a i don't think that's a formal on-chain way uh i think okay again i'm not 100 sure probably there's some voting uh but it's pretty arbitrary i think there's no like a formal kind of like a methodology but it's a bit more like a i think voting by the member and also combine some expert opinion from the the team as well because i mean they have all have insurance background as well so it's not a guarantee payout uh but so far they have paid out some claims successfully before do you think there's a way to do this in a completely trustless way so i mean we are operating with smart contracts after all right so isn't there some condition that you can define that is like definitely a hack or and then kind of people can 100 percent rely that the insurance yeah i think that yes it can be fairly trustless but it will not be like a hundred percent trustless because you need to rely on an oracle and in this situation oracle is even harder to define because how how are you going to define oracle for a hack right because it has to go through a human to decide oh we think that this is an attack uh so that we agree to pay out the claim so even on the definition alone that you can debate for a fair amount of time on that uh so i think that you'll be you can go fairly trustless but you will not be like a fully trustless purely run by code kind of way yeah yeah that makes sense so luke ring is the first uh dex uh in ethereum to adopt a ck raw and when uh yeah it was an and it's this is i can you can say it's a quite a big success in that sense that they are the first to adopt a dkr layer 2 solution and when they do the the process of starting the zk rob i think that was a get quite a lot of buy-in from a lot of people in the community and because it's the first practical implementation and it works right now because you can use the z hero of a loop ring for both the dex trading and also for transfer uh i think the transfer part uh is not really the major the initial objective but just that because so cheap to transfer on layer 2 they can't say that why not we also advertise this benefit as well because you can transfer from two different accounts in the zkrok with a very very low cost and very quick as well so i think that's kind of some uh expansion of the scope and i think they were all the book based model because if you're using using secret is quite cheap the gas cost and the performance is quite good so you don't really need to use that name but i think the challenge is a audible model it's not that good for book stripping liquidity for decks uh i didn't think right now they're actually going to offer a text for loop ring as well instead of a pure order book model so i think in that sense uh the zikro the techno technical implementation is definitely very successful but i think in terms of running a decks uh their volume is not really in the top 10 uh right now and even the user i think it's okay but obviously you can call it like a very successful and i think but one thing unique about roommate is also one of the very few team where uh the team is actually based in asia a big part of the team the engineering team uh yeah which is i think it shows that there are some dividing in asia as well so yeah and technically they are pretty solid uh but they're just pretty uh under the radar and pretty low profile in a sense what do you see as the challenge for basically those launching a new layer 2 solution like like you bring i mean if i look at this i i'm asking myself so what is actually the incentive to deposit any tokens there right right so don't you have to kind of chicken egg problem yeah exactly i think this is a big issue right now and it will get worse next year if a lot of the later to launch and we don't really get the consensus of which one that we are going to use i think this it's going to be a pretty chaotic situation i think that uh from what we learned in the d5 summer uh incentive works i think that actually some of the layer two solutions should actually experience a usage mining in a way that you give people some incentive to try it out to use the layer 2 solution and also to incentivize the other protocol to be on top of you as well so you gain the network effect and i think it becomes a bit like a game theory that which one are you going to adopt like right now it's basically that's middle and the smaller different program are all waiting for the bigger protocol to make a first move before they make a move because if they move and the bigger one moves to another one it's quite pointless you lose all the composability so it's it's a bit like a chicken game right now uh and i think that the layer two team can probably do something to nudge them again i i think that's just my idea and it's definitely not an easy problem to solve but i do believe that incentive goes a pretty long way to help to uh tackle this issue yeah right usage mining sounds like like a very viable solution to this problem right given that blueprint already has a token uh and i assume it gets it earned some kind of fee from oh yes oh yeah one thing about ring is uh the user do get some uh fee from the trading volume uh i think that's if you if you become a rubric staker uh i think you get a pretty substantial percentage of the fee that going through the loop ring exchange but it's all just because the loop ring actually doesn't do that much volume there's not much feed to be distributed right now so then we move on to our final category um we were kind of debating uh before this broadcast this should even be included it's defy coin um but coin gecko includes it so we will talk about it and it's very popular right now so it's the kind of ponzi game slash money games empty set dollar esd and ample forth so arthur could you describe uh how those work and why they are so popular right now yeah i again are probably not the best person to explain this uh so but i try my best uh md set dollar is a algorithmic stable coin that use a normal economic incentive to incentivize the price to be stable right now the target do is to be stable around one dollar over a medium to long term and they use they're making a lot of economic incentives to bootstrap the initial network effect uh so that people are gonna participate in bootstrapping the network at the beginning so the incentive of being early is extremely high if the esd market cap did end up expanding which it did so i think when it gets started it obviously started from zero uh and right now it's at around 500 million market cap and when you think about it it's actually quite insane because that's actually the maker market cap as well um okay it's getting close it's 430 right now but i used to it was like 500 yesterday so um it went from zero to 500 million i think in two months and by expanding the supply of the esd to the to the user who participate in economic incentive game which is uh you when the esd trade below one dollar there is an incentive to burn the esd so you acquire something called a coupon and what you can do with the coupon is if esd trade above one dollar in the future you can use it to redeem for more esd so let's say you burn one one esd you can claim like one and a half or 1.3 esd in the future if esc trade above par again when it go below pass so there's incentive for the esd participant to burn their esd when it's below par to a certain extent so that they can get more esd when it go above parking and there is an expiry date to the coupon so that if you if it doesn't go above one dollar within a certain time period i think for esd is around one week and then the coupon will expire worthless so uh there is a lot of game theory uh component into esd on how do they stabilize the price and bootstrap the initial value value and the network effect of it but another way to describe it is also highly speculative and it's a bit of a game theory game in a way that you have to know what other people is gonna do so you can front run them a little bit to do something before they're gonna do it and you also want to be the first one to exit when you trade substantially above one dollar so that you you can sell before a trip below one dollar again so there's a lot of speculating element into it uh and i can tell a lot of people are very interested into it right now even people who i don't expect to be participating in discount game i have some professional traders professional market maker like in the professional uh training firm yeah they have also doing it on their personal account which is to my surprise yeah i think that's what i think probably have more to add on this as well yeah i think you know the the idea of an algorithmic stablecoin is not bad right because all money is a is kind of a money game uh where it's a shared belief uh and we're definitely in the very early stages of figuring out which ones may or may not work i think ample fourth was an early project i think mid-2019 it launched it had some backers so there's an investor allocation and then it did a i think did an io on bitfenix um i think it was started at like 150 market cap and then went up slightly and then went down a ton all the way down to all the way down to um like 10 or 15 mil and then this year uh with the with the usage of the uniswap uh geyser where people supply ample and uh wrap teeth into uh into a pool that kind of stabilized the price and and allowed it to start going through an expansion cycle and it kind of did a 50x i think from the bottom uh in market cap so obviously captured everyone's imagination because people before this kind of assumed that this kind of algorithm queen wouldn't really work in practice uh and i think that apple 4 was interesting because it gave people some ideas of what works and what might not work i think yam then i would kind of consider the same in the same vein where they like the ideas of the rebase uh but but ironically now i think they're actually considering taking out the rebase so i think i think rebates expansion to contraction it it's ultimately a double-sided sword if you think you can create the mechanisms that incentivize people to um to kind of do you know do the actions that would you know and and risk capital that ultimately brings stability to the to the stable coin then then it's good and if they can't then you know you you're probably not happy with the contraction cycles so i think e esd and dsd should kind of be seen in that light where they're trying to solve some of those problems that they foresaw and kind of saw bear out in the apple case um but again like even at the 500 ml market cap like it remains to be seen exactly how it'll play out with the dow in terms of um in terms of coupons right in terms of how it how the game theory works where does it make sense to just buy the coin itself or does it make sense to to uh to play the coupon game where you're betting that it'll stay above uh the you know that the t-wop will stay above a dollar um these are all things that this is so new that uh no one really knows how it'll how it'll accrue but i think the fundamental idea of an algorithmic stable coin um is not a bad one the key is to get a reasonable distribution of of token holders that are not just trying to make a quick buck but are trying to build something longer term that that could be a uh decentralized money basically yeah i guess anyway i kind of disagree is the characterization as it being a stable coin at all i think that's the misleading part um ample thoughts may be the easiest to talk about so if you look at bitcoin in bitcoin you always have the same number of coins in your wallet unless you spend them um but the price of these coins fluctuates in the open market and ampliforth flips that around where the price of your coins is always a dollar but the amount of coins in your wallet constantly fluctuates so that's kind of what the rebasing mechanism does right and i feel it's very hard to argue that this makes your balance more stable right the balance fluctuates just as much based on market demand as it does with the coin like bitcoin so i don't think it's it's it's a scam or anything it's just a scam if you sell it as a stable stablecoin because people who want to own a stablecoin they want the number of their coins multiplied with the value of those currents to be stable they they want neither uh one of them to be stable and the other not right you can think of both ampliforth and esd as like a base layer money like bitcoin but where i kind of disagree is the way that it's being sold as a stable coin so we talked about amplified but with esd in esd not everyone's balances change all the time so they go a step further they kind of keep the balances of those who don't want to participate in kind of the economic game stable they can just keep their coins either in their account or in the dao and then they kind of incentivize some people to reduce their balance by burning their coins in exchange for more coins in the future and yeah i mean ultimately if you if you if you want to argue that ultimately these coins can have both a stable balance and a stable amount then i think that's just not going to work without some kind of backing i think that's the real problem like not really can you make money trading these or can they go to like a billion dollars in market cap and then maybe collapse and have a new cycle and so on i think those things are possible but what i don't see is that you will eventually convince someone to hold these as an actual stable coin when there are also other alternatives like usdc tether die susd and so on i have something to add you know is uh i i used to be fairly skeptical of the algorithmic stablecoin model because i just think that uh in practice that's unlikely to work because uh the problem is when it's below the pack uh even if you believe it will go back to the one dollar pack that it can go way below the pack before it start going there i mean you can use some economic incentive to incentivize that but it's who is going to stab me i mean nobody wants that earlier i mean everyone want to be the last person to support the price and then i buy the bottom i don't want to buy when it's going to drop 20 that's always a question if the algol staple coin stabilization method because you can't redeem me that part but um uh i think one thing changed my view on this is like i've been reading sapien i know it's a very popular book and i've been pretty late to this book uh but basically say that you know a lot of things is like it's homo sapien imagination and i do believe that uh for money uh there is some aspect to it and i do think that uh some people might claim it by adding a lot of the mtc dollar committee do recognize that it's not it's not going to be stable right now but what they want to achieve is to use the speculative component of esd to bootstrap the initial network effect to uh to a certain level where it can be more stable they don't think you'll be stable right now they think that you'll be stable when it hit like five or ten billion dollar market cap or even higher i'm not sure what's the target right now but i think that is that some uh possibility that it will happen there but i don't think it is a very high possibility event uh again and i also think that uh one key issue with the algo stable coin is it might not be there when you need it the most because what happened is on them like let's say what happened to march this year march 13th this year when the crypto market dropped like 50 to 70 in the day for most uh and i think in that moment can uh algo stablecoin withstand the test of being stable on that kind of situation that would be the greatest test to them if they can't i think the confidence will be destroyed in one single uh moment because that is not there to be stable when you need them the most yeah i kind of think that the the the entire question of is it really a stable coin is almost is almost irrelevant because because i think like everyone involved knows that it's uh that it's a that it's a game of betting on can this is this game fun enough that the whole world will play it right it's a good way to put it it's it's like you know you know laughing the world laughs with you right but cry and you cry alone so right now they're trying to get more people to laugh with them and i think the they do recognize that if they if they can get more and more people on board that the game is easier if the game is easily understood um then they can expand that way and you know if people own a small percentage of their portfolio in it like i did kind of like i was kind of drawn to the original apple fourth idea which is that this is a commodity money which is very deep you know arguably less correlated with other crypto assets right because it yeah like if the whole market nukes 80 then probably ample for it's gonna nuke also but you know in normal markets it generally exhibits lower correlation uh you know it might be like 1.05 and then it might not rebalance or might be like 0.88 um and so but but the but the initial problem they had was like liquidity and then later on they solved that with the geyser so i think i think like algo stable coins probably in the first chapter um i think they're the biggest issue i have them with them is just genie coefficients i think reality is that there's still not that many people involved in some of these uh and and i think the genie coefficients are not great uh so that that kind of makes it like not a distributed enough game um but i think if you can properly distribute the game and you can then create the right uh crypto economic incentives uh like you kind of need that mix of brain power and distribution which is tough right because i think you know esd they probably have the brain power but they don't i don't know if you can achieve the distribution uh and and have those waves of you know coin distribution profit taking get it out because the way that the dow locks everyone in right like kind of it's kind of like a cartel basically like you you kind of need no you kind of need nodes effectors and and so like but but then it makes it almost like uh like a relevant what the market cap is like the market cap you can call it 20 billion but if everyone's locked in the doubt then no one can you know it it it's only one percent of the people can ever crystallize that value um so so it's it's like the market cap is almost like a marketing to get you to come in before it's you know before it's even higher uh in kind of like uh you kind of say like all d5 games can can be reduced to fomo 3d right where you know that it's being programmed to go higher uh each each each period and and so you're you're kind of having to decide either you don't play at all or you play as early as possible so so i think like no one's really mis no one's really misled that it's actually a stable coin because if you thought it was table coin you wouldn't buy it anyway because you you know like like you're trying to you're trying to five extra money right if you buy this stuff and then you play with it um and i think it's like it's it's more bitcoin like in that sense where you're trying to make a bet that this is something that this is something that other people will like as a game it'll eventually because it's so fun it'll become a money and then because of that it'll have better liquidity and then probably be less volatile but it will always be like a commodity like money basically yeah i think that's i think that's spot on i think it's it's exactly right to think of it as a commodity like money same as sample fourth that has different properties from bitcoin i think where you're also right i mean equating like all money games in d5 to to something like formal 3d right i think some of many of the projects that we talked about like are not games right they are actually yeah like legit protocols where like people interact with each other in a sustainable way and the more they interact with each other the stronger they get but here this these are games that that have mechanisms that make the system inherently unstable that's kind of the whole point of it right that you have these these waves of basically fomo people depositing and you have these extreme incentives not to withdraw your coins that's kind of the whole point and esd it actually it started with i think a one airport on one epoch was eight hours unbonding period for your coins in the dow and then they raised it for 15 to 15 periods so five days and um i think that just shows that they like they were never interested in like making it more stable because if you if you want it actually to stabilize to get the coin back to one dollar then the method you would do that you would do that would be to bring more supply to the market right actually so yeah you have the re the positive rebates people in the dow get more supply and then those people can go to unisop and sell the supply and that's what pushes the price back down to a dollar but the the way they are taking it is actually the exact opposite direction right they make it even harder to to uh to cash out uh to actually liquidate any coins so you have this this wave where like everyone's balances grow inside the dow but when they actually want to withdraw and the price collapses to like 30 40 cents um and the question is always well will those kind of expansion periods make up for for the drop or would there be an eventual time where it doesn't recover and that you're exactly right that this depends entirely on basically how how much fun the game is to play and if it can find constantly find new money and new market participants to come in so yeah i i guess those really don't have much to do with d5 um in the sense well that those other protocols have they they do compose with uh with other d5 protocols i guess two small bits so kind of something like esd and ample i think they both use the the unisport v2 uh t-wap um as their oracle so that's cool um but apart from that yeah i think it's good that we talked about it because the hype for these things is really large right now but yeah i wouldn't really wouldn't really count them toward defy yeah i sort of agree is this this in a sense you can say it's d5 but uh yeah it's definitely a lot more speculative component into it right now than being used as like the product like us goods and services so uh wrapping this up so we covered all the categories um i'd like to spend a few minutes where do you see d5 going in in 2021 we kind of covered like the categories that are like very obvious kind of first satisfying the whole like speculative demand of the market you have bridges that the tokens to defy that exists outside of it then you have kind of the dexes where you can trade them and you have the lending protocols where you can lend them out get some yield on them others can borrow them um and then you have kind of the synthetics it's where you also can deposit or use your tokens as collateral and then create like tokenized debt against it so uh what is next i think uh one of the things that uh is like next i think next year uh of 2021 um more use case uh will be unlocked in d5 i think right now we're only scratching the surface we have built some of the basic uh base layer primitive like blending and borrowing spot taxes uh some asset management protocol but there are still a lot of other financial use case that i wouldn't i think there's still a lot of room to grow and proven this potential i think one of those insurance so i think right now only nexus mutual can claim to provide a successful insurance i think that there will be more insurance protocol to emerge uh next year and uh also uh derivative i think that a lot of the derivative trading use cases is hampered due to the performance issue of ethereum blockchain uh and i think that's on my account there's at least eight derivative trading pro call uh that is uh launching soon uh already launched as well so i expect uh this competition to be really heat up uh next year and we've combined with the launch of the year two solution and hopefully they will also unlock some other use cases like some probably micro payment and uh or even uh under collateralized borrowing i think this is something that covers the holy grail of financing a lot of people hope defy can achieve uh although it remains to be seen how it can be done but i think there's actually i think at least two or three protocols trying to uh tackle this issue and they are gonna launch i think next year as well and i think a few others um i think yeah i think we're just gonna see it continue to grow uh bearing any uh regulatory actions and it's also potential that we see some uh established uh fintech application tap into some of the uh product offering of d5 offered to their users you can call this cd5 but probably bridging this to the mainstream audience as well through their fintech offering i think that's also likely to happen yeah i'm excited to see d5 derivatives really take off next year i think there is a lot of pent-up demand to use these a lot of pent-up use cases i think if you think about existing d5 with borrowing lending and kind of uh being able to draw against an asset you you can kind of generalize that to being long that asset as a perp right or as a future so i think that being able to do so and then get really get the liquidation cost down very low almost low as possible you then allow people to use it properly uh so i would like to see transaction costs go as low as possible i would like to see um these kind of usability metrics really do really well next year because i think that then the then the canvas for d5 goes a lot bigger so i think whether it's amm or more central limit approach i think once you have that and it's composable you can for instance you you can package a stable coin that is like the coin plus it's short perm you can you know package uh you can you know have an options protocol which liquidates into a perp or an aggregation of perps there's all these things you can do but step one is to just get it get the market actual liquid get the market actually going so fun to see
