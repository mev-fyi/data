hey welcome back to uncommon core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles this show is hosted by suzu the ceo and chief investment officer of three era's capital and me hasu crypto researcher and writer enjoy [Music] hey sue it's so good to see you again i just checked and the last time we did an episode together just the two of us it was in june man yeah that's crazy almost half a year yeah man it's so good to talk to you again one on one you just you sent me a couple days ago a thread from from someone on twitter that had went extremely viral um about variation models for cryptocurrencies um especially talking about layer one layer one tokens right and um in the days after that two people i know from traditional finance who have no like none or very little crypto exposure also shared this threat with me and asked for my opinion on it um so i thought man this is something um we that we may have to talk about right yeah it sounds good so to me it seems that there's clear demand um to hear a little bit more about sort of how we think about evaluation models in crypto uh and now that we are making you know all-time highs again and so on um so yeah i just i want to go through some you know the arguments and approaches um that we've seen in the past and to me it seems uh i just sat down before this call and route on you know what i remember is like the the valuation models that people have used in the past to look at cryptocurrencies um to me it seems they can be like high level categorized in two brackets and the absolute and relative evaluation approaches um and i'm just gonna give this super high level overview because don't want this to be some kind of lecture um so in the relative approaches we have the ones where it's you know relative people look at something relative to itself right so they look in bitcoin they look at sort of okay what is the ratio of you know the stock the stock to the flow in relation to the price right um and then they sort of map this out right and get some kind of you know future price development the rainbow model it's in the same category hoddle waves in the same category where you look some at something that is internal um to bitcoin right huddle waves is sort of what's the hoddling behavior right what sort of the velocity of of coins in sort of the bitcoin economy um and map that to price right and many trading indicators sort of fall into this category and the second big one a set of approaches that model um the price of a cryptocurrency relative to other asset classes or other like external use cases i think one of the first that we've seen that sort of chris burniske pioneered way back in the day but that may also have been already like in some emails by satoshi and whatnot is sort of looking at the the remittance market back then when people thought cryptocurrency is mainly used for you know to send money abroad right um so they look at like okay what is that we have this thing in the real world what is sort of the tam of it um and how much of that can you know cryptocurrencies realistically capture and then arrive you know it's some relative valuation there and i think even more popular is look at like an asset class like gold right so people obviously value gold something like bitcoin or atm it does feel like gold in many ways so um how much of the gold market can we capture and i think those are pretty you know sound approaches um and then instead of the absolute absolute approach bracket you know we have seen you know people value these tokens as a company and recently that's a threat that we're going to talk about as a nation-state or in nation-state economy um we have seen you know pioneered by john fever like valuing these tokens as a commodity such as oil that you consume for fees um yeah and of course um you know as money basically um so first of all what do you think about this high level approach um and does anything stand out to you yeah i think i would first preface by saying i think that i think the desire to have valuation models has never been higher because of the entry of institutional investors who are used to these kind of models and equities and fixed income markets so they want to have some kind of solidity you know some some kind of kind of solid ground to be able to say okay the market is undervalued because of this over value because of this versus the model so um i think that's primarily where the drive to find these valuation models comes from um on the institutional side on the on the retail side um for traders yeah they they often want to be able to say um you know how does this compare to previous cycles how does this compare to to um you know can we map on chain dynamics to the prices that's why you know on chain metrics research type people are very popular on twitter as well so i think it's all people trying to make sense of things in the world right so they want to be able to tie facts in the world with prices in the world um so i think with that said um i think that uh i think the relative versus absolute is a good kind of way to split it out right because um absolute wise uh stock to flow is really the prime example of this right where um it's literally saying that um we can make certain predictions about the price of bitcoin from the way that its supply um its supply changes over time through havings and so i think with all these models there's like strong elements of truth and then strong elements of um things that don't quite make sense but um a lot of times it doesn't matter quite as well because it's all about coordination points also so i think um let's talk to flip an example where you know the question would be then why why do you have uh you know why why does talk to flow um just apply to bitcoin why does it apply to other things and and then clearly there's quite a few times where they have to redraw or refit it um and and so there's a lot of kind of i wouldn't call it pseudoscience but i would say it's it's not necessarily something that can be traded off of um but at the same time it's a very powerful uh coordination point for people um in the bitcoin market so because people know that other people look at this model it becomes something that uh is reflexive as well um you know just a couple examples of this kind of reflexivity is that most bitcoin ogs know that uh on the previous soft fork uh segwit bitcoin went out 50 in about a couple months right after so this time with taproot if they if they remember that then they and they believe that other people know this then they also want to hold for that right so and then similar for havings as well where people know that post having the price goes up a lot then there's coordination points right uh so i kind of see a lot of models as being actually like it's almost like constitutions or or or like uh like playbooks that people can follow together um and you're seeing that in ethereum now with the fee burning right where people are trying to say well we burned this much in fees today hence we must hold our eth harder right because it's even sounder today so there's kind of an element of narrative building whenever you have a model so um while it seems kind of um crazy to traditional finance people who really believe in the solidness of models uh the the sort of co-evolution of models and narrative is is something that's always happening right so so you're saying are all evaluation models ultimately just memes yes absolutely uh even if you take in traditional finance right you take a valuation model like when people look at foreign currencies they talk about things like purchasing power parity to talk about real interest rate differentials they look at these things and they try to you know ascertain some relationships right so part of that is doing some kind of like backward looking science uh sort of uh econometrics where they're saying here is what happened before and so we can extrapolate this um but at the end of the day yeah it's it's it's still something where you have to believe certain things about the world right and a great example of where the models of the past were shown to be again you know under subjective is the idea of value investing right which i tweeted about a while ago and yeah you know it's now been over 20 years that value investing has been sort of a disaster for those people and i think that um you know they have this idea that well there are no new paradigms or no new paradigms well if you look at 2005 the top stocks you know we're talking about oil companies and now 19 in the top 20 stocks are tech companies yeah so there there's you know it it it's quite and even if you think about oil itself i mean petroleum was found like you know in the 1880s right or 1870s i can't remember exactly but there there's kind of this desire for humans to say okay here's what has happened in the last 20 30 40 50 years and then now i've created a model and we're on solid ground now and this is like immutable and this is like truth that i found this truth but really it's like uh you know we're we're just a species living on this planet and making up rules and seeing if we can coordinate behavior from rules and make sense of things so with that said i think it's clear that uh in in crypto um the graphs for evaluation model um comes from that perspective so it's it is very important to be aware of what other people think is the valuation model for things and then also to see sort of when that can be true and when that can be very false right right there's two things i want to unpick here and the first the sort of the maybe the most central element you know to all of economics is sort of the concept of opportunity cost right um when we look and i'm curious so when we look at this you know sort of quote-unquote absolute approaches whether there's really such such a thing as an absolute approach um because you have a great example like people had this meme you know that basically stocks are cheap if they are sort of below a certain p e ratio right for example um but nowadays sort of the the the the sort of acceptable or standard p ratio is like twice or sometimes like three times as high right for for the the most valuable companies even higher and and sort of i think the reason is that you can only value stocks for example against its alternatives right so in the past people at the alternative like they would you know put their money in bonds and now bonds are paying negative interest rates right so how can you possibly value stocks without looking at bonds and all other assets right so is there really such a thing as an absolute model people try to create models and call them absolute but there isn't really no such thing as an absolute model another great example is you know western investors have been burning money in emerging markets for many years now because they buy a stock that looks incredibly cheap on the peak but then you know each year when they have earnings they pay them out all to to employees or they pay them out through other ways right i mean especially chinese equities you know these companies are generally not run to create a profit for shareholders so the company can make billions of dollars but that doesn't mean shareholders are going to get any of it right through dividends or through buybacks you know there's no so so there's kind of a always implicit assumptions in absolute model in models that purport to be absolute there's always implicit assumptions in what people are trying to uh say they're they're trying to sort of uh say this is uh the way that we unders that we can understand this versus other things and uh by doing so uh we will make some kind of uh some kind of progress so i think that uh it's for that reason too that you'll see different coin communities have different models as well for what gives a value so you know bitcoin the fees are not quite high these days so there's not much talk about fees or transactions right because if you do that then ethereum or other chains look much stronger but instead they'll talk about you know versus gold or they'll talk about huddle waves or they'll talk about um stock to flow and so that you know is is also a reaction to the realities of the world right and similar for ether uh you know there's a lot of high fee volume underneath there so they want to talk about fees a lot and you know and then there's you know solana and avalanche and you know high tps chains where you know user accounts are growing very fast and so there there's kind of there's always an implicit assumption behind every model um and that i think that's quite key to understand uh crypto actually as well um because there's anytime someone tries to sell you a model and say this is the model you use to value all coins and then you find like let's say crazy outliers where you then you ask them well why is the market pricing this coin that way and then you say market's wrong or you know things like that um that you probably get a sense that you're missing something as well you touched on one of my like favorite pet peeves which is i'm constantly talking about like with people who tell me that you cannot look at defy tokens for example as equity-like because equity gets all of its value from [Music] from the law right basically you're guaranteed you know that value as a shareholder of the of the uh of the stock but i'm telling them no it's because of the social contract that the company sort of maximizes shareholder value right they could do whatever they want with their money and that's you know nothing really that you know within even within like the the the realm of what's legal there's still like so much they can do and so um i really like that you said that and the other point is that you made it also very good um where each coin in each sort of project wants to be valued on you know in a framework or metric that makes them look really good right so that's why all of the the high tps chains they want to only compare themselves with like low transaction costs and high tps right and then you have you know something like bitcoin that wants to like once you com wants to sort of value itself in in uh you know something that makes bitcoin look good right so each community is sort of its own sell side research basically yeah exactly so when we look at um [Music] when we look at these valuation models i think what something you said is that um there's basically a beauty contest right going on in crypto at all times or like a coordination game where you want to you want to predict what valuation models other people are going to use um you know and understand what according to those models what coins um will do the best right um so there's basically like a matter like how how much focus do you spend on like a meta game like that i think it's pretty important to understand especially when people kind of over estimate uh certain narratives or underestimate others so i think a good example of this was eip 1.59 which was a very bullish catalyst going into it um and extended through a bit after as people started to see the burn but then as people started to you know think about it a little more logically they would they they started to say okay well even if i'm burning a lot of fees now uh but it hasn't you know the chains not scaling on layer one but meanwhile all these new users are coming in and these are not you know necessarily wealthy people these are people that want to be able to use dfi on a thousand dollars these are people that want to be able to use applications um [Music] then maybe you know having a culture where you're you're celebrating high fees uh can be a turn off right and and can be quite quite dangerous also so you know then we kind of saw a big surgeon in layer one activity where you know they they kind of you know were able to capitalize on a lot of the news coming in right with you know b and b and and bsc but then also with solana and ftx and you know with avalanche and their bridge and phantom and you know there's a number of these uh lira ones that have performed incredibly well sort of after yeah five nine so there's kind of an example where you know uh if you're purely from a fee perspective you may say well you know uh is burning the most fees has the most revenue has the most unchained revenue since it has the best p e ratio then you kind of missed the whole point right of what what the market will do next because um the the the kind of reality is that uh there is also a philosophical debate there that that can happen where people might think okay well um you have the highest fees now but if the next one billion users go to other chains uh will not some of the users on your chain now go to those chains as well right so sort of to sort of join where the new party is uh so this is kind of what's happening in the afc space as well unfortunately as well right where you know ethan fc's have really fallen quite a bit in large part because of salon nfts right because people can actually can collect these uh whereas no one's gonna buy a one either nft and pay point one ethan gas right so they're having to compete with these kind of bots to do that so there is a there is kind of a double-sidedness to to sort of each narrative really right and and so the it is important to see sort of where that narrative can be coming a little bit dangerous uh and where it's sort of um sort of less so right so i i think that you know bitcoin uh uh you know for some time it had a kind of a dangerous narrative uh where it was you know much too tied to um to you know elon pumping it basically and and things like that and and so uh when he you know started to talk about the mining uh you know cleaner dirty mining and then we had the china foot as well you know that became very dangerous but then you know as the market kind of stabilized and you know increasing amounts of mining moved uh out of china and you know into sort of very renewable and very sustainable sources i think there is something where you know i've seen a lot of people talk about how you know because you know ethereum is migrated into pos or pos is a strictly better uh consensus mechanism than pow then therefore you know once you know everyone realizes this then bitcoin will go to zero and pos coins will go to the moon right and and and sort of that that's kind of becoming understood i mean and as to the point that i've seen a lot of banks write research like this um and and so that that's been something where um i think that uh if they if they zoom out they'll probably see kind of the problem with that with that logic right uh namely namely that we can create umpteen pos coins uh we can create umpteen uh forks of pos coins as well and and there's um kind of a reason why uh proof of work for for um moneyness has has different properties than pos um so i think that um you know i've talked to some guys that are like some of the biggest farmers on ethereum and they said they actually would prefer if it stayed pow because it's lindy like they know how it behaves yeah as if it goes to pos then the lindy clock is reset to zero and they wonder where you know they if they want to wait at least six months be for farming big you know um and these are huge farmers on huge d5 users on ethereum so i think that um the pow-verse pos narrative is another example where you know if you if you take a model where you know any use of energy is waste then you kind of will then say well then why is bitcoin number one the market is wrong right and you kind of ignore the fact that you know now in the u.s stock market there's a ton of bitcoin miners being listed there's huge investment appetite there's huge courting of bitcoin miners by states by texas virginia west virginia you know uh all across the emerging market as well so so i just think that that there's another example where you know for a while the sort of dangers of pow or sort of the ways that it could get attacked were underestimated and then now it's sort of very overestimated and sort of the advantages of pow are not understood i mean what what people who say bitcoin is dying or like the proof of stake queen can replace bitcoin what they also typically miss i think they tend to be newer people in crypto and what they tend to miss is that ultimately what matters is the strength of the community and we touch on this with the side side you know the community being sort of a coincidence that research and um we've seen how well they can you know if one narrative falters then they can you know invent the next one and bitcoin has transitioned narratives so many times now i try to show this with you know my article uh divisions of bitcoin in 2018 with nicardo this you know looking at this really helped me understand um that just how good of a bad bitcoin is because there's really no one thing that can kill it right it's just going to transition to you know the next narrative or the next use case and ethereum at this point has also like proven a similar sort of chameleon-like quality definitely so one of the things and then that's an interesting thing you said that i want to unpack so um one of the statements from the threat and that we talked about is uh so the value of a chain comes from how much economic utility it supports not from how much it captures um and you told me um that this statement scared you um he said it's one of the seven unholy top signs like the signs of the market topping out um so first of all why do you think that and what are the other signs well first of all the other signs are i haven't seen them yet and there's some chance that i won't see them this cycle so then there will be a super cycle as promised but with that said this is one of them where it's a similar concept to what i brought up during like the top of d5 summer uh in 2020 where there's [Music] there's sort of a this idea of the fork right and and forking of things and you're kind of seeing this with olympus now as well where there's now 15 olympus forks at least on every chain right and it's it is kind of scaring some olympus holders because now olympus is launching to avalanche as well because they are like okay well there's now like two different like avalanche olympus forks that are all doing really well like i i can't ignore this anymore right and and so there's the i mean forks have just a great ability to show people that you know what has been built what actually is novel and what can be copied but also sort of where things might fail right where you know if you see some of these forks fail that then you're like okay well this may also happen to mine in the same way and or also you know maybe long-term the value capture isn't quite as strong as they thought uh because a lot of stuff in crypto it does follow a kind of thing where you need to be early in that thing right so if you're not early in it then it defeats a lot of the purpose of it to begin with right so once things get to a certain point there's you know there there there is this fear of not being early anymore and this fear drives people into things where they think their higher chance of being early and so when that happens uh then the question is what kinds of what kinds of investments make sense uh given that and what kind of investments are more exposed right and so the idea that um that you know the way to value blockchains is by the economic utility of them uh and not the value they capture um you know th this is and then and then more so to value them as like nations right um i think this is very tricky um i recently talked to maddie who we had on our podcast as well and he was talking about the idea of tribes and and sort of what he that he was positing a similar concept where he's saying what crypto does is it enables tribes to come together and there are many different tribes and then these tribes just are creating a lot of this value because of their ability to coordinate and their ability to make do economically useful activities for each other right and i think creating like fomo and other people who want to join the tribe but they sort of need to buy the token to become part of the trip yeah and i you know we we discussed privately and then he later on said yeah like the he actually thinks most of the tribes that are formed now will fail right uh like 95 plus he he said and and so there you kind of see the point where yes it is very easy to create tribes uh in a bull market where the coins are going up the question is what tribes are sustainable when coins are going down a lot right so as we saw in 2018 2019 you know ethereum had reasons for people to stay involved even though the number went from 1450 to 80 in a year uh less than a year actually so whereas other coins that happened and then everyone left right and it didn't really bounce back so um economic activity on the chain uh capturing value these kinds of things there there definitely needs to be some value capture mechanisms long term so um in the case of ethereum it's now through this v-burn process but also through this uh the the use of ether as pristine collateral in d5 which is great right and then also in other chains you know that are similar to ethereum like avalanche they have a similar concept right yeah p one five five nine and they have you know deflationary coin and similar with tron similar with other coins and and proof of stake right and pretty mistake as well right where you you have some kind of like mev uh capture potentially and you also have some kind of um ability to earn a yield uh using the native asset right yeah yeah so so i think that while these are while these are very kind of important concepts there's the it can be dangerous to tie uh prices to economic activity uh or to or to raw utility uh from any specific model because again you must have a market where the people believe this is true right so some some strong counter examples some counter factuals to this might be something like a cardano right which has almost no utility yet uh but it's still doing extremely well right as one of the best performers since the bear market and uh missile's a great community um and you know the first thing any normie ever asks you about you know he'll ask you about your view on cardano probably um and and so the question is like well what have they really achieved through this well they've created a great meme right they created something that's really speaks to people um you know so so i think that that's something that you know always kind of throw throw throws a wrinkle into everything right and you know so somewhere with stuff like doge stuff like sheep uh where there's none like mimetic value as well and then the question becomes well is there actually a lot of difference between chains with utility than having value or memes having value or are they both memes and they are memes that appeal to different people in a different way you see what i'm saying because then if you go to bitcoin itself bitcoin itself has one of the lowest utilities on chain but has the biggest market cap by far and so there again it's like you know bitcoin in a way has more similar things to some of the chains like cardano or like doge or like sheep than it does to a chain which tries to say i'm i'm tied to the utility on myself yeah i mean we see this in not just in crypto right we see there's now everywhere that in stocks and so on right because i mean if you look at why is tesla like worth you know as much as like the next what is it like three or four next biggest car companies combined it's not because they you know sell more cars um or have higher margins no it's because they are selling a story right yeah they they let you be part of the tribe you know of those visionary people who are saving the planet and whatnot right um so in that sense why this like maybe a spicy question what do you think is the biggest tribe in crypto that can still fail i think from a purely just you know philosophical perspective anything can fail right um so i think there's always failure points in all these things just like there are failure points in all nations and all companies and all in all things right like i strongly believe in the impermanence of all things so i think that with that being understood i i think that then the question is what which ones are you know you know they'll be uniquely susceptible if the market were to turn and what things are less susceptible right and you know i would argue like for bitcoin and ether because they spoke to some concepts of decentralization and they spoke to some philosophical concepts for people that people were willing to hold it and build on it during the bear market even though uh they were maybe losing money right whereas something like eos uh once the money was gone you know and kind of the coins all into a treasury and the ecosystem fund wasn't doing anything then people stopped building on it or people stopped caring as much uh whereas ironically something like uh cardano or tron they actually went in you know build communities and they they try to build utility and and and so there's kind of this it's kind of this thing where um you know what what what kinds of projects really need the number to be high for anyone to care and what projects does the number not need to be high for people to care right uh so that that kind of tells you a lot about the strength of different tribes um and so i think generally in crypto there's uh strong members in every community there's sort of a a weaker large majority um that uh will likely leave and in the case of price going down and then uh the question is how many of those people will get converted to uh the strong the strong right and does this strong number grow over time uh because a lot of people who came in during the previous cycle they came in for icos they came in to flip stuff uh dirt during the late stage uh maybe they bought the top of bitcoin and you know then they were like what am i you know just as a punt and then later they have to figure out what did i buy so i think um there is a lot of evidence that the current top coins are is relatively rationalist i think they have you know all quite strong believers they have quite fast-growing communities and i think that um i think that i can't name like any specific tribe that i think is uniquely about to fail or anything um but those are the kind of metrics that i would look at yeah okay so to summarize maybe you're looking at which coins which tribes did not yet have to do or have had to endure a bear market where they converted a lot of weak members into strong members and those are the most likely to fail i wouldn't say that most likely fail but i would say that um it is something to just keep in mind where um there there can be quite a lot of in the market that thinks numbers can only go up um so right as long as that's true maybe people will will like it but if the coin is uniquely designed in a way that as a number goes lower then people have no point staying then it gets quite dangerous and you see this with some of the d5 ponzi games right where if the coin goes low enough then no one will farm it suddenly the tvo will all leave and then if you were looking at tvl that as sort of your evaluation model then you get scared and you leave also right and you you also sell so um that's kind of sort of a canonical example of why uh you know first of all that metrics can be gamed by farming and and by uh these kind of ponzi games but also that uh it's sort of by construction going to fail if the price goes low right i mean it's basically a question of how much leverage and reflexivity is built into the token um yes and d5 ponzi games are a good example i would say ethereum in 2017 18 was maybe even the first big example of such a ponzi game not deliberately or anything but there you had this ico game that was happening on top of of ether and i don't know like 20 or whatever of all eve was locked ended up being locked up in ico treasuries um with you know removed supply from the market and and and pushed up the price but then once the market turns the ico started selling off endlessly all of those so supply back onto the market right so you had it on the way up and the way down and that's why ita crashed like 95 um much more than you know bitcoin for example yeah i will say that the coins of this cycle they are stronger in the sense that i do think there's something unique about uh high percentage being staked um if people don't care because they feel like they're still earning a yield and they feel like they're being productive i do think there's something to that uh meme where they're less likely to sell it because they think they can wait it out and then because they also know that everyone else thinks that way they're kind of you know they're there's kind of collective shelling points right um but with that said you know we really haven't seen yet anything where there's force selling right where you know either through redemptions from funds or or or through crystallizations or through things like that right where um yeah where there can be just you know or just profit taking or these kinds of things so um [Music] i think that uh it's very much true that that staking has created a very interesting flywheel because the more people stake the more people see that sticking and then they think supply circulating supply is lower and then they also buy and because they buy it then they want to get the highest yield on this then they also stake so then you know staking yields or staking rates have become sort of a broad uh benchmark for how for how healthy a network is right where the staking rates that they're higher and going higher and that means people have more conviction and if people are unstaking and then selling that there's like less conviction so i do think that that that's something that generally has seemed to work very well this cycle and that was one of our earlier sort of broader bets um but but again it's something where you know the downsides of stick or sort of not the downsides but sort of the cyclicality of proof-of-stake um is very is not understood at all uh by the market because it's never had to deal with it yet i think i think it's probably uh not really comparable to the ico boom i don't i don't think proof of stake is going to introduce a lot of cyclicality a lot of further cyclicality because of liquid staking i think liquid staking will just completely replace any form of locked staking and then all of this like when you stake in either you have it immediately have it back can use it in default you can sell it at any time so i think this sort of uh removing supply from the market effect um no longer exists in that case yeah i mean it just it just comes down to the idea of um locking up so in proof-of-stake and sort of the value accrual of these models there's an there's an assumption there which is that uh by locking up supply the number will keep going up right um and people will buy it because they see it locked right but um but again you know we're we're at this point where we're at you know 500 1 000 x's and quite a lot of coins and um also we're at uh you know quite quite broad understanding of these facts right whereas you know during the bear market um there was a very poor understanding of how uh proof's day could create these kind of things you know we kind of saw the first taste of it with tazos right and and and baking right where coinbase had to buy more tazos to support the baking of their clients and so that created a quick move from one to four dollars and that got people really excited about proof of stake as a mechanism and also with some of the governance that was happening and and so we kind of had to taste them but then it was like generally not understood that proof of steak had this kind of uh had this kind of a flywheel effect right whereas now i think we we are very much in the point where everyone believes this flywheel effect so i guess all i'm saying is yes it has a flywheel effect but everyone also knows it has a flywheel effect i agree yeah it's it's no longer really relevant because our everyone already believes it it's still true well it's still true and it's still relevant it's just that it's it's it's understood better so that changes something right yeah versus when it's not well understood at all something that sort of both the relative approaches and the absolute approaches completely ignore is sort of the cyclicality of markets right um we have to talk about this um we talked about all of the like the downsides um of the existing approaches where we think they're flawed but also what elements might have some some sense to them um so how do you think about you know reflexivity and cyclicality in the crypto markets it seems it seems like you can almost not not value anything without putting this in the number one spot yeah so i think on viewed on very long term lenses i think the sticky cycle category doesn't matter as much uh you can kind of just buy projects you like and then stake them and go go into a coma and you know or buy them put them in cold storage for the most part um and that will generally work i think that approach um it has worked and will continue to work i think that in terms of um you know weathering drawdowns or or trading around the market in between kind of different coins um i do think that um that approach requires um you know a certain amount of understanding that um that uh crypto does have elements of boom and bust in it by its nature of sort of being hyper capitalism right so we know that all markets have boom and by cycles uh viewed on long enough time scales just a matter of asking you know what what does that boom bust look like right for instance it can be a far higher number than you think right like um doesn't mean that you know bitcoin stops at 68k or 100k it could mean that it goes to 500k and then goes down to 250k for instance right or it could mean that you know like solana did it went from 20 cents to to uh you know 200 and then back to one uh 115 or so and then before doubling again and and so i think that um the the cyclicality this cyclicality has a lot to do with um when when kind of you know all the upsides have been priced in and when uh none of the upsides have been priced in or when some of the downsides that you know haven't been priced in or sort of the risk of uh the risk of replication hasn't been priced in right so i think an example of this too was sort of with sushi right where sushi fourth uni and then there was a lot of excitement about it uh first it went down and then there was a lot of buildings and projects and then it came up right and then at that time you know some people in the market including ourselves we had this idea that you know sushi could do really well because it would go to all the other chains and it would do this and that but then you know what we kind of started to see happening with bsc it was that well actually cake they made their own right and their own happened to you know have the support of the bmbogs and you know it happened to have the support of the ecosystem so that was just the sushi of the chain and so we started to see this thing where it's like actually uh you will just have that app but on different chains and then now with avalanche as well right like you know the the sushi of avalanche is trader joe and trader joe incidentally also has borrowed lending on it and it also has you know a bunch of other features on it so there's kind of this idea that um you know what what are the things on the chain that actually make it uh properly unique where will the new users go these kinds of things and and so i think you like viewed in that lens um i think that's um you know it's kind of easier for people to understand like the l1 moves of the past few months right where um you know like if people did they wanted to be able to say that everyone must value this decentralization of youth versus other coins or other layer ones hence they'll be happily willing to pay 400 fees or if they're not then they're just too poor right well actually what happens is people just have different priorities right or they have different concepts of what they want to do and you can fork all the applications and then go over there and i think there's also that idea then of like well all the innovation is on ethereum but that's not true right like we're already seeing incredible amounts of innovation you know through uh phantom through avalanche uh in just in the evm space alone right um i think spell is a really interesting example of that um but there's a number of other ones that are coming up as well and and so i think there's kind of this idea in crypto very often where it's like okay the these are the coins that have made sort of the the the og's rich or like the previous generation rich and now the new people have to all buy my coin and that's how this works but then the new people when they come in they buy other coins or they buy new things or they buy you know so that's kind of like there's these two um there's the two there's these two strains of crypto i would call it like one would be like the very institutional like us vc side and then there's the sort of like very grassroots or like very user-driven side right another great example of this is like kusama versus polka dot right where kusama uh has done really well and has a ton of this organic activity uh from the community and that kind of also has an interplay with uh polka dot in the way it's valued so i think the cyclicality of markets the the the most critical thing to understand is when there's uh replicability of the underlying thing that's supposed to give the the thing you own value right uh once you become aware of this you start to see that a lot of things are on less solid ground than they look at first right uh or a lot of narratives are less solid than they look at first basically you have to understand how much reflectivity and leverage is a part of your existing narrative how much of that is due to being in the bull market yes precisely my last question for you what valuation framework will help you the most in the next six months and which one will work best over the next six years i think six years is a very difficult question to answer uh i probably would skip that i think in the next six months um i think it's our general view that bitcoin is very under owned uh because there's a entirely different type of valuation model uh that i think you could use on bitcoin that you don't use on the other ones which is sort of political and i sort of alluded to this during my podcast with jordy where we talked about bitcoin uh and sort of soft bitcoin strength uh sort of the quiet strength and you know it's it's something where um you know gold's been flat now for 10 years and bitcoin's gone up a million percent right and on top of that bitcoin having the providence that it does as the first chain and having the fair launch that it does i mean we can debate whether other chains have a better launch for promoting utility or not but bitcoin being the first having the providence of the first um that creates a very compelling uh coordination point uh for people to store value in because they understand that everyone else agrees with this right and more so i think that you know during the bitcoin scaling war debates like should bitcoin become high utility or not it's becoming increasingly clear even among the pch people that i know that the way that bitcoin has done it is the right approach and now we've gone toward a sort of war of utility on every other chain but bitcoin is sort of able to sit where it is uh and try to be the most decentralized right right so i think that this value proposition uh over the next six months to one year i think uh is gonna really come to the forefront because we are very much living in inflationary scenarios in a lot of countries uh we have food prices going through the absolute roof we have russia um you know basically holding europe hostage over natural gas it's also holding a lot of markets hostage over the price of fertilizer china's holding a lot of the world hostage over rare earths and a lot of these other kind of uh phosphorus and these kind of things that go into a lot of supply chain so there's basically an incredible inflationary push that's coming um and and i think that uh this kind of stuff is very bullish for bitcoin because previously people would have wanted to buy gold but they can't buy it now because it's not going up and they're just you know as it's not going up and as they see young people buying bitcoin and especially wealthy young people by bitcoin they it's becoming a very pascal's wager at this point and i think that the this is also where the element of proof of work mining really comes into play and this is a flywheel that people don't really understand in crypto but i think it's very understood in infrastructure where if you have miners that are mining bitcoin and they are very close with uh local governments you know with the grid with uh helping stabilize the grid as well and also just you know creating infrastructure jobs as well um and now that the whole world knows that bitcoin is not going to die uh that that it has the support of the main nations it's going to be incredible amounts of mining projects being announced in every country right we're seeing huge projects in southeast asia laos thailand we're seeing huge projects in latin america and this will only continue because now people will view this as a digital commodity and they'll say okay i can i can use the existing resources of my own country to mine bitcoin and then sell it on the open market or or even just to hold it in treasury right because i know that the rest of the world also created their bitcoin this way and this is how they'll value it so this is kind of the incipient use case of crypto the sort of the the sort of the sound money use case and i think that this is something that um you actually uh it's difficult to to place bitcoin against the other coins on this metric um there's a lot of tech these people that want to be able to do this and and so they'll talk about utility and they'll talk about um uh you know tps they'll talk about you know scaling but this is not really something that you can do right like you can't tell them to you can't tell them to buy another coin you can't tell them to mine another coin so um i think that this kind of is the most still the most underrated uh narrative in the market and the the most underrated uh sort of um valuation model you could call it i mean we could be in a world where let's say elon comes up with great um you know solar mining clean energy mining and he starts a plant in texas right where we already see a huge amount of plants being put up and then this kind of model inspires a lot of other countries to go in this is the formation of a new world order very quickly right um and yeah you know i was speaking with the guy who um did the microstrategy placement at capital capital being like a trillion dollar allocator of capital uh in the us right and he said he thinks then in the long run that bonds people will sell bonds and buy bitcoin people will not own government bonds and store value anymore they'll own just bitcoin so his target for bitcoin just is like even higher than mine and this is a guy who's just you know traditional finance uh sees the potential of bitcoin to be a store of value and so it's kind of a different it's a different ballgame right and i think this ballgame actually if you zoom out this ball game was like completely derided during the bear market like no one thought that this was possible you know this is all just some digital money digital beans that we were all trading and this is one thing versus another but now you're seeing very serious people talk about this stuff as the formation of a new world order right you're seeing politicians in the u.s uh especially in the gop but also in the center say that this is actually a political philosophy behind it as well right this is elements of energy neutrality where people have the right to buy the things they want to buy uh without having woke capitalist cancel them for instance or having people tell them that this is not something they can buy and so there's like that confluence of sovereignty and confluence of uh of um coordination that that is extremely powerful actually that's why we're seeing all the senior politicians in the u.s really embrace bitcoin because they see it as a very powerful wealth base uh a very powerful voting electorate and they also see a strong path to localism right they see a strong path to local governments having more power right if they collect tax revenues and they convert it to bitcoin uh that's extreme power that they have over essential governments um that's the extreme power they have over um you know more centralized forces um so i think that these kinds of things will make it very likely that bitcoin will succeed at its sort of current uh most potent meme which is to be valued against gold to be valued against bonds to be valued against all sorts of other kinds of stores of value that exists because once it's able to to really be seen as a treasury asset uh for the largest saving institutions in the world and the la and the largest pools of capital in the world as well as for every individual that wants to save money in sort of a simple way then this um the the this kind of flywheel effect this kind of coordination point um is the most underrated uh among crypto natives right because there is a lot of very interesting tech happening as well in crypto and i think that that the interestingness of the tech doesn't take away from the potency of the bitcoin monetary uh strength that it's entering now yeah i mean i'm surprised i agree with everything i'm surprised that you say on a six-year time horizon it's harder to predict i personally think on a six-year time horizon it's much easier to predict instead of what the right valuation models are is much more obvious i mean personally i think it's just in the in the long term like we this is like the next stage of the internet right almost it's like where we where we bring for the first time we have value in the digital realm that and stuff that you can own like property we are entering the property phase of the internet and and we can to me it seems that we can you know value bitcoin and ether and maybe a few other coins as you know form of monetary commodity um but also as a form of new almost like super cooperation in the case of like something like if when when you do have sort of the the the burn from uh yeah one five five nine you have sort of uh the money that that gets transferred from transactors to steakhouse and proof of stake um i mean it's you can't put a number on it it it's it but but i think you can really tell like okay what are sort of the how is the space gonna develop over like the next five years and which projects are or which categories are going to be the big winners maybe that's not the same as as like a evaluation model but um for me sort of the view of the next six years it feels much more clear and easier to predict than you know what's gonna happen in the short term yeah i think you're right in a way as well i think that um [Music] the the sort of larger questions that loom over six years i would guess you know stuff like zero knowledge proofs stuff like um you know what what kinds of things will get captured by by by application layer what kind of things will get captured by layer one um you know right now we have incredibly vibrant layer one communities um and we also have the price going up 100x 1000x uh as well so when it stops going up a thousand x i mean we have to assume it stops going up a thousand x right so once that happens uh what are the substitution effects right uh what things will substitute what things won't uh this for me is harder to reason about actually because like from my point of view there's a world where you can do everything you want to do on ethereum on avalanche or on another chain so we can debate that like centralization decisionalization but for a lot of users that's what they believe and so like gamify you know like i i actually am more bullish on bnb for game five than any other chain because you know being you know binance has the clearest path to one billion users that i see um you know they have these incredible partnerships they have these incredible uh like fan token fan you know things that are happening and and so you know there's also the question of like what level of the translation will the market value right like will it value very high very low medium like everywhere mm-hmm these are quite tricky questions actually uh especially if not all numbers are going up um and i we are getting to a point where i i mean i think uh i still think we're in a super cycle i i think that like drawdowns won't be too extreme but i think that relative evaluations of things versus other things this is actually quite this is quite in flux right i mean you think about uh just versus june right like seoul 30 avax like 10 now avex hundred dollars you know soul 250 you know and and and so there's some very real moves happening i mean b and b 40 to 650 i mean there's real stuff moving around and happening and there's you know like even if you look at like you know best movers on being since being a year like stuff like phantom is up like you know more than even solana and stuff that's uh these are kind of all questions that i do have on the six year horizon which is um how does this look in six years because we want i think i've noticed the trend from ogs or from people from the precycle they want to prescribe more more providence to smart contract protocols than actually exists they want to say things like all the innovation is on ethereum or they want to say things like all the activity is that what people are willing to pay for is on ethereum they want to be able to say these things in part because i think it also makes investing easier because it's just a simple decision right you just buy and you hold the the biggest smart contract chain and we are seeing some of that mentality with institutional investors where they like all these other chains are so complicated and you know why don't i just buy ether and that's like the biggest the best one it'll win and you know now we're kind of the last few weeks we're seeing some of these guys saying oh like i actually missed the i missed like a 50x here i missed the 100x here i missed the 30x you know what i mean right so yeah now we're seeing this kind of interest come and um i i just think that the smart contract space is incredibly fast moving and the things that we think are going to be the next new thing are very rarely the next new thing and the things that we don't think are often become right i saw this really good tweet from uh digentech luis uh a fingerprints dialogue the other day where he said like everyone's talking about game fight now yeah and like the chances that game fight is the big thing over the next year he thinks is like not very high because everyone is talking about it now whereas yeah you know no one was talking about d5 uh when it came out of nowhere and then no one was talking about uh nfcs when it came out of nowhere and and so um you know he does bring up an interesting point there which is what actually is uh mass adoption what does it look like what are people doing are we all playing giant ponzi's are we all playing you know like what what exactly is it and and so i am excited by the idea of rapidly scalable chains now because you can do things where you can send people one cent two cents five cents and this is something that um you know again purists can debate how decentralized it is but it does enable novel use cases and and and so i have a very open mind when it comes to smart contract space i try not to assume anything uh uh like about how it looks in five ten years because i think it's it's truly influx if people had told you a year ago that phantom is of 1000x you would have said they're insane but you had been wrong so you know what i mean right like it's something that uh uh it it's it's it's very we like to uh we like to ascribe a certainty to what has just happened and then predict it and then project it or we like to do these kind of things but really crypto because of the permissionless nature of it and because of the also the boom bust nature of it like i remember when we did our top 20 coins thing we said eventually the top 20 will be filled with defy coins you remember this right yes and we were we were both completely wrong right and you know so instead they're filled with uh dog coins and they're filled with uh and they're filled with alternate layer one right yeah yeah and and and so i i'm not arrogant enough to say that like in five years i know what smart contract protocols will look like i i think flux is it is really the nature of this this part of the market i agree it's always good to go back to these earlier episodes and almost look at them look at them as you know these time pieces where you can yeah exactly and see how wrong you were and yeah you know get humbled by the market and i think not enough people do this right i think um like there's some we can debate about um like valuation models uh all day i think the biggest takeaway is that you know what is the dominant valuation what it changes all the time it's just basically a game of narratives um but there are some things that don't change right i mean some of the very long-term trends that you know make crypto go up i think yes they are very safe to bet on and and you can opt out of a lot of this game if you just say i'm holding for three two like three four five years um and also you know stay humble about the market right this this is this sort of going back to like writing actually writing down a thesis and coming back to it six months later and look and seeing how wrong you were i think this is something that probably a lot more people would benefit from that than thinking about what is the next valuation model yeah definitely okay so thanks for the discussion and steer around alrighty [Music] you
