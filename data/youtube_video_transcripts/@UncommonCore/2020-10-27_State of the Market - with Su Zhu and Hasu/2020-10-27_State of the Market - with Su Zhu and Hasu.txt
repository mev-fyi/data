welcome to uncommon core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles today i'm sitting down with suzu my friend and co-host to talk about the state of the crypto market and what he's seeing on the horizon sue is the ceo as well as chief investment officer at three arrows capital one of the largest trading firms in crypto just one thing before we dive in we make no money from this podcast but we do want to grow our audience so please take the time to leave us a rating and review on apple podcasts it really helps a lot with discovery thank you and please enjoy the episode [Music] sue welcome i'm really excited to talk to you today yeah should be a fun one i i want to talk to you about the market so much is going on right now um i have questions about things that have happened or that are currently playing out but i also want to use this as a segway to dive deeper into the fundamentals and the theory behind some of the some of these things um so i hope we can tie them together in a way that's both interesting and informative for our listeners sure to start out so the the big story right now is probably the decline of defy across the board many many coins are down over 50 percent some of them even down 70 percent such as wifey year in finance why do you think defy crashed and um did you see it coming i think the crash of defy is in any kind of big big explosion of interest and community you'll have quite steep pullbacks so i think that this is no different in that sense you can't really have prices go up 1020x without having 50 and 70 pullbacks so i think part of that is just the internal logic of markets cannot be cannot be fought against i think that um for for us for me personally i think there were some warning signs a few weeks ago where you had a lot of sort of copycat stuff popping up a lot of forks that they could just you know copy and then get rich from that there was a lot of me too kind of uh behavior so i think that that's usually symptomatic of blowoff tops and there's a few reasons for that i think one is that there is the the local tops are always defined by a misallocation of resources uh whether that's in crypto or otherwise so during the you know during the dot-com boom the during the absolute tops there were a lot of normal companies that were adding uh you know dot-com to their name and trying to refashion themselves as tech companies and similarly during the top of defy here you had random projects starting to say that they're defy that they can add an amm or add swaps i i had at least three or four uh discussions with top 200 coins where they wanted to figure out how to get into d5 so i think i think things like this are always um are always good signs because they signal that the market is trying to the the market is creating much more novelty than it is innovation and so we definitely we definitely had a big sort of uh correction now where people are realizing wait the yields are not forever someone has to buy governance tokens for me to get that yield who's going to buy the governance token if there's no reason to own the government's token or because the fully diluted market cap is extremely high even at these levels so i think that overall people are just starting to ask the hard questions now and nothing has really changed even that strongly fundamentally but i do think that for people who are overexposed too thinking that it's just a new paradigm that never goes down i think they're kind of also having their own first taste of what markets are like right so i think it's a mix of all those things yeah and you and we touched on this in our episode on yam but you tweeted a few days before that picture of the the euthanasia roller coaster this is does this sum up what you just described pretty much absolutely absolutely the euthanasia i think euthanasia i i first came across this motif in 2018 on speaking with another prominent traitor in the markets uh light crypto on twitter and he was discussing with me the idea of accumulation distribution and what he means by that is that when you have created a high in alt btc pairs once that high has been created and then it nukes the next bounce up is always a percentage away from that top because people have seen that top and there will be x percent of people trying to sell to lock in some profits and they know they have to sell at a lower price than the high that was printed right and the incremental buyer is suddenly gone because there's not an or the incremental buy is still there possibly on the first bounce but the sellers the the overwhelming size of the sellers is is too big for the buyers to absorb so so you have and as soon as you make a second lower high in something like this then you will have this thing go again and again uh toward this kind of a vortex as we're seeing now in some of these markets and and i think that that that's that structure is very common in all btc it's very common in a lot of these hype cycles because fundamentally it's a money game in a lot of these coins right you're you're betting that more money will go in and will flow out but if we're making lower highs then that's strong evidence to the contrary so those who have unrealized profits you know they thought they were up 10x 5x 8x whatever it is they're now suddenly saying okay i want to make sure to book some profits so that i'm not one of the losers of this game right because suddenly it becomes very apparent that you need new money to come in and you cashing out strictly takes away some of that liquidity so i think i think that that motif is uh is a very good way to understand crypto markets i think it's it's helped me a lot and i strongly recommend at least when you see signs of of things happening that are very euphoric you ask yourself would it make sense for this to be the top of euthanasia and that's in general a good way to think about it and it'll also help you not buy shallow dips right like it's very scary it's very dangerous to buy a shallow dip at the beginning of the break because like fundamentally for the value buyers they may still not be bidding even if it goes down 50 right so if you bid on a shallow dip let's say 10 it's kind of it's kind of you're betting that it's not a euthanasia that it's just another that is just another dip to be bought so you just have to be aware that if you're wrong you can be very wrong uh in in that kind of a scenario oh that's a great point we talked so much about scarcity uh in the context of cryptocurrency and and each of these tokens is um seen basically on their own is scarce has a limited supply of tokens um and we saw that with with wifi right it had this kind of scarcity premium in the beginning but then what happens is that we see a massive supply-side expansion for these kind of projects because of all the different copycats so first there was just wifey right just just yearn and now you have at least 20 different yield farming projects and many of them like some of some of the bigger ones like um harvest dot finance or pickle.finance attract like over 200 million dollars of aom right so would you say this this contributes to basically the coaster so at first you have like some projects that are like generally innovative and um and that that kind of lead on the way up but then with some delay you have all these different copycats coming online and basically to such a large supply side increase that there can't be enough by us to keep it going for much longer sure i i think that's definitely true and what i what i would say is that it also depends on what part of the cycle we're in in the beginning of the cycle i think the forks or the copycats the the first copycats they actually help a lot like yam you could say was kind of a copycat the ultimate copycat right because they copied wi-fi elements ample fourth element compound elements and that was hugely popular at that time even with its issues and i think it led to the d5 coins that you could stake for it going up like  tons for a couple days uh for a few days so i think copycats in the beginning of the cycle are very good for the markets uh price-wise but i think that like you said as you get later in the cycle when people start asking questions about moats and what's the you know what are the actual cash flows that are going to be achieved you know what's going to actually happen i do think that at that stage you tend to have people saying okay if there's now harvest that's valued this price this market cap and you have wi-fi valued at this other price um you know what what's going to long term be the reason why people buy wi-fi and not this or how are they going to capture those cash flows right and i think that forks are actually really good at pointing out these kind of things like say same with sushi and uni right like people might want to say uni is worth all this because it has the brand behind it and it has something behind it but the other day it's open source code and sushi really does the same thing they arguably have a better coin distribution in some sense because they don't have a pre-mine um so there's no like i think in d5 the existence of those kinds of forks um does start to have people ask questions okay can we actually put in a fee can we actually make this uh like this took and capture value and and so that i think is what's been uh really bearish for the market like curve putting in fees right putting in an admin fee of two basis points and then having that go toward a buy and burn uh and then having the price absolutely nuke right afterward i think it was kind of the market saying that okay maybe you have some cash flows but it's not a lot and your inflation is still much higher than your cash flows right so there's ultimately not there's ultimately not like any easy way to say to new money that comes in and seizes the space why are these good investments uh if you can't articulate how this token has emote how this community has a mode uh what what exactly is the value accrual and so that's why i do think that no i'm i'm not as dubbish as some people are on twitter i mean i'm a big long-term believer in d5 i'm not as dubish as some people are i do think it's going to be a fairly long rebuilding period especially as we're in a backdrop of what i think is going to be a high bitcoin dominance regime in the next few months possibly a couple years even i think that the big you know the builders in d5 are ready to build and they're ready to truly innovate and create stuff i do think that the speculators um need to be braced for more pain if they're especially if they're in their short term because i think that there's still a lot of froth in the markets there's still a lot of stuff that's not that rational that's happening and i think the max payne point uh from my point of view from what i can see it's not really close yet i assume um we touched on this earlier but does this crash invalidate any fundamental assumptions that you and other people have had about d5 and maybe also even more interestingly does it validate any assumptions as well maybe things that continue to work even though we have seen such a big drop i think not a whole lot is invalidated per se aside from the idea of i think governance tokens people have been a little bit too bullish on as a concept like you mentioned to me before d5 should be governance minimalized not maximalized well i think this whole wave of d5 especially the newcomers you've had this big push into governance maximization right the idea that this token can literally change anything at any point and therefore it's really valuable because you don't know what they're going to pump and dump next they may decide to vote in some crazy pool and then those guys will want to pump that well you know this logic only really works in a bull market right as soon as you turn into a bear market like all of a sudden it doesn't matter what you do it's still gonna still get new so um you know i i i have this general heuristic that a good sign that things will take a next leg down are when projects try to vote in tokenomics that try to pump the coin and it doesn't even pump for like four hours it just pumps like for half an hour and then it nukes right or you know when when people will try to do things like make make the rewards vesting right it's ultra bearish because it doesn't actually accomplish anything uh and it's sort of like the last card that any of these can play so once you play that you know tvl goes lower from the smaller players but the bigger players can hedge anyway and they don't care uh you know they're they're very mercenary about it so you'll end up just having even less of a community if you do vesting you'll you'll just have whales basically farm the entire thing because they can handle the vesting and they can hedge it so that's also like a good sign that it's it's not it's not going to go great um so so i think that there are these these are some of the things that you'll tend to see where i think tokenomics people are putting a little bit too much focus on tokenomics the ability of tokenomics ultimately fix adoption i think is bit overstated i do think that that's a good thing because that means that in this bear market people will go back and think about what innovation they're really bringing as opposed to trying to like take you know something that's already worth a lot and then say i've created something else that is a subset of this with one thing changed can i be worth that right so i think that that's um that's going to be the direction that it goes toward i think in terms of validation i i do think that amms have been quite validated overall um as a concept i think that you know you've seen a bunch of token sales happen on amms you've seen a bunch of projects really bootstrap their liquidity through amms unit swap as well as balancer as well as others so i think that is very healthy to see and that's even happening now you know unison bonds are still decent balancer volume is still okay so i think it kind of does show that even if people are losing money they still find it convenient to trade on a dex you know on a web wallet so i think those are good signs and those do validate the idea that something has been created here of lasting value and people can build on that yeah so since you brought up um amms one project that basically marked um the basically the top of the d5 hype cycle is student swap with the launch of its unit token you can farm uni by being an ap in one of four unit swap trading pairs and then stake these lp shares in the units from tao and by doing that you earn uni rewards um so i i am farming um in this and so it's very interesting to me um and i i would like to use this as a segue basically to talk about market making in general last week you you wrote an article that was very well received for derebit um called toxic flow its sources and counter strategies um maybe let's start with that what are the main insights from that article so i think amms are revolutionary in the sense that anyone can now be a market maker 24 7 right their liquidity is posted on the internet and anyone can buy yourself from it so i think that's important to understand first and foremost now with that you have takers as well who are trading a lot of volumes so when you see very high unit swap volumes the questions might be okay well those volumes are so high but what are they doing right like are are all those people clicking on web wallets are all those people just fascinated by you know trading from metamask i think the answer if you look on chain it is definitely not right what what's actually happening is people are arbitraging between the price on the amm and the price on a centralized exchange so for for pairs like like tokens like smaller tokens you may actually find that the price discovery is mainly occurring on unit swap but for a lot of other tokens say ether itself that it's definitely not occurring mainly on units it's occurring it's occurring on centralized exchanges right like coinbase bitfenix and others so what that means is that every time the eth price moves people are competing to do the trade on unit swap and then hedge it with a centralized exchange so that that whole process of arbiting the decks as you can call it is what's really generating a ton of this volume um and so you might ask the question okay so so these guys are obviously all making money because they obviously will only trade if they make money um so but the amms all seem happy they all have their money in there so so they seem to be making money so who's losing money right like or have we just created like an infinite money machine and the answer is no you have not created an infinite money machine what what you have created is two things one is a belief that the assets in this pool are correlated enough that the up and down movements are relatively safe uh to be indifferent between so what that means is you know that one of the two assets in your unit swap pool is not going to go to zero right if that goes if that goes to zero that's that's what the kids call like a rug pull right it's when it's when you have a token in a pool and ether in the pool and then one day you wake up and the token's worth zero so you ended up by being in the pool you ended up now owning uh zero ether and a lot of token um so that that's impermanence loss in a nutshell where you basically get stuffed with the one that's worse and you don't have the one that's better so i think that that price right now people don't really i mean it's already very mathematical i think and i i mean i think what essentially being an mmlp is is you're you're actually buying a uh unlicensed structured product is what you're doing you're buying a what uh an unlicensed structured product so you know in in korea a very common structured product is called the worst of put and the worst stuff put so a normal put is when you sell a put and that means that uh you agree to buy uh something at a lower at a lower price if it's out of the money you agree to buy it if it gets there right so the price blows through there then you you know you're losing money because you sold that put and you get assigned the the person who bought the put from you they say okay i'm going to sell it to you now at the put strike here you go so a worse though put was invented by investment bank sales devious as they are and they said okay well why don't we put three assets uh into a basket and we say to the guy we say to the client how about you're selling a put not on one stock but on the worst of three stocks right yeah and the guy's an idiot so he doesn't really care so so he'll go and say okay well what's the yield right because you're getting a premium when you sell a put and obviously the yield is much higher the more stocks you put into the basket right because you know given sufficiently many stocks in a basket the certainty that one will go to zero is like 100 right so even if it's large caps so that that whole process became a very fun game for investment banks for a few years and then regulators started saying like what's going on here like how do you do this and so now it's generally capped like they only put three stocks in and they're very blue chip ones usually um but uh yeah it it's it's something where it's similar to that right like you're gonna get the asset that is the worst and the question is are you paid enough in the meantime that it was all worth it right so no one is really doing that math uh that closely aside from the big sort of industrial scale farmers of uni that are out there and you know sushi as well you know we all know that there are quite a few industrial scale farmers of sushi as well and for those guys you know what what they'll be thinking about is how do i hedge my risk right how do i use options on therebit uh to because those are the only place where that's liquid enough to buy a huge size you you have to go there and basically buy buy out of the money calls out of the money puts and hedge your risk that indeed one of the assets you wake up one day and one of the assets goes down to 50 or goes up 50 right and if you just back you know if you if you back test crypto that happens all the time so i think right right now it's quite fascinating to me that d5 has generally gone up in a period of bitcoin going very flat right it's basically been very range bound in 10k to 12k range past few weeks and uh eath itself has also been relatively range bound between 310 320 and 480. so i think that the d5 markets all a lot of these primitives have been generally um in that kind of environment where it hasn't really been tested how how people will behave if you start to get some serious impermanence loss so i think that you know if you're not hedging um it's probably it's probably gonna go bad at some point right as a guarantee because you're basically selling uh volatility and that's that's inescapable because you know that your hedge is to buy strangles right it's to buy straddles to buy strangles so if you don't buy them then you're not flat you're actually short that's what's paying for everything right it's the fact that if if one day you know people wake up and uh you know donald trump says he's buying all all the bitcoin he can and bitcoin doubles that you know if you're in the wbdc pool you wake up and you see that you actually don't have much wbdc you have all youth and then you think to yourself that's that's unfortunate right so that that hasn't happened yet because of the relatively low volatility environment that we're in historically low volatility environment but i think it's a huge mistake to think that lasts forever so um you mentioned um buying strangles and straddles um so are those um like what does it take to buy those are those individual products on on therabit for example yeah you just buy you just buy an out of the money call out of the money put and then at least if the prices go up you're covered for that and the uni rewards you're getting and the fees you're getting it pays for the premium on your options right so all the all the big industrial skill players are doing this because they're very because one is their size is big right so so you know if people are playing around with a few hundred k or like tens of thousands like you're hedging you know you're ultimately trying to save yourself from losing tens of thousands which is not a lot of money right but yeah but if you're farming with like 50 100 mil then you you start to say okay i don't i don't want to do it as a game right like i want to do it as a like like asic farming itself asic mining itself right so there have been a lot of these products that have been launched in some in both china as well as us i think coin list has one and there's a few in china they can't name that that have them as well but but many of those will be hedging uh in some intervals um with different strategies i've i've helped devise some i think that ultimately those guys will be fine because they understand the math very well and they'll even pull out if the math goes bad but i do think that the math is capable of going very bad for for people that don't hedge because they won't have the gains on their hedge legs to offset when the markets start moving again right so so you you hedge your ap shares with uh with options and you mentioned you also had your reward tokens i i suspect hedging reward token is an interesting question um i mean i can't comment on what we do but of course i will say that a lot of people do hedge rewards similar as they might hedge bitcoin mining rewards right if they think that they're going to farm this amount of bitcoin they'll definitely overheat it in a neutral environment because they want to lock in their profits so you definitely see some of that going on in the farmable coins and i think that's uh that's just prudent right because if you if the price goes up you just become richer and the price goes down well you're you're glad to have been hedged so i think that like in a way that kind of shows the ultimate uh the ultimate irony of yield farming right because the yield farming or like generalized you know liquidity mining the initial idea was that you were going to you were going to distribute the coins of your protocol to people that are using it the most right and that this by you know by this process it would be the fairest distribution and it also achieved sort of the most uh motivated participants like in it right but but in practice what has happened is that the largest players in crypto itself just use it as a money market right they they put capital in they farm it they hedge everything out it's pure arbitrage and they walk away with lots of money right and and in a way it's similar to mining right where with gpu mining let's say the gpu miner he doesn't need to care about like any specific coin he just wants to mine the stuff that people want to buy so if there are people buying some random gpu coin then he'll absolutely mine it and jump on them right and hedge it out and when the coin dies he'll he'll move on to another coin so money is sort of the ultimate gpu or cpu right because you can use money in anything uh there there's no like other machine needed there's no other proof of work needed hence why you see a lot of um heavy dumping because the participants who have the money uh you've you've created a dollar auction whenever you create a yield farming uh scheme right you've created a dollar auction for people to come into your come into your network and use liquidity to bid for that dollar and there's no promise that they will stay around and and play house after they think the roi is not high enough right there's no such there's no such social contract and there's no such promise either so i i think that in the beginning these projects probably got some hype out of it because the total value locks went up so much right uh on compound you know the the tvl first it was the the strategy was usdt versus usdt then it was bat versus bad and now it's diverse diet and then they realize that okay well diverse's diet industrial farming is the least is the least bad option because at least it makes die a supply pump which then helps make her and so there's that kind of a logic to it where they've decided that that's the most allowable form of yield farming uh but yeah it it it's ultimately it's ultimately tied to that idea that you are distributing the token to people that are just gonna sell it for dollars but how do you do it in a way that people buying it actually make money in the end you have to let the people that are buying it make money if you don't then there's no real chance right and so for uni that would be the test right when if people are actually farming and holding uni the question is what do they expect to achieve what do they expect that they'll be able to get for their uni because they are very much paying for the people that are just farming pure so given that all these large firms basically mine fully hedged would you say that other market participants just underestimate or basically misvalue the the combination of having like a low return but with a very high sharp ratio because you can always use leverage right to to increase the returns you can't really increase leverage at least not yet there's a project coming out that uh that we recently invested in called alpha finance they they actually do allow you to leverage pharma unisa that's interesting but you can't really use leverage in the traditional markets i mean in the uh in the farming markets because you need actual capital right um whether it's your capital or you're risking someone else's capital it's still ultimately one unit of risk uh it's it's it's atomic risk basically um it's not like a derivative where you can go 5x or 10x or 25x right so i think that that generally gives a huge advantage to big players because they have the money right and as i alluded to in a tweet the main money in this space is not even from stable coin whales or altcoin whales is from bitcoiners right bitcoiners have all the money because their coins are worth the most uh so with that so what that so what that means is that from what i know i mean bitcoiners make the most money in d5 yields farming because they have the most money to begin with and and so and so that that kind of has become a basic yield uh it's ultimately a bdc denominated yield for for uh for a lot of folks and and so that that i think is the ultimate irony of defy where the populist narrative on twitter is that bitcoiners don't understand d fire that you know like the tone base he doesn't even get uh that unit swap can't be stopped but in reality there's a lot of quiet bitcoiners with you know 100 000 uh you know 50 100 000 bitcoin like large scale and they if they deploy even 10 of this into d5 like that's what happens right like because because ultimately the base reserve of crypto is btc right it's got the market cap and it's got the liquidity so i think that that reality means that all yield farming ends up being done by people who view it as a money market and that's not to say that they're naive either right i mean these guys these guys read the code they read the solidity code you know they hate solidity they hate ethereum but but they read it so it's this funny thing where you know they view it just like mining right like they may mine litecoin that they may mine zcash they may mine like other coins but ultimately they viewed as a business so i think that that's ultimately the reality in the space so all all yield farming projects today are being farmed in that way for a very large percentage of their of their supply so yeah i mean it's easy to forget that bitcoin is still 20x larger than usdt even right which would be the second reserve currency of the space so um given that btc denominated farmers capture most of the rewards of all of these tokens is that part of why you think bitcoin dominance is going to increase over time especially these yields flow back into their base currency i think yeah that's one reason i see the other reason i see is that wbdc ultimately is very bearish for ether i think you know there there are some arguments that because it uh hurts the ability of the bitcoin blockchain to receive fees for transactions that will therefore be more bullish for ether but i think in the near to medium term what it will mean is that if people come in and buy bitcoin up to 15 16k now you can foam a bitcoin from the ease of your decks right you can go from your ether straight to your wbdc you can go from your stable coin straight to wbdc so i think that that effect in the near term will be much more pronounced than the theoretical effects which is that you know bitcoin is on the ethereum chain i think that that is something that that is very very bearish for eve because it also you know if you think about the unispot pool wbdc is one of the four pools that means that anyone can go from a lot of youth to a lot of btc very quickly and because of the way that that market works is that you probably don't have people sitting on a lot of wbdc to begin with um as a natural user the like the natural users are all ethereum eath holders on the ethereum chain so like wbdc is not really held in that way so in a sense the most likely flow is that youth people sell that pool consistently for wbdc to diversify right so i think that i think that that concept is something that people just need to be aware of as well i think separate from that i think there are going to be some headwinds for ethereum over the next few months i think as vitalik uh has pushed toward a more roll-up focus roadmap i think ultimately it's more fundamentally sound but i also think that it's going to be a wake-up call for the community too because it does mean that a lot of the a lot of the eth2 research was probably wasted and also means that the tps may not get to anywhere that allows mass scaling or anything resembling mass adoption anytime soon so i think that that will be the challenge i do think that all applications will still continue to use ethereum um and probably like other chains if they make sense they'll be very chain agnostic but they'll use ethereum given that's where the users are now but i think for eat the asset it'll be challenging environment for sure because ultimately that that headwind of the long-term road map being so so ultimately not very very scalable and also not very clear even at this stage several years later we're still at the same tps and optimistic will only really get you to 200 tps um and it will it it will force a lot of social coordination up the stack right it just forces it into layer two you don't really solve that many issues and it creates socialization in terms of community uh in some sense too so though i think those are all things to be aware of right and it's not just um now we also saw the recent launch of tbtc and at least in my little bitcoin bubble i am seeing some people who would use tbtc but not wbtc because tbtc is trust this bridge the first trustless bridge for any um cryptocurrency so that's interesting as well i get that i get that i think the difference between tbtc and wbdc is very similar to the difference between die and usdt right where it's i think keep is academically quite interesting um that that it can be done but the thing that academics needs to remember is that not everything that can be done should be done or not everything that can be done is more than an academic experiment right because you know for players like us or for alameda or for grapefruit or any of the other big houses like you want to get in and out fast right like you want to get in and out of 5k btc 3k btc to be able to do that you ultimately need one that one peg somewhere and i think that it also has to be capital efficient so that's very hard to do with a lot of the other more decentralized constructions and then the question will be does the market care or not or do they trust spitka or do they trust a bit go dow i think the answer is they trust the bitco dao more than they trust the holders of whatever token has come up with to bootstrap whatever new so-called decentralized bitcoin is made up did go dial so wbdc is governed by a dow actually this dow is quite powerful it can even uh it can even vote you can even vote to uh so if you send wbdc to the contract address they can actually vote to retrieve it so they they have some interesting powers oh yeah okay that's something that that happens sometimes to people where they accidentally copy paste like yeah one time i've seen this happen is when people try to add a token to a wallet at a custom token or to an exchange um yeah because then they accidentally copy paste the address into the uh into the uh the into the address field i want to send it yeah so um well i was not aware that um wbtc is governed by a doll so interesting um i actually want to jump back um to to uniswap for a moment because there's one thing that has been on my mind for months actually um and it's the question if so in in a central limit order book exchange market makers tend to increase their spreads when volatility is high basically to spread the inventory over a larger level of prices um but amm market makers don't do this at least yet but you you can do this right so my question is that even in unisop you can do this so my question would be like do you actively manage inventory in aps based on expected volatility is that is my logic here even sound that you should be doing this yeah if you're if you're a market maker who needs to make money on trades then yes you should be doing this if you don't need to make money on trade so people who lp in unit swap they don't need to make money right they may prefer making money but they don't need to that's a key difference i think um tiantian at amber in the article you wrote with me he made this very good point where he said that for a holder of an amm lp token he simply needs to personally be indifferent between these two coins somewhat and he needs to believe that roughly over the long run that these will outperform buying and holding the two of them so as long as he believes this then everything's fine and even if he loses money it's the same as the korean retail that buys social products because he also thinks he's okay because most of the time he gets the coupon but then once every four years you have a big crash and then he ends up being along the worst of five stocks so you know i i think that there's a lot of things that in theory shouldn't work because of efficient markets and because people are not dumb but in practice they are working in d5 because of the fact that um you know even if it's dumb it's still less dumb than other things that they may do right and it still is a is some liquidity like for instance that like that guy who puts it in the amn pool he may have been doing something even dumber with his money he may have been trying to buy and sell levels you may have been trying to get liquidated on bit mix right you have no idea what he was doing so it's it's it's not a it's not a perfect there's no perfect solution not everyone can arm everything all all the time some people have to just own things some people have to just try to compete um not really with the market but just with themselves just try to make a little bit more money every year right so i think in that framework then you quickly see why you know spreads probably don't aren't going to widen you know for for announcements um probably the simplest solutions will do okay better than people think but yeah there's definitely a lot of room for emm innovation too we we backed a number of amm competitors recently that have what we think are slightly smarter ammms but yeah the the market will decide because yeah like if there's an announcement and then price goes way up and then way down unit swap lps are happy and if you were an lp in a smart pool where you widen you wouldn't get that volume right so then maybe your lp's would be results oriented and then say okay i wish i was in the other pool you never really know how people will think about it if you try to always make money you won't do any trades that's also a good way to think about it right like if you're if you always want to make money then you should never be a maker actually because makers can by by philosophy never guarantee that they make money a lot of these amm models get constructed on paper right an academic context where you assume strong rationality then they meet the real world where the market acts with bounded rationality um and suddenly some model becomes dominant that kind of relies on people not being rational right like more people being bound have bounded rationalities such as uniswap and it becomes a new selling point for liquidity so it's always important to keep in mind um one story that um bubbled up yesterday was um so uh on chain um analysts found that someone borrowed a lot of wifey on i don't know if it was cream or ave actually and then send it to a binance which which makes it pretty likely that they were a short seller right because for what other trades you would do that maybe market make the coin on violence but um the address was i guess associated with alameda um which which mostly probably makes on their own exchange i don't know not on binance so there was a a bit of a shitstorm against them in response on on social media and some telegram groups that i'm in so what do you think about that event i think it showed how early this whole space is where people don't really understand trading and they also don't really understand what the goal of defy should be right so i think first of all whether alameda was short or not or they were short for a client or they were short for an inflow or they were hedging it's completely irrelevant because for every trade that occurs in the market there needs to be a buyer and a seller we can't all be bolt hards and just like no one that does any trades and it goes to infinity it has to trade at every price up someone has to sell for every buy even if it's going up right so to say that because he's short selling it kind of just tells you the mood of the market right where it's kind of getting into an anger phase the market and they're looking for excuses or scapegoats um i think that what's what's very likely that they were doing and all swat people do is that they're just arbiting the centralized exchange against the decks right if you have most of wi-fi sitting in in terms of liquidity if you have it sitting in the unit swap pool in the wi-fi eth pool well if there's huge sellers on centralized exchanges then you want to buy from those guys and then sell to sell to the unison pool right but they need to wait for your withdrawal from finance or wherever and that might take quite some time might take half an hour so you might want to borrow some wi-fi and that way you have it you know in your account and as soon as the market nukes you can hit the unison pool you can be the first to orbit basically obviously you can't do a flash loan because you can't close the loop right you can't buy wi-fi usdt on binance using and and then use that wi-fi immediately to deliver to unit swap centralized exchanges can never be part of a flashlight yeah exactly exactly exactly so you always need uh market makers to be borrowing lots of coins to be able to arbitrage centralized exchange versus dexes that's actually what fuels a lot of the borrow and lending activity in the markets it's not people short selling it's not people doing um you know crazy spoofs or whatever but it's really just market making but i will say that even if they were short selling that there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and like we saw with the link uh with the link short sale attempt on ave those guys got liquidated because the market was bullish and they realized they could push the price much higher than the liquidation price so there's no risk-free money in short selling right the the it actually takes quite a lot of it takes quite a lot of conviction to short an asset because a short can you you can have an infinite loss on a short right you can lose your whole account on a short so from that point of view i think that the the defy space in particular risks making themselves look a little bit silly if they go around trying to vilify short sellers because that's also the main point of ave and compound and cream right which is that you have two-sided liquidity you have suppliers and borrowers if you now are like mad because borrowers are selling your asset well you're probably not cut out for d5 right so i think that that that's kind of now become [Music] i think in the last few hours on twitter i do see people just saying okay yeah he should be able to do whatever he wants um but yeah you definitely have a few people that obviously are sitting in a lot of losses now and kind of trying to find things to blame yeah and i mean also the the borrower pays interest to the suppliers right so the supplier gets exactly they get compensated for exactly for whatever the the borrower does with the money and i mean yes some people are saying i mean so you can earn more uh interest by uh staking your wifey in the in a vault you know in the governance world for example but if everyone did that and nobody supplied cream and ave then of course also the um basically whatever uh revenue people in the world in the governance world get would also be way lower so um i think basically it all balances out in the end but this this story was interesting to me not just because it shows whether kind of the irrationality that you described but also because it it kind of showcases a fundamental problem something that really bothers me actually with ethereum and uh defined which is that it's getting easier and easier to track large accounts with software like nansen but um i mean i reckon that funds have even better proprietary data and tracking software so in that sense i mean there's basically no onshore on-chain privacy and it's so much more so much more deadly in d5 chains um and basically any kind of state for chains than it would be in bitcoin with basically transactions can't be front run or otherwise manipulated or against you in any way right so if if i hold money in a bitcoin account or send it to an exchange or send it to my you know whenever you just when every kind of things you just hold it there's nothing really really malicious parties or like other yeah you know other kind of markets can do with your transaction but but when your transaction kind of interacts with the global state then you know when they know what you're doing they can mess up your whole transaction and future transactions as well so like how do you as one of the largest firms in d5 who is doing plenty of on-chain trades how how does this lack of privacy affect you that's a very tough question because there's no solution right now in ethereum right so most big players don't even bother trying to be private because they know that it's not worth the hassle of trying so especially if you own a large amount of supply even if you try to deposit it to a centralized exchange and then withdraw it back people can easily see it to you because who else would have done that right so there's absolutely no there's absolutely no way to get privacy and i think that that is a huge barrier to adoption as well because i don't think that companies want like imagine if everyone's bank account was just an ethers like you could go on either scan and i could just see how much money you have in the bank you probably wouldn't like that too much right so i kind of think that that that is a very understated uh problem in ethereum it mainly impacts whales which is why i think it's not as talked about but i think that it's a huge impediment for institutions to come in huge impediment for privacy-minded people to use defy it's it's not it's not unsolvable i think people are working on it but yeah it's a it's a huge issue right because one is what you mentioned which is the minor front running right where you can actually have censorship very easily on chain through that but then two is that you could have all your trades you could have all your trades uh be seen so you have to basically you have to justify that you're buying or you're selling right whereas in practice in the stock market like when when bill ackerman buys stocks or he sells stocks he doesn't have to tell the world why he's doing it right he doesn't have to tell people yeah i'm bullish now that's why i'm buying or embarrassed now you don't have to give a speech about it he can just do it right but in ethereum d5 there there's this big uh there's this big meme around like oh you never sell or you never do this you never do that um and so like blue kirby had that issue right where he said you know i'm selling from my e from my ens address and i'm going to buy back somewhere else because i don't want everyone to follow my 30 wi-fi all day long right so i think that you know that that kind of uh that kind of a community feel or that kind of uh that kind of a mantra it's definitely not healthy it's definitely not the underpinnings of actual global finance right and it's a very provincial uh kind of a mentality so i do hope that people do build the needful tools there and and get it to a level where it's actually uh usable by by by real firms by real people that just want to do finance they don't want to be in a community they don't want to be on twitter you know talking about coins all day they just want to use finance because that's real people right and i think that ethereum does run the risk of being a circle jerk in that respect where it's it's mainly an elitist or a kind of a very niche kind of a subculture in the end yeah i totally agree and um i think the the wi-fi borrow story also shows that the game theory just changes completely between a paradigm with hidden information and one with open information i mean it's not necessarily unwinnable when basically you um basically all your information is private and maybe that all of the small the smaller players is hidden but it requires some changes in strategy right as if you're aware if if if the market is so thicker and people are paying so much attention that borrowing wi-fi on ave can that alone can basically make people dump then basically firms should start doing that as a bluff right yeah and then eventually it won't work and so it'll all be equilibrium but the bigger danger is that these kinds of things become very very normalized that people just track whales all day and they and they enjoy the game right because if you're going to build a global financial system you have to move beyond that and if you're not able to move beyond that then the big money won't come and play right they won't want to join these games so yeah it has created some very interesting money games and there are definitely ways to exploit those games and exploit psychology but it's uh it's a little bit sad for me to see too because i think that you know if ethereum had better on-chain privacy or had some ways to to get at that then like i could see it being much more usable right i mean everyone knows the top 20 addresses uh pretty much who they are in terms of farming in terms of trading and i will i i will say people are generally pretty good about non-doxing but at the end of the day it's it's a very very it's a very very small community and i don't see how newcomers will be that comfortable with having all their financial transactions seen globally right i just don't think that that's like that that to a newcomer seems strictly worse than how finance already works like way worse so because you're talking because you're telling the guy he can both lose all his money from a hack and by the way most custodians don't support these smart contracts yet but also everyone can see your transactions so they can see when you capitulate they can see when you buy they can see all these things i just think it's not going to fly i think it's a bit of a sober way to end this episode but thank you very much for the discussion it was fascinating i don't say this a lot but i think you leaked some some real alpha all right take care take [Music]
