welcome to uncommon core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles this show is hosted by suzu the ceo and chief investment officer of three aeros capital and me hasu a crypto researcher and writer [Music] hey i'm sitting down today with suzu my regular co-host actually um congrats to earning the title crypto villain of the year 2021 i think you were ranked first in the recent article this is a huge achievement for you obviously is there anything that you want to say to your fans uh well you know it's actually um it's actually really funny because the way that i kind of have conceptualized like my image over the years is that you know when i started out it was basically just investing and trading right like basically i called the bottoms and the tops all 2019 2020 and pretty much a very pro ethereum and bitcoin uh stance for the most part um throughout and um you know this year as the market's developed and you know follower accounts have gone up like 10x 20x um gone um into some other ecosystems as well and kind of just now kind of uh zooming out and starting to like analyze what you know were the priors that i had in the beginning and what are the priors that have come out you know what are the things that have happened now um it's it has has kind of made me question sort of um you know what what is the what is the way that crypto will evolve in the future and and also like what what are the kind of traps that i think crypto communities are starting to fall into and what are kind of the problems so i think it's i mean it's it's interesting to me that it's like um the idea of a villain because i'm kind of refuting a lot of the things that kind of the bitcoin and ether ogs especially the ether ogs think of as like these holy truths right um but you know those tweets got you know 15 000 likes and the reason is that the new users and the new people that they actually they actually resonate with the stuff right they view they view crypto as something that belongs not to the ogs it belongs to them as well um and and so that's something that we can talk about more in depth later but kind of a good kind of a good way that i personally framework uh think about it so what holy truths are you talking about here well i think bitcoin and ether have a lot in common right they have this idea that um layer one needs to be kept as decentralized as possible and then layer two is where we scale so with this you have you know on bitcoin lightning network and then on ethereum you have a number of uh l2 solutions uh both optimistic roll up and dk roll up and kind of the assumption in both of these coins is that um people will be uh willing to sort of wait around for these l2 solutions in order to use blockchains essentially right so um and the reason why they should be willing to wait around to for these l2 solutions is because they value the decentralization of the base chain and they also value um the overall quality and community of those networks right so i think um i mean not that these holy truths are wrong it's just that while this is right there's other truths that are also right and and so i think thinking back to the bear market uh guys like house money and multicoin and sort of their thesis on crypto being quite a different one from you know the sort of canonical bitcoin and ether thesis that most most funds and most investors had at that time they chose to say okay what what are we good you know what what kinds of networks will reach one billion users right and so you know through that framework they invest in very different things than than most of us did right they invested in b and b they invested in solana they vested in sort of a host of things that were considered very very contrarian at that time and i think that you know if you look at the prices of coins now versus april of uh this year you know bitcoin and ether are basically flat right but bitcoin's slightly down either a little bit down um and then and then b b up a lot and solana up multiples avalanche multiples quite a few layer ones of multiples and and so um thinking to this um and and then looking at some of these theses and also seeing kind of what uh the newer institutional investors are thinking about when they come into the space um i am struck by a kind of uh cognitive dissonance i think um that the market has uh and and the split in mindset between sort of the way the ogs think about crypto and what the project is doing and then what sort of um is actually unfolding right where you know half the metamask users are actually bsc users for instance um or where um you know people are indeed uh uh more willing not less willing to participate in newer networks in large part because they can be early right as you know we were early on big one and ether so i kind of see a lot of the same mistakes that bitcoin maximalists made i actually see a lot of ethereum maximalists make the same mistakes now uh where they kind of they kind of take it for granted that we all agree that like eth is the asset that we're going to build on or like you know this is the reason why we do things and i'm starting to starting to kind of see how that all plays out in the sense that um you know bitcoin and ether are probably the soundest monies in crypto right they kind of have the best distributions and they have uh the most decentralization but that doesn't actually that doesn't actually have as much network effect when it comes to adding new users to the network um as as you may think right so that in part is why you know you know for the same reasons that ether gained on bitcoin uh over the last year other networks are now gaining on ether right so i think that the main reason i see for this is that you know if you look at average address uh active addresses on ether it's not that much higher than 2017 uh it's not double for instance and that's something that um you know we discussed before and it's something that you know the the the reason given is that well you know these are whale chains and it's fine and well the new users will use other l2s or they'll use this or that but it's actually it's actually it's going very much toward the bitcoin 2017 uh roadmap right um and the i think that the challenge there is is just simply that uh users will not necessarily wait around for that um so i think while bitcoin and ether can be good monies i don't know that ethereum can can sort of lord over other chains and say you know all value accrues back to me or all people have to settle back to me because i don't think that that is a business logic that makes sense right um it's not a business logic that makes sense that you know eventually all users will pay rent back to eath holders right it's not it's not a it's not a given i do think eth can can compete well at as money against bitcoin because bitcoin um you know has it has a very different trade-off pool versus uh eath but i don't think that ethereum itself as a network um actually is that useful for for for most people because i don't think they need that level of decentralization that ether is trying to say it it it upholds and i think that this is something that um the market has just spoken already i think yeah i mean i think i would agree that um most users don't value decentralization most users are not willing to pay for decentralization because they don't value it very much and so i mean i was so impressed um by is it really true that half or over half of metamask users are using blc i mean that's a pretty impressive number so um but something also struck me that he said um so i think a big reason and maybe even the biggest reason that people flock to these new networks as well it's not really that you know they want to use them but it's more so that they want to be early to something right um isn't it a very dystopian vision of crypto um that there's less network effect than we thought to these existing systems and that people just the people value being early so much more yes yes absolutely doesn't that make it like a big casino where we just realized i don't think it's as so i don't think it's as dystopian as oh jeez think it is so if you're an og and you're sitting there holding a bunch of bitcoin and ether for you it's dystopian because you wish other people came in and bought your bags right but if you're a new user it's the opposite of dystopian it's the same as you felt when you were early to these coins right um so that that kind of is really the beauty of crypto in a way too and and so um [Music] there's kind of i mean this bull market is basically played out very differently than a lot of the ogs thought they would right i mean a lot of people would have thought by now surely bitcoin's at over 100k surely ether is at over you know 6k and and you know but you know since may since april you know instead we've seen solana go 8x and we've seen avalanche go 5x 6x and we've seen some of the you know we've seen b b go 10x and and and so the world actually playing out very differently than kind of that that thesis so it's the dystopian if you're a bag holder of bitcoin and ether but it's not dystopian if you're a new user right and so it kind of drives at the store value thesis for crypto in a way which i still believe in um but i just think that it's it's trickier than than it appears um i think that uh the reality is that the big reason people come into crypto is because they want to enjoy the same kinds of gains that people who came in previously did and they also want to be involved actively that is to say i i think of bitcoin and ether now is more like philosophical coins where if you're a normal person who has a thousand dollars ten thousand dollars you are not really touching the base chain ever you're not doing any actions you're buying it in your coinbase exchange account and then you're hearing stories about it basically you're you're basically hearing people talk about what bitcoin and either are and then you're buying those coins but not actually transacting on chain right um and and so i i think of diesel as like the philosophy coins and and then i think of like you know bsc solana avalanche and these other ones as sort of stuff that people are using themselves um and and so i think if you look at the active address counts right of the newer networks they're growing very very fast um at incredible multiples per month and yeah you can say the reason is that you know there there's you know a lot of d5 ponzi's and a lot of stuff but there's actually the same way that ethereum grew right i mean ethereum grew through d5 ponzi as well in 2019 um in 2020 so i think we're just seeing that run again but in faster speed and across a lot more people and so what what scared me about ethereum is that i think where ethereum is today versus where i thought it would be two years ago is just a bit different right i'm sure it's the same for you where you know i would have thought we have some ways to onboard you know a higher percentage of new users um which we don't and and so um there's something to the idea i mean i i tweeted about the idea of like the founders dilemma which is the idea that you know the founders they sort of get some market share but then they and they prove the market but then they don't ultimately win the market and i think that um interestingly i i think that ether has a good chance of winning the the not not winning but sharing the market as money with bitcoin but i think it has actually a low chance now at this point in part because it's so optimized as money to win the sort of smart contract execution environment and sort of the smart contract community long term because i think user acquisition is also very important and i think you know the sort of the negative network effects that the guys like multicoin pointed out uh year years ago they've kind of all happened this year right whenever gas went high you know eventually no one could use anything on d5 and then and then either price crashed and then people stopped using and so you see this again with nfts right where you know the the fees went high and then people couldn't uh buy the cheap nfts anymore and then the whole entity market fell so you know just kind of seeing this play out firsthand made me realize that um [Music] the future's just going to be very multi-chain because because you know ethereum for better or worse it didn't scale to the point it needed to uh to sort of compound network effects it's never effect effect for you know for for users has kind of already stopped uh as network effect as a money uh is still growing albeit slowly um but you know on par with bitcoin speed okay okay i think there's a lot to unpack here um in your answer for me um so i think the first thing i mean maybe the most easiest thing to address you said um ethereum has over optimized for being money first i would agree that um esa is probably the only real contender to bitcoin in terms of store of value in the crypto space and it's sort of very distinguished from btc which gives it a good long-term position it has a much different security model with perpetual inflation which is sort of it's bitcoin bitcoin's achilles here that it's security model in the long term it's not figured out whereas um ethers is and ethereum sort of gets um gets a positive cash flows as well from from uh people actually using the chain via eip105f9 and also from being used as as a as collateral in proof of stake so um but i would be curious to learn in what sense has ether over optimized for being money so what at what points did it make a trade-off like a conscience trade-off to say we we designed the chain to be better money and worse as let's say an execution layer sure i think a good broad way to understand it is if you look at antonio the founder of do idx's tweets about it afterward and he he said you know the ethereum user experience on on layer one has basically not even 10xed over five years um and at that time the roadmap was very much to to figure out how to cater to users and developers right um and and so i think just like if you just zoom out that far it's pretty easy to see that we're we're in a very different place today on ethereum than it was uh a couple years ago and i think the another easy way to see this is just with d5 itself right where if you look at the d5 that's kind of really taken off and done well it's been crosstrained it's been non-ethereum right so you know luna versus snx but then also you know um sort of projects on avalanche versus projects on ethereum the you know the same exact project but they'll do better on avalanche um and then you know you you you kind of get a sense that um i think ethereum rightfully says that they're the bedrock or kind of the uh birthplace of defy innovation right but what that also means is that if that's the main claim to to to um sort of power that that that becomes quite it becomes quite nostalgic like in a way right uh where um what about the new users or what about the new developers where do they go and and you know what we're seeing is that new developers are just multi-evm right so they deploy where the users are because their goal is to have their product be used you know so an example is we back tranches which is a quite quite uh novel mechanism for doing risk sharing across um longs and shorts and it's got one of the highest tbls in d5 right but they started off on bsc and the the founders love ethereum but they just said if i launched on l1 uh there's no way and i'm not gonna launch on matic because if i'm gonna launch on another chain anyways i might as well launch where the actual users are right so uh okay this is what kind of work this is kind of what we're seeing on the app side and then you look at the performance of d5 coins too right you know when we have that part let's take note with the performance let's let's stick with the sort of the tech for a second because yeah sure sure so um if we i think if we look at blockchains from actually first principles it's really just you know it's a shared database where anyone can can verify or where anybody can see that the the computation that was done whether it's a transfer or a smart contract execution that was done with integrity so that was that was done correctly right and you can have various kinds of such uh database basically so being the most centralized would be just binance right the centralized exchange nobody has any insight into their database but it has a lot of reputation at stake um so you just trust it to you know perform all the other updates correctly pretty much and on the other extreme you have something like bitcoin and ethereum where they say oh we throttle the network um really hard to sort of keep um this verification cost this cost for people to actually do the accounting themselves to to to to walk through every step that was done and say oh i can i can verify without making any trust assumptions that all of this computation was done correctly right and in the middle between these two extremes centralized exchange and the completely decentralized blockchain you have a pretty wide trade of space right and um that's where you find bsc that's where you find avalanche and solana at some points across these spectrums right but sort of what i'm wondering is i mean are these other chains really gonna you know develop in in in any other way i mean then you hear in bitcoin so their databases are always so yeah i guess my answer would be they already have and they will continue because they are attracting all the new users i think this is the just the reality of the space right and i think you know when i told you that half of metamask users are bsc users and it under shocked you it's because a lot of you know a lot of ether ogs and biblical energies they don't use chains because they don't need that money right like you don't need to make a thousand dollars you don't need to make ten thousand dollars right you're too wealthy to care but that says more about you than it says about other people right so it's kind of my point which is that um i i find that a lot of ethiopians they're in the mindset now where they're like i'm already rich and you have to understand why what i've done is so good and also what i why what i'm preserving is so valuable and valuable as it may um you have given very few outlets for new users to come and participate in what you've done and and so you know that's the reality of the space and and you know having matic is not is not an answer right because if you have matic then they say what is the difference between matic and any other l1 right and then and then you open up that door and then yeah of course of course there's none right so so i think that that's kind of the reality of the space and i agree with you a hundred percent on you know there is a you know a decentralization trade-off uh between each of these and i think what the novel sort of understanding that i have or or that um i think the market has as well is that um where ethereum is on the trade-off scale um [Music] it it is optimized for a world that um it's struggling to maintain its network effect for evm itself where evm developers are immediately deploying to every chain and then users are using where they find it most convenient so i would say in april or march i would have said that ether itself uh will benefit a lot from this multi evm i believe i said that in a thesis um and he did and i think in part ether has right it has outperformed bitcoin quite a bit uh since then because ether benefits from being able to be ported around on evm just much easier right so you can bring your you know you can bring your ether across different bridges you can use it as collateral here and there and so it has definitely benefited from that but it's also underperformed other layer ones massively and and the the reason why i do say performance is important is because the this is also the incentive for people to get involved right so you know if you look at the d5 projects on ethereum you know where they have uh pretty much only gone down in dollars even uh over the past year i mean if someone had told you at the time we did that podcast where we predicted device coins would enter the top 20 that they would actually all be down in dollars you would you you would have said you're insane right yeah but but it's happened and i think and i see that i think they have performed not that bad since then they are up in dollars definitely but down big but i think a lot of them are actually down in dollars if i remember correctly and and and so that's something that i don't think people are i mean privately i've spoken a lot of people and and and they you know they they they say what those reasons are but i think that um publicly it's something that is a bit taboo to talk about right because it has it you have to admit a lot of kind of things and and and so i think i mean my diagnosis would be a few things right i i think one is that the early ether builders they were very committed to ethereum as a network and so where the founders dilemma kind of plays in is that if you already own a lot of ether and then it's gone up 20x you're already wealthy right so so once you're already wealthy your incentive to build also starts going down right because what is the incentive to build at that point and and and that we've seen a lot in the ethereum device space i think um i think on the on the idea of you know going cross-chain and acquiring users i think that this is a this is very much a knife fight right this is very much a fight uh to see you know which builders are the most aggressive at creating products for new users um and creating experiences for new users and i find it interesting too that like when i speak to some of these ethiopians you know some are very good at going cross-chain and and using them but but a lot of like others their mentality is like i i'm too rich to have to do that i'm too wealthy like i don't need to right um so this is i think the big divide really in this space which is that it's to the point where um ether can no longer ethereum can no longer claim to have all the innovations right like now you actually see the opposite where synthetics are trying to copy what luna's done with you know ecosystem airdrops and multiple projects on it and you know it's we're we're kind of seeing that reverse copying on a number of projects now as well and so i think that there's an arrogance to the ethereum community similar as there was an arrogance of the bitcoin community um and i actually think that you'll see this arrogance play out in almost every community um not in a fatalist way but just as a as a product of founders dilemma like if people already become billionaires people already become you know worth a lot of money their their basic worldview becomes how do i perpetuate this idea as opposed to um how do i compete in the open market so i think that that kind of reality um is is the main reason why um i expect d5 building and and d5 to to do better on newer chains because the builders there are just hungrier and they're also trying to create applications for a million users or 10 million users i i feel like to some degree you're making the same mistake that you warned me against a couple of months ago when you said what did what the bitcoin maximalist think and say actually doesn't matter at all for what what makes bitcoin like a good network and a good investment um and in in this case i think you're sort of you're saying the same thing about the hero maximalists i think it does i think it does matter though in a i think it does matter in a few big ways right um i think the main way that it matters is on the on the question of investment right so if you look at what kinds of things um what what kinds of things have been hyped now in ethereum and then done very poorly we can make an entire list of this right we can talk about uh we'll loot for one but we can also talk about things like wi-fi right or we can also talk about um there's a whole menu of these things and i think actually if you look at what a lot of these have in common it's just this this this idea that you have to do it on ethereum uh or otherwise uh you don't do it at all and so like loot for instance you know when they launched like the m loot whatever like two accounts uh took all the loot basically they took all the rare stuff so it was just dead on arrival right and you've seen a whole host of these things too like we you know we we backed an nft project called monaco and the founder of that is like a big ethereum believer or whatever and he's just like how like so so we did a full gas subsidy for everybody who minted uh which cost us you know a few hundred to eat or whatever and then later we're just like how do we even do this so so we're gonna end up launching the token on bsc and avax um but it's just it's just something where like really people have been like contorting their bodies to be able to to deploy things uh and you know for for guys like andre he was like okay i'm just gonna do this on phantom right and then you know for the obvious guys they're like i'm just gonna build an avalanche right and so we've already seen that diaspora now because i think the whole social pressure against going to other chains has has really died down now in a big way in part because the theorem has sort of lost the plot in in that kind of sense right and so i think that in that framework um what i would say is like you know culture does matter because um it's it's the question of what is each you know each smart contract uh community um offering to new users to to new developers uh and what is it you know what what kinds of things are actually possible basically for them to do um and and so i think that um you know starkware is another interesting example where you know as darknet gets bigger um the question is like does it owe rent to ethereum does it owe these kinds of things to other chains of course it doesn't right um and and of course they will also you know follow a path to make you know technology that is useful for people but basically i guess my broader point is that this idea of like the rent being paid to the holder of the coin of the oldest smart contract coin this is very much now in the culture of ethereum in part because of uh the ideas of eip105.9 which is that rightly it starts to claim a it it starts to claim this idea that uh the holders of eth benefit from the activity on eve and this idea has now been copied on other chains but i think where ethereum has made the mistake or where ethereum has a challenge is that it's done so but it's lost the user network effect without having enough good scaling right so the beginning of this year when i was speaking a lot of ethereum people they they told me optimistic roll-ups can be huge it's going to be a one-and-done and it's going to win the market and what i've seen now and you know at the time i talked about like you know what about the fact that it takes seven or eight days to to bridge down and you know they said stuff like well of course there will be market makers and market makers will provide the two-way well you know just the other day we were asked for a quote the guy i wanted to bring 3k eath down from barbra shroom to to to mainnet and i have no other side for that right because what are the odds that i find someone who wants to go the other way for the size i mean you see what i'm saying right it's just like there's kind of a there there's very much a uh gap between the ambitions of an ethereum and the kind of stated goals of an ethereum and then the reality of the execution but i think where you know the coin has done well relative to bitcoin is that bitcoin has also not done much as well right and and the market um all said well at least ether is better than bitcoin in that sense and that's why i think you know zooming out i actually find it really dangerous sort of a lot of the talks about like you know either flipping bitcoin or sort of you know either is better sort of value than bitcoin because actually uh it kind of misses the point both coins are down since may and other coins are up way more and other coins are also growing way faster so i think that kind of would almost be like the max payne scenario uh for the crypto markets where you know if bitcoin and ether were both seen as sort of older tech or like you know older uh projects where you can't really get rich anymore and it's just old people hold these coins uh and then here are the new coins where you can actually participate well that that gets you into a multi-coin world right and that gets you into something that you know the ogs will find dystopian but they would have trouble convincing others that it's dystopian you see what i'm saying right well i see i see why about the sort of that this is a cultural argument yes very much yeah it can be very effective i would say like we don't get around the point that as as a fundamental argument as a tech argument it has no validity because what all the other blockchains are doing in the in the in the worst case they are only trading sort of computational integrity or sort of the the the accountability of the blockchain for more throughput and this only scales to i mean this is not real scalability and it only sort of gets them so far um and then after a while they just run into the exact same problem their blockchain is also full and then are we saying sort of uh avalanche has abandoned their users or solana has abandoned their users i mean at some point they can become just the centralized database but i mean then you can just do that from the start as well so it's not really in this approach in the worst case gets you nothing and in the best case they actually have very similar roadmaps to ethereum where they say oh we're going to have sort of yeah we're going to have a sharded database basically where you only have to uh where only sort of the the proof that the computation a lot of computation happens off chain and you only prove to the main chain that the computation was done correctly this is sort of the form of charging this is kind of where we agree right i mean what i'm saying is basically that the road maps in the in the end game may all look very similar and then it's a question yeah which team will actually execute that vision and i'm saying that ethereum if it is solely trying to outperform bitcoin uh it will actually lose in the execution of that roadmap versus other l1s whose goal is more uh i mean in part because they start from nothing but also because their only way to grow is to get more users they will actually lose in that and so we've seen that right with like you know the avalanche gas has gone down again a huge amount after the recent upgrade the apricot five upgrade and uh you know this is something that um i only expect to continue to happen because even if we accept let's say ethereum and avalanche must follow the same roadmap then it's a question of who will execute that roadmap better who will execute it faster who will serve who will be more likely to serve users over holders this is something that i think is is the point right it's not about it's not about um you know if two have the same roadmap then automatically the older one wins this is kind of my point which is that if two have a similar road map actually the newer one is more likely to win because that's also what we've seen in tech right um and you know simani he makes the analogy of uh ios or he makes analogy of mo of mobile uh operating systems in 2009 where at that time there were a whole host of operating systems and people just said you know you know blackberry just has to win this they have the network effect and this has to win that and this has to win this and then if you look at what actually happened um you know the newer ones just you know because they don't have technical debt and because they have a different mentality which is uh not serving their existing users but you know trying to get new ones um that that dynamic is actually you know i do see that playing out um in a big way and and it's something that i think i think um in part what we're seeing now is is the is crypto trying to digest this um and and i think that um look i firmly personally believe in the story value case of crypto and so i think bitcoin and ether share that and they will go up a lot in dollars and you know we'll all continue to be rich right but uh when it comes to executing road maps for onboarding users into crypto networks i don't see bitcoin or ether really being able to do this and i personally am in the school of thought that bitcoin e3 will go up anyways because uh the store value case is is viable enough but i do also increasingly see uh someone like zamani's point which is that you know if at some point b b has a billion users uh even if it's a database um are you going to convince people that they need to buy bitcoin as a store value or either just throw a value you might not be able to right yeah because that narrative will not be very interesting there will be like a cult it'll be perceived as a cult and and so that i think is something that we do need to keep in the back of our minds when we uh think about how does the new user come to crypto and how do they see the space and how do they interact with it and not to see it as dystopian but to see it as a competition of free monies and a competition of free networks right um and and so it's these are some of the biggest questions in in crypto value cruel of course yeah i mean for any new user i would always recommend if you have ten thousand dollars you just don't belong on ethereum like you should use um bsc you should use 41 you should use average you should lose solana you should use avalanche and that's always sort of what i what i recommend because there's just no point ethereum layer one is not gonna scale for regular users it doesn't have to that's not the point so if you if you just like zoom out two years then or maybe let's say five years there's not going to be any regular users you will have some whale users on ethereum layer one but otherwise it's just basically proofs of off chain computation like then the entire chain is just going to be full of sort of this kind of settlement transactions where rollups send their proofs to the layer one and they sort of update the balance of some uh application like dydx does today for example um and that's what makes these uh applications non-custodial and trustless um and i think this is sort of this is the roadmap for for all layer one chains i think um you can say oh but we can have like a more scale like a chain that has more throughput so we can attract more users today but i think you yourself made the point why this kind of network effect is not something that buys you anything in the long term because there can always be a new chain and this new chain doesn't have to even to do anything different in terms of tech it can just say we're new and when you come to us then you can be early again and we just pay a lot of incentives and the same game starts over again so that's why personally i'm not really interested in in participating in these things because i don't see them as credible attempts to you know actually scale a blockchain um and sort of when we said blockchains are only about sort of having a database with computational integrity ethereum the ethereum roadmap and it's not only ethereum executing this worldwide but the ethereum roadmap the one the one of having a sharded database and the layer one that has only proofs i think that's the only credible attempt at actually scaling um this property and so i i'm interested in sort of all blockchains that take this approach but for the others i think it's just short-sighted but i think what you're missing is that you're taking kind of an objectivist approach right you're kind of saying this must be the solution that is the most technologically valid and hence you're only interested in that well be that as it may um you know these were the kind of criticisms put on solana in the early days and what we've seen is that solano's actually attracted a whole huge amount of grassroots developers and huge amounts of application interest right i would say the last 20 of our application bets uh 15 plus of them are non-ethereum mainly because we prefer to do best where the we can see it get to a million users um and i think for a lot of the other funds even the funds that were quite against solana i see them now trying to get into these rounds too and so it's just something that while i hear you on you know your vision of where the technology should be and how how it looks i do also see that the way that the industry is going is much more pragmatic which is to say i want to onboard the users now um and that's that's the that's the goal right and and so i just think that there needs to be a broad okay put it this way i think there needs to be a broad respect from the ethereum community for uh users i don't i don't think there's quite that respect for users and i and you can argue that there doesn't need to be because ethereum is on this mission to scale uh in this uh robust way but we're getting into bitcoin lightning network type of logic now too right where be that as it may you're you're free to do what you wish but you do run some risks of losing network effects um and and so i think that that's kind of what i would say about this i mean i think fundamentally it's it's it's talking on two different planes right or it's talking past each other where the set of priors are just different um so so my set of priors is to say okay we can invest in bitcoin and if there are stores of value that's fine um and we speculate on when we buy them and when we sell them and the global demand for user and the the global demand for crypto monies right but at the same time we also uh feel that applications on ethereum have really suffered from uh you know optimistic role of not being competitive and and then later on uh you know newer scaling not coming out um and you know the world we live in today is very different from the world uh we imagined when ethereum device was sort of at their highs and and so uh seeing that world i'm an introspective person so i look at that and and i ask myself why did it fail right what happened and the reasons that i'm seeing or the kind of the realities that i believe i am perceiving are that well first of all the builders are actually better on these other chains because they have chosen those other chains because they want to reach users so i see that with dokon and luna i see this uh with a few other projects and this i think is actually the anti-culture case for ethereum which is that it actually is unable to provide a space for these type of builders i remember during a clubhouse where andre chronos he said i think this was in like march i can't remember exactly when but he said like if you're an evm builder today you need to go to bsc immediately right and then you know at that time like then then a whole host of people went to bsc but i think that this is this is the future um of smart contracts application space and users and and so from my point of view um i do have a bit of regret and nostalgia for the d5 times and i wish that it would have gone better uh but i think that um you know the reason why i was so triggered by kane is because he kind of um is kind of the is kind of the ultimate example of sort of you know an ethogee who did very well holding eth basically um and then the project itself you know has kind of not been as you know and it's not something where i'm like shaming builders or this or that but he's the one who says you know you know anyone who's not building on ethereum layer two is like you know we're gonna keep track of all your names and then you know i'm not going to welcome you back to community i mean this is dangerous stuff i think um and this is stuff where yeah um i don't believe in it so i i think that um at the end of the day um the same problems that happened to bitcoin maximus are happening to ethereum maximus and the problem for ethereum is that while it matters less for bitcoin because you don't do anything with bitcoin it matters more for ethereum because you actually have to do things on ethereum and so if builders are starting to go to other chains which i see them doing this is a matter of debate that i have with some other funds but i do see builders going to other chains um especially solana especially avalanche then then the floodgates are very open on that and you won't we won't be able to claim in two years that all the innovation is on ethereum right and once you lose that uh then really what you have left is you can say that the evm uh enshrines eth as the holy asset which i think is happening um and that um it shares a store value case with bitcoin and that and that can be fine as it is right that that that really can be the end game of eth and um and it can do well but i don't think that um i don't think that this is something where um that that alternate layer ones are sort of um discredited for their approach because i it's kind of fascinating almost like as a fractal but i kind of see like eth as being what original bitcoin wanted to be in some ways right which is sort of um you know having nfts and having um having um defy and these kind of things and then i see like alt layer ones trying to be what ethereum is trying to be which is like you know uh yeah the reaching a building i think where vitalik said that um if there's like f what is it what did he say if there's like five cents he said bitcoin has five cents money yeah i mean stuff like that of course makes you look very bad in the future that's a given um yeah so so i mean and and and i think it's look like i still own more ethan pretty much i still own more ether than pretty much anybody i know so it's not something where but i think this is i mean this is also to me this is also like a warning sign but i mean vitalik is a very smart guy and he already yeah first like the bitcoin cash people fell on their face making the claim that you can guarantee some kind of low cost environment without sacrificing sacrificing all decentralization then vitalik made the same statement he fell on his face and now i see for me it's just it's just just groundhog day i see the same i see a new class of people repeat the same the the same things that already the bitcoin cash people have failed at vitalik has failed that they are not going to succeed in my opinion i think they are going to fail for the same reasons and that's sort of what makes me a bit frustrated about seeing these arguments because it's not yes i'm taking um like a technologist stand stands on this where i say yeah i'm better at evaluating um this than the market i can say this is gonna fail for you know technological reasons this is gonna run into its scaling limits and at some point also the narratives around it are going to collapse when the fees go up and they have no credible scaling roadmap so um but to me this this just feels like i've seen the story like play out more than once in the past i think the i think the the the sort of shortest rebuttal i would give to that is to say just look at the network growth rates on the other networks and then say let's assume that they run into scaling problems and let's assume that they solve them in the way that um uh would be maybe not acceptable to ethereum people and certainly not acceptable to bitcoin people i mean keep in mind too a lot of ethereum's decentralization trade-offs are completely unacceptable to bitcoin people right and so i so so i think that then you you're very much back in the fractal that i'm talking about which is that um you know ethereum people making the same arguments against other chains that bitcoin people make against that make against ethereum right and i guess what i would say is that um i do see these fighting product market fit and i do see these teams being at least more motivated to onboard users um and and so i guess what i'm what i'm warning or not warning but what i'm kind of predicting is that um [Music] that all layer ones will continue to do very very well and um i also see this in the web 2 investors that i speak with right because when when the web 2 investors come to crypto i think some of them you know they they gravitate toward the uh toward the ethereum vision um but then as they do they start to see like okay well how fast is this network growing because because i'm investing in network effects right how fast they're growing and then they see that all the other chains are having way faster network effects and then they're saying okay well what is the reason for this and and so if the reason is that ethereum is waiting for its own scaling then it starts to sound like bitcoin right it starts to sound a lot like like bitcoin so um then they're like okay well i clearly need a hedge because these are already outperforming either by a lot and on top of that there's you know very credible uh activity happening i understand that either people say it's not decentralized but i also understand that big people say ether is not decentralized you see what i'm saying there right so so that that's kind of what i'm predicting basically and and i think that um i think that for me like i kind of had the thesis uh fortunately relatively early uh during the bear market that i think all all layer ones are yeah deeply undervalued because these are real teams building stuff and i was fortunate enough to you know so so like polka dot kusama uh avalanche near um oh i mean we pretty much said at that time you know pretty much any alt layer one that is doing like that is shipping code uh is is gonna is just is incredibly undervalued by the market i think um richard we had on our podcast at the acm he had basically that thesis and he helped us kind of see it which is that um for the same reasons that ethereum grew very quickly these chains also will grow very quickly because the penetration of smart contract users and and and just you know applications is a zero of the main population so it's it's it's a world where we live in where um you know just to give an example right like taizo tazos just did a great deal with ubisoft where they're gonna give something like 10 million wallets to ubisoft users and then holding fts in them so i mean i can see a world where chains can do well just being used in one country right and then and then going from there and and so i guess what i'm saying is like the world is a very very big place and i see layer ones doing very different approaches to biz dev very different approaches to users um and i think that this is healthy actually for broader crypto it it does hurt a bit of um ethereum dominance like i think ethereum would be much closer to flipping bitcoin today if ethereum had managed to find you know if it basically what we think of as the scaling road map in 2025 if it had been achieved by today right um but um be that you know being that we're in the world we are in today i see sort of more of a hybrid bitcoin and ether will share a store value case and then i see a multiple you know a multitude of all their ones and i and i think that i mean not to say that this is good or bad but just to say this is i think just the reality why do you so ethereum has also of course gone through periods of extreme growth um and back in the day we used to use this as um an investment case for ethereum over bitcoin right we saw that yeah bitcoin was valued much higher but ethereum growth in in any relevant metric was just leaving bitcoin completely in the dust there were more i think what i realized i think what i realized looking back is that we were asking the wrong question we were asking the uh we were asking the wrong question which is the og question which is should i own more ethereum bitcoin but that's actually the wrong question well my question to you would have been why why do you think that the growth that these newer chains are seeing is going to be more sticky than the growth that ethereum has seen uh well what i would say is that their growth has already been much faster than bitcoin and ethereum and their growth can continue to be much faster because one they don't have technical debt bitcoin has technical debt right ethereum has huge technical debt these new ones they don't have technical debt in part because they're more centralized but also in part because they're newer right um so you know they're already proof of stake well for ether it will be very hard to go proof of stake it will take months and months right and there will be a lot of questions as we go into it and and and so technical debt is one reason also i think um the spirit of community is another right where um the the concept of getting in on the ground floor is very attractive to people and you know if you look at either today like it doesn't offer the opportunities i think that um it did when people uh were around 2019. so even if you look at like you know talking about airdrops right like all all this stuff is for if you were a user in 2019 as far as i'm concerned like ens yeah you registered it in 2019 you know using some of these products okay like some of them late 2020 but they're all kind of like i mean i would posit that it's all the same two thousand users two thousand to five thousand uh you know that that that are basically benefiting from this and and so that's kind of the big challenge i think uh which is uh ethereum's growth of users on l1 has basically gone to zero right um because of the fees and i can accept the argument that that's fine because we'll do rollups but i would then also argue that if you assume that's true then the growth rates on altair ones will be very fast because there is a demand for people to get involved in crypto and this is where they will go and so for me it's trivial that the growth rate of user counts and activity on other chains will be faster than on ethereum um it's a broader question what will outpace the other in dollars today uh from where we are here because obviously we are already up 1000x on solana we're already up you know hundreds of access on these other coins and the these are all kinds of um you know we're we're trying to get to questions of like what is a fair percentage of ethereum market cap these things should be but i think when it comes to user accounts when it comes to activity levels when it comes to new builders uh new passionate builders who want to build billion dollar applications i very much see these going to solana starkware avalanche and a few others and i think that that's just natural um so i do think that when there is um more opportunities to deploy on l2 i think they'll also do so but i think that ethereum has lost that network effect of being able to say all innovators come to my chain and join my community um i didn't realize it quite early enough i think if i had i would have just sold all my ether for salon on avalanche but you know be that as it may i was comparing either too much to bitcoin and you know so i suffered that fate along with you basically um you know as part of the sort of the og crowd now that you know debates bitcoin versus ether all day right you know and you know i've met young guys like retail guys like they're like 50 sold 50 abax from a dollar you know and these guys are just like why do you even talk about bitcoin and ether like what what is the point and and so like there is that perspective that i have to remind myself of each time because each generation each crypto wave has brought in uh new people right and their perspective is very different from yours and mine and you know you know speaking of these kind of guys i do i am sometimes struck by like are we the boomers you know yes um i think i would be i mean i i i would agree that somebody who comes in today won't use bitcoin in in ethiopia and they shouldn't because for the reasons that we talked about but that doesn't mean that they are any more right in the long term i think if you've only been here for half a cycle then i think there's definitely the risk of sort of over overvaluing what is new and what you know over what is long-term viable i would say that at the end of the day i'm i'm a pragmatist i'm i have no uh ideological reason to support ethereum i would say i'm pretty far from from being like an ideologue i i think that in terms of its roadmap it's actually it's going to be cheaper and better for a user and an application builder to use um a rollup that posts you know proofs to ethereum then these alternate layer ones if if they are just a layer one so they can have the same role the same um the same sharding road map and then i think it's sort of a fair game um but i think that this approach is probably going to win out over the you know monolithic layer one approach um and i say that because i believe in it for you know that it's like pragmatically the the best approach and not because i think it's somehow more i don't know that it's like for moral reasons or whatever right i mean i get what we were saying but i guess my point is that for like for for me as someone who invests prolifically in applications i i see the strongest applications being built on non-ethereum these days and that's something that i would have been absolutely if you had told me this a year ago i i would have said absolutely no way zero chance all the innovation i see is on ethereum and now all the application innovation i see is not on ethereum and and so this is just for me that's my perspective on it and that makes me sad in a way because it's different from what i thought it would be and it's different from what i hoped it would be um and so i think that i think that that's kind of where where the the the the biggest fear for me in crypto is that if we get to a world where the end game is then you don't need to have any like like you you get to the most centralized chain and then that is the thing that you know i mean i'm kind of seeing this like and it scares me with some of these web 2 guys and they're saying like well you know what you don't even need crypto you just have tokens the whole point is tokens uh once you have tokens uh you can incentivize everybody you incentivize your users you can get rid of the [ __ ] blockchain right yeah yeah just give tokens and this is i mean kobe was 20 mothers a bit as well and this this is what really scares me because if we don't if we don't make reasonably credible applications that that scales users you you do some run some risks that like um you know we're just talking about tokens in five years that run in actual databases um so so i i come from that perspective but i mean i mean i think at the end of the day like it's it's it's the points on both sides are really well understood now i think you know the market will decide the new users will decide the new builders will decide and and and i think it's not even worth debating honestly because i think it's more about prognostication right so people will step their chips the way they want to set them and and then that's it yeah i completely agree i i i'm a pretty strong believer in the thesis that fast forward five years and people will be using applications they will not be using blockchains they would be going directly to applications like they go to their bank their broker whatever their super app and they will be using these applications and they will know that it's non-custodial but they won't know on what chain it runs um and they they won't have to they don't have to care and then it's purely a matter of what chain um can get the best yeah properties to to build us into users um and there won't be any sort of yeah i mean any reason to favor one over the other for any other reason and um yeah that's that's that's definitely also the approach that i'm taking and um if it's true that other chants can capture better builders and can retain them in the long term then i definitely think that these chains are in a good position personally i don't i don't see that right now i think definitely it's very attractive for a new builder to build on new chains but it's also because these chains tend to be empty empty here and this is not going to sustain so there's some amount of short-termism and they tend to be big incentives right so between building on ethereum and building on avalanche where i know that ava labs have is you know paying out huge they are dumping like avex incentives on on any application that builds there of course that's a huge bribe for me as an application builder to favor their chain but i also know that this is not long-term sustainable right so at some point the this this sort of incentivized growth will taper off and then what matters is the actual technical trade-offs well i think the why well i think the the the biggest counter-argument to what you said is that it's already been wrong for many months now right where um you know from the vision that we would have seen a year ago to now it's already been wrong and then so i think the question is then at what point will that vision be correct and i think the answer that most ethereum people give is that the it will be correct when we finally have l2 scaling that is competitive with uh the experience the user experience on layer ones um that is what they say but what they're underestimating is that the new users don't have an allegiance to ether the way that you do right so even when that is out there is no guarantee that the new user will then say i value the technical trade-off of ethereum i'm going to go there that i think is the biggest point and i would also make the point that starkware does not belong to ethereum right starcover belongs to itself and they very much do not plan to pay rent to ethereum so this is something too where i would say um arguably all l2s will not want to pay rent to ethereum in my opinion they will also end up becoming like l1s so so that that kind of is my biggest kind of point which is that the execution layer the execution environment that provides the best experience for applications uh whether incentivized or not uh once it has those and once it has a flywheel of users coming in that's incredibly powerful and i've seen that with bsc and binance where you know even with a weaker technical roadmap they've been able to capture half of all i mean they just have by far the most users of any chain it's not even close right and that's why all the new gamefly companies are launching their games on on bsc because that's just where the users are um so i think that it's just something where i find the ethereum rhetoric to be more out of touch with where i see applications and users going than ever before and this is something that i think is is honestly irrelevant to the average eatholder because like i said i think each value crew now is not coming from that stuff it's coming from people buying bitcoin and ether together as part of a monetary basket and so i get why they're also out of touch with it because they're because their goals are different and their you know kind of ideas are different but if we're talking about um where users are and where they're going where builders are going i do find it very facile to say well as soon as we get our layer twos up then they're all gonna come back i i personally not a believer in that because i don't think that that's um i it's not how i've seen the world play out if we if we say that the builders just build on you know what's cheapest and gives them the best guarantees to them and their users then i think that there's a good chance that um many applications will favor building on a roll-up that set it to ethereum um like we see with dydx right dydx you couldn't build it on the layout on blockchain not really um you can only build it in in an environment where computation is really cheap even cheaper than it is on solana and i think that we're probably gonna see more of that in the future i think i mean dydex is a great example too right because if you look at if you look at um what antonio said he he said that you know we we built this on starkware and finalizing to ethereum if they have our opportunity to finalize other chains they will definitely do so um and you know the starcore guys have said from the beginning like we will we will offer this to all chains right so ethereum does not i i guess my point is ethereum does not own the idea of a roll-up they do not own the idea of a zk roll-up they did they did funded in the beginning of the ethereum foundation but they absolutely do not own the idea of it so if this is such a good idea this is not an ethereum idea this is a point that cosmani made in a thread a while ago which is that ethereum people's main rebuttals to why they don't have the user network effect now is that they say well wait for zk roll ups to get huge and then i'm going to have it but zk roll ups are going to be everywhere so this is not unique to ethereum exactly exactly i think but that's it's interesting how we both see sort of the same argument in favor of our point um yeah you see what i'm saying because because your point your point assumes your point assumes a point of reference right you you you have a very objectivist way of viewing the world and you and you have this point of reference which is that it started with eth and it comes back to youth so the activity all comes back in the end because we all recognize this you know similar to when you're a very bullish bitcoin right like the the monetary maximalism like it all it all comes back and we're all competing as monies but then it all comes back to the thing itself and kind of what i see is that um this this may or may not happen but i don't have the certainty that you do that it will come back to ethereum because i do see the users i do see the applications like very much building elsewhere so for for me it's far more it's far more dangerous to have certainty than to have like uncertainty in this kind of a situation where i see like nine out of ten projects building on ethereum today okay so i should um i should i should also clarify i definitely agree with you i don't think uh everything's going to come back to ethereum i'm i'm a very strong believer in an a in the multi-chain world um a lot of changes that are going to be connected via light client proofs or some other like we have a going to have a very diverse set of bridges that connect blockchains using different um just assumptions a that's one thing that i strongly believe b one thing that we already discussed i think um people are not gonna interact with blockchains in the future it is applications that are going to interact with blockchains and people are going to interact with the applications and the wallets and that is their only interface to the world of blockchain and eventually users will not decide to use chain agent bhnc but they will only there will be the application developers who decide what chain gives them the best assurances and the cheapest cost and c i think i believe in the unbundling of the blockchain so right now ethereum and other chains there are sort of many things at once they are consensus they are data storage and they are computational it is all happening within the same layer and increasingly i think people see that it actually makes more sense to unbundle these different steps because then you can build layers that are strongly optimized to do one or the other and i think i only believe sort of i'm cautiously optimistic that ethereum is understanding that and sort of getting in position to to dominate in this world where the different layers of the blockchain are unbundled right so they say they say yeah a computation is there's no place for computation on ethereum this is just a place where people you know post proofs of data and then settle between different applications and so on and partially they also say this is a place where you can store data if you need the highest assurances but i don't even think ethereum is really going to compete as as a data availability layer um so i i completely agree that ethereum is sort of going to lose it it's not even going to gain it's going to lose a lot of its current activity and this this is going to happen on more um optimized blockchains like um like starkware um and so on and but nonetheless i think that other blockchains are in even worse position for how this future is going to develop and that that makes me sort of cautiously optimistic on ethereum i think the the whole premise or the whole world view is just different from the way i view it i think i think like like like to caricature a sort of an ethereum person who like you know i'm most derisive about it it would be someone who's like mainly like half their tweets per day are about how other ones are not decentralized and how they're gonna fail um and you know i i think that you know be that as it may like just have to find something better to do with your time right like it's the same as the bitcoin maximalists who like like literally half their tweets are about why ethereum is is too centralized it's the same it reminds me the same thing it comes from the same part of the brain too actually and i think it's actually the same type of mentality because during the bear market you know ethereum almost died right like it was almost to the point where people thought it would be chain death uh and so that that did create like this culture of saying okay well you know we are going to defend the asset i need the value and you know that's actually one reason why i got more interested in investing in eath as an asset at that time uh like a hundred dollars because i just thought you know this is actually undervalued as a as a tribe as a network um and so people went through so much they are never going through so much on it they lost all their money they got liquidated on their makers cdps they're still building on it you know i went to all the ethereum meetups that i could in in southeast asia and and so i i i really sensed that and i think now we're at the flip point of that kind of where you know it's um i feel like that same energy i see everywhere else except on where i think it needs to be on ethereum and and and so that that kind of scares me because then if i like zoom out a bit more then i recognize like like you know just as i was early to eat at that time other people have you know been early to solana or avalanche with other chains and also seen that and and so then i i kind of i kind of just i'm always very skeptical or i'm very very very cautious because i know this is an effect in crypto and it's a wealth endowment effect where like a tribe becomes wealthy and then poo poo's everybody else right so bitcoiners became wealthy and then spend their whole life pooping everybody else and i'm arguing partially that like ethereum people become wealthy and then start poo pooing everybody else and it's not all ethereum people right it's not all uh but i do think that that's not healthy um uh and i do think that uh if they take that too far and they ingrain that in the culture then it will end up very much like a bitcoin roadmap which you know is is not great right in terms of tech technology and and so i think that's kind of my perspective i mean it's not a question of optimistic or not optimistic it's just it's just the it's just the reality that i perceive kind of thing um i don't make a problem i don't make predictions based on like how i feel it will happen i make positions just purely based on the idea that things that are happening like this if they continue then what will that mean and and i think that the legitimacy of altair one is incredible now versus during the bear market during the bear market when i bought solana saps i was so embarrassed about it i couldn't even tell anybody about it because solano was a dirty word i don't know if you remember but solano was a dirty word back then uh if you were if you were talking about alt-letter ones back then it was a dirty word in the ethereum community um and and so you know fast forward to now where i see the legitimacy of it uh from you know tier one investors from traditional finance investors and that's something that that's something that i think is striking right and it is different um and so i then asked myself the question how will this continue how is this continuing to evolve if this is the if this is the analogy of like operating systems then um then the technical debt one struggles against the new ones right the ones with existing users struggle against the ones that have uh growing new users so i guess what i'm saying is i think that uh like everyone should just keep open mind and i think that there is a strain of ethereum maximalism that is getting pretty active uh and i think that it is the same type of part of the brain as bitcoin maximalism and i think that it's it's very very dangerous yeah i mean i can i completely agree i also see these trends it's not something that i participate in when i see it honestly i just mute them to be honest same as i do with the bitcoin maximum lists um i think fortunately the culture and ethereum is not so much it's better it's still better it's still better than bitcoin in the sense that they they at least are open-minded i mean i think interestingly bitcoin culture i think is getting better now i think it kind of hit a low uh maybe a few months ago and then now they're kind of you know like like i was i was just speaking to our mutual friend leo who recently moved to singapore and he was saying how like in the bitcoin community now there's like this really big push to like add scripting and to like make d5 possible and these kind of things right because they're just watching and i and i saw a great thread just the other day by a vague who was saying how like you know these these nfts why are we not doing nfts now on a counterparty right why do we not use nfcs to fund bitcoin core developers and um it's actually really interesting thing with the free ross uh nft where i think one of the bidders who ended up losing but he was like this anonymous bitcoin billionaire whose plan was to burn the nf like if he had won his plan was to burn the nftn ethereum and reissue it on counterparty um and and so you know you're kind of seeing like uh you're kind of seeing this this uh renaissance possibly on bitcoin where they just say you know what we're not going to actually call nft scams we're not going to actually call token scams or d5 scams we're just going to we're just going to like try stuff again right and and try to make it yeah so so i mean it's definitely bottoms in terms of that kind of stuff uh yeah whether it's enough it's a different question but it's it's definitely bottomed i you know i i i mean i see a theory maximism still on the way up in general um and i think it's only made worse by the fact that your new users are going into new chains right so at some point i think it'll um i think it'll stop um but i i do think that um it's it's maybe just the structure of uh of human civilization actually if you think about it right because it's like you know you you kind of have um you know you kind of get to a point where you know you you you become the dominant in this sphere and then you want everyone to recognize this and then it becomes very tough to compete with newcomers too because you know they're they're you know they take cheap shots or they take shortcuts that you can't take or you know they they take things and then and then so the reaction is to to kind of insulate from that right and the reactions kind of justify the existing decisions and these kinds of things and but but soon it gets to it gets to a point where um where if if it's taken too far uh it runs the real risk of just being out of touch with what the market wants and if it gets to that point so so example about a touch in my opinion would be optimistic roll up where they they actually thought they would be market makers to to bridge like on and off sizes so [Music] i think that the the danger is to become out of touch right and i think that ethereum has a better chance of not being out of touch because fundamentally i think it's a very eclectic group of people and there are different uh people working on different solutions um but um i just don't think it's something that people should argue about like all the time i think just the just the desire to have arguments about it shows the weakness already in my opinion um because they could just be that they could just be building instead or they could just be acquiring users instead um so it's um it's that's just the way i perceive that's just the way i perceive what's happening i think you're not entirely guilt-free in starting this argument i think i think that um [Music] i mean for me it's it's really uh it's really an snx thing too because i mean you know i've talked brightly about snx for a long time right and kind of as the first divi project and i've showed snx to people and said this is an incredible team it's going to be this and maybe that and it really has not and then i've seen luna do really well and luna is basically the same thing except just executed way better right and i thought a lot about like why why did this happen you know at some point i own a lot of luna in the past too and then i sold it uh for more d5 stuff and you know now i've bought back a lot as well but i just thought a lot about like what was my premise that back then right my premise then was like well you know you generally sell alt layer once for more eth you generally sell other applications for more east defy and then you you know like that's the positive that i'm coming from right it's coming primarily from one of saying my thesis on this was very wrong actually and why was it so wrong and you know like in a way like you and i are right like we misled people into the d5 vision of the world i remember when we did that thing with arthur and the you know top d5 projects we talked about luna and then we just pooped it we were like uh like it's some yeah it's not on eath so we don't care right you remember that right and i think luna market cap is like more than all the e stuff combined now so it's just something where i think that um it's a huge blind spot for us and i am one who's like incredibly self-critical so i just think like why did we have this blind spot like what was the problem with this thesis and i think i know the answer which is that it just assumes a world where eth is the only smart contract chain and it also assumes a world where um other people are just debating ethers bitcoin all day pretty much um so i think with that in mind um i think that snx rubs me the wrong way because they you know like optimistic roll-up like you you it it basically basically i i see it as like of all the projects that like should not be allowed to shame others for exploring scaling solutions like synthetics is like like king among the ones that like don't have that right to shame anybody for it right so i think that this is just the reality and and i think too it's something where i mean the reason why i think it got so many likes and was just like so so popular among basically everybody except for eth maxis is that users don't like being talked down on by eighth maxis they just don't like it um they actually don't like etham axes as people and they also don't like ethereum if it is the kind of chain that just says okay like you know you should you know you know you're using something centralized right or you're you know you're doing something stupid right you know it's just it's just paternalism that's very similar by the way it's a bitcoin maximus but journalism during the bear market which is to say oh you own [ __ ] coins oh you own you know this you know there's all this stuff you know [ __ ] coin minimalism all this kind of stuff so i think that this is something that as people think about harder um they will see the parallels and i think they will see the danger um but with that said um i look i think that there's a big separation for me be between whether if the asset will do well and ethereum the network i don't think the ethereum i'm i'm less optimistic than you on ethereum the network uh having any kind of dominance over smart contracts uh execution space so so it's just a it's just it's just a point of prediction i guess the disagreement i do see eat the asset doing well in general i'm not sure if it outperforms bitcoin or not from here but i think it will do well in general because it is a widely held asset that has a that has a strong brand and it also has um great liquidity from amm pools from people putting their coins um you know in univ3 pools and so i think that um it's not something where i'm telling people to like sell all their ether or or like buy all the ether or anything like that it's just i don't see i see a big gap between uh what ether was supposed to be what i thought ethereum was supposed to be and where it is today i i see that gap the biggest um as sort of the most prolific investor in ethereum defy uh and ethereum nfts for for quite some time and and so this gap to me is is just uh it's just saddening to see um so i come at it from that perspective it's not the perspective of a multi coin which was just right from the beginning that you know ethereum would not have this network effect as as predicted um it's very much from one who believes in this and then now realizing that uh it's it's a much weaker network effect than postulated you know i love that about crypto that um even even we who have been in crypto for so long and um have think about this all day can still have big disagreements about how we think the future is going to develop and i think that that makes it just the most interest like intellectually the most interesting space in the world and also the most interesting market um so i definitely appreciate the honest conversation that we have today this one thanks and take care [Music] you
