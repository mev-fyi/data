welcome to uncommon core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles this show is hosted by suzu the ceo and chief investment officer of three hours capital and me hasu a crypto researcher and writer in this episode sue and i brought on legendary crypto trader kobe who is at crypto cobain on twitter to talk about the bull case for ethereum and its upcoming catalysts whether eth can flip in btc and what advisor said kobe to survive several market cycles to date enjoy thanks so much for joining sue yeah me too and um our special guest today is um kobe welcome hello mate hello how you doing thanks for having me i'm doing great thanks so you know you you have a huge twitter following and like you have been forever basically in crypto one could say you're a real dinosaur and um but you know that considered it's um just crazy to me that i didn't know you until like half a year ago um i i only joined the space in 2018. um did you did you like take a break or something um or have you always been around all this no i think what it is you know is like you're a serious person are you like you you take this you take this thing quite seriously like you do you write research and and stuff and um my account just tells jokes and honestly they're not even very good jokes they're uh like low brow humor so i think i think a lot of people see the account and ignore it thinking like this count is like well why would i follow that it seems it doesn't even make sense most of the time um and then after a while it just it ends up on their feed so often that they capitulate into the follow button you know i don't think i don't actually don't think that's it but you're very good at the self de decor i must say um no it's just that you know for these accounts that have been around forever there are so many accounts that have like a couple hundred thousand followers if they have been around for like in like 2017 but it's almost like an anti-signal because you know some of them are just way too rich to care they have stopped following the space stop learning um they're just selling out but um you know when i sort of found your account i i thought it that it's actually a completely different from how you'd expect like a large account from you know back in the day to be um because like your tweets are actually actually extremely intelligent um i really like that humor but i'm also taking uh a lot away from your commentary yeah you know i think a lot of the old accounts um either changed hands or they truly lost interest and missed out on the on the run and like there isn't many um people that were on twitter the same time that i was on twitter that like made it through each cycle and then like capitalized on each of them i think uh a lot of those people lost interest in the bear markets they got wrecked over leveraging themselves um in like a period of sideways um and really missed out so that look there's a few of them like angelo um is a king and uh you know he's still half around now semi-retired tweets every now and again currently 10 million underwater on dogecoin or something but um i think the majority of those like big um like early accounts that the account ownership has changed hands or they just like lost interest in the space and now they're they're bitter because they sort of missed out on the um on the greatest ballroom of all time yeah it's um it's funny that you that you say this um so tell us a bit about sort of who you are where you're coming from but i'm especially interested in how did you manage to sort of rekindle the interest for crypto like for so many cycles and for so many years that's that's the most fascinating thing for me about you yeah so um i had like a bit of a uh uh unusual or strange life to be honest where i like optimize for doing loads of stuff i optimize for having as many experiences as possible because i believe that um uh variety makes you younger in that every time you have a new memory you do something new that doesn't blend into the ordinary uh you experience it um uh like more profoundly and more presently uh it extends your life in a in sort of like a way of multitude of experiences rather than just the same thing over and over and over again um but yeah i like have a computer science background did computer science at uni dropped out of uni to play in a band for a while went back and finished my degree um did tech startups and in parallel like did hobby crypto stuff all along and i guess the reason um i stayed interested in cryptos like i i don't i don't want to be a dude that says i'm in it for the tech but i find like the tech side pretty interesting so i find that easy to like slowly plod along and keep up to date um up to date with and i find the cyclical nature of the market that we've had over the last 10 years has been hugely favorable to anyone that was able to address the reality and say this is sideways this is you know a period of pain during this time all you have to do is sort of grit your teeth and weight rather than over leveraging yourself and um uh like like getting liquidated on a candle that like if you look at the chart now you can't even see any more because it's just like noise yeah and i mean i strongly relate to what you said about sort of making new experiences that that's one of the things that really shows you how subjective our you know we experience time like when we learn something new then somehow this you know the passage of time seems to slow down i think that's one of the really beautiful things about life yeah i think this is the reason that the guy that started airbnb said he started airbnb but maybe it just sounds pretty um yeah we definitely get into sort of your experience through the different market cycles and so on um later on and also um pick your brain um uh like a lot of things um in the crypto space but first so i have a question for you sue because in october 2020 when we released our episode with light crypto and you know that that very well got a lot of attention and a lot of people are still listening it today and we still get a lot of you know messages um sort of about what we said about ethereum in that episode i think at that time we were basically like peak bearish on ethereum especially you and six months later you're now super bullish so um what happened in the meantime think i think as traders we sometimes use hyperbole just to just for impact but um no i think at that time there were a lot of inflows into bdc in the odc market bitcoin usd that that was around the time of the sailor inflows it was well before the i think the price was probably around 12k 11k then and fbdc was around 0.031 it proceeded to go to around 0.024 before starting to bounce and and i think i mean that at that time it was just a backdrop of the institutions are coming for digital gold thesis and this is something that i i mean i still believe if everyone comes together and says this is the digital gold then wow we're then yes then bitcoin will definitely separate from the pack and and fbtc ratio would go down quite a bit but i think to the contrary of that kind of i believe you've you've also saw a lot of interest in what defy is actually doing um to to to challenge the traditional financial rails and also you're seeing ethereum tokenomics improve and you're seeing ethereum community improve as well so i think in that backdrop i mean we can go out into it more later in depth about the bold case for ether the bulkheads for ethereum but i do think the bold case has been stronger than ever uh at this moment yeah um i totally agree and yeah i think if we have sort of a high level topic for this episode why not make let's make it the like the unpacking sort of the bookcase for ethereum um so let's jump into some of the different catalysts and why you think we are more bullish than ever so maybe starting with um erp-1559 so um to both of you how how does the fp15f9 change the the tokenomics of of ether and make it more attractive yeah i mean i don't know the exact number if i'm honest but i i think it's something like if one 559 and the merge were active already there would be something like 800 um east uh new east issued yesterday and like fifteen thousand new uh fifteen thousand east burned um and the validators receive like six thousand uh of those ethan transaction fees which if you annualize works out is like a sixty to seventy percent apr from um from staking but if you take a look at those numbers a little bit uh more closely fifteen thousand youth burned is gigantic compared to the daily issuance now at the moment i think it's about 70 million um go to miners every day and about half of that is uh is from inflation like new east issued um if it's going down to like 800 issued with so much um supply burned the pure really basic supply demand uh equation just becomes incredibly favorable um to to ethereum um not to mention that the staking reward also incentivizes people if it gets to 60 70 percent i think it might get to like 50 and it incentivizes people that hold east to lock up their eth for even longer which like compounds this uh um this supply demand issue even further i think it's massive and people are not truly factoring it in and i think they're not factoring in because eth2 has become a bit of a meme like is too soon too soon like the merge is going to happen soon and like like it's like 20 21 i think the current year um and we still haven't merged i think people are just saying are going like yeah this this is not real this is not going to happen ever um but the truth is like eap 1559 will happen in summer and the merge will probably happen later in the year so they'll both be reality by the end of the year i think yeah i think philosophically right it gets back to the question of what did satoshi invent i saw this vitalik uh presentation at one of the devcons where he said he invented cryptoeconomics that's what he invented and i think that that idea is is i think a startling one because what it would mean is that if there were a coin that managed to get its community together to coalesce around its value proposition and also to transact and use it as the underlying chain that they work on then then that would be i mean basically bitcoin is also that and so to sort of compare and contrast their valuations you also have to compare and contrast how they function in their ecosystem and how they function um not not just as a store of value in the mythological sense or in the narrative sense but in its ecosystem itself and so from that point of view it's quite easy to see why eip1559 is hyper bullish because it represents uh it represents an assertion that ether is the native collateral of ethereum and that eth uh will accrue value within this ecosystem and will try to be as as sound as possible as something that people will hold so but i do think that there are also good arguments i mean they're always having good arguments on the big corner side that eth is changing too much all the time but i think that if you look at the stewardess or not the stewardess but the stewarding of uh the the ethereum project it it has been done in such a way that it is generally protecting the rights of youth holders um and and as long as that continues this confidence has only been increasing over time by people so yeah right i mean people love to point out that you know either eve's monetary policy has been changed um a few times before and then you have sort of the erratic seeming difficulty bomb where issuance tends to slow down and then all of a sudden the difficulty bomb is reset and then issuance spikes up again and it just makes for an incredibly ugly looking graph um and i i actually thought that you know sort of the if communities of breaking or if developers breaking this this rule that they would never increase issuance for the beacon chain where they they generally like added a second issuance um i thought that also back in october that this was would be perceived as more you know sort of breaking this narrative that you'd never um increase issuance only lower it but it hasn't at all so that was one of the things where i would say yeah um i was wrong i thought the market would pick up on this and it didn't at all so i mean personally i'm okay with that totally um yeah i i think it's interesting because a lot of um like the the core bitcoin um maxi camp often cite this is a uh a thing that's bad about eth and in many ways you can agree with them right like if your um goal is like a political or philosophical argument around removing serenity um about having serenity and removing um state from money then bitcoin is by far your best bet um it's by far the most uh decentralized and the most difficult to change like you saw with bitcoin cash that um uh like large highly influential um participants in the ecosystem tried to make um a relatively big change to bitcoin and it was um and it was rejected but i just don't think those things are investment theses like i think it's uh like it you can have that as a your political belief or you can have that as your philosophical belief and you can also at the same time take an unbiased look at how the tokenomics of ethereum change and say hmm that's probably favorable for the price of ethereum um which is completely disconnected from you know uh from unless you're entirely allocating capital based on philosophical or um political reasons which if you want to do that go ahead but um i'm not someone that you should follow in that case um i think if you separate those two things out i think it makes a lot of sense so i agree with a lot of the bitcoin maxi arguments like bitcoin is the most decentralized currency and not having a central financial planner that's changing tokenomics um makes for something that you don't have to you know rely on a certain group of people it makes it um something that you don't even have to trust because it's going to stay the same all the time but i just don't think that's an investment argument i think it is something totally different yeah i mean it's um on some level you would think that the goal of every coin is to basically just maximize you know the value of that coin for its holders and that's how it wins that's how it wins yeah so everything's safe moon you would think so right but something everything with levels of sophistication yes on top of it i would say i would say the other dimension is probably sustainability right i mean you can you can design we have learned a lot about basically tokenomics and you know complementals if you were um from the first d5 summer i would say books will be written about sort of the 101 of of you know how to pump a coin based on that um but you know not everything is like like the higher your complement is the lower the sustainability of the pump tends to be right yeah and um i think for that's also something that you know in a very different time scale bitcoin and ethereum have to also look at and deal with right how can you really create the best economics as possible because the coin with the best economics for its holders will be and the most sustainable right to economics will be the coin that wins ultimately uh at least on a very long time scale and i also think that yeah p1559 just dramatically improves um the tokenomics of eve and that's why i see it as you know a very positive catalyst yeah what i find more interesting than the pure tokenomics or the explicit changes to supply and demand or whatever is the attitudes towards these things from each um each like both the communities the holders the developers and stuff the attitudes towards um how you should approach monetary policy uh attracts people that agree with the same thing right so it's like these sort of self-reinforcing communities where if you believe that um like sort of theolog like satoshi at some point was a central planner and he wrote the tokenomics for bitcoin and now they exist forever and they should never be unchanged they should never be changed it's like that's set in stone almost biblically um then people that believe that flock to this community and for people that uh take a lot more of the facebook move fast break things um you know change things when they feel necessary to be changed they seem to flock to the ethereum community so what i find more interesting is how over time those individual attitudes will um will scale and will sort of grow with the network because um on one hand uh as ethereum ages it may lose uh that sort of yeah we can just change things type of approach and it might become a lot more boring and uh stable but equally it might just be something that's fostered into the developer community and just something that exists forever and uh you know for the rest of time you have to read exactly what's happening on eth week to week because things might change from october to april you know i definitely hope that it will i mean it's good that they can sort of pivot into the better designs and that's what we're seeing right now still but i would think that they have to you know tune it down at some point sort of the iteration because already today um if you don't pay it like if you build a large application on ethereum and um you don't pay attention to sort of the governance and it it could just be that some of your competitors get a proposal into the next hard forks that that sort of wrecks off your smart contracts and this is something that should definitely not be the case like you should definitely strive for i mean i sort of like how vitalik puts it you know with a sort of incredible neutrality if you build on ethereum then you should have to guarantee that your application is um is good you know for at least a few years at the very minimum um so um but moving on um from erp-159 we talked about the merge right um and this was basically accelerated accelerated by so the miners getting angry about yeah p1559 threatening to stage like a um a demonstration of power on april 1st that then didn't happen um but still it sort of showed the community like let's accelerate so the transition to to proof of stake and as i understand you're probably following that closer than almost anybody because of your involvement with lido is that can we talk about that yeah yeah so i am was part of the lido team for the majority of last year uh and now i'm like part of the uh independent member of down no longer a member of the of the core team but um vasily from the uh the core team is one of the uh smartest crypto people i've ever met um maybe just people maybe i don't need a prefix with crypto anymore they've merged into the same thing um and yeah happy to happy to chat about it um yeah so light was a is a stacking service basically right for for f2 currently on the beacon chain but then i mean for you the the merge is super relevant right because it basically expands your market by like 100 100x or something like on ethereum yeah so the main um the main goals behind lido were initially to fix the staking user experience issues for ethereum so you know there's a they design it in a slightly like a non-user-friendly way which is um maybe just how they do things but the you know you can't stake um anything except multiples of 32 eth problem and when you stake eth on um you feel like if you stake today uh you like spin up your own validator and stake today you're basically moving your eth to eth2 and you're earning rewards that you can't access um until transactions are enabled on these two which is like some point in the future maybe like whenever whenever they've whenever they've um finished up their bits and bobs so having it's like a very big commitment um and at the like 32 east now is you know a decent amount of money so uh it disincentivizes or prices out retail that's ethereum's motto for 2021 isn't it just pricing out retail no matter what you do you price out of retail through um but it was initially to you know solve those two issues to create a two-way door um for staking eath and allowing you to stake smaller amounts of yeast in the bigger picture the primary goal is to um solve the competitive equilibria between participating in d5 like participating in on-chain lending and securing the ethereum network um mostly if you participate in defy today you can get yields that are greater than um the yield you'll get from staking your ethereum so any um self-interested rational actor would take the higher yield available for d from defy than securing the eth network and getting your you know 12 or whatever you get today um lido allows you to compound those yields so you can stake your ethereum you get a an on-chain derivative of staked an erc20 that represents represents your stake to ethereum which you could then use in d5 so if you follow this train of thought you can imagine that some point in the future the new base currency on ethereum would be staked ethereum rather than ethereum because it can do everything that you can do everything that ethereum can do except you get the base yield you get the sort of risk-free yield i did air quotations no one can actually see me can they um you get the the base yield on your on your east and it's already like erc20 wrapped for d5 uh and stuff so um that's the core purpose behind uh lido for anyone that is listening that doesn't know what it is or or why it was created and how is that going so far how do you see an option using like the beacon chain and especially adoption of the the staked eve token yeah so um i think about seven percent of all eth staked is staked with lido um at the moment um and nearly all the other steak teeth is staked with either kraken binance uh sweets or like steak fish so a lot of the big exchanges have um gigantic market share um and it and it sort of makes sense right because the way staking was designed with these huge lock-ups and lack of liquidity a lack of um uh like the ability to on stake was a perfect setup for exchanges to launch a centralized staking derivative like you can um on stake within their own centralized market yeah so of course um they can provide the uh a superior experience to you know solo staking or joining some uh some pool um so i think lido is the only or a staking derivative um on chain staking derivative is the only uh staking option that can match and is probably superior to exchange staking um so i think that adoption has been pretty good because of that there's you know like billions of dollars in lido now i think just like over a billion dollars um staked in uh in lido and there's a gigantic curve pool of eath to staked eath so that if you want it on steak by selling your erc20 steak teeth you can do that with like relatively um little slippage like i think at the moment you lose less than half a percent um but by doing so um but you've also seen a lot of um unchained staking derivatives that have tried to do it not reached uh sufficient liquidity and their users just get wrecked if you stake and you try and unstake you immediately lose 15 um so i think having uh the liquidity around like the two-way door is super important and i'm glad that lido's been able to achieve that um and having like being the generally accepted uh like staking solution early is um pretty helpful after the merge happens the product gets much more interesting because you no longer have price risk when unstaking you can stake you can on stake after the merge transactions are enabled at that point the product starts to like come into its own but it also loses the moat of um like competitors can now uh vamp attack you much easier much more easily um competitors can provide better products and the one billion in liquidity that's in lido is no longer stuck there by the um by the like properties of the merge but in the future i i can definitely see uh a time where you you know instead of you you you have your optimism and your arbitrage or whatever roll-up takes um uh like market share and in that roll-up you use state teeth as your base currency um and you earn a yield on whatever you're doing in ethereum whether you're trading whether you're um providing liquidity somewhere i can i can imagine that being um the future it brings a question and why didn't eth build this native into the uh into the protocol but um so do you have any thoughts on the um merch to e2 yeah i think uh i definitely agree that with staking derivatives on eath it's going to be quite a lot of winner tickle effects because like you mentioned with liquidity everyone wants a stake where everyone else is staking that that's how you ensure the the uh the liquidity process uh if you go into a pool that not that many people are going into you you're taking so much risk for zero gain you have nothing there's no upside and only downside right so that i think um people should consider i think also uh with the merge itself um it's going to be really interesting to see what happens there's some people who've been asking like you know is there going to be a proof of work fork of ethereum is there going to be like a like are miners going to protest all this kind of stuff and i really do think if there is a fork it's not going to do very well at all because who would support it at this point um and who would be incentivized to support it it's very few people right so it's it's very it's very hard to see how the merge will get stopped by forces that be that that will say i don't like the fact that pow is being turned off just because i think the general strength of the ethereum ecosystem now is so strong with the application layer and with the status of the ethereum foundation and and and i think with the certainty they have on the roadmap now and that the community is behind it it's i think there was a time a year and a half ago two years ago where people would have said you know just cancel each two cancel uh proof of stake just do like 1.5 x or one point x and then do uh you know proof of work plus roll ups and that's done right i think that there was a time where that was actually a popular that was a popular view like among very large youth holders that that that would be the right way to do things and yeah i agree i think now that's definitely shifted where there's a there's a resurgence of interest in this ultrasound money thesis and and this idea that it sufficiently differentiates itself from bitcoin by being purely proof of stake uh so i think that you'll hear that narrative a lot at that time where they can start extolling some of the benefits of being purely proof of stake there are of course also downsides uh but there's uh it opens up a whole narrative uh mind space i guess uh so it's gonna be interesting to see how how that develops how would you compare proof of work and proof of stake also in the sort of the eyes of the market especially yeah i think if you asked people two three four five years ago there was a lot more respect for proof of work than there is now um it used to be that you know it's unforgivably scarce it's creating this unforgeable quality from the physical world it's bringing that that that that cost into the system but you know with the launch of a lot of these proof-of-stake networks like polka dot cosmos and so on solana uh it just it just has moved the overton window so far to the direction of saying proof of stake is just one other way one other consensus mechanism and so that that normalization of proof-of-stake i think has been um actually i mean given the issues that eos had with its proof-of-stake with its delegated proof of stake network there there also was a time where it looked like proof of work would you know the the the uh proof of work maximalist uh seemed like they had a good argument um and it could also be that proof of stake hasn't even been around long enough that we've seen some to to test some of the edge cases but where it is now uh uh the the market is comfortable with proof of stake put it that way they're comfortable with high staking rates they're comfortable with the governance around them roughly and so that i think the market in a way views proof of work as as a bit archaic i think that's why you haven't seen like new proof of work launches the main ones that have launched during this bull bear market grin and uh you know the two member wibble coins grid and beam they've absolutely collapsed you saw the fpga based ones like kadena and those are also absolutely like just not going anywhere and and and so there's almost this idea now that if you launch a new proof of work coin you're like wasting it's like an incredible waste uh so that that's been interesting to see so the the market definitely sees it as archaic and so so prove work definitely has an increasing image problem i would say also with the like the rising so impact investing and you know the environmental narrative behind it but there's also just this sort of the mechanistic like the the supply and demand argument behind it because in proof of work you do actually leak my value out of the system constantly every year right because you pay sort of parties that are external to this system that are not your own holders whereas proof of stake sort of completely uh eliminates that right so there's just far less selling pressure um so i would say that even well i i increasingly think even if proof-of-stake like proof-of-stake can be can be less robust but probably still win like unless it's like far less robust but there's like some some uh some margin there where it can be less robust but still win just because it's so much more attractive for holders basically yeah i do think it's a big dynamic shift of um the majority of inflation to miners versus the majority of inflation to large holders um it does make a difference like who's holding the stuff and and who's um therefore gonna be um gonna be selling it um but i don't honestly i don't know enough about like the economics of the miners business i always just see it here on twitter or on like some on-chain analytics telegram group that the miners are dumping that's all i ever hear um but i was i was surprised the data someone said that you know in after one five five nine in the merge ethereum will have lower issuance than bitcoin and i was like wait ethereum has higher issue at some bit code house as possible it's so much smaller i was like wait this is super bearish um that's crazy though yeah yeah but um it's still it's still it's still crazy that um that inflation is so high and that 50 of the um reward per block is uh from fees um i i think it's i think it's over 50 percent of the average reward per block is um not from um direct mining rewards instead from fees which just seems enormous 35 million um a day or something yeah right i mean now like this is something that people didn't really see coming right most people anyway that um nowadays minus earn revenue from from three thousands right the inflation uh then so the the transaction that just i would call them like congestion fees just people wanting to get into the block they just wanna wanna be included it doesn't matter uh at what place in the blockchain i just want to get in and then you have the mev right so that the value from minus um getting transactions in early in a block um making arbitrage in in d5 liquidations and so on just getting getting to stuff early and this has been grown at such an enormous pace and that's sort of this sort of hyper charges the whole proof-of-stake narrative right because proof-of-stake internalizes all the money that currently goes to miners and miners just found this sort of unexpected but huge revenue source that's in itself bigger than the inflation and the fees combined on most days in like the last six months and all of this money would then also go to steakhouse and that's just yeah that's just such a powerful thing you know yeah mev after the merge is going to be pretty interesting because validators who can extract mev are going to be able to compound their stake and earn more yield compared to regular validators so i you can imagine there's going to be an arms race uh in a way because exchanges are gonna need to do this so that they can have a competitive offering on yield um also like the products like lido anything where there's a pool is in a good spot because the odds of proposing a block um has a lot of variance so pools extracting me together um are going to outperform i think and then in eth2 you know the slot proposal in advance about 15 10 15 minutes like 12 minutes in advance i think um so it can like be a literal arms race like to parallelize um like who's coming up with the best ordering max me v extraction unique strategies pools of pools services centered around all this it's going to be like i like i don't think people have thought about that enough maybe people have and i haven't read a good piece on it or i don't follow the right people um but i think there's a uh an mev arms race is on the way um and i don't really know how to position properly for that yeah i think lido has a pretty good position in that you know there's a validator set of extremely high quality avada validators working in a pool together um and that yeah i just don't know how to position for um for that yet otherwise um but i think it's gonna be super interesting over the over this year so the validators that currently work with lido the largest ones do you have any insights in if into if they are already preparing and thinking very hard about how to extract the most mev after the merge yeah i don't know i think it's also going to be interesting because i don't entirely understand how um how the roll-ups stuff uh is gonna uh interact with it as well i i think we're gonna see elimination of a lot of the unsavory um mev pretty soon um but yeah for on the question about the validators um like i know some people in lido have been um thinking about it um some of the people at paradigm have been thinking about it a lot and i think uh lido and flashbacks are chatting to each other um on a per validated basis i'm not sure um i know p2p.org um has some special software in a bunch of their networks and that's why they offer a higher yield um for a bunch of the protocols uh than a lot of the exchanges do so if you i think it's like if you actually if you stake polka dot with ptp.org versus crack and you get like double at p2p dog or something um but uh so i'm sure yeah individual validators are working on it a punch as well okay so we discussed erp-1559 and um the f2 merge as potential catalysts for ethereum in the next like six to 12 months so do you think that the launch of any particular layer 2 solution or even like several of them together does also represent a like a viable catalyst in what sense of catalyst can you can you explain do you think that it would just allow um you know ethereum and d5 to do stuff that are currently not possible right to me it seems like many people are actually priced out of using ethereum right now um and that so that also is what explains sort of the rise of solana the rise of esc do you think that sort of those people will quote unquote come home i think actually there will be a lot of use cases that can come back to ethereum once there's layer 2 scaling i i think with eth2 it's too hard it's too far to say it's too far the future to say what the ui ux impacts will be because they can create new problems easily uh just as quickly as they solve old ones as we as we know about ethereum so but but i do think that it doesn't even matter if you you know if people come back because i think you're expanding i think what bsc showed uh i had that tweet that i was saying like bsc is very the most bullish catalyst for ethereum i've ever seen is that you it's it showed that actually the ethereum ecosystem it got it all right it has you know ether scan is great metamask is great everything is great evm is is great developers can use it they can audit it they can deploy safely relatively safely it kind of solved all those questions and especially given that binance had tried to do it with with tendermint before and it didn't go anywhere at all it really showed the network effects of ethereum in it like in a huge way and it showed that with let's say a 10x increase in throughput you can get 100x increasing in usage and so it just makes it that much more likely that the smart contract vision for the world comes into existence i think because it's it's proving to the market that there is this demand uh to act on chain even if it's less decentralized for now uh so yeah i completely agree with that if you think about it from a product point of view right you are seeing product market fit of evm with users um so i totally agree i see uh the the rise of um of bnb and bsc is hugely bullish for ethereum in the long long long run um also very bearish for tron what were they doing like totally like it was all available for them the flip side of it is one thing i think bsc is incredibly good at um is this sort of like binance are also incredibly good at marketing right they're good at marketing they're good at uh saying outright welcome to the greatest casino of all time um you know the stuff that's popular on bsc now does not even have the pretense of being legitimate a lot of the time some of it is like is simply we designed the tokenomics and i hope that this will go up so we can all get rich together um in some ways honestly kind of little i find that a little bit more honest than a lot of the 2017 um participants but um bsc are also incredibly good at marketing they're incredibly good at saying come here um you know these things are gonna go up and you're gonna make some money um and if ethereum i i genuinely believe that bse could be entirely centralized um sent back and forwards on like a google doc or something and it would um a lot of the coins on there would have performed basically uh basically the same um so as things um as new things are built i think binance can just integrate whatever it centralized in it so they can just go if salad does well let's slap some to lana in there they can do whatever so i think that their strength is access to new market participants via directly marketing to them because if people are um interacting with bsc um and bnb they're using binance they are acquiring a user for a company which is then like a that user has like um you know a lifetime value for them and stuff so i do think that's a bit different from um ethereum and while i see it in the long long long run it's super bullish for ethereum because it's clear prior market fit between evm it also i don't think you can say if ethereum had um the scaling today all those users would have embodied onto ethereum instead because binance are still going to be doing their marketing they're still going to be pulling people over and binance is still hugely incentivized to pull people onto a chain that uses bnb as collateral um so i i think it's interesting i i think it's interesting how uh that part of the ecosystem will um will like how that narrative will be written over the next few years because so many things on bc just going to zero like so many things just like a ponzi or it's a meme or it's like it's going to zero and a ton of those users will get burned um and then they're gonna blame finance for that or are they going to like but like they're just going to exit crypto entirely and then how the regulator is going to approach something like this like um like tons of basically illegal securities being launched on um a relatively centralized chain where has like what 10 to 20 validators or something it's um it's not super censorship resistant should uh finance have a like a fiduciary responsibility to be um interfering or uh or whatever it i like i don't know how any of that's going to play out it's um it's going to be very interesting honestly a lot of this space you just kind of got to sit back and be like i don't know what's going to happen i'm just trying to watch it all so that when they make the movie in 10 years i can be a consultant and i get to meet the new leonardo dicaprio and go don't go on the red carpet and go look at me that's my that's my primary motive um do you see is there anything in d5 that you guys are waiting for in terms of uh you know that really gets you excited that's about to launch or in the next three to six months uh loans are not like incredibly over over collateralized but i don't know anyone that's doing them i don't i don't know if it's about to launch but i think that'll be um interesting because everything's so over collateralized um i think that'll be interesting do you use um like recursive borrowing on component rv and so on maker no i'm too simple tim okay but you can like you you you can do like three to four x leverage right like today if you want you just have to leave it in the protocol yeah yeah other than that um i'm not super sure i think like a bunch of the upgrades are going to be interesting i think uni swap uni v3 is gonna be interesting to see how it plays out with uh with curve and um with sushi and stuff um but the i'm like it's not d5 but i'm excited about arbitrary optimism or whoever comes around and launches because i don't think people are properly quantifying the uh the scaling benefits that roll ups will provide um so i think rollups is like a 100x increase in throughput um and eth2 and shardings are only like a 50 60 i can't remember the exact number um i think it's like 65 or something increasing in throughput but those two things stack multiplicatively so rollups on top of sharding is like 6500x increasing um in throughput and the eth2 roadmap is like move to proof of stake um sharding of data but not of computation and then eventually full sharded transaction processing which is like that's going to happen in 2030 or something like i have no confidence full sharded transaction processing is i think it's years away so full on chain um scaling like sharded applications on uh on eth2 is still still years away however the rollers on top of um sharding of data i think he's going to be pretty soon like next year early i don't know what the words from youtube is but it means you get that 6500x increasing throughput pretty soon um comparatively um so i'm pretty excited for arbitrary optimism or whichever zk one um actually ends up beating them to market because they've taken so long um those are things i'm most looking forward to but uh yeah sue what about you what are you looking forward to and also if any of them are still fundraising can you like slip me a intro of course uh i mean on the d5 side i think you know just d5 perpetual swaps d5 leverage trading i think is a is i mean dydx obviously with uh layer two on starkwear i think that's definitely one to look out for i think there's also a number of other ones that are good uh that people should just try out a lot of them are in liquidity mining phases right now so you're gonna get paid to use them and i think in general those have all worked out very well for early users so it's something for people to look at i think on the roll ups point i 100 agree i think people really don't get how much scaling can come from roll ups uh i think that um i think that even if they didn't do e2 sharding it would there would potentially be ways that you could do like roll like a kind of a network of roll-ups and and that would already be enough scaling for ethereum um and i think the other big point to add too is that like in 2017 and 2018 there were already talks about layer two right with raiden and with plasma and these kind of concepts and a lot of those teams in those team members later on joined a for-profit commercialized you know layer two companies and solutions and i think what was missing then was that the the application demand and the application quality wasn't there yet and and the and the users weren't there yet so people didn't know exactly what they're optimizing for what were the pain points what was going on there was all research right it was all more theoretical whereas now there's you know there there's so many different implementations and there's so many teams competing to be the first to market to to win applications to win mandates and so now you're in the pr you're in the very free market phase you're in the very um competitive phase of ethereum layer too and that's incredibly bullish for actual deployment there's not a chance that not that roll-ups don't get deployed in a big way in the next year right there's zero chance and whereas in 2018 like despite all the hype about you know casper ffg uh plasma all this kind of stuff it's just like you know it's just all an idea it's an idea in someone's head so applications have driven the infrastructure uh now yeah that was that's i agree that's what was missing back then that you had actual application demand and now sort of ethereum is sort of you know breaking at the seams um because there is way too much application demand for like the the little infrastructure that we have and that's that just creates this huge incentive to improve the infrastructure and then deploy it in sort of a rapid manner so i'm really looking forward to that personally i'm a bit more hesitant to call any of this like really scaling um because i'm still not 100 sure like how assume will actually look and feel when we've transitioned to the sort of asynchronous um execution model right where all of a sudden like yeah like stuff that you do on one roll-up that's that sort of atomic you know um like you're used to today but once you know there's something that you know touches the base layer and the roll-up that's no longer atomic once there's like stuff between two roll-ups it's no longer atomic so how do you think about sort of the move to the asynchronous execution model i think the problem is that it is now inevitable because since uh roll-ups only you like use the chain only for data and not computation and they'll be able to use the uh the sharding of data um like pretty soon and you get that 6500x throughput um quite soon because of the combination of those two things by the time base layer scaling happens on ethereum it's gonna like no one's gonna catch it's gonna be two or three years away and it's gonna be a performance decrease versus like the um the the two things um like that stack that we'll have this year or next year so i i just think it becomes inevitable and i've read that um even eth core now is saying okay what does ethereum look like if you build like a rollup centric um roadmap for how you build ethereum um so to me it just seems like it's an inevitability um now but beyond that i don't have any strong opinions i have a question for you actually a bit off topic but do you think that if ethereum were to flip in bitcoin that bitcoin usd would still be able to sustain levels and people would still buy bitcoin as a store of value or do you think that that would be challenged substantially i think the flipping is now inevitable um but i think it would be incredibly temporary so i think that the like i think you'll have a massive blow off top i think the east blow off top will be like either slightly before or aft slightly after the the bitcoin blow off top and at the east bluff top it all like temporarily flipping um i i've never felt more confident in the trade of my life not financial advice to your to your listeners but um and the reason the reason is that the total addressable market of things for ethereum is just gigantic so even if bitcoin gets the store value its digital gold narrative gold the market cap of gold a total addressable market of gold is still lower than the total addressable market of everything like of all money and when the internet launched people got the internet wrong thinking it's like a you know an additional channel like you've got now you've got tv radio and internet rather than realizing like no the internet is just a new medium for all channels you have tv you have tv on the internet you have a radio on the internet you like it creates uh new mediums the like macro vision for ethereum is that for all of money whereas the macro vision for bitcoin is like now digital gold star value um when you talk about crypto equities or um or stable coins or uh whatever people never go oh is that on bitcoin like you automatically assume this thing's built on ethereum like uh great britain's doing a a stable coin trial and uh path messaged me and was like do you think this is going to be on ethereum um and that's your default that's what you default assume um like it's not going to be on finance smart chain is it but um like that is your default assumption it's like well this is probably going to build on ethereum because right now 90 odd percent of um things that have usage in the crypto ecosystem are built on ethereum maybe it's like less than 90 now because uh binance is like super popular at the moment but even even buying smart chain in a way is built on ethereum because it's just the same source code um so i think the the flipping is um is inevitable i think in bull markets ethereum hugely overperforms in bear markets ethereum like goes to zero while uh bitcoin does pretty well um it like performs better on the downside um so i i do think we'll see a a very very very temporary uh flipping i think bitcoin will be able to sustain um usd values because i think the narratives for the two things are very different i do think you'll see a bunch of institutional adoption of ethereum soon i read a report um the other day uh by a guy called alexander who runs a fund that works with um like helping institutions get access to crypto and it was just all about ethereum saying it's like you know um it's like a uh a first-class peer of uh bitcoin in their eyes now um but yeah i i do think there's gonna be a bit of a um a bit of a move from i think it was you that sounds me going to start seeing some cold wallets moving and uh taking allocations to to ethereum and there's a lot of people that are underexposed to ethereum but also i think a lot of the people that have bought bitcoin have not bought it to um sell the sell the next one that comes along you know they took 10 years to buy bitcoin it's not they're not gonna uh go oh wait we bought the wrong one let's like quickly buy this other one and dump all our bitcoin i think a lot of the people that are holding bitcoin now are in the like will never sell um never sell camp and worst case scenario they'll uh go we should also allocate to um to ethereum and take another one out of their treasury or something um but that's in like a that's on a really short time frame so it's like you know flipping happens bitcoin doesn't go immediately to zero um it you know probably sustains well and everyone like it d flips and everyone goes ha ha that was uh what like you know bitcoins back or whatever um on a longer time frame um i do think the bear case for bitcoin is ethereum um i i struggle i struggle to see um i struggle to see without like performing similarly or without the um like the bear market safety what the narrative um sustains us because i think the majority of crypto markets is like no one trades on reality everyone just trades on what everyone thinks reality is like the the post-truth era has um has gone too far in the crypto markets it's like everyone just trades on on on narrative now uh it has become super super super important so i i do think on like a if if you have a flipping that sustains or ethereum largely gains on bitcoin um i think it that becomes troubling uh temporary flipping i'm i like no problem for bitcoin usd but if the you know the average price of eth to bitcoin over the last sort of five years has been what like it's about what it is now right probably if you average the price out over if that if that changes significantly and if it goes to you know 0.1 instead of 0.04 and sustains over a longer period of time i think stuff like that starts to uh starts to damage the narrative of um bitcoin a lot more than a temporary flipping does because a lot of people i think have like like they got scared out of buying bitcoin uh these institutions family offices and stuff they got told not to allocate to bitcoin by jp morgan and goldman sachs either because they were dishonest or naive and now come 2020 2021 they're considering taking positions because they're seeing elon doing it and now all of the people that told them not to do it saying oh actually yeah we've taken position in that now but they see the price of bitcoin as far too high or their bold case scenarios for it go well maybe i can get a triple out of this um and if i'm getting a triple i can go you know i can go participate in like some like risky stocks where i don't need to do a bunch of additional reg compliance stuff to uh for it to be possible for me to get exposure um if i'm going to do like the funny money if i'm going to do the weird internet money i need more than a 3x and then they start looking down coin market cap um or coin gecko or whatever so in some ways um it i think it's kind of funny that they got like flooded out of uh the greatest boring of all time and now they're digging through coin gecko to find the like i've missed my gains i need to pick up some light i don't know what's this cardano thing um but in the in the other sense it makes it bullish for stuff that still has a ton of like market cap upside um so yeah again i think it's going to be um i think it's going to be interesting uh how it plays out um but i do think that flipping is inevitable but i think it will be very short-lived and the reason you think it will be temporary or short-lived in this i guess this time is just because you think either will not be able to sustain that momentum and there there will be too much selling back to btc there will be too much selling to usd or yeah i yeah i think for the flipping to happen um in this cycle unless this cycle is the um soup cycle sponsored by susie if it's like if it if it's not like you know just up for um like the next three or four years and it takes three or four years for eth to flip then i'm like yeah cool maybe you'll have a sustained flip in england but in that case the writing is going to be on the wall for three or four years during this like uptrend that um like signals uh market share like evaporating and moving to eat if you have a 2017 style we're currently at like point zero five or something and then three candles later you're like point one five you're just going to have too much um too much selling pressure too many people that are a a decent profit too many people saying it's not different this time um i'm you know taking profits here and then that um you know selling pressure just turns into a like three candles back in the other direction um but in crypto and maybe in all things i don't know enough about other markets to be honest but in crypto things grow in bubbles so you have these huge parabolic bubble like run-ups and what's important is where the price settles um after that parabolic rise like if you have a parabolic rise and then you have the new floor settling like you know 100 50 above the previous floor i think that is way more important than like did the peak flipping the market cap for seven minutes or did it like it was actually for two days or whatever i just think that that stuff's like vanity and it's stuff for like people to argue about on uh on on twitter it makes a good talking point but it's not that interesting because it's like a data points that existed for a like a matter of hours if your the floor establishes significantly higher that gets super interesting it means like the demand for eth versus bitcoin now versus several years ago has substantially changed um and if you can sustain that for like a year or multiple years i think that's way more interesting um personally um because like you know dogecoin dark verge coin or whatever that went like infinite didn't it it don't matter they went to infinity once sure so so sue um i assume you're um you know a bit more bearish on bitcoin after potential flipping um i'm undecided actually i mean i think that there's kind of two ways to look at it from my point of view i think one is that even if it flippens that bitcoin has its unique value proposition and it has a different set of potentially a different set of buyers who kind of more objectivist in nature so they just view it as okay this is the canaan this is the first chain so i just collect it and i don't think too hard about it orange coin good kind of mentality and i do think there are a lot of those people um i mean you saw how little of supply moved as we went from 20k to three and a half and then back up to 60k like a ton of supply is not moving these guys are just not like there is literally exist no information no they're anti-bayesians right there's no in from new information that would make them sell it uh and and that is actually very powerful uh and bitcoin kind of has that and and so that's i think the the the bold case um and also i think you know then being the biggest proof-of-work chain there will be proof of work advocates who you know countries with cheap energy costs um that that kind of um game theory will be interesting you know if bitcoin were to dip because of these people selling because ether flipping did who's to say that some of these governments won't bid it up and then be like okay now now we all love bitcoin right so that that is kind of the big bold case for it uh not to go down i think on the on the other side of it is that you know the the the biggest advantages that bitcoin has right now are one it's the most liquid uh way to trade crypto and two is that um it's its dominance as a pricing pair its dominance as something that as a treasury asset of crypto right so that does get seriously challenged if it's no longer the most liquid and the largest because um then people will say well why don't i denominate an ether instead why don't i you know trade ether pairs as people do in uniswap or why don't people trade back to ether and and hold ether as a store of value if it's if it's more liquid anyways and so losing that liquidity advantage is very dangerous for bitcoin in that sense because um i started to play with this kind of idea that ether is almost more anti-fragile than bitcoin because ether can exist and and kind of come along happily for years at 10 to 30 percent market cap of of bitcoin it doesn't matter right it it as long as it serves some purpose for itself and for its people whereas the question is can can bitcoin come along at like x percent of ether you know like like 50 of ether 20 of ether uh that gets harder because it's value proposition one of its biggest is to be the biggest coin uh once it is not the biggest coin uh you really do need that kind of uh very strong holders uh to to to say and that that may or may not happen at the prices that people think um so i'm of the view that i mean some of these do that if flipping were to happen it would actually i think the last one was a very temporary one in the backdrop of a of big scaling debate bitcoin cash going to 0.4 0.5 xrp btc going to absurd levels and i think that kind of in like the history doesn't repeat but it rhymes way i almost feel like if it were to happen this cycle uh obviously the third there's no cycle because it's a super cycle but like just speaking in those terms uh if it were to flip in um then it will kind of be much stronger this time than last time just because like it just because of the way the history is just my intuition about history uh kind of makes me think that um and be and because sort of the hype will have been validated like in a way like like the like the product and the and the narrative would have caught up with the hype um so i think that that kind of it's kind of that re that that reflexivity is harder to break on on that upside um then last time where it's much more chaotic i think yeah i'd say that those are great points i strongly agree um i would add like on top of being like just the biggest coin like that being one of the reasons why people hold it like i would say people a lot of people also hold it because they think it's like the lowest inflation asset that you can have right it has zero inflation after all but i feel like it's almost like a new paradigm where people didn't consider before that if a coin like that is that the race to the bottom doesn't stop at zero actually like you can go below zero percent inflation and why should a coin that has like one percent deflation not be preferred by the entire market over a coin that has like zero percent deflation zero percent inflation um and i i personally think that you know a lot of people in bitcoin are like genuinely scared um about this proposition yeah it's interesting i i i often think with um a lot of the people in in bitcoin i think they organize into a bunch of different categories and some are just philosophically and um philosophically believe that you cannot have um the active uh like centralized planners that ethereum has of you know the the few teams that closely collaborate together um into like a a monetary system that's gonna provide the world that they want to live in um i think then you have a bunch of people that got like in that 2017 time got completely wrecked by buying like rubbish and now they only really follow bitcoin i think everything else is um is uh is a scam uh and they don't really keep up with the information enough to know what's changing because like uh people talk about the flipping is market cup right like is ethereum going to be bigger um than bitcoin on um on market cap but there's a bunch of other interesting metrics uh as well that probably don't like have high correlation with price now but show adoption in other ways and the two where ethereum performs the worst is google search interest which is like 15 of bitcoin and market cap which is about 30 of bitcoin today and then everything else ethereum does like really really really well and the most interesting one is if you think about the amount of usd settled every day on the east chain it is like multiples multiples larger than on um bitcoin partially because you have so much stuff built on top of these so you have like all the stable coins built on top of the eth uh the majority of stable connectivity happens underneath i know there is some on bitcoin but um the majority of it happens on if you have all the tokens and all the tokens have gigantic market caps and everyone's sending them around and stuff but and the arbitrage between them that's probably about like 30 40 well yeah it's just just gigantic and if you look at um there's a site that has like a flipping metrics uh flipping index that maps all of these together and how they um how they trend together that has been steadily moving up for uh for a long time like a couple of years and um at some point uh it it seems to me that like market cap has to follow this um these user adoption metrics if they keep trending in that way and it's probably not highly correlated so it's probably not fast um but it would it would make sense to me i hadn't really thought about what sue said like the the narrative for bitcoin as being you know like the big star value it doesn't do much else um if that's taken away by heath that is quite bad for bitcoin um i hadn't really thought about that uh too much like if you go to coin gecko and bitcoin's number two it feels like super super super bearish um for bitcoins i hadn't thought about that um too much i also agree with sue that like 2017 is regarded as like yeah we don't talk about that that was just crazy like chaos like that didn't really happen everything was irrational then whereas now it seems a lot more like um uh like it's less it's frothy again now but it's been less frothy as we've uh risen up and institutions are allocating and the uh like the trading volume isn't entirely like 95 retail like it was um like it was back then i also believe that if the bnb frenzy was happening on east now the flipping would have already happened you know there wasn't always a like a link between stuff like trading volume and like the settlement sort of that happens on eve or the arbitrage um until basically erp 1559 and the merge which then internalizes all that revenue that is generated as a result so it you know puts it into the eve token and um i think that is in my view that is basically the catalyst that is needed to to finally translate all the numbers where ethereum is already performing better than bitcoin into you know actual price appreciation that's my guess yeah definitely tells me that makes sense i have one last block of um of questions and um because i i feel like we should let more leverage the fact that you have uh like you're such a large trader and you have survived um through so many market cycles and um lean a bit on your experience so how would you describe um what's your approach to to trading and like how do you survive for so long yeah so like financially survived but man my health my self-respect uh um my friendships um for me um i think it's a few things like my whole approach has been to survive like i all my thesis was always if this thing is really going to be a big deal you know if the the last eight years is gonna happen the way it happened sorry one sec then then the best thing to do is to take it slow because the implied price to the future implied price is so gigantic it's like a the chasm of difference that just being exposed to this market will be enough and outperforming the market by 2x or 3x will be a phenomenal uh increase in in net worth um i didn't realize it would go like it did with such massive boom and bust cycles like i was really shocked that the 2017 cycle went so high and then went so low again afterwards um i thought as the market got bigger things would mature and it would become less volatile and i still believe that however sue's now telling me we're gonna have a super cycle where it's gonna go to a billion in a single daily candle so um maybe maybe i'm naive still but rather than taking a you know go from net worth of 100 quid 100 for any americans listening to 10 million in a year it was always instead try and play it safe accumulate as much bitcoin as possible and like play the plays a long game um and positioning that way i think was really helpful um i'm naturally quite bearish so uh like i struggle to believe in in anything i can always find like the flaws and why things won't work i can always like that's naturally how my mind works like this sounds dumb this sounds stupid this is never going to work for these reasons that's my natural disposition which i think is quite helpful in crypto markets um in some ways as long as you're able to confront that and you know out trade yourself and and recognize that that's your natural disposition and say how do i modify this instinct within me in order to be profitable um a way better natural intuition in kryptos like this is going to infinity i'm going all in because uh the people who've done that over the years have done very well but because i felt i'm naturally bearish i'm naturally skeptical it means i've trapped uh all kinds a lot like musical chairs like i know intellectually that they're going to go up because of market participants believing these things about them and the frost and people wanting exposure and everyone's kind of playing chicken with their money so i understand that but i also inherently believe that it has no value and therefore um i need to ride this and exit safely and a lot of the time i'm newton on that meme where it says like newton x is happy often that's me but i just don't re-enter because i'm like you know what if i get a 3x or a 4x or a 5x and it goes like 100x i'm happy with my 5x because i'm playing like a 10 to 20 year um 20-year game like you have some money you still keep investing like you still still keep doing stuff and that's the the game i'm playing i'm not trying to you know participate in the casino of putting it all on um a single horse and yeah maybe making 100 million in a single trade and then like uh exiting while i'm sure that feels great i don't think the people that do that even then walk away they just keep gambling and my approach has always been like take it steady try and um outperform the market respectably a little bit but don't try and like 10 20 x out perform the market every single year a lot of the time it's not possible and you're just like chop yourself up um in the ball run years it's incredibly easy to outperform bitcoin by a factor of 10. um like even just holding like some of the altcoins alone you would have been able to do that um but in the bear market like it you just have to accept the reality of the world that like right now it's much harder to make money you're not going to get the revenue that you earned in the bull market the year after the year after the bull market or the one after that and the the mission is to survive um through this whole thing and i think the people that have done that have done uh really really well and i think it's also why you see so many of the the biggest most influential funds or um investors in crypto got started in 2018 2017 2018 because surviving those um like the down periods it like they were pretty brutal in 2019 2019 i just said you know what i'm not gonna do anything like i'm not gonna trade at all i'm just gonna like i'll keep watching the market i'm gonna like go do some traveling and have a rest because when things like in 2017 i had very little sleep and when things go like that again i want to not be burnt out i don't want to have wasted um a year margin trading myself to death to like outperform by like 30 in a bear market like it's really not worth it um so i always optimized for like keeping myself occupied and having other things to do um you know after the 2017 run i like built a startup and built something that adds value to the world and like um try to keep myself like really really busy and the ball run comes around and i you know quit and focus on the ball run and try and outperform by a decent chunk but i genuinely believe it's all about playing it safe like keeping your leverage down um keeping like your um like keep your exits like uh like safe and sustainable and um just play it safe like everything goes up a million percent like if you like you just all you need is exposure to the market that's that's literally all you need and you'll do fine um the people that don't make it are the people that try and outpace and they have like a sense of greed around it and they go  i wasn't positioned properly for this bull run and if i had positioned properly i'd have this amount of bitcoin or this amount of ethereum so to get back to that amount of bitcoin or ethereum i'm gonna have to up my leverage to 5x and trade perfectly for the next four months and they put a bunch of pressure on themselves which makes it impossible for them to trade anyway um all those people get rude i haven't seen a single person um uh make it in a scenario like that every single person i've seen make it has been i'm doing all right i'll keep doing all right i'm gonna keep it chill um and i've just done that over the course of like eight years three years or five years or how long we've been in the game what do you say to people who you know only joined like half a year ago or something and now feel like they've missed the train yeah so like every single bubble i always thought of that that might be the last one that might be the last time we get to do this like in 2013 it went up so fast and you know i got into crypto in 2012 early 2013 so it went up so fast that i like felt oh wow maybe i've missed out and then you know bear market zoom out think about long-term thesis and stuff um so i think everyone always feels like they've missed out but the level of crypto adoption now versus the level of crypto adoption if um you know this becomes a like global consensus currency or like a a base money in the world it's dramatically different right like at the moment you've got ellen going on the ellen show to make fun of nfts and saturday night live like making fun of um like ethereum and stuff in little skits because it's new and it's weird and they don't really get it and you have relatively little adoption like institutions are buying crypto for the first time um over the last couple of years um it's only just really on their radar and the big banks are only just going yeah maybe this thing is legitimate by the way sorry that we like flooded you out of it for you could have been very rich if you'd ignored us um all that stuff is just starting to happen um and the realization of um the like the most bullish cases for um crypto the the upside is still really far away um you know um like bitcoin wouldn't just be flipping gold wouldn't just be um you know taking the market cap away from gold it would be realizing what gold would have been had bitcoin never existed which is you know multiples larger than gold is um ethereum's most bullish um possible cases like you know ethereum is no longer speculative it's just the uh utensil or utility that you need to interact on this um consensus computer that everyone in the world uses for in order to not trust each other which is a maybe a little bit um a little bit dark but whatever um and like the upside for even the majors is like still um super super super high on a medium to long term uh timeline in addition i like to um i like to continually think that things can get better and like what we have today is not the best thing that we can ever have and therefore it's i believe that like new things will be built like you know um if you were in crypto in in 2012 or 2013 it is still possible that you missed out on ave you missed out on synthetics you missed out on uni swap you missed out on curve you missed out on you know everything that was like chain link everything that was built over the last few years because you were early to crypto but you need to continually pay attention to uh like innovation and um the way the space is moving in order to um take advantage of those things and the amount of information asymmetry and the amount of new information daily um that's generated by an open source uh community that has direct financial incentives is gigantic and that gigantic amount of information makes um a bunch of opportunity for people who are willing to dig in and are willing to you know um like like become independent thinkers about um what is going to be important over the next sort of five years or so so if you're joining today uh like i i have two main messages i think one is you're not gonna go from a thousand dollars to five million dollars in this cycle some people might some people will there'll be a couple of people that do you know we just saw someone on safe moon do like 200 into 42 million i don't think he sold but some people will do that but it won't be the average now if you're willing to stay engaged over the next sort of five years or so those sort of returns i think become a lot more reasonable um if you play your cards right so you're not going to become an instant overnight millionaire in this cycle please stop trying reduce your leverage um like generally don't margin trade at all if you just join crypto the second message is i think it's going to be slightly harder than it was back then in some ways because back then there wasn't an overload of information like there was like bitcoin and there was a bunch of stuff that was crap um that pretended to be good um and then 2017 came around things got a bit more confusing um ethereum um came around and uh you know things started to get like alternative projects started to get a bit more credible whereas now there is so much stuff happening and the complexity of the products has increased a lot um so i think it's harder to have exposure to the good stuff earlier because you need to do a lot of work to figure out what the good stuff is um but because that work is needed there's a bunch of opportunity as well so you're not going to become overnight rich you need to stick in a space for a bit longer try not to lose interest and um yeah it won't be as easy as just riding like bitcoin upwards but um there will be things that reprice much much quicker than bitcoin repriced uh that if you're willing to do the work you can get exposure to sorry i i said the same answer like four times though i said there was so very valuable advice so too before we wrap things up i'll be curious so based on the beliefs that we discussed today and sort of the strategies um how are you both positioned for the next um three to six months our audience always loves it when they ask this question so starting with you sue i mean i think khao in a recent podcast recently as well and just mentioned that we're quite overweight ether i mean we are we are definitely very overweight ether i think we're we we should be one of the largest holders in the world of eth right now um i i think that actually and the main debate that we have is just do we want to sell at 0.1 do you want to sell it 0.15.2 never sell and obviously when i say never sell i mean it as a trader so that doesn't actually mean we can be doing a podcast in two years and we'll be talking about why ether is a scam but no um i i we're very overweighty um i think application layer we've done some investments into uh some solana based ones also bsc i'm applications continue to be very bullish on i think it's been a bear market a bit like almost like in between all the froth it's kind of been a bear market in ethify um you know stuff like ave is still 30 off the highs stuff like sushi's 50 off the high so um i do think that with layer two with resurgence of eath these projects uh you know will will get the attention again so um i think i think on the alt layer one side i mean i do think that there's quite interesting stuff happening there as well um yeah i i i generally see the next few months being a little bit bearish bitcoin dominance i just see it as something where um you know you've had the sailor narrative a few times and you've had the you've had the digital banana a few times and there's big sellers at 3x all-time high so you know from from all those things happening you know the ogs have gotten comfortable and deployed out to alds you know the uh you know the new comers are coming in and they have not a bone of maximalism in their body right they come in and they just straight skip the first five coins and just go from there uh so that that that's definitely the flow that is coming i mean some of the retail fiat on ramps that i speak with here you know the flow is 75 percent eth versus 25 bitcoin so you know the resale flow is strongly pro uh non-vtc and and i think institutions seeing this price action they also want to participate in it and and and that kind of will just add fuel to the fire so i think i see fbdc 0.05 as a key psychological level i think when you break it people are going to be like okay um that that that kind of really gets people's attention so that's generally my my my view of my positioning yeah very similar soon i spoke about this on on twitter dm not longer maybe a couple of weeks ago um i i don't even own any bitcoin anymore like first time uh in my life since 20 to 12 2013 um where i where i don't know any and like i rebalance a lot but i've never entirely bounced out in in um around december um of last year i started uh entirely rebalancing out of bitcoin into um into eth um just for the merge and eip1559 stuff so um i um yeah i'm like hugely overweight um eath as well uh and exposure to like the d5 stuff that i just think is sort of like a staple um it has underperformed a little bit recently but i just feel comfortable sort of backholding um that kind of stuff i try and like position my portfolio in a way where it's like not mentally taxing for me where i can just kind of like back hold it and like i can go get drunk or i can go like if i'm away from the internet for um for a week accidentally all of a sudden i know that i'm not like gonna come back and be like wait i'm poor now what um in it's just like whatever i can just hold it and i can feel fine about it the only other thing that i've been doing a lot of is um i've taken a lot of exposure to uh seed rounds of things um either where the vesting is relatively short and i'm like like like it's a bull market things getting frothy short vesting i will take that i'll do the alameda like accept your thing and like sell it fine um so i've been taking that and also anything where i'm like this is genuinely a good project wherever like it might have a four-year investing but in four years i can still see this existing as a thing so i've been doing a lot of that just because i'm um i'm a bit scared of heights on a a bunch of things um at the moment so i've reduced allocation to stuff where i just can't tell myself i um i believe it uh i believe this is like a valuable thing or i can't get a thesis behind it working um i'm more than happy to like miss out on profits and i'm sure that i will because um i think like the market is relatively detached from reality um at the moment like there's been a disappearance of shared objective standards for truth and uh instead um you know like the fact that maps dot me can be in a bull market when it like literally doesn't even make sense like it's an offline maps app with a d5 wallet in it like the majority of the users of maps or me use it because you can't use maps online like that's the primary use case it's like this is better than google maps for when you're offline so they've added a defy wallet like when you're offline in the middle of the forest and you need to quickly access your vaults like this doesn't make any sense to me and that's in a bull market so i'm sure i'll miss out on profits when i can't figure out a thesis that makes sense but um at this stage when you know everything's up 20x 30x or whatever i tend to transition that like the instinctive bear in me tends to transition to like a protect um a protect sort of uh scenario where i only hold stuff that i can later in like a year or two if i lose all my money i can at least explain to you how i lost it and i say yeah well i held these things i believe they were good for these reasons and that's how um that's how my investment didn't work out whereas if i'm holding you know map stop me and i have to explain to someone how i lost all my money and i'm like well this offline maps app didn't do very well in the d5 market and it's like like everyone's gonna laugh at me so um i've moved a little bit into that sort of protect um uh pattern now except with uh with like seed rounds where you like no one else got in a cheaper price and it seems like a fair fair bet in this um in this sort of market basically shame minimization strategy yeah exactly like the like if you're married and you lost all your money what would you tell your partner and you don't want to say you know um i lost it all because i believed that they were going to put this token that got made by an anonymous developer on binance smart chain was going to get integrated and it was going to be the primary way you buy electricity in a tesla i don't want to say that because i don't believe that's true and like my partner's then going to leave me but if i say you know i thought the fees that were earned by this protocol were um you know uh like outsized versus the fees earned by um this other protocol and the market caps meant that this one was a better bet plus i thought that the um like liquidity locksmiths protocol would be more sticky through um like the next so the market i expect over the next 12 months at least i can take away something away from that and learn something from it and do something better next time um i like i think it's really important in a market full of like irrationality and and froth to remain an independent thinker and remain at like least true to um your thesis and like what you like make moves that you can at least back and believe in and learn from if they go wrong and sometimes you can't learn anything right it's like sometimes the learning is okay so hasu just messaged me to say he lost a little bit of the ending recording and none of us can really remember what the lesson i said was gonna be so i'm here recording a post podcast to announce uh that you kind of got rugged you kind of got rocked um we didn't talk for too much longer anyway um and i mostly rambled about the simulation heuristic and its application to crypto markets and how often the outcome we expect is the one we can most easily imagine and that tricks us uh into not betting enough or not paying at all or tricks the unit buyers kids into thinking they'll be billionaires or tricks people into selling early whatever your natural sort of tendency and disposition or expectation um imagination is honestly i don't think it was a very high quality rambling as you've just witnessed in this follow-up ramble um if i'm going to make some closing remarks since i've got the opportunity to record my own uh closing of the of the podcast um i i'd say that everyone i've seen do extremely well both in in this space and in the non-crypto world too have two sort of common traits they're exceptionally curious and they have high conviction in their own analysis or their own talent or their own uh view of the reality of the world these people are often uh resistant to being told how to think about the world how to think about certain ideas and they're meticulous about what's true and what's not true and what's real and what isn't um and that combination of endless curiosity and high conviction in your own uh sort of beliefs or analysis allows people to make bets dig in to follow through with their bet recognize when they're right or wrong and learn from why it's much harder to learn from something if you don't really understand why you made the bet in the first place and it's impossible to hold high conviction in a bet when the analysis is somebody else's work and you're underwater and you're you know feeling stressed so i think conviction and curiosity are both muscles that you can train over time by changing your circumstance and approach to problem solving or new information like if you're in a if you're doing stuff with your time now that does not cultivate your curiosity you should change that and figure out ways that you can um force your curiosity more to like to be more present in your day-to-day life some old trader or gambler or whatever said something like you can't win if you don't bet and you can't bet if you wipe out so before i say goodbye i'll remind you to reduce your leverage play the long game remain curious keep learning make small bets learn from them repeat et cetera thanks to sue and that's you for having having me on i'll be off i'm going to go back to twitter to write some jokes up only see you later
