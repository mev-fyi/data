welcome to uncommon core where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles after our video on the top 20 crypto coins by market cap that was very popular we got a lot of requests to do one on d5 decentralized finance which mainly exists on ethereum and for that episode we have brought the foremost expert on d5 there is at least he was one of the very first and most successful d5 investors who knows a lot of things about it knows every protocol so um welcome arthur hey hey hi hustle and uh so thanks for having me yeah great to be here yeah and just to introduce arthur a bit further he's kind of gone from being one of the earliest adopters of synthetics and ave as well as kyber to being now running the largest defy focused fund in all of asia which is defiance capital which i've had the pleasure of um supporting from the early days and and uh it's been quite impressive to see their growth so without further ado let's um let's get into it uh we've got a list of the top 20 d5 coins uh in front of me we last time we went just uh an ordered list by market cap this time we're taking a little bit of a different approach just because so many projects in d5 try to solve similar problems to each other and we actually group them by by six different categories and we'll talk about them one by one so we have the dex category decentralized exchanges then we have spot landing synthetics landing um bridges and then the other two you'll see when we get there so uh yeah let's let's start so i think uh we start from unisoc uh unit stock is probably uh one of if not the most successful uh decentralized exchange right now both by the trading volume and by the active user so on average is due around 200 to 300 million volume and herald have around 20 000 daily users and it's also the first one to popularize the automated market maker model to provide liquidity for exchanges which is uh you can say that it changed the decentralized exchange landscape because without it this is very expensive and difficult to trade on decentral exchanges so yeah so this is uh what unison is about and the interesting thing is the unisop was launched uh using the grant from the ethereum foundation to the founder head hayden and he was a former mechanical engineer and started this as i think more of a hobby project so i think i think my view is uh it's definitely the most successful uh decks right now uh as you can see from the user volume and user and the volume and i think the it did change the entire landscape and i think bring a lot of wealth effect into the entire device space through their retroactive distributions uh although there was a lot of criticism on the ama model that brings impermanent loss to the liquidity provider which is also considered as a market maker in a traditional context but uh despite this i think that people realize that the fee in some situation can actually offset the uh the impermanent losses although i don't really like this term but this is what people call it uh so that right now you still have around two billion dollar of liquidity log inside a uni shop to provide liquidity for various tradings so i think that the the next move is really for them uh to innovate from this because right now the model is inefficient for for the popular mainstream asset because the slippage is way too high uh given the capital it has that is under locked up so especially let's say you talk to a professional market maker with that amount of capital they can definitely provide a much tighter pricing compared to unison but yeah so i think that the v3 uh they supposedly have a lot of new innovation that can mitigate uh part of this impermanent loss issue and there was has been a lot of engineering and research work uh in the world they have been very secretive about that uh but supposedly to be very good and they have the backing of one of the most uh biggest uh venture crypto venture for in the space paradigm which has allowed the top researcher in the space to help them on that as well so i think that we i mean everyone in the d5 space is definitely looking forward to this and see how innovative uh the units of v3 will be and i think that's really a key event to watch right now that's i think one of the key issue is the governance issue i think that uh the 40 million threshold is too high and i mean everyone agree i think most people agree with that and i think the previous uh governance but also to lower the threshold didn't go through so and the team seems to be taking a pretty hands-off approach to this government they they can't just say that oh we'll let community decide anything that we are not going to drive this and i think probably partly due to the legal reasons since they're based in u.s but i think that this deadlock is slowing down the progress on the community side uh quite a fair bit yeah that's probably the general view yeah it seems i think the governance thing is uh the government's problems are very real right it seemed almost like they didn't want the community to have any say in what they're doing yet probably because they have a very concrete vision for what the unisport v3 is supposed to do um and they don't really want anyone meddling with that and so they they launched the token and the governance in a way that it would be paralyzed at least until v3 is out and then maybe do like more of a handoff to the community kind of interesting also the the governor's proposals were focused on um on giving dharma and some of the arjun and some of the smart wallets that aggregate a lot of small users together and then interacts with uniswap themselves they kind of fought hard to get their own um to try to get their piece of the air airdrop for the users right um and that ended up not happening or not passing rather but um i think one thing interesting with with these kind of um what these kind of equity slash uh slash airdrop slash emission coins is that you get really three different distinct uh token holders right you get some that are focused on uh trying to get more governance power you have others that are trying to maintain their power and then you have yet others that are trying to make sure that they keep getting rewards the lps basically so i think i think unit swap being the first though and sort of being the biggest like these are the toughest questions in my opinion in d5 which is how do you reconcile these three very different forces how do they align on division and then governance doesn't stall right because in theory you could have these retrospectives get pushed forever it could come up again in a few months right it could never end uh in that sense so moving on to sushi sushi swap forked from um a unisop basically and uh had one major change which was to add a governance token um before a uni was out so um as i understand you guys both like sushi swab a lot so um let's hear why uh why you think this this is a distinguished project from unisoft that deserves our attention yeah so i think i'll probably start with this so i think you know social style is definitely a very interesting one for me personally because i was pretty uh against it uh when it was launched because i think it's pretty distasteful uh and the way that the initial founder chef tommy uh was obvious that you i don't think it was launched with a good intention to return the report to community i think that's part of the intention but another part of the intention is really to just to be a co-founder of another successful d5 fog and make a lot of money in the process although he didn't return the money in the end uh but i think that that was always part of the intention that the so-called profit maximilies mantra and i think there was no innovation it's a purely uh like launching a token ahead of uni swap uh so and i also think that the initially the the sticking contract they used to for the liquidity mining was also that they are not using the existing one which is the one that was used by synthetics that was so the one that's most commonly used by other uh like the food coin d5 but they actually use their own sticking contract and that was not audited so i i didn't feel that safe so i as a result i i didn't really uh interact with sushi slot much uh when the at the height at the peak of the liquidity mining of the sushi song um so that was actually how it got started and at that time there's really no much innovation because i mean it's just copying a unique soft feature and add a token on top of it i don't see how a fork without any unique selling point can sustain in the future but i think what changed my mind is like at the durian at the at the bottom of the d5 correction uh i think when some of the like i saw the better coin have uh rebound from the bottom i start looking for under value stuff and i realized that actually to my surprise sushi stock is still doing a very decent volume uh despite the the over of the hype at that point of time there's almost nobody talking about it in social media and like it's just nobody even know what's happening to uh sushi shop at that point but it's still among the top five decentralizations by volume and also by user as well so that despite the the all this drama it still retain a core community of user and uh also a volume as well and they already implemented the value capture which is like a five basis point of all the volume will go to the go to the feed pool they will be distributed to the sushi sticker uh and over the last two months it averaged around 10 to 20 of annualized u and this u is a real yield because actually they do get the cash flow and use that cash flow to purchase more sushi from open market to distribute to the social stickers so it's not like an inflation revenue i mean they do have inflation but that is to pay the liquidity mining reward but uh actually over the last two months uh the liquidity mining reward have decreased significantly and two of the rewards are actually locked up so um and despite this uh there's still a pretty sticky bunch of liquidity and even at the bottom he has around 200 million dollar worth of liquidity and right now i think he has around 1.2 billion worth of liquidity and with the same reduced admission schedule so i think that that is what surprised me and made me to do more research so when i uh after i started the research process i started to learn more about sushi soft uh it turned out that uh the core uh they did manage to attract a core group or contributor to keep contributing and there are some are like they are not even in the official team like the boring crypto that's his uh nickname and he was on like a contractual role he took a certain amount of sushi in for as a remuneration and do launch a margin trading feature for sushi so and so there was a community that was start to form around sushi and start to build on top of it which is too much surprise because i didn't expect that to happen at all uh i'm not sure why i think probably they have the first mobile advantage to be the first to fall off uni shop and get the car like a attention uh in the space to congregate towards them uh but yeah i i talked to the team and also did my research that there is a pretty vibrant uh improvement happening uh it's a bit uh chaotic as well it's a bit like a grassroot kind of democracy like a fast-moving a big chaotic but it is working and there are people working on improving the product so that's what changed my mind and uh i think that uh the difference between sushi and unisa right now is really that uh unison is a bit more like a very elite cow uh like a project right now there's like a top pedigree like a backed by the top venture finding the space and uni saw v3 supposedly have a very good uh like it's like a breakthrough in the technical feature uh they will solve a lot of the current issue uh sushi shot is more like a grassroot cuff version that respond to the community demand and iterate fast and build on the the future that community really want such as the margin trading and various other features uh so i think there's a difference right now um and it starts to become more differentiated so that changed my view i think that social stop is here to stay uh and my uh yeah my cos might consistently be the top three or top five decks in the space going forward if they can keep up the innovation yeah now what i like about them is and they are also working on a pretty big upgrade called benfo box i think it's like it's almost like a global wrapper for for like all the assets that that exist in sushi swap and the goal is to increase the capital efficiency of uh basically all the money that the lp is put in there so tokens can be can be lent out or made available for landing uh as well as uh sit in a dex pool at the same time so that this kind of goes back to how how the y pooling curve for example did it yeah definitely i guess what's interesting about sushi too is kind of uh kind of you know ftx alameda they were one of the biggest lps in the beginning and um kind of took a more active role there as well and then kind of proposed um various integrations with solana and serum and then and then you kind of see now sushi exploring moonbeam and polka dot so i i do think too that because sushi is very um grassroots driven and sort of it's just based on what the users ultimately think is the best direction for them uh i think i think sushi's gonna be quite a trendsetter in terms of going cross-chain where there's value to do so and and going toward uh just as chain agnostic and as you know principal agnostic as possible and and sort of more just trying to maximize value for holders [Music] the the the third axis zero x and um i actually don't know much about it probably the extra the one of the indexes that i know the least about so i'm very curious to hear what would you say maybe in relation to the ones before we discussed unit swap sushi swap so what is uh what's zero x doing ah okay so i think probably i'll i'll explain it so uh xerox is actually the i think one of the first uh uh one of the defendant one of the earliest uh decentralized exchange protocol uh they are they in itself they're actually not attacks they actually protocol for decentralized exchange to build on top of so i think what they have discovered is that uh at that point of time that you need the common protocol for different decks to build on top so that you can share liquidity so their model is a little bit like a rfq model and adopted by the professional market maker our fq being requested requests for code yeah so yeah so you can you can you can press a button you get a quote from the market maker so they the order book is not on chain it's actually like a off-chain model maintained by all the 0x relayers to communicate each other and to to match the price among each other so yeah so i think and obviously there's some economic uh uh incentive to ensure that they do match order and do not front run their of their users so there's certain economic element indeed but basically it's like an off-chain order book uh but on-chain matching model but it's not exactly an audible it's like a rfq that the relayer will talk to each other to share the liquidity um is definitely one of the more long-lasting uh decentralization protocol because as it was launched in 2017 and the ico and i think they launched a product uh in late 2017 and been used since then obviously the adoption has been pretty slow uh but it has always been there since the beginning uh but i think some of the issue was during the earlier stage a lot of the more promising relay like paradex was actually acquired by coinbase but i don't think there's any development happening on paradex right now it's kind of like being sunset uh then there was a radar relay uh but again i think that is also being sunset i'm not sure what's happening the team doesn't seem to be building on it anymore the the domain is still there you can still use it but nobody's really using it anymore so the problem is i think the incentive is just not sufficient and the volume is also not sufficient for the re-layer to really make a living from building a 0x3 layer so uh that is kind of the challenge that lead to like none of the xerox really really successful that's why before unisot really uh changed the dex landscape uh the volume was always only 0x idex uh and uh kyber so before unison becomes successful this is the three only decks that really doing some volume but still very minimalist less than one million dollar volume a day so it's nobody really cares at that point of time uh recently they can't have some mini resurgence uh because i think they changed the token economics a little bit i think it was uh early this year or late last year um so that you actually the fee does go to the xerox relay so instead of a pure 2017 era of the utility token you pay to access services uh it becomes a little bit of small value capture inside the token but it's still pretty insignificant i would say um then uh and there was one uh wallet uh the m token wallet which is the most largest ethereum and actually crypto wallet in china uh they actually built their own version of xerox relay called tokendone that actually builds built on xerx protocol and that has been quite successful for the last six months and that actually drive i would say more than 90 of the zero x-ray layer volume right now oh what happened yeah so uh yeah it's just a mobile-based uh dex uh and it's a xerox relayer that built on xerox protocol the chinese especially asia user will be more familiar with it because this is really the biggest uh ethereum wallet in china yeah and obviously and they launched their own aggregator matcha which is quite similar it's a tax aggregator which aggregate liquidity from every place but they also have their own proprietary liquidity source by the periscope which is their own uh market making arm of 0x which i think is driving decent part of the 0x protocol volume as well so i think that aggregated play which is macha has been fairly successful so it's been making them the top three top five decks by volume right now yeah but i think that uh i think that this um i'm not sure what's the next step right now uh yeah i think that that's the key question i i think the token has been there it was this coin based like since 2017. uh definitely one of the more old school d5 project before the term default was even created but right now it's definitely losing a little bit of shine about the latest crop of d5 and i think that we just need to know what's the next step before that people are being more interested yeah xerx is the only exchange in this list that's not an amm i think right so it uses kind of other book based model uh correct yeah kyber is like a hybrid area yeah but yeah oh yeah okay yeah i was going to ask you so what do you think about this debate going going forward which of those is is going to win the amm or kind of the rfq slash auto book based model i think this is a very interesting debate i don't think we are going to see a conclusion so soon uh i think that everyone a lot of people people even in the d5 space including me myself was pretty skeptical of a pure xyk constant product uh ama model initially because we think that beyond the long tail asset uh it's just too capital inefficient to work but uh i think that i think probably you guys discussed in this previous podcast before like you actually do not have to be the best solution you just have to be good enough solution for a lot of the retail users that actually do not have a better solution for them so i think that uh and this so i think ama is definitely gonna be there for a foreseeable future but again i don't think all the book models will go away uh i think for sport decks uh definitely i think amm have a stronger age right now due to the underlying base layer issue but uh i think if the base layer performance can improve further probably we can see audible bass decks to be able to compete with uh ammn bass decks in future but i think that another innovation of amm decks is it brings about like a it combines some of the asset management element with uh a dex uh liquidity provision because that if you have like a if you think this two pair of assets gonna range about in value it actually makes sense for you to provide liquidity using the constant product model and that is indeed an innovation so that people might not be just providing liquidity for the sake of priority liquidity but it's also they they are attracted to the asset management element as well so um yeah i think they both will coexist but it's too early to write off order book decentral exchange right now yeah there was kind of an aha moment for me when i realized that in a member dex is more dex as a kind of side product uh and actually you can think of it mainly as as basically an investment strategy for investors who want to kind of sell volatility and to uh yeah basically want to be rebalanced by the market to have a fixed weight of assets in their portfolio right which is how etfs for example work another protocol that leads into the kind of fixed weight investing framework would be balancer because it allows more than two assets to be in each pool and that's one of the main innovations in balance so you can have more more assets in a pool in a fixed rate with each other and um people can have way more customization uh available when setting up the pool so they can actually change the fee that is charged uh it's not a standard fee like on uniswap and um they can also change the curve itself i believe so um what do you guys think about um balancer i think it's actually for me uh even until now is definitely one of the bigger mystery indeed fire on why uh despite the similar feature uh balancer lag behind uni swap or and even sushi swap so hard in terms of the user number and also volume like uh if you look at the latest number uh i think that the balancer tbr is not that bad it's around um 600 million volume which is around half of us this is sushi salt volume but uh there was a tv out but when you look at the volume uh sushi so is doing 150 million volume today for the last 24 hour and balancer is only doing 25 more million volume so uh the volume to tvr ratio of balancer is very low compared to both sushi shop and unison and in a way both sushi unison is actually only a subset of a balancer when they come to the ama model because balancer you can do 50 50 weight you can do 80 20 uh 90 10 and even like a 30 33 um so from a pure logic uh like like a quantitative point of view there's no reason that you should not use balancer over uh unison or social but the fact is it is way less used by d5 users i think that a commonly cited reason is the user interface and the user experience is just not as good as both uni and sushi and i think it's like the the gas cost is higher although i think for power users that's probably not the main reason but i think there's also a lot of the tbr there is actually quite of stale like the people who are there is just actually kind of to farm the the balancer pool token and also to farm the other uh native token reward profile other that set up that liquidity pool imbalancer just to have some sort liquidity but usually their weightage are not 50 50. uh sometimes at 80 20 which is quite sub optimal for certain way for for for one direction of trade so that's probably the reason that drive the big disparity between the volume to tvl ratio for balancer and i think the ui ux and the gas cost should definitely place a part and um beyond that i actually think that uh it's a decent product uh i think that yeah it is the further next step on unison in terms of combining asset management investment product with a liquidity provision and it's even more customizable and it's also the liquidity bootstrapping pool which is uh used by a number of d5 protocols to bootstrap the initial liquidity was also a good innovation so i like i like balance as a product uh the innovation and some of the features but uh the fact is it's it's not as gain as much traction uh compared to both uni and sushi for a number of reasons and yeah so i think that it's just that they probably just need to in a way improve their ui ux uh low optimize our gas cost and find the next step yeah but i'm not i'm not 100 sure what is the next big improvement coming uh yeah yeah i just would second the idea that the balancer user experience is pretty bad um i think you get a lot of failure messages that for normal users don't really understand what's going on i think there was like a few bugs in the early days too that were pretty scary for people um which is really quite ironic right because if you remember like wifi farming that those are all balancer pools so you would have thought that given the massive growth of wi-fi since then that balancer would have done better but somehow it didn't really manage to uh deliver something that that people wanted to use every day yeah yeah with those concerns so the ux is i mean balance has probably maybe of all the projects on the entire list the one that has like the biggest question marks in terms of like they are so obviously low-hanging fruits that you could improve and it would just make the project like a couple times better right if you only forked unisop's uh front end and user interface then it would immediately be such a relief like i don't think anyone really uses the balance of front end like all the volume that's actually driven to balance it from aggregators because the existing front end is such a joke actually and um i also think you're totally correct that a lot of the liquidity is is stale um we looked into this a while ago and balance is actually the of all the dexes the one that has that pays the most for uh liquidity in terms of token rewards um but it's i mean it's i always want to say it's like a circle jerk because so like a huge amount of the liquidity actually goes to bell holders right so they i i want to say it's like 50 of the entire rewards goes to kind of bell pools and um even better against like like third or fourth class d5 assets that have absolutely zero trading volume earn huge amounts of rewards just from being like in a 50 50 or 80 20 pool there so i think that it's a project that has like so many question marks about it but at the same time fundamentally looks quite good but i mean maybe maybe they i don't know have to revisit some of their actual business decisions so bancor um i don't don't know much about it other than um it's sort of a one-sided uh amm model so how does that differ from what unit union sushi swap do okay i think bangkok was also one of the oldest uh uh decks in the space and actually they are the first one to come up with the ama model but uh i think the difference is uh so okay i think some background story actually bangkok launched one of the biggest ico in the dtm history i think they raised more than 100 million from the ico and actually got a lot fair amount of flake from the from there and but they did launch a product uh i think fairly early i think late 2017 uh and they've always been working since 2018 so yeah you have to give them credit for that for really building your product during the bear market but the check the main difference is the bank call you have to uh it's also ama but you have to go the liquidity is concentrated on the bnt token itself so instead of like a hook from eve to usd you actually have to go from eve to bank call then from bank called the usc so uh i think that create a lot of user friction a lot of people don't want to hold the bank call token just to provide liquidity um so i hear that you can say that's probably the main reason that bangkok uh unisop did so well compared to bangkok because a lot of the if uh ethereums they just don't want to touch anything except ethereum and or probably some other stable coins so they were happy to provide liquidity for eve to usd but they just don't touch any coin especially the units of early days it's really supported by many ethereum bills before the whole liquidity mining thing so i think so that is a friction but they did uh have a massive improvement recently uh which is like a you can provide a single site degree you don't need to provide both token pay and actually how they solve the impermanent loss issue they're actually going to use a bank called bnt token itself to provide subsidies as an incremental law so if you sus if the liquidity providers suffer impermanent loss uh they will actually i think issue more or just take some of the existing pnt to give it to the liquidity provider to cover the improvement losses to incentivize a liquidity on bnt and it has launched a while back i think it's called bangkok v3 i think he has seen some improvements some traction he's doing around 7 million uh return for the last 24 hours uh see some it's like increasing tbr as well but it's still not at the top five decks by volume right now so i think uh it's a constant it's an ama model similar to unisop and these even have the permanent impermanent loss kind of subsidized by the token holder as well so again i'm not 100 i'm not super familiar i'm also 100 sure why it's not as successful as the both uni and sushi but i think there's probably some user experience reason as well and personally i um i i'm a bit wary of the previous uh the work done by the team on how they handle the whole ico and also how how the whole eos thing i think there are some controversy i'm not 100 sure i didn't follow that much but i think that they are just they are not always not not the counter favorite child of the ethereum community you cannot underestimate the importance of ethereum community i mean they just don't like bangkok so yeah i already tested about bangkok so three arrows i actually invested in kyber pretty early right so um what can you say about kyber the last exchange on our decks list yeah kyber we have a good relationship with we've helped them with a variety of financial services as well i think um definitely a very early project as well a 2017 project i think arthur can probably speak to how he sees it playing out in the overall ecosystem of decks has definitely gotten more competitive these days but i think i think what's interesting too with like k n c staking is that i think they kind of pioneer the idea that you will get a instead of a buy and burn you're you're going to get actual cash flows from the coin and i do think that that's a that that's a superior model i mean it's worse for people who have to pay taxes but i do think it's generally good to assume people are not paying taxes in defy um like i would just assume this like as a rule so given that people don't pay tax in d5 i think that i think that um it's better to that they have their k n c sticked and then they're getting cash flows um while they don't have to touch their balance i think that that whole user experience has now been convincingly shown to lead to better engagement and better understanding of what kind of returns are being offered by the protocol and also how to improve it so i think cairo kind of was at the forefront of that as well yeah so i'm pretty familiar with kyber um so i think the interesting thing is uh i actually followed the development process pretty closely fairly early on uh and also uh so i think the interesting thing is that kaiba was fairly under uh the radar for most part of the 2019 i would say that even though they are actually by volume the top three uh for the most part of 2019 so uh second half of 2019 like kyber and uni swap uh was consistently the top two decks by volume obviously the time change they are right now they're not in the win in the top five uh and i think that their model was always kind of like a quite ahead of its time they kind of think that on-chain liquidity is very important so they everything for kyber is on chain if you're a market maker on kyber every like a new code you're providing is actually a new transaction on chain so actually yes it's quite expensive but uh they have a different way of providing liquidity so that's why it's like a hybrid area so there you can use a unisoft version of a constant product xyk model uh for the usually adopted by the treasury team like synthetics or others like to just have a very passive way of providing liquidity on kyber and then you also have like a professional market maker can use something what they call a fat price reserve model to be to add to customize a lot more on how are they providing the liquidity like the pricing will not be like a constant product it will be a lot more uh like a traditional order book way of decreasing uh liquidity as you go further from the mid price um and it was fairly successful at that point of time and yes they and they recognized that they were one of the earliest uh o ico od5 project to recognize that yes they need to change uh token economics and that's why that uh yeah they have changed it to that you have to participate in the governance to get some of the free reward that is non-inflationary is paid in ethereum and they also still remain some of the burning components as well or if it's a fairly small part of the total token uh value capture right now and i think that uh so and i think they have always maintained that is the capital efficiency is fairly important because uh i think during late 2019 uh they were doing on par volume with unisop at 110 of the capital of the tbr so they think that that model is clearly superior because with way lower amount of capital we can support a higher amount of volume and so i think that is they have always believed in that and i think that's not wrong it's actually correct in certain way but i think what uh what they don't really foresee happen is including me as well is how underserved the retail is in terms of they want to actually want to have some product they can actually also earn you and probably help the project that they like at the same time they don't mind providing some extra liquidity and when you have like a 5 000 retail token holder that each of them provide a few thousand dollar liquidity it adds up to be a pretty significant part of the portion of the total liquidity and help to bootstrap the initially credit improve until the professional market maker to step in so i think this is what they don't really foresee and so they always be more thinking that the professional market maker is the better solution to solve the liquidity issue instead of the gathering liquidity from uh retail to do that so i think that that's why that when the whole d5 summer happened uh balancer launched a uni money campaign and also unisoft did the same thing uh they did not have the room to innovate on that because the token supply is already there they can't really change that much because they already the token sale back in 2017. so they are a little bit restricted in that and as a result their volume did not experience a parabolic growth like what happened to uh unison so units of one had probably grown a hundred times this year uh and kyber had probably grown like ten times it's still a very impressive growth but when you compare them to unison this is an auto magnetic difference right now so but then say it's definitely one of the more most legendar d5 attacks protocol but i think that they are doing a little bit of a soul-searching process on the next step on competing in the deck space because it's definitely very competitive right now that sort of wraps it up for for the dex category and i i have a question for you about this whole category so what do you see happen in in 2021 for example could you imagine that centralized exchanges start routing uh orders to taxes and sort of act as the front end for for the user enacting with a lot of these uh interacting with a lot of these d5 protocols i think that um i think the central exchange will not do that do it directly i think that's not really within their responsibility i think they'll just delegate this task to the professional market maker which is uh prevailing right now they're probably for some of the long tail asset or some of the newer assets that just get listed on central exchange uh i think that the professional market maker will actually source the liquidity from the central exchange so that there are sufficient liquidity on the central exchange i think that's actually what happened to probably wi-fi need it because i don't think wi-fi have an official deal with any of uh professional marketing i think they probably have to get some of the token from decentralized change themselves because that's the only source of liquidity or for finance yeah so so i think that's yeah i think the professional market maker will do the job for the exchanges yeah and i think in terms of uh the view on 2021 uh i think that the market share uh will continue to grow that means i think that the dax volume will grow at a faster rate than central exchange but i think that both both of them the volume will also experience a pretty exponential growth as well i think it's possible we see like a d5 uh dex dough like a consistent like a 500 million to one billion dollar volume a day uh and i think that if the layer two solution adoption is as successful as what the most optimistic person think uh yeah i think that that's possible yeah yeah i think definitely we'll see c5 and d5 volumes grow especially for the uh exchanges like binance.com and the the ones that are um non-us i i see as um almost having already been a sort of like cross chain layer two right in a sense be because you're depositing various different coins to binance and then they're giving you back uh like other coins that you can withdraw and and i think you've seen that volume go through the roof uh along with d5 actually so i think what what kind of um is is likely to happen is um is that these exchanges are going to be able to offer like cd5 that kind of makes sense for them where they're getting a cut of the the staking reward let's say in the case of sushi or something else and conversely uh users that are already quite familiar with the binance experience or some other exchange experience they'll just use that and they don't have to deal with on chain so i think you kind of see that high hybrid approach i do think though that there's going to be continued like pressure for exchanges to list like the popular divi assets very quickly because nowadays you know an asset just comes out it's immediately in uni swap sushi swap and does well and exchanges rush to list it i think that that's only going to continue and and i think like they're gonna eventually try to figure out ways to support as many of the beneficial actions on chain as possible for users because that stems the flow of capital out of centralized exchanges and gets them to stay if they think they can get the same benefits on the exchange [Music] moving on to our second category i labeled this the lending category and we have projects in your ave compound maker synthetics and humor but i would further distinguish between protocols where you can um where people basically deposit spot coins and you can basically lend those out and other people can deposit collateral and borrow your the coins that you put in but there are no new coins being issued and then coins like maker and synthetics where you deposit collateral but then the coin that is issued is actually created um from that collateral so it's tokenized that and that that can be stable against uh an oracle and that's basically how you can create any synthetic asset that you want that's kind of how all those three works so but let's get first into the spot landing category so we have ave and compound yeah so i think that uh the sport landing category is it's quite interesting because it's actually quite obvious that there's two very dominant uh leader leaders in this space right now which is rb and compound uh and i think all the others don't really come close so it's really a two-way race right now uh and i think they are quite interesting because uh compound was definitely the first mover uh and but ave managed to catch up uh fairly uh earlier on and i think that their main difference is really like a traditional kind of a faster moving uh agile newer karma against a more established uh one which they are like probably move a little bit slower uh they are trying to do things in a more careful and cautious manner uh i think and that's uh what the main difference between rv and compound so i think i'll talk a little bit more about away first so i think that the what they've did is like distract a good balance between uh innovating innovation and also the the security of of uh of the protocol because being a landing abroad protocol the security is uh is probably one of the most important thing because if they have some issue the entire asset of the protocol can be drained so it's good that both compound and rv have no issue on this peaceful like people cannot just drain the asset randomly um and i think that uh that when you strike a a good amount of balance between security and innovation and uh that is what we drive a significant part of the growth of avery so ave was only launched rmv one was launched in january this year uh and they hit like a one and a half billion of tvl during the d5 summer which is in less than seven months so i think that even during the fintech history you probably have not seen such a fast growth in tvl before um and that was without their own native liquidity money granted they get a lot of help from uh yearn from their own uh kind of like a stable coin you project that just automatically redirect to uh but nonetheless uh one why a half billion tv in seven months is very impressive i would say for anything in the world and yeah and the protocol is secure enough and the team is really uh right they know what the community wants and been very reactive and responsive in delivering that and uh they are token economics also is the same they were actually an old ico it was called land and they re-rendered to arve and actually know that their old token economics is not the most optimal one and they actually spent a lot of time thinking about how to improve it and i think the outcome was uh fairly successful i mean everyone think that the token was a very well designed and especially that it has some sort of value capture but it's not like a pure ransicking because the rba token holder that is sticking are actually providing kind of like an insurance backdoor backstop to the lender on the protocol so if there's a under collateralized event uh for the lender always takers actually are responsible for like kind of like a slashing some of their stick to to repay the under collateralized portion of the debt so that this make the lender feel safer to interact because you know that it's like a some sort of backstop in the place so in that sense it's a little bit similar to like uh you can think of it in the conceptually equity of the bank like uh the bank equity is then backed up the bad bad depths yeah so i think that is the good token economic design part of rwa and right now they have some small amount liquidity mining but it's like the u is so low it's like probably less than five percent a year so it's not really the main reason that people gonna go and like a participant out there i think there's a lot of organic economic activities and the flash load innovation yeah it's more the they are they're the one that popularized the term and also the the usage of it so yeah i think there's definitely one of the top d5 team and a very young and very very fast-moving agile team that doesn't sacrifice the security of the pro room at the same time which is a pretty uh rare and uh important combination i think that uh i expect them to remain the top landing and boring protocol for the foreseeable future and i think for compound uh it's definitely the first one to popularize the money market based uh approach to landing and boring and uh and this has been proven to be extremely successful and even the earliest the d5 protocol uh one of the earliest dharma actually pivoted from like a pure matching based model uh to a pool based model and instead to build on top of a compound so i think that uh this this approach is definitely the most successful approach and uh they've been very secure i have no major incidents so far and they also uh kind of synthetics is technically the first one to start the liquidity mining campaign but compound is the one that started the whole craze of liquidity mining and i think that is kind of like they get some credit for job stopping the entire d5 summer over the last few months so it's definitely one of the more successful protocol but i think that right now uh the new direction the compound chain uh i think there's still a lot of question uh what is the main takeaway from this i think that um the vision is probably to connect all the different chain including probably some cbdc i think there's some other speculation uh but that vision seems very big i'm not sure how are they gonna pull it off in practice uh as right now it seems like um initially when they launched a governance module uh there was a lot of interest and passion for people to keep improving the compound protocol but right now uh i think the passion can't win a little bit uh the governance did not move as fast as it used to uh i think that the team probably i think the pure decentralized method uh i think is this applied to our way as well like i think that the governor's apathy is real like a pure 1.1 vote uh will will live to a lot of people just end up not participating as well so i think that uh not sure how are they going to keep up innovation if the governors keep having a little bit discount like a stale issue yeah yeah i think compound ave obviously by far the two biggest uh bar lending uh my firm3r is also pretty active in the odc borrow lending so it's been fascinating to kind of compare and contrast the different uh approaches that they take i do think compound was very uh prescient in seeing that the broker matching model would kind of not be the one that takes off and has a network effect uh in in on chain in in the in decentralized finance for the main reason that i think peer to pool activity is is definitely preferred where people can just supply assets and get some yield no matter how small they can put something in and they can borrow against it so i think that kind of two-sided uh asynchronous borrow lending is it's pretty it's pretty interesting and you you know they kind of basically invented yield farming as it is uh where people are getting the comp token as they supply and uh borrow from it and they definitely had a very ambitious token emission program which was intended to get people to participate as much as possible in the governance and give it to the users so to speak um so but but i do think that the the idea of you know yield farming and liquidity provision i think it it it does always raise the question of who will actually be the users um right because because every activity that has a dollar reward will become a dollar auction you know who who has the capital and who has the desire to earn that coin and what if they really want do they want to earn that reward because they want to participate or do they want to earn that reward because that's the highest roi they can find right so i think compound kind of suffered a bit from that kind of mercenary uh farming activity and i think it's something where because they have they have had to rely on that for their tvl it's kind of something that they can't get away from either right because if they stopped rewards then the tvo would also collapse and go to avid so they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because the tv all they have is is generally there for um for farming uh especially double-sided farming but then if that were to the farming were to stop in any way then it would go to ave so you're in this kind of a very tricky spot because because of the way that it's positioned in the market um so i think that's the biggest challenge for combat i i think ave um you know for its part it it also is very reliant on its its own native token but also on a link as well where there's like key assets that are in ave and not in compound um things like that um but i think what what they've been better at is having better terms for things that people want right so like wbdc collateral factors and and you know having wi-fi earlier and and all these type of things i think they're just a lot more reactive a lot more responsive the government is the sounder as well the the token distribution is much better so i think it's not a surprise that is outperformed compound quite a bit um i generally think it will continue to do so for those reasons as well yeah um i agree but i also would say like credit for credit is do i always love to like when when i tell someone new about compound then i always like uh sorry about d5 then i compound is always one of the first projects that i talk about because it brought a lot of fundamental innovation to d5 that makes d5 very different and unique from traditional finance right so for example the uh one of the first things that i would mention is kind of tokenized balances right so when you deposit collateral into compound and rv of course and then you get a c token a compound token and you can use that compound token that represents your your savings in compound in other protocols right so and uh arthur actually touched on that with the cooperation between urine um and ave where uh there were white so-called y tokens that actually put basically your money into ave and a couple other money protocols depending on where you get the best yield at the time and then you could still put those y tokens into curve amm pool um where so that they would actually earn triple yield at the time right um which was uh was i i guess one of the best yield farming opportunities at the time yeah so um the difference between the set synthetics landing category and the spot landing categories in the synthetics learning category the asset you lend is actually created from thin air it's basically it's you can think of it as tokenized debt and that that can be stable against whatever you want whatever as long as there's an oracle that provides price data then you can you can do that and the biggest one of those would be maker and maker issues only one synthetic that's issued from collateral and that uh synthetic is dye it's uh the biggest synthetic stablecoin as of right now with i think about about 1.2 billion die in circulation so what do you guys think about maker and die i think that uh maker is uh first of all uh defense should get a credit for being actually the first d5 protocol and to launch successfully and get some of the adoption and proof that it's possible to launch a decentralized stablecoin and have went through multiple a big market correction event and still be there i think that's definitely not easy existing itself is actually a big issue because actually i remember that i was very bullish on stable coin back in 2017. i was actually looking into what stable home projects that we can actually invest in and that was tethered but that you can't really get a price exposure to tether uh and i found about maker and there was actually a lot of the theoretical debate back then about like how uh like the flaws or maker model is not gonna work you know it's not gonna scale and despite all that like yeah i still had like more than one billion died in the circulation right now uh which is a success definitely a success um and uh the model has been like it's shown to be possible to protract a decentralized stable coin from scratch uh so i think that is definitely uh credit where is due uh i think and i think that's uh and being the first d5 protocol to the major d5 protocol they get a lot of uh support from everyone in the space because everyone initially want to see them succeed so when you see the q1 2019 when the d5 starts getting started uh gamma compound uh know that time they all support the die because they're like kind of the de facto stable coin of the d5 it still is right now but i will say that the usage from other stable coins have increased significantly in d5 right now so um that is a definition is definitely one of the more it's definitely one of the top d5 protocol out there but i think that also there is a lot of issue uh so i think i will be probably a little bit not so politically correct on this which to say that uh if you're like a super knowledgeable and sharp uh have a good understanding into d5 fairly early on because i would say that true smart money already recognized the potential of d5 in around mid 2019. everyone can't see the potential but just not sure how big it will be and there are some that think that okay d maker mkr token is the best way to get exposure to d5 because it's the leader of d5 what can you go wrong it has the biggest adoption by far yeah the economics have some issue but it can be fixed uh yeah so if that is a thesis you put all your money into maker you underperform so much during the whole d5 uh wave this year i think that's just not even an understatement like you even underperformed if ethereum itself which if you are surrounding you have a lot of things to say about this um so i think that that's the card i really like despite being one of the most successful diva protocol the it's not being reflected in the token price of maker itself and that can't lead to a lot of the this illusion among the community and i think that uh like so right now i think the governance is um there's obviously still some uh very passionate community member participating but i don't think there's a new fresh blood joining the maker community to really participate in the governance and drive them to a new direction and uh i think and their approach of trying to unbox centralized assets as part of the collateral base also have also caused some of the difference in opinion amongst other key community member uh because they think that means it's not fully censorship resistant anymore other it does allow dye to scale uh faster and bigger as well so i think that's a key debate i don't think there's a right to wrong or wrong answer to that uh but again i think that's has caused a lot of challenges and i think that the next step uh for dai is pretty challenging in a way that how how is it gonna go beyond the next day are you gonna take the real world uh assets such as like some of the uh mortgage uh into s assets so why how are you gonna do the option liquidation i i think that's quite challenging uh and the value capture also very uh thorough review on how it can align the success of the protocol together with the token value because right now that is currently not working and among all the token model like a buyback amber is the least preferred model in my opinion because i think a placeholder bc wrote a very good article on that like basically if you have an early stage growth stage uh be like company or like a network protocol you should not really be like burning your token because that's kind of like destroying your network capital which i 100 agree with like at early stage you really should invest in growth instead of like uh burning away your uh your token because that's actually redomination of the it can make the token price go a little bit but i don't think it really serves the protocol question in the long run yeah so that's the diet maker so if if you could if you were put in charge now uh in mecca is the kind of benevolent dictator uh what would you do to get the project kind of back on i i almost don't don't want to say back on check because the die growth has actually been so impressive it's at 1.2 billion dollars in comparison the second biggest synthetic stablecoin susd which we'll get to in a minute is at 100 million um so what would you do to yeah i guess reinvigorate kind of the passion for for this project and get some rewards to mkr holders for example i think we'll probably do like an open call to the wider d5 committee to give an input on what is the best way to improve the maker token economic going forward because i think that most people will agree with me that the current model is not the best model for maker i think yeah there's kind of like a consensus among a lot of people right now uh so i didn't get an open call and i think some of the bright community members can probably put up some very thoughtful proposal and they can combine a few proposals and kind of a better one to incentivize more community alignment with the growth of the protocol yeah and also i think that one of the things that maker is not doing which is account you can consider them counter trend it's like most d5 protocol are actually rewarding their users for using them right now i know it's not sustainable but at the early stage uh it makes sense to do that to incentivize user to use your protocol but maker is actually not doing that uh you you're like a user or maker which is like you open a cdp they call you up right now you pay stability fee uh you're actually not being rewarded and depending on who you ask a lot of the user will actually penalize for using mob as an early user because when much dirty happen a lot of people were liquidated for zero that time and they're not getting any compensation and the the response is basically that oh this is the early stage broker or this experiment that you know you are taking the risk of using this is too bad just definitely destroy a fair bit of the community confidence they need to restore that back as well so i think that that's what i would do to really change the token economic and fight i would i wouldn't even mind printing more token i don't think that's a stake of cow i think just like a number so you should able to like inflate your supply if you think it's necessary for the protocol to grow uh to the next stage yeah i agree with a lot of that and i think too like i mean i've been quite publicly bearish on maker for for i think almost two years now and i think actually not only has it out like underperformed d5 i think it actually has underperformed dollars uh which is quite impressive to to even be able to do uh that's true like i for the next three years yeah and and i think it actually it it it gets at the heart of a bigger problem for some projects where if the if the coin distribution is too is too tightly controlled by similar types of thinkers or players let's say usb cs then you end up with a lot of uh you know choices that are not necessarily made for the interests of the community or the interests of the users but for the interest of the investors right and so like that that kind of question of how do you make your users rich from using it well maker just decided they didn't want to do that at all right they kind of saw that as as not part of the mission which kind of defeats the whole purpose of defy in in some ways where the users are not benefiting from the protocol doing well uh you know they don't have any like the maker holders are completely divorced from the cdp owners which creates this impossible traction where their incentives are always at odds and i think too like even talking about buy and burn versus staking right like because the usbcs are the ones holding it and because staking is so difficult for a lot of uscs because of the fact that once you start staking a coin you trigger a lot of tax issues especially for some of these u.s species that have uh that have lps who are charities or who are like uh nonprofits as soon as you get this like staking yield element and this kind of element it sometimes can trigger a lot of complex tax issues right for uh for some of these investors just so you basically you you end up with this like prioritization list that ends up having nothing to do with defy has nothing to do with the protocol but it it has to do with like who are the bag holders uh and what did they need at that moment right and and so like a good example of like you know maker price being like pumped high and then overvalued is like they need it to be propped high at that moment to make it look like they had adoption or they made it look like it did really well right let's say they want that so they can raise a second fund but you know if if that's what you want then that is obviously not going to be good for your users who then follow this and then buy it at the top and then have to watch it be flight in dollars over three years right so you know i think i think these kinds of things these kinds of things are are the very kind of thorny issues uh in our space and and there's all there's honestly no right answer because i mean two makers credit they they have created a very successful stable coin they have created something very excellent uh it it has challenges but it is used uh and it is growing and the code does work it is it's audited uh it it's withstood some tests of time it it's failed some of the other tests but like it kind of it kind of you know gets back to what i mentioned in our previous podcast which is like what makes a project success for a failure right like zcash could be the most successful fair coin because it makes people poor so that it's fair right and like in that sense like like maker also makes you like it makes you poor if you bought it but you know if you just really wanted to borrow uh i said you know a decentralized stablecoin against your ether and you happen to not do it during the bad times like that succeeds and if you just want a whole die like and you put it into some d5 protocols like that works so like what like who just gets to decide if it's a failure is it just price alone right it's i don't think it's just price right so i think it's a massive success on his own merits i think price wise it's a failure by design i think the price is designed to fail in in kind of that sense um but like to the extent that it kind of is achieving its its initial goals i think it's already surpassed some of those goals and and i think too like even with the on with the off chain stuff and with like that kind of stuff if they do end up getting like a regulatory mode for themselves if they are if you know if their backers are closer with government regulators i can imagine like worlds where they have a privileged place in in kind of be able to do that road uh i i'm not privy to those discussions and i'm not privy to how that works but it very well could be a reasonable road for them to go down to if they think that they have the clout to do so right like if you like imagine if they get the ability to do mortgages while nobody else can because they're you know like that's a great like like it's not up to us to say that's good or bad if they can pull it off then power to them yeah and there are two kind of competing visions when it comes to these real world assets right so on the one hand people who are more focused on the state bitcoin they they would say but if you include real word with assets assets those are by definition censorable so if die is then partially backed by these assets then die die is not actually the center of stable coin anymore but on the other hand you could argue that actually maker creates a lot of value for its users um if they can get liquidity on kind of arcane assets that it's very very difficult to borrow against otherwise and all it takes in d5 is kind of price oracle and you need some way to liquidate them if necessary but if they don't really like if it's price stable assets then you don't even have really the problems with liquidations and it's really a huge untapped field for example borrowing against debt right so you have kind of your business and you have you have basically payments incoming in the future payment obligations um from your customers for example then you could you could deposit those in maker and borrow against them or royalties as a musician or whatever right so those things are extremely stable against against the dollar so you don't even have really the problem liquidating them and i think that's where a lot of people in maker want to go um i just hope that they don't forget kind of the the token holders along the way the maker token so we move on to synthetics sure it launched as haven right back in the day and was actually a very direct maker competitor and i remember them having a series of really excellent blog posts that's where i kind of first noticed them where they um where they really wrote great fundamental analysis about maker about uh basis which then never ended up launching um kind of the algorithmic stablecoin and uh yeah and kind of the haven vision yeah and uh i would say those posts they're still online today and they're still absolutely worth worth reading yeah absolutely so i think that uh yeah so that is actually the first d5 protocol i invested in so uh it goes a long way on this but i think uh currently uh synthetics is actually uh if you look at circulating market cap it's the number one uh right now if you exclude chain link and uh rap bitcoin and dine i mean talk about like a yeah non-stable crypto assets that's number one right now and i think that uh again i think it's a kind of show that in d5 uh a lot of the things you can actually consider kind of like an alchemy of finance i mean uh most people know that i'm a big uh supporter of uh synthetics but uh and a lot of the initial skepticism will actually correct in a way that uh how do you really uh bootstrap a stable coin or a synthetic asset from their own native token because that in itself is like a circular reasoning but i think that uh uh what changed my mind is actually like reading one of the blog posts of synthetics actually that is to really as long as the there's value created from these services uh the collateral token should be worth something because that means that people are actually willing to pay to use those services and the fee that go to the token holder uh is what make uh the synthetics token snx token valuable so i think that in that sense you can think of them as like a uh obviously initially it is nothing but it's like just like early stage equity it has the equity is not worth anything they the founder raised it and based on certain future expectation of what they're gonna do to make it such a way that it will be valuable in future so i think that's what uh uh what the difference of uh synthetic value model that confounded a lot of people earlier on so right now uh snx uh in this simple term basically you collateralize snx token and you can create various other synthetic assets and you can trick those synthetic assets around and the fee will go to the synthetic home as an x token holder that are taking it so so that's the gist of it and they are also the earliest the first launch partner they're gonna partner with us optimism uh of the layer two solution that is using optimistic grow up uh yeah so i think that they really need the layer tool to solve their uh the current gas price issue because uh you interacting with synthetics is a very the gas guest price can be very high so they really need that layer two solution but uh i would say it's definitely one of the most uh has definitely one of the most vibrant and uh active community around and that was have went through a lot of the different tough times so that the community is fairly sticky i mean there are some children here and there like i mean even me myself i was not as active as i used to be but i think that a lot of the bright people are there helping the protocol and even kane has uh have delegated some of the responsibility away to the community as well so and uh their approach on the governance is pretty refreshing i think that like they think that the pure 1.1 vote model is probably not the most optimal is that you lead to a lot of governance empathy and all sorts of issues and the will uh kept calling the shot and the smaller token holder would not feel uh motivated to vote which is uh the correct assessment actually so they went for like a more council more yeah so i think that governance is also a refreshing difference between compared to other d5 protocol um and i think that yeah they are definitely one of the most uh the whole team is uh very uh good in execution and fast moving and yeah but i think there's some uh i think some of the key uh like challenges is like the uh as of right now the deadpool because as uh if you're staking you're actually taking out the deadpool exposure which can go up uh if a lot of the satellite asset trader is actually profitable so i think that uh it's a little bit at being in the house and they it's always constant process to mitigate this issue uh i think the next version of the product will be able to uh largely mitigate this issue but i think this is like probably like a issue when they when the bigger you get the more important this issue becomes yeah yeah yeah and i think what you said about having a very vibrant community that's that kind of goes back to why you wouldn't want to funnel some value to your token holders and have some some way that the token benefits from basically increased usage of the protocol which maker doesn't seem to have and hence it doesn't have this kind of vibrant community that or constantly makes improvements uh to to to the project it's more like a team sitting in an ivory tower um compared to synthetics and that's what i what i really like about them yeah i think synthetics is kind of the it's kind of the darling of composability right of of ethereum based composability because the s and x holders and the s developers the team they're kind of pioneers in using curve and using curve pool to stabilize uh susd and also using uh unit swap right to synthetic ether versus ether uh and and funnily enough right if you were lp in in the seth pool you got an insane amount of uni from the uni airdrop and if you were in the uh curve pool you got an insane amount of uh curved tokens crv so i think it kind of uh uh you know by having that grassroots uh community and and having that distribution it it enabled them to to uh be really like looking out for what other people are doing and seeing how it fits in and i think like understanding that the whole point of ethereum is that you can compose apps with each other right the the money legos uh concept and i think that um you know the synthetics uh staking contract is was uh heavily used uh the minter contract rather uh was heavily used in in then later stage d5 projects that that wanted to have like a cl like a stick and claim concept um yeah and i think too like the like the big innovation of of synthetics uh that i that i also failed to see in the beginning but but like like you get to see it as you start to interact with it more is that um when people buy us next and then they draw like susd against it and then they trade it for other things um it kind of gets like a like a double beta effect right like you're you're one year long snx so you have the d5 exposure but then two is like you then use your susd to try to beat the pool uh and you can use your susd to like farm and defy do a whole bunch of things like susd because it's arguably the most decentralized stablecoin you know it was used in based uh as the as the farming token you know it's used in various curve pools so you so you kind of like you you you own your snx and then you get a seat at the table you get i mean whereas like with maker you own maker and then you vote in things that are irrelevant because you don't have enough maker anyway to impact anything uh and meanwhile you can't do anything with your maker you you can't borrow against the you can't like you basically you basically own something that's very uh static whereas when you own snx your possibilities are your your possibilities are endless you know your your the things you can do with it are endless uh so i think i think that that kind of like let people figure out what's cool is uh has worked out very well for them yeah and i guess also notably synthetics is way more centralized than than maker um and in fact more than like most of the projects that we talked about and i think for an unfinished project that still has like a lot of kinks to work out and not just kinks but really fundamental stuff that needs to be solved which is kind of the stakehouse taking on exposure to the dev pool which is in its current form very hard to hatch um and it's really not kind of set and forget like compound or ave or uniswap right i think they they'll have to figure that out and i think it's good that the kind of the governance works the way that it does right now and it's not already too decentralized and too ossified in order to make these changes that are necessary so um should we move on to yuma uh yeah i think uma is uh i actually don't have too much thing to say because first of all i i think it's probably the d5 protocol that i have the least understanding in and i think that uh i also don't really understand how it can attain the current level of market cap because i don't think it's widely used and integrated within the entirely file ecosystem uh as even i think they have a synthetic dollar or some of the things that you can do some view farming you see some traction uh but i don't think it's like a super successful i think this has some success uh but at the current level of market cap i i it's a question mark told me that how they attain such a level of market cap and get disturbed by coinbase so quickly but again i think that there are synthetic approaches the sound uh in a way that is this it doesn't take on that much risk compared to the snx model where you take on the debt risk all this thing it's like a collateralized model and then you mean synthetic asset but i think the key challenges is how to really boost the liquidity for those synthetic assets um it's this you can do some you farming for it but the more synthetic asset you have the harder is to posture it for sedate for liquidity for different synthetic assets it's really difficult uh unless you pay some professional market making to do it so i think that's probably the key challenges how do you go beyond like a proof of concept phase to being widely used in the entire space uh this is the part that i don't really get about uma yeah so sue do you know how what kind of architecture of humor works in comparison to maker and synthetics because i really don't know much about it at all yeah like i would say the simplest way to explain it is they have kind of like an auger like system right where where it's it's based on instead of instead of um using oracle you have like a dispute system uh so like disputers are essentially the ones who are who are making sure that contracts get settled properly and things like that and i i've had a lot of problems wrapping my head around how that will work in practice i i get the appeal of it uh from a construction perspective because you get some nice like no arbitrage like assumption if you get some no like nice no arbitrage assumptions then it should resolve nicely but i i think the game theory of it to me is something that like because i consider myself quite an adversarial thinker and and i do sometimes wonder how it'll look uh if there's collusion if there's like you know you could in theory like when it's near a big liquidation you could have disputes like like you could have like spam disputes that last like four hours while you know it's at the it's at the pin right it's at the liquidation price and then you kind of wonder what will happen uh you know there's there's all these attack vectors that that are very hard to reason about i think i think like first wave defy you kind of saw like people like okay if it's if it's audited then i ape in right and then and then now they're saying like okay it can have five audits and it can still be wrecked by not like smart contract design but by a crypto economic design right and like now people are realizing like even if your crypto economic design is correct you you know do you have the market forces do you understand the market itself well enough right do you understand game theory and and so this has like i think um is a good team they have a good um they have a promising idea but but these are the tough questions and they're and they're really tough in the sense that you may never know the answer until there's a big enough bounty because let's say i know how to exploit uh like something i obviously won't do it unless there's enough money right and and so that would be the same with with any of these kind of uh constructions and and so like like that that kind of like thanksgiving turkey effect uh is is the biggest challenge for any sort of radical new way of trying to solve an issue or trying to say that you don't need oracles or you don't need that i think these are these are very tough questions to to to actually say you've solved okay that's all for today please come back next week where we discuss the second half of the d5 top 20 with zoo and arthur x goodbye
