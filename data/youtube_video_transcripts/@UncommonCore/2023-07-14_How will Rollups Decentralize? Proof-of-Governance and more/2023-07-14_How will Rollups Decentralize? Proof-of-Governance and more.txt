[Music] foreign this is Uncommon Core 2 whether you're an old or new listener I want to spend a few minutes on what you can expect from this show going forward what's going to change and what's going to stay the same Uncommon Core has always been a passion project of mine it was a podcast that was about me taking the position of a student who asks simple questions about the big and Timeless ideas in crypto sometimes I did that with expert guests from the industry but usually with my former co-host suzu now I don't know whether Zeus Farm three hours Capital has misrepresented the sovency in 2022 nor if they have borrowed money while already in solvent I was never close with Sue personally nor did I have any insights into three errors I just know that we did some great episodes together for you guys and that I learned a lot from them by late 2021 Sue and I had been drifting apart for a while as my interests were increasingly moving away from markets and investing towards technology and coming a bit on myself I made a big leap at joining flashbots an organization formed to mitigate the harmful effects from Mev on public blockchains as well as becoming an advisor to the Lido tile and now I am completing the circle by bringing Uncommon Core back with A New Concept and a new co-host the new focus of Uncommon Core will be on exploring the technology and incentives that make Public blockchains Work under the hood with a special attention paid to the three big fields of Mev blockchain security and the rollup ecosystem I will be joined by my new co-host John Charbonneau the co-founder and managing partner of DBA a research driven crypto investment firm based in New York like me John is deeply passionate about understanding and improving the infrastructure that makes crypto work together we will speak with some of the incredibly Builders and researchers who are continually pushing the frontier to make the mass adoption of crypto possible what won't change is the values that made Uncommon Core successful for 37 episodes and weigh over 1 million downloads deep curiosity intellectual honesty and the desire to break down complex ideas together we hope that you will join us on this journey into the heart of the machine what is a good way to start you know a podcast after one and a half year Hiatus um John it's it's really good to to have you and to be doing this with you um how are you doing good it is weird to be uh on here on the other side of this now considering this this was the podcast that I was listening to and I just got into crypto I had been thinking about restarting the podcast a few times and um yeah you were one of the very few people I I could imagine doing it with I was I was hinting at it in in the intro but my my interests had been kind of Shifting um gradually uh more and more away from investing and trading and kind of Market psychology and defy as well frankly um much more to the infrastructure side and so I'm really glad that um we have the opportunity to to dive deeper into these topics together yeah it should be fun I was the person who was always liking those tweets of waiting for you to restart the podcast so let's talk about you for a second here the new kid on the Block um what do you spend your time on in crypto in in an average week so average day I probably spend way too much time on Twitter um that is honestly a lot of actually how I found a lot of stuff at first particularly early on you just kind of find that as like you start to filter through and find all your information there I'd say a lot of my day is honestly just going through stuff that I find on there different research and reading probably less than I would like uh like during the me during the week you definitely have a lot more busy work than you like to uh I like generally my weekends are the times that I get to do the work that like I actually like to do all like all of the types of work that I like all of the longer form writing and stuff like that in particular uh you just kind of really need to sit down and just like block out time to do that kind of stuff you like you need to have a few days aside just be able to turn everything off usually during the week is when I'm doing a lot of just talking to people about like different ideas that I'm working on and then the weekends slash end of the week are the times where I'm just gonna go into like a rabbit hole for three days and not talk to anyone and have 100 tabs open in my computer and just like start writing and reading through everything is writing for you an important part of of processing the whatever you're reading connecting the dots yeah I like it's that it's one of the things that I actually figured out pretty early in crypto it's not something that I actually used to do um when I was in school or my previous jobs um like I wish I kind of knew this in hindsight but like writing works just incredibly well for me it's I so much of what I would do starting out when I was like crypto was like a hobby kind of thing it was just you just read stuff you listen to podcasts and you listen to it you think you understand stuff really really well um and then the second you try to go explain this to someone else like right after the fact you realize oh I understood probably one percent of that like it just did not stick at all it makes sense as the person is saying it then when you try to like say it back it's none of it stuck in there um writing is the only way in particular like really long form stuff like I really need to just build an idea um and force myself to go through everything to learn it it just forces you to like turn over just every leaf possible and whatever this idea is when you just you know you are looking at everything possible on this topic and then you send that out to a bunch of people before I finish it like most of the stuff that I write I'd say I do 95 of it like by myself and then the last five percent that changes when I send out the report to like couple dozen different people that last few percent probably 10x is my understanding of the topic it makes and makes the reports significantly better at that point oh wow um yeah it just like makes a huge difference that lasts a little bit yeah for those who don't know John uh John is one of the most prolific technical writers in crypto you know you've written about um ethereum's roadmap and roll ups and sequence study centralization and Mev and so many different topics um and so you're saying when we read one of your reports then we are basically going through the we're basically replaying your thought process while you were exploring these topics on your own yeah more more or less like I I think it's actually helped me a lot um as far as being able to write decently that I've come into crypto pretty recently and just don't have a lot of background I think it is just inherently really hard to write about a complex topic and like explain it simply if you just know this thing too well and have like a really dense understanding in one area and then what you write comes off as very academic and for experts in like in a specific way um it's much easier to write explain it like I'm five type stuff on complicated stuff if you have to like when I'm writing it I'm just learning it from beginning to end that is 90 of the reason that I write stuff is it is entirely selfish and personal it is because that's just like how I learn the thing uh I like I think it's just so helpful for people to try to do more of that like for me personally that has been the majority of how I've learned everything in crypto are you using chechi pity or any other you know models yet in your writing no okay never um I hear a lot now that um actually the rise of AI and the kind of the you know democratization of the availability of it um is making writing a less important skill I feel like there may not be something that that you would agree with right so I it might lessen the impact of putting it out there um particularly if like if Chachi chat GPT can start to write you know something like I'm writing then yeah less people will read what I'm writing because there'll be better stuff out there so that certainly seems plausible um in the longer term that being said if I had to at the end of all of my reports just like click delete light them on fire and throw them away I'd still write every single report and do them the exact same way uh the the getting to put it out there and have people read it and meet people is like the extra bonus that's really nice 90 to 95 of it is just do the work to learn it yourself that is the only way to force yourself to make sure that like I I have looked at everything on this topic that I possibly want to look at and processed it and like look through all the holes and put it together um yeah chat jpt will probably be better than me at writing one day but just reading what it writes is not going to help you learn the thing in the same way as just like actually just going through the motions yourself like you've got to go through emotions at least personally yeah for me um writing is thinking that's why yeah I mean it's it's I can't think without writing like if I have to think through some topic an instructor it doesn't matter at all what it is it's that's personal or it's professional it can be any number of topics I I'm probably right on the order of like 20 to 30 documents per day and they can be very short right um but it's just like putting different ideas on paper and connecting them together there's this idea of course I mean now by now it's it's it's it's um almost like a part of pop culture like this idea of like the second brain um having this you know um archive where you put all of your notes and um you can connect them to each other you kind of write these small atomic nodes that are self-sustaining and then you link them to each other and by by the process of actually linking two nodes together you also start linking them in your head and it's it's it's crazy how that can form kind of new you know newer connections and and kind of increase the neuroplasticity of your brain so yeah I would I would say you know writing is the the number one important part of learning I mean there is a reason why I want to talk about this topic I mean you actually join crypto relatively recently right um when was it uh so I started in crypto it was like right at the end of March uh just over a year ago so 2022. I basically I basically started reading about it um over the year prior like I was part of I was part of the covet generation of crypto uh prior to covid my I just never looked at crypto seriously it was just my only experience with it was uh friends who were really bad at day trading on it and managing to lose money and like bull markets on it and I just kind of ignored this thing uh then like early code was when I started to pay attention to it and then over 2021 by the end of the year it's just like an obsessive hobby um so then I quit to go finally go do it 22. yeah and it's uh it's it's funny how some people can you know just come into crypto and drink from the fire hose you know an insane amount and and and kind of go to the top very quickly and you are definitely one of them I think I was one of them as well when I joined and that's why I see so many parallettes because I think we have a very similar style of learning and it's one that has a lot of feedback loops built in at least for myself right because when I learn I write and when I write it allows me to publish and when I publish it allows me to a you know get a big dopamine boost which is one thing but it also allows you to build you know a brand and a network and having that Network you were saying earlier with like 90 of your learning happens when you send your article to a dozen different people after it's already done and having this network allows you to do that right it allows you to ask any question to anyone and for me my I think my research process is a little different like I schedule like interviews with people way earlier and ask them questions way earlier um because I'm not as technical as you I think primarily right so I I can't chew through these topics you know as far myself as you can so I have to ask earlier and so Network for me was always super important and that's why this feat is like this this virtual cycle between you know learning and writing and Publishing and network and then repeat um this is basically like what my my whole kind of crypto Korea was was built on in in the first couple years yeah like the this is realistically the whole reason that I got into crypto and the like at least as a job uh it was a lot of fun throughout 2021 is like clearly a fun hobby I just wasn't at the okay I'm gonna go quit my real job and go do this magic internet money job for like the first year the main thing that did convince me is that I started to realize a little bit of like what we're talking about now like kind of gets to is I think the main thing that particularly is a new person that like makes you able to like get by reasonably well in crypto it's not like a background of 10 years of experience and a depth of existing technical knowledge and whatnot it's honestly just understanding how to like make the process work in your favor of just like understanding the workflow of particularly for a field that like there's just so much it's like there's always just too much information like the thing that is going to get you to say on top of that is not 10 years of pre-existing knowledge it's understanding just like what is the process that works for me to be able to process this um and focus like my time and resources in the right place and like work on that and get ahead on that thing quickly um and that's just like a personal process and like using the people around you that kind of thing it's not like any existing technical knowledge for the most part um which is like it makes it a lot of fun as someone who is coming in it's just completely new you legitimately can come in and just like actually be pretty good at what you're doing which is just like a lot of fun if you focus on the right places how do you do that how do you pick on a topic and then focus on that so sometimes it's like oddly odds to me like the first big report that I did um it was shocking to me that it just didn't exist uh it was it was like right after I had started at Delphi at like the beginning of last year and it was like the big ethereum report um that was the thing that I wanted to do right away I like I had just joined crypto it was very clear that okay ethereum is clearly the most important thing that like everyone is building around everyone is building on top of and yet it also seems really clear that when you speak like 99.9 of people the roadmap is just too big at this point for like most people to fit it inside of like one brain it's kind of scattered in different places like oh if I understand the Mev side of things really well I probably like don't understand what's this whole new dank sharding thing and like it was kind of scattered all over the place as someone who just like I came in from the outside this is the most important thing and there's no way for anyone to just like have a comprehensive understanding of this in one place like it was the thing that I knew that I wanted to read really really badly and I was like this is helpful for a lot of other people if I'm coming in and it's the most important thing and I really want to read this thing like it was it was that it was like this is the thing that I would have loved to have in front of me right now like it was very simple as that um so that one felt like very obvious to me I I would say from there going forward some of them kind of just like naturally follow on like what you're already working on um and that's when it becomes easier to like find things that are on the edge of uh like what is the interesting new idea like you're probably gonna be more likely to find that if you are a like quote-unquote expert whatever focus in an area like the next new interesting nft pfp project whatever that pops up I'm not going to be the person who finds it because I don't understand the first thing about any of those um but to the extent that you know there's a interesting new idea in restaking or maybe or whatever it is or shared sequencing like I'm reasonably likely going to be one of the first people to like be on top of that kind of thing because it just naturally follows from what you've been doing um but sometimes it's just like the very obvious thing like the ethereum report it was like is I would love to read this it's the most important thing there's nothing on this uh it was like shocking to exist and it's funny right because when an outsider comes in and learns about crypto they can see these things that are very obvious to an outsider but not to the people who are already in crypto and I mean that there should be a certain report is one is one example of that another I actually had the same realization when I came into crypto and I thought I mean why is nobody talking about how kind of this whole Bitcoin and ethereum system I mean it's basically all a social contract between different people you know and the the technology is just an instantiation of this social contract in this community and they there's clearly the social layer that you know decides what should happen to the protocol and also when there's a bug that um kind of determines you know how it should be fixed and if there's a fork it determines which chain is a canonical and all of these things and it was like when I came into crypto still in in 2017 you know it was heresy to say that there's a social layer in Bitcoin I mean if you think about it today like to anybody who comes in new and they just look at the facts you know that are laid out it's so obvious right and so I I've had almost like a fraudster you know just like writing this stuff down you know because it was so obvious um and you know that the narrative also behind you know that kind of make up the community and the composition of the community can change and that way like different narratives can Dominate and that was kind of the other big article that I wrote In the Beginning visions of Bitcoin with nicardo and yeah some of this stuff was so obvious that it's it's really funny that that it doesn't exist yeah it's a kind of blindness that you develop when you're too deep in crypto and that's why renewal of communities and like fresh blood coming in from the outside is so important the other thing that I wanted to dive in John is how do you how do you do the research process for an article like um for example the one that you wrote on ethereum's roadmap because um are you using are you working a lot with kind of primary sources or are you um you know reading a lot of kind of secondary sources are you talking to people um what what is your personal approach of working I'd say the timing of some of it has changed since I started to now thankfully um like it I can just generally do them more quickly um but I mean for the ethereum one and the kind of one or two after that in particular I would say the majority of it was go into a hole for a month um and ignore everyone around me and try to ignore like every other responsibility I possibly have and just go into this thing and put all like get every last thing possibly checked um I mean for that I was starting from absolute like literally explain it like I'm fives of to understand stuff like kcg commitments in there like I was looking up what is a polynomial when I started that I was like oh yeah it's this equation thing that like I remember learning in like high school or whatever did literally watching like Khan Academy videos and stuff like that so starting from absolute ground up um you end up with a thousand tabs open on your computer and like that I would say that is like the normal what my computer actually looks like is Google doc on one side and there's like a thousand tabs open on the other side and it is just this is everything that I need to go through on this topic it will take me however long it takes me and it is going through that and then just synthesizing and building as I go um and then once you're most of the way of okay I've kind of checked the boxes like thought through most of the stuff that I've possibly like that's out there and that I've gotten to where I want to get to there's always the edge of the map of okay I understand the stuff that's out there but the stuff that makes it really interesting and like adds that extra understanding is talking to the people at the end to the stuff that probably isn't written down yet um and it's like kind of still floating around in their heads and like that's the stuff that makes it really interesting is like having all of those conversations at the end of the report um so I have a very similar workflow now I would just say it's generally a little bit shorter usually um where it usually I won't need to like hold myself off for a month or so to make one of those reports now like usually it'll be like a week or two or something like that um but I I very much split up my time into when I'm trying to when I'm doing one of the reports it is I will spend 90 of my time on that thing for a week or whatever it is um and just try to just ignore everything around me in the world outside and then the next few weeks I go back to okay I have a job and I need to do all these other things that I was ignoring for the last couple weeks and I was like go on those and then after a few weeks I just have a niche to like okay I want to sit down and just like go all the way in on something else and then like pick the next thing what did you do in crypto that you are most proud of uh it was the first vitalik one uh like the Vitality it was like it was that it was the it was the vitalik quote tweet on the like the ethereum report that I did um you must be another report but of the quote feed yes and that is still the like pin thing on my Twitter is that uh like particularly at the time that I was the most proud of was I'd been in crypto for a month and like I like I mean like all of the people that like uh that I was talking to about that like they were like celebrities to me like at that point like in the in the nerdiest way possible like those were the celebrities to me um so having been in crypto for a month and like I just spent a month on this you know big ethereum report and then vitalik retweeted it and was like oh this is really good yeah I was I was rather excited after that um that was definitely the most excited I was um especially like right after starting um yeah I was super excited it was a very it is a very good meme I I recommend everybody dude to check it out so I want to kick it into second gear here okay we we we covered a lot of kind of the the Personnel I think we we are getting a sense of of who you are and what you're interested in um and now I would like to talk a little bit about um the topic of this podcast so we got together because we both love thinking about crypto infrastructure and that's of course a very broad term um so I would like you to you know just map it out with me like what what what are the things um what are the key areas in crypto infrastructure um that exists today um that you are excited about sure yeah there's kind of a few I'd say big buckets like most stuff falls into and the boundaries of all of those things are really loose and they kind of all overlap with each other uh one obvious one particularly for you is the whole Mev slash supply chain and it gets fuzzy because there is still no definition of what Mev is and everything is kind of Mev or not and we're not really sure um so a lot of the protocol level like uh thinking about like and trying PBS like okay how do we address this thing um obviously for you guys with Suave over at flashbots like uh trying to approach it very differently than everyone else's today and then kind of applying a lot of that logic over to roll ups um is a lot of what I'm spending my time on right now um so thinking about okay we've got all these new blockchains that we've kind of decided like this is the way that everyone is going to you know use blockchains for the most part in the future is kind of the ethereum vision and it's still super early stages of okay what do these things look like like should they look like ethereum when they start thinking about decentralization and proposer Builder separation and whatnot or should they look just completely different and have completely different trade-offs um I lean more in the ladder Camp um but like that is a super interesting area and that like obviously plays in with Mev because if you try to you know do sequence or decentralization you just ignore Mev well then you're going to end up with all the same problems that all the blockchains had like a few years ago and then you end up with all the same problems that ethereum had um so that is a super interesting area obviously the scaling that goes along with that and then kind of the last large bucket I'd say broadly is kind of around the consensus and security of that so in particular a lot of around staking um liquid restate liquid staking obviously for yourself and then restaking where we're still trying to decide if this is like the best thing ever or if it's going to break everything still dpd um so that is kind of a whole fun area um yeah and all of those like fit together very well and like that's another thing that like again makes crypto fun is like you kind of have to piece all these different things together to like understand one thing like decentralizing the sequence here it's not one problem it's like six different problems from everywhere and then you kind of like try to put them all together which makes it a lot of fun um which of those are like are you thinking the most about you think right now um spending your time on I I mean anything different I think the most about the the Mev slash transaction supply chain um because I spend most of my time working on on flashbots but um it it's like you say right they are all so closely connected so there's basically no way to not to work in Mev and not think about Roll-Ups why because roll ups also need their sequencing needs met right so they um and I want to talk to you about this in a minute here but they they roll ups today are you know quite early and they're quite centralized they have a lot of their training wheels on um and they are looking to take them off one by one and and one of these requires basically decentralizing you know their leader election mechanism they are and whether they want from a proposal Builder separation or not and thinking about what is the best mechanism for them uh whether they should you know what they should adopt how we how they can become compatible with the future maybe supply chain I think these are definitely topics that we're thinking um a lot about at flashbots um we recently put out a a job posting as well for for a layer 2 researcher and engineer um so and then of course there's the whole you know staking area I think um Lido is a of course a protocol that um is the biggest um liquid staking protocol and um liquid staking is the most dominant form of staking I believe um to the point where there will only be liquid sticking protocols in the future um and it will completely crowd out regular sticking and the kind of the the the market dynamics of liquid staking and I actually just um did an episode um on that with Mike uh over at baycuff a good friend of both of us and we talked about kind of the market dynamics of liquid staking and whether it's uh you know what what kind of Market outcomes there may be and I was arguing that this Market has a ton of network effect and um I think it's very likely that there will be a winner take most outcome and so when you are here in this um in this field so we're talking about core infrastructure so ethereum couldn't work without staking protocols at scale yet we say this is an area where there's actually like competitive Dynamics that dictate that there will be one big winner what does it mean for ethereum right and it raises so many follow-up questions so my personal view is that we basically need to make sure that the best is taking protocol wins and that taking protocol is as decentralized as possible and as close to immutable trustless infrastructure as possible um and that's the kind of I think it's a very similar line of logic that also attracted me to flashbots because block building and Mev and kind of you know this whole like I have the thesis that the mempool and the auction for preferences that come into crypto and then get turned into blocks and executed on different chains that um that this would also turn into its own shared infrastructure layer very similar to liquid staking in that sense and so the challenges in both are actually it's not just they are connected in the sense that you know liquid they can provide us are kind of the biggest customers of kind of the Mev supply chain um it's also that they face very similar structure um challenges that we have to think about yeah okay so I think that gives us a pretty good overview I think just starting with these three topics Mev Roll-Ups and scaling and and staking we Loosely discussed how they relate together and in in crypto infrastructure everything is related together why is it that you care so much about infrastructure what is it about this why not you know why not nfts why not you know building applications on crypto why not Identity or daos what is it about this that that kind of you know scratches your Edge so a lot of that is probably personal uh uh a little bit of regretting my previous career choice and this giving me the chance to look at something more technical uh so like I I had a pretty traditional Finance type background like I did economics in college and that I was working in finance for the last two years I there were parts of it that I liked but I definitely had meaningful regret that I didn't do more of a technical background um that I didn't do something along the lines of engineering that like I had seriously considered and then I kind of just like followed with all my friends in college were doing for the most part um and so a lot of the infrastructure stuff appealed to me in particular because that's just where a lot of the more technical side of things just naturally came in um getting the chance to finally understand like hey this is how a computer actually works uh like a lot of that side was just very interesting to me on just like the simple technical level whereas a lot of the nft stuff was like it was fun like that was like hobby kind of stuff for me but it wasn't what I was gonna get super excited and like wake up at 8am on a weekend and like start reading about like a lot of that was the technical stuff that I felt like I'd kind of missed out on for a number of years so a lot of it was just personal interest um the other part of it was also just honestly where most of the interesting Innovation like has been over the past year and a half has by and large been on the infrastructure side um so like I like I came from a finance background so a lot of the D5 stuff was that was what was super interesting to me after Bitcoin was that was the first thing like Bitcoin was what got me in the simple macro stuff then the first stuff that I got really interested in was defy as like a hobby kind of thing because like it's just a natural this makes sense um but I didn't want to go work in it until I got into the infrastructure side of things and a lot of it in particular is a lot of D5 over the past call it a year and a half two years I I don't think that there's been nearly as much rapid change in Innovation as there has been compared to the infrastructure side of things like I I think that has just naturally been significantly more interesting thing like on the infrastructure side and while I think that a lot of really simple D5 Primitives are going to be incredibly successful in the long run I think that a lot of them are incredibly simple defy and they're just like inherently less interesting at this point to spend time on for me of like what is the tweak to this decentralized exchange versus the last one that makes it like a little more Capital efficient that has just like naturally been a little bit less exciting to me versus the infrastructure side of things over the past two years has been like hey what if uh everything that we built over the last like five years which is like all wrong and we build this all completely differently like that is basically what Roll-Ups and this whole like scaling roadmap is is like hey like sorry all of that stuff that we said for like years about you know everyone was like oh we need a new consensus algorithm and like that makes us more scalable or we're going to do execution charting and whatnot um like Roll-Ups and this whole kind of vision was very much as I was coming in and like it was at the point where it was really starting to become like okay this looks like the direction and it was just completely new thing that was just like this is not what anyone was talking about years ago um so like naturally it's just hey you know what if we rip everything out and start again scratch and like build it completely differently like that's super exciting and that just has so many follow-on effects um which was just like it makes it a lot more interesting just from a personal perspective like to spend time on when everything is just constantly changing yeah I think it was the same for me I think I I came into crypto and I saw you know Bitcoin proved crypto to me but then D5 proved that crypto is more than Bitcoin in the sense that you know you can actually build useful things with smart contracts and you can actually build really cool and really powerful applications but then when I looked at these applications a bit more closely I thought they are still extremely Limited in what we can do right and so this actually sent me down then the infrastructure Rabbit Hole I thought well you can't really build you know a competitive decks while that's the Lev you know why transactions are not private and not efficiently routed and and all of these things for example right and so um that that was one of the rabbit so it's definitely for me you know in terms of it doesn't you know we can't have people build applications on these systems that we want to arrive at an existing C5 applications if we don't first solve infrastructure problems and I mean Mev is a huge one scalability is a huge one and security was another one right so I think all three of these problems Mev Roll-Ups taking um if we don't like if if we don't solve any of them like if there's any of them that we don't solve crypto will not succeed I think and so we need to be you know pushing the frontier on all three of them at the same time um if yeah if we want crypto to to kind of be a place where you can build really really good applications in terms of yeah if you have a follow-up question or something always just feel free to jump in nice I was gonna say I I think that some of them we could have Pretty Simple Solutions too and like still get by even if it's not the perfect solution that we want and like I think it will still be an improvement that's worth making uh but yeah in general we do have to get all of them like reasonably right yeah I mean we we have some great applications already right I think um like a unisop and I can make um working really well uh in spite of their Simplicity um yeah but I want more you know I just I just want more and so okay um let's walk me through a little bit let's let's zoom into one of these topics so why don't we choose roll ups so walk me through where we are right now what is the state of Roll-Ups uh where are they in kind of their adoption um but also in terms of their decentralization roadmaps what steps have they taken and which steps have they yet to take this is the part that I'm excited for uh finally dig in on a topic uh so yeah I've been spending a lot of time on this lately on Roll-Ups um and so I and particularly on the decentralization stuff uh and broadly I would still say that they're a lot earlier than I think a lot of us would like them to be particularly on the decentralization side of things it like it definitely has been slower than I mean certainly that I expected it from what you would have heard uh coming into crypto a couple of years ago where like I I remember that was like when I was coming in a lot of it was a like zku VMS are like about to be here like like this is the year uh like they're right around the corner that kind of thing was always just like push back push back push back like now they're kind of here um but like was certainly slower to get to that over the past couple years and now like you're seeing a lot of the same thing on the decentralization side where it's been oh yeah like we're gonna have a decentralized sequencer like ASAP uh like that has been a conversation for a while and a lot of it realistically in my mind is uh like that's probably a lower priority as it should be for most of these Roll-Ups because I don't think that sequencer decentralization or you know a certain proving system makes a gigantic difference when the biggest problem is still like who holds the upgrade keys to these contracts um if you have a multi said controlling this thing then obviously you know the all the other details are like kind of a lot less important um so seeing Roll-Ups that are finally transitioning on that to like okay we have a much broader multi-sig that's like outside of the team itself um you need a high threshold of it to make any changes um but like that is still the most important thing in my mind like by far is just like actually handing over the control and figuring out like what we're going to do with this like I feel like most of the sequencing decentralization stuff oh like most people haven't done it yet but I think it is in large part because of prioritization of I don't think that you actually need to decentralize the sequencer if you're roll-up is implemented well so I think it's just a much lower priority I think a lot of the decentralization on the you know how do we actually control the contract itself of like having arbitrary upgrades that's not a question of importance that is a like that is very important and should be done ASAP that is a question of I still think that there's like a lot of open area and a lot of open thoughts on like what is the right way to do this like I think that you like there's a reasonable answer that all of these contracts need to be immutable and they're like there's no acceptable outcome where they're upgradable like all these role of contracts need to be immutable I think that is like a reasonable position to take I think it's also a reasonable position to take on the other side of like you know token holders should fully control these things or some other complete governance mechanism like that is the direction that I think things will go in is like there will be upgrade ability um but then the question is like okay there's upgradability um like are you just gonna have to be like token hold your governance and now okay now you just ended up in a situation where the majority token holders can upgrade the contract um so you start to have just like very difficult questions on that of okay if we do that but like what if we give them a really long delay so they can't upgrade the contract anytime soon like you know it takes a month then in that time you could presumably exit from the roll-up if you like you don't like the changes um obviously that's not like super ideal and the question is obviously like what if there's a bug in the contract like do you you know do we need instant upgrades to be able to fix something like that so like these are very just thorny questions that like and this is where I think a lot of time should be spent on is like what is the governance and control side of Roll-Ups as much as I've like loved spending time on shared sequencing and like all these other interesting like mechanism designs like that is like the stuff that nerd Snipes me and I love talking about like oh yeah how do we get like Atomic cross chain transactions using Suave and a shared sequencer like it's a ton of fun to do that um I think most of the important questions though are actually on just the very simple fundamental questions of like who controls this role like what is the governance of it should be of staking or not like how do like who's the person who kind of controls who's the sequencer has been a lot more of my conclusion as like I've worked on recent reports and like thought about it more is probably a meaningfully more important question than what is the exact sequencer mechanism that you have you know whether it's one sequencer or it's a consensus set of 10 or whatever it is um I like the the person who controls it that governance mechanism or centralized company who just like holds the upgrade Keys is like a much much more important question in my mind um like a lot of the kind of incentive and reason that people really want to decentralize the sequencers like okay we want like real-time censorship resistance and we want to make sure that like you know you don't have monopolistic operators the problem with that is is just like decentralizing the sequence or quote-unquote like doesn't actually fix that in my mind um you could put a consensus set in there but if your governance token holders who control the roll up and like they set the rules and they pick who the sequencers are they're going to be able to implement if they want monopolistic pricing or whatever rules they want such that like we filter different addresses like that like that is ultimately up to them um sequencers just have a much much more kind of constrained role compared to like what we think of with player one validators today is like they do have so I I think that much more of the focus needs to be on like how do we constrain their powers such that like even if it is literally one person who's doing this we're totally fine with that as opposed to just like how do we rush to get this thing as quote unquote decentralized as possible with like many operators doing this thing and then we just kind of throw it out there and like we assume it works because I think that there is generally going to always be active governance on these things um and like I I think that Roll-Ups should lean into that a lot like I do think that Roll-Ups need to make very different trade-offs on thinking about like Mev compared to ethereum um like a lot of that stuff is going to look very different in my mind okay that's a lot to unpack here okay so um okay so I I okay I want to zoom into one point first so you were saying um sequence or decentralization this is not really a priority for our rollups right now I would agree I think but it's not only not a priority I think it's also very difficult so even if you wanted to do it it's not really clear how to do it in a decentralized way because um this is one thing I highlighted in like previous talks and such but um by having a centralized sequencer for so long that is operated by you know the kind foundations or companies Behind These roll ups they were able to give users a incredibly low latency and B privacy and this is not something that you can just replicate in a decentralized setting and so it is a big it is a big challenge like right so it it kind of depends what trade-offs are you willing to make and also what technology is available I think we're trying to get there with Suave um where we would have you know just kind of Builders execute build us run in inside trusted execution environments and I I think this is clearly like the most viable in pragmatic path how you you can decentralize the status quo you know you just take what currently runs in a centralized server and you put it into a te um and if you want you're going to rotate but that's almost like the easy part of the problem right yeah so particularly in the absence of like something like Suave is not yet live today and I I agree that decentralizing the sequencer if we give ourselves the same constraints as something like ethereum I do think is a really difficult problem if you assume that this has to be a completely permissionless role and we can't trust any of them and all of that kind of you know the stuff that it makes sense for ethereum to optimize for I think if that is the optimization then I think it's a very difficult problem um I think that Roll-Ups are in a significantly safer place that it probably makes sense to make meaningfully more trade-offs in my mind on like the decentralization and Trust side of things um because again fundamentally like these roll-up sequencers just have a fundamentally very different trust requirement compared to ethereum validators like it makes sense for us to optimize for ethereum vouchers that we want to try at least to have this super long tail permissionless incredibly censorship resistant the whole point of Roll-Ups is they're already paying the layer one for those guarantees of enforcing censorship resistance and whatnot so like sequencer fundamentally doesn't give that anymore so in my mind they can make significantly more trade-offs and we can just pick you know we can have governance decide that like hey here are the 10 sequencers that we're picking or pick your number whatever it is yeah and we trust them and we say Hey you 10 sequencers you do the same thing that like arbitrary or optimism was doing today of you guys run a private mempool and like we trust you to abide by that and like you don't front run users that is that is a clear improvement from having one person do it today like no it's not ethereum if it's a permissionless open validator set and whatnot I I don't think that that's going to be a practical goal for like most Roll-Ups nor do I think it's necessary like I think it's gonna be difficult from an economic efficiency standpoint like let alone just getting that many people to run this kind of network I don't think it's necessary um and then quite frankly like if you look at Roll-Ups today they don't want to give away that like that part of particularly fast confirmations and private members like that's not going to be an acceptable thing for arbitrary and optimism to say in my mind of like oh yeah we decentralize the sequencer and sorry it's a public mempool now like there's no other options and like you get front run now in like a couple seconds uh realistically though I think that you take a step in between there and you say like okay we governance decides like these are the people that we trust and if you act maliciously like you're out like that is what governance needs to have the power to do so if a sequencer does start acting like out of term then you boot them out like that like that's a very fundamentally different Dynamic than ethereum where you know if ethereum validators are censoring you there's no other like chain that you can you know send a message to and be like hey force my transaction into this chain like if ethereum is censoring you and like you're based on ethereum like you're then you're being censored like that is the whole point of Roll-Ups is they get to inherit that from ethereum if their sequencer starts to extract Mev sensor I force and exit like I I bypass them and slash governance just kicks them out yeah so like I think that they can make meaningfully more trade-offs particularly today where we don't have this perfect world yet of you know this perfect private mempool with like something like Suave and Visions where I just kind of throw my order in there and it comes out the other side of you know everything is handled in between with privacy preserving technology um like that doesn't exist yet for these Roll-Ups and like I think particularly in that period like it makes sense for them to make trade-offs in that interim and have trusted operators that like governance does have meaningful control over okay so I I think I I hear you say we have on the one hand the chain like ethereum and it has specific uh requirements or goals you know and these are to be very neutral very kind of censorship with this base layer and so it it has kind of a way of decentralizing or it it has a way of selecting it's well let us in like form of PBS and like a mempool policy and so on that allows for these things um to work right and that's one of the reasons why privacy today like front running protection is so difficult on ethereum today why you know the block time has to be very high because again like you want to be very geographically diverse entities to be in consensus with each other and you don't want latency to become the dominant factor in who makes money in validation right and but then on the other end you have this Cosmos chains or app chains where one application is basically its own chain and they have their own validators and maybe they share it with someone else but um they have a governance and unlike ethereum they are not too shy to say um our governance can decide whatever we want right it's like um we have no problem slashing someone socially um uh which would not happen in ethereum today right um so I think even I mean the Dao Fork was very long time ago and you know kind of reverting that state transition I think already that's like proven extremely controversial and will not happen again but this for these app trains it's it's quite common to say for example on chain like osmosis to say if we see any of you valid at us front running a user then we will slash you or whoever you delegate it to right and I think dydx actually came out the other day on Twitter as well with their new version and they said uh by the way guys we have a solution to Mev it's social slashing we're monitoring um the chain and if we see anyone any validator misbehaving we're going to slash them and I don't know I mean like I hear you okay so like your thesis is Roll-Ups they are already quite decentralized because they post their data and their proofs to ethereum and so they cannot make any invalid State transitions also they have this bridge contracts and users can um always get a transaction mind um through the bridge like through ethereum layer one okay so that's the opposition um and you think that makes it okay basically for Roll-Ups to go with the kind of the more cosmosy route of okay do you have any concerns that like hey do you think this is a middle step or do you think this is a potential end game for Roll-Ups as well uh I definitely viewed as a middle step and I think it's very possible it's a end step particularly not I wouldn't say for all of them to be fair like I I certainly do think that there's going to be a place for Roll-Ups that want to be on the far end of the spectrum of like possibly they do have an immutable contract and we just want to have this super decentralized permissionless mechanism that makes sense I also think that there is going to be a place for the absolute extreme end on the other side of we have a decentralized exchange we run a centralized sequencer we do you know private mempool first and first out like they might even do co-location rights whatever it is um the the thing is like that's not a that's not a replacement for ethereum that's a replacement for Robin Hood uh the way it works today like there there I think that there is going to be even in the end game like stuff on that far end of the spectrum where this works because hey if like unlike something like Robin Hood or like using coinbase as the simple example like there's a market difference between I use coinbase to centralize exchange and I use roll up where bass uh like coinbase is the centralized sequencer for this like if that is properly implemented coinbase is not custodying my funds anymore there's there's no possibility anymore for this exchange to be literally just taking my money and sending it to a hedge fund and like doing whatever with my money like that's fundamentally not possible anymore they do have the power to okay they can censor you on a very short time span or start front running you I like I'm willing to put trust slash I think most people will realistically in a large company to be accountable for they're not going to do this kind of just unrealistic very short-term profit-seeking behavior of like yeah they could start front running all their users like they could it seems highly unlikely that they're going to do that if the result of that is everyone just leaves the role up and like okay this business is dead now and they made a few dollars like front-running people like anyone can do that in theory Sure um like that is why it's it's significantly more important for for those types of use cases to be viable to have all of the backup type stuff in place for these systems to have like real user opt out like there has to be the exit button right away of I'm a user I get my money out slash if there's a malicious sequencer we have governance upgrades on this thing and we just immediately you know goodbye like that person is gone so like having that opt out is the fundamental thing that is like a large difference in my mind like that's the thing that makes a lot of traditional Tech entrenched it is because they're just built their whole business model is built around the idea of like how do I make sure that people basically cannot leave my platform possibly I'm okay with a person who's like literally running the box of operating this thing being like kind of centralized if it is fundamentally the opposite premise of paper basically have no power over me and I have like free opt out at any point in time I think there's gonna be a place for both of them but yeah said realistic though I mean a rollup never exists in a vacuum right like if we talk about optimism or arbitrum I mean what they've been doing I mean one reason why they have been launching so early and with that training wheels on they have been using these centralized sequences to provide users really good user experience is because they want to build they want to gain an early advantage in building that Network effect so isn't it unrealistic to say that users can leave at any time for example you know if the arbitrum ecosystem becomes very popular isn't that at that point like saying I'm going to leave ethereum uh I mean it depends I mean it could be difficult if it's a place that you like to use but on a fundamental level I mean like there's no like I mean there's no comparison between something like that and something like Twitter basically where like that is the whole point of it's really hard to bootstrap any kind of decentralized social media because I fundamentally cannot carry over my network to somewhere else it's like you are going to start from scratch yeah like using arbitrum like yeah I have to move to another roll up but I mean your assets are your assets you could sell them you could move them you could go to play this thing on another chain like that that is just like yes I mean there's a minor the user has to literally do something um but it if it is a very clear and easy opt out of like I own all my own funds I own my data etc for like whatever this use case is like that is a clear opt-out that like keeps operators in checking my mind and like that that's what actually prevents the more monopolistic type activities in my mind rather than saying like we have a decentralized sequencer and then all of a sudden like they're gonna behave like you could have a decentralized sequencer if if your governance for your rollup is run by token holders who just want to extract a bunch of value well then they're going to increase the prices and try to extract value the thing that will keep them in check is okay can users actually opt out of the system immediately and hey we can go do the exact same thing like right over there on the other roll up and we just go move over like that that's what actually keeps it in check in my mind so how would this play out then um so let's say we have you know governance whitelists so right now we have one centralized sequencer right okay so let's take it to the next step maybe there's three centralized sequences would you envision that these sequence has outsourced their block building or is it something that they do internally like would there be PBS if yes will it be permissioned PBS which we've never seen by the way um you know how do you think about that yeah having some form of PBS auction is one of the clearest things that I think they need to do regardless of whether of a centralized sequence or a decentralized sequencer like this is already a problem today for centralized sequencers that they should be running some form of auction like you don't want to end up in the place where Roll-Ups are already in today of there's no way for me to express my preferences everything is private first and for me like all the problems that everyone saw with the arbitrim sequencer uh like in recently spam like yeah like this is the obvious conclusion if you do private first and first out and you have like no way to express a preference over hey I want to be the top of the block I want to get in fast whatever it is yeah um so in my mind there certainly needs to be you can have this you know trusted mempool that the sequencer runs on the side and like we have a block and they also say like we're running a PBS auction if you want a bid for the top of the block or whatever it is you could bid for that um slash other preferences they just won't be able to see the user orders assuming that the sequencer keeps those trusted orders private which is effectively what I mean block Builders what services like flashbots protects and map share are are like trying to do is there there is a truck there is an amount of trust in there today on like one operator to keep it private and like you would be trusting some of the sequencers like hopefully obviously that gets more decentralized over time um but in my mind that is like a very clear improvement over what we are doing today still um where we have a number of operators and they're like actually accountable to governance rather than we have one operator and the team who deployed this thing like decides who that operator is uh and like we're getting towards that stage like governance having more power and being able to decide and like I do think that that is going to be the natural next step of we have governance decides on like these are the operators that we trust they will very intentionally pick we can pick you know a geographically distributed you know set of sequencers like they start to do the kind of thing that like someone like lydo is doing hopefully of like we can very as like and this is one of the problems with proof of stake without any form of like delegation like someone like Lido in between um is if you just do assume if you just assume that liquid Satan doesn't exist uh which obviously it approaches like taking everything over but like if you just do delegate a proof of stake by itself without that like most people are gonna pick like hey I'm just gonna give my person like the biggest validator I trust them and like you end up with everyone giving it to like the biggest two or three people in the same way that like Lido alleviates that under the hood of you know hey we can purposely pick we pick a bunch of geographically distributed operators very intentionally which users would not pick if we left the choice like to themselves governance could do the exact same thing here of like yeah it probably doesn't make sense for them to pick 10 sequencers that are all operating in the US and like using the same like AWS Center like that would probably be a bad idea they should probably very intentionally pick you know we want 10 or 20 operators or whatever that are very intentionally Geo distributed that are using different infrastructure that we keep them accountable to that like it you actually end up with that's why it's interesting like people view the like proof of stake permissionless decentralized like it sounds nice I I think most of the economic forces if you just like let them run out like that end up more centralized than if you had this quote unquote like POA or proof of governance or whatever you want to call it like we very intentionally pick these are the people that like we want to be running this thing and like that's the kind of process like lighter runs under the hood um and this is the interesting part like this is what I was starting to like tweet about a little bit the other day I was like uh Sunny had tweeted out um from osmosis uh uh like proof of stake was a mistake um that we should just do like POA like let government's pick um was that his point was that his point was he was it was he saying that you know we should do POA or was he saying that we should go back to proof of work oh yeah it was for POI it was for like we should just like governance pick operators um and this is where like this is where I think we'll have some interesting debate on this is so for something like ethereum I don't agree with that um ethereum needs to maximize for we need a completely permissionless like way for people to join this validator sets like that makes sense of my mind we need proof of state to do that because inherently if you rely on governance to pick these people like that is the exact opposite of what ethereum is optimizing for ethereum does not want we pick a set of operators and we have like centralized-ish governance that's trying to manage all these people and is very active governance and it's not permissionless to join like that's the exact opposite of what ethereum should be doing like obviously it doesn't make sense they need proof of stake um the question in my mind that I'm starting to increasingly think is like actually very viable is for Roll-Ups is there any need for us to do proof of stake um at all for these types of constructions where if we're saying that governance can do this process themselves um because like this is where it'll be interesting it's like it depends on what gov what Roll-Ups decide to do with governance because if you if you're a roll-up and you decide that like Hey we're immutable and we want to be like ethereum like we're going to burn the keys there's no upgrading the contract and realistically everyone is stuck to the contract and like we basically have no governance you probably want like a decentralized permission this mechanism like proof of stake throw it out there and like that kind of works because you don't have active governance to like keep selecting these validators my general opinion is that most Roll-Ups whether on the other end of the spectrum of we just need to figure out better governance than like multi-sig upgrade Keys it's the type of stuff that optimism is experimenting with we're like we have two houses and there's different forms of identity and like there is a real governance process that governance process in my mind can manage a set of sequencers in the way that like Lido picks delegates under the hood so then the question is if we're optimism like or some other roll-up and we actually Implement a robust governance mechanism where you know we have multiple houses we have interesting forms of identity whatever it is and we're able to confidently pick like hey here are the 30 geographically distributed sequencers that we like what is the reason at that point to implement proof of stake if it seems in their benefit to actually keep the set close because they want to trust them to enforce certain things if you implement proof of stake by assumption is whenever you implement proof of stake liquid staking tokens like becomes 100 like we will just approach like 100 like it is better than delegating your state natively for like very obvious reasons so the difference between the two scenarios is if you implement proof of stake you end up with Lido or someone like that they end up effectively running all of the stake and they picked they pick the delegates for you under the hood and they presumably do a good job of picking these geographically distributed validators and whatnot um the obvious problem with that which light I was looking to solve is uh the like principal agent problem with this of like okay now you have a LST governance that's picking all of our delegates like this is our chain we want to pick the delegates so to make that viable you need something like uh the Dual governance that like in my mind otherwise this just like I think it's crazy like you need to have can you explain what to do the governance what's that oh yes yeah so the simple way to you know the way that Lido more or less works today is like okay ldo token holders control the Dow um so now you end up in a situation where okay we're ethereum if all the stake ends up with Lido and they're picking all the delegates well and that means that ldo holders are picking all the delegates instead of like ethereum and like we're very misaligned now so dual governance uh the way that like Lido's proposing it is to give like Steve holders potentially like veto rights in a lot of circumstances because like they are presumably obviously either lined like they are stakers and so if you know ldo token holders start to have some like malicious proposal that's like against ethereum interest stiffholders can veto that um so like that helps greatly mitigate the okay this LST governance is just like gonna go do their crazy thing that's bad for us for proof of stake to be like viable at all in the long run I act under the assumption that liquid's taking tokens like they end up cannibalizing like most of the stake and if that ends up cannibalizing most of the stake like you need to have a way for them to be aligned with the protocol itself so like something like dual governance is just like an absolute necessity in my mind um so I assume that's where you would end up if a roll-up implements some form of proof of stake is like we've taken tokens would arise they would hopefully Implement some form of like dual governance such that like you know staked op or staked ARB token or whatever has like veto rights and whatnot the question is that like that point is the big difference between the Roll-Ups and ethereum is I don't think the Roll-Ups if they don't need to care about a permissionless validator set so they don't care if you know ethereum validator number one million can join this thing so we don't need proof of stake for that and if we end up in the spot where realistically most of the capital is delegated this whole like slashing thing kind of loses its punch when like it's not your money like I am using someone else's money that was delegated to me um so like I questioned how honestly valuable that is you end up in like the best case scenario where you have this liquid taking token that like they're picking the delegates under the hood for you and then you know your role of governance has like some form of veto rights does it make sense at that point if we have active governance and we don't need a permissionless validator set to just say like hey our roll-up governance will just decide ourselves and we don't have any staking we don't have a staking token it is just whatever the form of our roll-up governance is it's like we just picked the 30 sequencers as opposed to Lido who are ever else picking them for us and like having this taking tokens like why do we need that kind of middle process in there I think the particularly interesting way is like if someone like Lido or whoever else like they're basically delegation slash picking of these people like as a service like we will do a better job of picking these geographically distributed people like we are ready to go of like bootstrapping like these are the 30 people who like fit your needs and like we can set this up for you Etc um like that becomes very interesting versus a lot of like governance is hard like most Roll-Ups are gonna like have a very difficult time of picking like oh these are the perfect like operators that we all want and like repeating that process over and over again is difficult um so it like it's become interesting in my mind like what what is the reason in this scenario if I'm a roll-up that has like an active governance that I trust and I don't really care about having like validator number one million be able to join my validator set like what is the point of staking at that point versus just like let governess decide directly and like do do away with staking yeah I think the argument that I find convincing is that the rollup already inherits a lot of decentralization from ethereum and so it doesn't need to be as secure and so it doesn't need to um you know basically incur so much overhead you know both in terms of cost but degradation also Visa experience from having this decentralized sequencer selection mechanism and why couldn't they also like exert somewhat of power to governance I think um the argument I don't find convincing is that liquid staking would be the end game for Roll-Ups so I think liquid sticking works really well on ethereum um for a few reasons um so the first one is that ifs actually used as money um and this is used as collateral very actively but no roll-up tokens I don't know that that's going to change because already Roll-Ups today they would support um fee payment you know in Eve um several of them have a con abstraction just topic we didn't talk much about today which is also super fascinating um and I think I mean we are going to a place where people can pay their fees in any token I don't think really there's any much demand to use for example arbitrum talking to optimism talking and so on and for anything so I don't like for me as strategic advisor to Lido I would not green light or like not that we have a process for green lighting I'm speaking metaphorically but I would not support um an expansion of lighter or for example to a layer two for that reason because I think it's basically completely futile to go into that market so I don't think you actually skipping that step I think if you went to proof of stake I think it would stay you know non-liquid probably for the most part um but that I mean that's like a minor part of your argument right I think the the main part is actually that it's already pretty pretty trusted even if we have governance in the mix um and I would largely agree with that I I wonder what do you think for chains that let me take a step back because we've um we have seen one thing that we have seen like one and a half one year ago is a lot of the Roll apps develop layer twos actually saying we want to be the place where you can build layer threes and you can settle you know the data and the proofs and so on to our layer too and so and they kind of retain the option I guess over the longer term to kind of untether from ethereum itself and either you know don't post the data anywhere or you know post it on some off-chain data availability solution right but I think everybody wants to be the sediment layer you know if you would and so um for a chain that has these Ambitions and I mean you would have to think like optimism arbitrum stocknet ZK sync I mean they all are dreaming big and they want to build you know an ecosystem of chains whether that's you know many Layer Two Chains and you have a kind of super chain you have like a sequencer in the case of optimism or whether it's a kind of layer 3 ecosystem like in the case of you know CK sync and stocknet and scroll um would you think different then about the need for sequencer decentralization I think it is significantly more important for them to figure out their governance in that position than figuring out like the maximally supposedly decentralized sequencer mechanism it like that like that is in my mind what's going to be more important and so I mean like using optimism an example so like bass won't be deployed as an L3 like settling to optimism they're not doing that it'll just be like it'll be another L2 which I think is very reasonable um the benefits of l3s are like kind of fuzzy in a lot of cases well optimistic Roll-Ups they're pretty fuzzy right because the the layer 3 would have to post the data to the layer two but then the layer 2 has to post the data to the layer one right and so can is it fair to say that that's different for validity proof roll ups because they can actually um you know bundle all of the proofs together yeah the the clearest like simplest benefit would be if you're a ZK roll-up and the proofs that you would be posting to ethereum particularly if you want to post them frequently if those are really expensive to verify on ethereum um I mean you could do different forms of like aggregating those and like converting them to different proofs that are cheaper to verify in ethereum but in general like if you'd be posting a lot of proofs and expensive to verify the monothereum it probably makes sense to like yeah we could just dump them on an L2 yeah aggregate a bunch of them and then we settled them back down because like it's cheaper to use there like that one makes sense um there are other random benefits of it as well but yeah I think it's like clearest in that case um but in in any do you think ethereum will add any pre-compiles for uh you know solving you know verifying these proofs not and anytime anytime soon okay would be my guess like none of like most of them are just pretty political um and like doing anything that would be seen as favoring like any of the more targeted ideas that are like that would be seen as potentially favoring like one type of ZK roll up over another I don't think like I don't think it's going to make sense um I mean work together and like first degree on One op code that they want right and then get it to them to do that people right because wouldn't they all benefit tremendously if there was the case I feel like the answer is yes I mean based on particularly like I mean they already have such Divergent plans at this point that like oh yeah we'll all go back to doing this would be kind of it would be kind of difficult but yeah I mean in theory yes if everyone did the same thing like it would be nicer but I think they're just like so Divergent that like it's probably hard to coordinate that um but yeah kind of kind of back to the original like I I do think that optimism in the scenario figuring out their governance is more important than like what is the sequencer you know do we have 10 do we have 20 sequencers is it 100 whatever um like their governance is going to be really important in particular when everyone is using the same Bridge contract um in this whole like super chain vision and there's one governance uh so like that is supposedly going to control that like in the long run like as they have like full governance power that governance is going to matter a lot um like that is going to be very very important and like change that are like basically want to Outsource their governance to optimism like that's very interesting like base can effectively like Outsource governance to optimism like should they want to um like that is going to matter a lot in my mind like what are the upgrade mechanisms like who's going to in control of this system and like those are the people who picked the sequencer uh like that is still the most important problem in my my mind and that is like a very very hard problem figuring out just like how do we do roll-up governance and like think about this problem like that is very difficult can you explain um just briefly kind of the vision behind the super chain uh we'll we'll see if I can um I I mean like the very general idea is I I I'd say every roll-up ecosystem has a very similar idea at this point whether it's them or ck sync or polygon talking about polygon 2.0 like they all have similar visions of we're going to kind of be building our whole ecosystem of Roll-Ups and we want within our kind of ecosystem to have enhanced op in interoperability and shared standards and whatnot across them so having very fast bridging between them potentially having a shared sequencer between them having forms of like standardized messaging between them having potentially shared governance to the point where it starts to feel like in this like super chain that you know I'm not using 20 different Roll-Ups it kind of feels like I'm using one single roll up the like super extreme end of this would be the kind of post that um that UMO From Success from succinct had put out I want to say like a week or two ago uh it's called shared validity sequencing where you have a shared sequencer for multiple chains where like in theory like bass and optimism could have the shared sequencer that if you go all the way to the extreme end they have like shared validity conditions across them where you know a fault on one like reverts to the other chain and like they like they're actually like fully tied together to the point where they are basically like a form of sharding of like you're basically on one chain at that point um I don't think most things are going to go to that extreme so that's going to be like the interesting question is people build out these ecosystems and in particular with shared sequencing is there is kind of this whole spectrum of you know on the one end is you have a monolith chain you put everything on one chain on the other end is you know we have a million chains that are a million different standards and then like you like hey what if we have a you know a shared sequencer but like people have different standards and they're kind of flexible and like a little bit further over is what if we have a shared sequencer that's fully stateful and is like checking the validity of all these chains like then it's like kind of approaching like one chain at that point so like there's this spectrum of trade-offs that'll depend on like what is your application like how much do you care about being like basically on the same chain as you know the chain next to you versus hey we want to have our own governance we want to be able to hard Fork by ourselves and like make our own decisions so there's going to be this like interesting spectrum and that's going to be a very like political social thing for them to figure out and then also just kind of emerging based on you know what are the applications that actually use these things and like how much interoperability do they need between them um like Scott from Argus had a he had a really interesting presentation uh like at the uh I'll show the research Day videos like he was talking about like um about this in the context of like gaming where you know there is no need for this shared sequencing for like a bunch of different game shards to have this you know perfect synchronous composability between like three different games like they don't need that like we don't need to optimize for that they could be just like completely basically different shards that you know share some infrastructure behind the scenes so there's gonna be like different trade-off spaces for like different applications which will be like really interesting to see um John we have to wrap up soon but do you would you like to summarize what are the main takeaways for our listeners today yeah so on the roll up front as people start to think about their decentralization roadmap I think that there's a lot of natural tendency to draw parallels and lessons from ethereum of you know wearing ethereum roll-up this is what ethereum is doing for PBS for its validators like we need to be doing the same thing I think there's a natural tendency to do that and in general I don't think that it's usually going to be the right spot on kind of the trade-off Spectrum for most of these Roll-Ups because they are very inherently used for a different thing like ethereum is being made to serve these Roll-Ups and give these tags that we are in teas these Roll-Ups are being made for users to be used on a shorter time scale like they're fundamentally trying to give different properties and so I think it makes a lot of sense for them to design themselves very differently in reflection of that um in particular like I think a lot of it might look a little more cosmosy than it does ethereum where ethereum it makes sense to be the most like permissionless and try to be decentralized as possible whereas I think that Roll-Ups are going to have to think a lot more about opinionated governance whether they like it or not like I think that is naturally going to arise and with that naturally going to rise uh probably need to lean into that and like figure that out like very very strongly uh I think that is potentially going to be the more important and kind of the driving factor between like how do these systems play out in the long run like how do we figure out the incentives in the system like how do we keep everyone in check it's going to be figuring out a lot of very different points on the kind of trade-off Spectrum versus ethereum okay so I mean one thing where you said this in particular it would be the sequencer and so you think sequences should be determined by governance and so I hear from two directions that you think governance will actually become an incredibly important topic for Roll-Ups to figure out on the one end because they they're actually the biggest thing that they all need to decentralize is kind of the stewardship of their smart contracts um so who controls that who can update it what are the guard trades um how do you also mitigate you know it's not just as simple as just making it immutable because things can go wrong and we may need some methods of upgrading it but then also sequencer decentralization and you say you're basically arguing governance is kind of the focal point where both of these ideas meet and so governance is a really under researched underdeveloped area right now in roll-up land is that right yeah broadly yes and I think that most ropes are going to be forced into this decision like ethereum doesn't have to think about this because there's no smart contract on ethereum that controls most of the money on ethereum Roll-Ups all today and many in the future are going to have this one smart contract that controls a hell of a lot of the money on the roll-up and that contract governments governance made de facto be the role of governance so if they hold a ton of power over the chain that we're not used to thinking about on something like ethereum where you know we have this committee that like controls most of the money uh they're going to have a lot of power and like be driving the decisions in large part um so thinking about that yeah is going to be like very important because it just fundamentally changes the way that you have to think about all this my mind because I think a lot of stuff is going to be have to be way more opinionated when you said we probably won't have a contract on ethereum that has a lot of money in it I had to think about liquid seeking and kind of the outcome from that market and that's probably the closest one yeah that we may get and it's no coincidence I think that the challenges faced by liquid second protocols to find ways to you know marry immutability and you know security and to decentralize their governance I think like yeah I think you and I we agree that there's a huge overlap between for example you know the roadmap of a Lido and and the roadmap of you know a roll-up that there's much more here to discover than you know typically meets the eye okay there was a very interesting perspective I'd not heard this before um thank you John um and yeah um I think in terms of cadence we may do this every every two to three weeks right I think that's that's what our listeners can expect and so yeah we'll see you all um then
