let me offer a few remarks on the implication of the coveted crisis from for the labor market uh in my final minutes so as you all know as of today recording a few days after the initial meeting on may 8 2020 the unemployment rate is approaching 15 3.5 million people americans have applied for unemployment uh insurance and so this is a labor market catastrophe of the type that we have not seen since the great depression i want to now step back and say uh what did things look like before uh the crisis and why they will probably not look quite that way afterward so here's where we were headed before the crisis uh really four points and i'm going to illustrate these pictorially one was that we had a kind of a barbell economy polarized employment growth and high wage high education jobs and low wage low education jobs simultaneously that movement into low-wage low education jobs was personal services it was concentrated among non-college workers who are the majority of the us workforce despite the low wages in that type of work we had a tightening labor market uh reflecting four forces uh one was a rising dependency ratio meaning the retirement of big boom the second was small cohorts of young workers entering the labor market due to low fertility a third was vastly curtailed immigration as a reflection of changing policy and the fourth was rising projected employment in personal services having to do with changes in consumption patterns and again with aging so the expectation going forward was rising wage pressure in low paid jobs let me illustrate each of those points very quickly and then tell you how i think things have changed so first this shows what many of you will have seen before the kind of a polarized labor market uh occupations are ranked to your large categories from lowest paid to highest paid and you see a kind of a a u shape where the two ends are growing on the left-hand side is employment growth in health and personal services cleaning protective services operator operator and labor jobs these are many of these are hands-on positions they involve helping assisting or caring for others they're growing rapidly they're low paid on the right hand side growing rapidly are professional technical and managerial jobs i'm sure we all understand uh how important and well remunerated they have become over the last several decades in the u.s economy contracting of course our production operative clerical and administrative support and some sales occupations these are kind of the middle skill set of jobs that have been hollowed out as a function both of computerization of office work and decline of manufacturing some of that having to do with automation some of that having to do with trade important to understand that that polarization is concentrated among non-college workers workers uh with uh high school or lower education uh that's where the movement out of the middle and towards the left-hand side of the diagram uh has occurred that's a movement of uh non-college workers out of office out of factories and into entertainment recreation uh security uh health uh food service et cetera it's the us labor market has not delivered much wage growth for less educated adults since uh really 1980 but if you look at these figures which show the evolution of real wages indexed to their 1962 level uh up to uh 2017 what you can see as uh this kind of uh upward check uh in the last couple of years especially among the least educated though not exclusively reflecting the tightening labor market and the wage growth that was starting to occur even in relatively low paid jobs as a function of the high pressure labor market that was very good news um and in fact if you look at the projections according to bureau layer statistics of the types of jobs that are supposed to grow we're supposed to grow over the next decade um uh these are the top 20 these top 20 account for 55 of all projected job growth over 10-year periods so 4.6 million of 8.4 million jobs they are concentrated in these low-paid services health aides food and cleaning services labor occupations these are mostly non-college jobs they mostly pay below the medium wage so these are not jobs that we're excited about you know many many people are making careers in however they were numerous and the fact they're numerous uh creates uh wage pressure which is a positive force from the perspective of of improving opportunity or these labor market conditions for less educated non-college adults this was abetted by the aging of the population age old age dependency ratios means the ratio of p people aged 65 plus to 16 to 64. our rising steeply the us much less than other countries but even so it was anticipated that between 2020 and 2050 we would have moved from an age to dependency ratio of about 26 to about 36 uh and you can see if you look at the age distribution of the us uh population between 2000 and 2020 how much of the mass has moved from the working age gears that's the red line with the peak in the middle uh to senior adults out of the prime age work okay so that was the stage uh setting the stage and the expectation was this combination of rising demand for these uh uh typically low education services the aging population uh slow uh uh population growth or small slow entry of uh of new workers and curtailed immigration all of which would create a high pressure labor market for uh non-college workers and that is better than a low-pressure labor market from the point of view of wage growth and employment rates so why might the post-covered labor market look different even let's imagine that you know we all began to return to work today uh well i think there are there are six factors uh one is there's going to be a penumbra of risk surrounding many in-person services until there is a reliable vaccine and so that will cause just a de-densification of workplaces of shopping malls of restaurants and so that will change at least in the short medium term the demand for many activities more profoundly i think this is going to be an automation accelerating or an automation forcing event of course we've had uh you know a proliferation of artificial intelligence of robotics of online services into work um but this will speed that up uh and i'm speaking with folks today saying you know people who are running factories are discovering you know they're running within uh you know 15 or 20 of their previous workforce they're finding they can get more much more done than they thought they could obviously we're discovering we could do many more things online remotely than we thought we could and that lesson those lessons will not be unlearned so i think that this period of labor withdrawal despite uh even within you know without a necessary withdrawal of demand means that when we get back to work firms will organize differently and it will likely be less intense labor-intensive a third factor that i think will prove quite important is in the us economy and in fact in many advanced economies over the last 30 years we've seen a reallocation of sales and value added towards larger firms now some call this the superstar firms phenomenon uh and uh larger firms are often more productive they're often more profitable but they are less labor intensive a larger share of their value added is paid to shareholders to capital to profits and less to workers and so because this crisis is very likely to weed out many small and medium-sized firms which are less capitalized they have less savings they have less access to capital markets when when the tide recedes uh we will find that the firms that are left standing are the larger ones and that will likely cause a permanent downward shift in labor's share of national income of a couple of percentage points one or two percentage points there's no reason to think that we will quickly rebound from that so we will accelerate a process that was underway a fourth factor is a likely change in demand for services that i expect some of them will be quite durable changes i think it's very likely that we will see reduced business travel many people have learned that you know you don't really need to show up anymore uh and this will lead to a decline in the hospitality sector to some extent and recognizing that business travelers they are the ones who pay you know pay for the prop who basically make airlines profitable that make hotels profitable by paying full fare on weekdays uh they go to expensive restaurants on expense accounts and so on and a lot of the tourism industry is kind of supported by the kind of layer of profits that comes from business travel so if there is reduction in business travel that will affect demand for restaurant workers hotel workers transportation workers all kinds of cleaning services this will affect service demand second of all secondly a rise in telecommuting will also cause reduced demand for many of these cleaning services security even people going out to lunch during the work day uh and i expect that we will learn to telecommunicate telling telecommute more uh based on our few months uh cooped up at home finally and this is does not take a crystal ball the retail sector you know which was already contracting is uh is shrinking very rapidly we've seen a number of high-profile bankruptcies uh retail sector employment provides millions of not very low wage not very high paid jobs but still many millions of jobs i think that process will be uh of contraction will be vastly accelerated so uh to conclude this ongoing wage pressure in low paid services that i at least was confidently forecasting i am not confident about anymore uh the uh forces uh you know these multiple forces are going to cause employment in those activities to shrink more rapidly than we would have anticipated um one wild card here i think that i don't have much insight into it but i do think it's worth considering is whether we're going to see a rise in early retirement uh where many people older workers who have left the labor force during this crisis may not return uh it's not uh in other crises we said oh that people couldn't afford to retire uh because their savings have been wiped out at present actually the stock market has not lost nearly as much value as you would expect given all these other forces so it's possible that that there will in fact be a movement into retirement if so that will also change labor demand that actually will create additional demand for prime age workers uh who are still around so uh uh i think i'll just conclude by saying uh it's unlikely that the post covered labor market will immediately return or even necessarily ever return to the trend we were on uh in the pre-covered labor market uh but in the best case scenario many workers will be recalled and uh and as this reallocation occurs we'll hopefully make the most of the opportunity to retrain people and help target them to the emerging opportunities that come about
