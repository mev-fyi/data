uh this is claudia golden and it is august 5th right and i'm in my lid tower office with gary becker of the university of chicago and with my friend larry katz gary about um mainly about the bureau but he can meant it to whatever he wants so you were talking about something having to do with the history of the bureau you said something about you know the history of the bureau up until i wanted to continue that up until left uh yeah yeah and um and i think moved john my move moved it to new haven for a while and then eventually to cambridge but i you know i first became familiar with the bureau through milton friedman when i was a graduate student so i knew a lot about the bureau for a graduate student anyway uh while i was at chicago and it's great empirical tradition which the bureau was i mean um burn burns and mitchell basically anti theoretical uh even though burns taught a course at columbia on theory but he taught it in the form of you know look at these assumptions look at these assumptions in a negative fashion and it turned people off of theory even though burns himself was a was a competent theorist and a marshallian type theorist so the bureau developed a strong condition by the time i came there a very empirical very careful work which was not the standards of the profession at that time which was largely non-empirical or if it was imperative or sloppy empirical the nbr always had if you had a research assistant and they had to compile data they would have another research assistant who would be looking at the data and the other person would be reading out a very careful procedure to make sure of accuracy and as i say i think of one thing at the bureau in those days it was a great emphasis on quantitative work that was accurate that you could trust and i always would say any number that jeffrey moore for example ever told me i would have 100 confidence in that number he wouldn't give a number unless you know he had checked it uh very carefully but the downside of that from my perspective was there was kind of an anti-theoretical orientation at the bureau and that eventually began to change i'll stop here maybe you have something you want to direct so what i mean i could go on would be obviously the person who linked the theoretical and the empirical and imperial projects was milton friedman you know your advisor was the fact that he was chicago and not that involved their day-to-day meant he didn't affect you know what actually happened at nbr because clearly his projects you know from income from independent professional practice to monetary history clearly combined the two yes income from independent professional practice as you know i don't know if you know the history of that that started out as a study by simon kuznets right with some data on uh on doctors earnings from 29 through 33 years i think approximately milton friedman that was brought in and it became his doctoral dissertation and you can see even in the early in the introduction to the independent in the book they say what friedman did and what cousins did and freeman brought into the study a lot of analytical techniques and particularly the um i would say two things in particular um it was a human capital analysis so he looked at discounted earnings and it will he introduced a permanent transitory distinction which started there and then he applied it to the um consumption function that started and so i always thought the study on income independent professional practice was perhaps the greatest empirical study of its time in the sense that it was careful empirical and it had an analytical analysis and it was a great book i mean it was terribly reviewed in the american economic review i once checked that when i wrote an essay about friedman why waste your time on this little problem was the basic um reviewer so it never got the reception that it deserved but to me reading it as a graduate student i always thought it was a great a great book and i think it stands as a really a great book for anybody who comes across it now um but as you said larry they he combined theory and empirical um in in not only in that book but to some extent in his monetary history with anna schwartz anna was the more empirical person she was a very careful worker um knew monetary history very well milton really until very late didn't really know monetary history that well i mean he learned it in the course of doing it and i think anna learned it in the course of julian yeah i think that there was this magic moment when they thought they finished the book brought it to princeton had it read by someone and the person said this could be a monetary history and then anna went and got out of the library you know hundreds of books read them summarize them yeah it could be i don't you know you know that better than i do um but she eventually knew more monetary history than mil mcmillan learned a fair amount and i think partly and directly through anna really and but maybe partly on his own reason uh but when i came to the bureau uh the way i came to the bureau that might be relevant i was thinking of ex i didn't have a lot of offers i had one from columbia i mean i wanted to be on the east coast it really only had colombia uh columbia made me an offer this is in 56 years 56 i think i went there in 57 i'd been an assistant professor at chicago for three years and chicago actually offered me more money to stay uh but i wanted to leave chicago to get on my own more and so i wanted to be on the east coast for various family reasons and it wasn't a huge market i mean johns hopkins i interviewed with they decided not to make me norfolk but columbia did and then i you know it's sort of through my milk connection with milton the national hero came in and i said i would like to be connected with the national bureau it's important to me as part of colombia and they asked me what i would like to work on i said i'd like to work on calculating the rates of return on it on education i mean so what i suggested was a very empirical project and uh saul fabricators then director research went out and raised 37 500 from the carnegie corporation when john gardner i don't know if you know that name was head of the carnegie corporation he was always very proud that he supported this early study it was a very small brand but it was just for me and a research assistant a little they gave me three thousand dollars a year a salary um and i started out entirely as an empirical study uh you know there at chicago ted schultz was working on human capital so human capital was was known there was some work by some others going on but i thought the empirical work on that had not really been done carefully enough in terms of estimating the return so i started getting data and thinking about it the more i began to think about the problem the more it occurred to me that it offered a fairly unified way of understanding a lot of labor market issues and so i began to think of on the job not only the role of education and earnings but also on the job training general and specific training uh who paid for the training is an issue i got i i got into stuff from the military the consequences for inequality a lot of theoretical issues that i see it opened up that this approach opened up so i altered the project i still had a well for me at least a big empirical section on you know the imper on estimating the rate of return the first half of the book was basically theory and then the second half of the book was testing the theory but mainly it was empirical they had some relation to the to the theory because a lot of the on-the-job stuff i didn't try to test um and took a long time before we came and we still don't know that much about it but um i did do a lot of work on the empirical side and the first paper i reported out on that book arthur burns asked me to present a paper at a meeting of the american economic association on some of the empirical results which i did do that and i it was eventually published in the proceedings called under investment in education question mark and i made calculations of the rate of return on education and compared it with some data that stigler had put together for the national bureau on rates return on physical capital and i concluded there was no obvious evidence that there was under investment in in education i looked at the externality issue some tried to make some calculations of what it could be and if there were these externalities what would be where they would be so i did a little work on that at the time mainly again empirical but a little bit of a theory um and then we had this um but and i got encouraged i wasn't discouraged from working on the theory even though the bureau let me give you a little more of other people when i when i came i would go to the bureau certainly every friday and often in second day a week i would only go to columbia like three days a week i lived out in the suburbs and i would go at least one day often two days to the bureau so what yeah i got to know everybody at the beginning with the columbus circle the euro was at 39th and madison i don't know what that's no that wasn't columbus or no the columbus circle was the original eventually they moved into this fancy office building they had i think it was the 11th floor they had one whole floor of an office building was just an office building really and they rented they had a very good long-term rental contract so from my perspective it was good i would take the train you could take the train from uh suburbs i was living in scarsdale and you'd be very at grand central you'd be very close to to the bureau so i would go in a lot got to know the people there interacted with some of them very very uh very closely so which people i interacted with well of course it depends i mean the years are a little bit emerge in my head but the people i had was close with was jacob mincer he spent one year while i first came to beer he spent a year at chicago as a postdoc schultz bargained with him too tightly and he decided not to take he was offered a chicago assistant professor decided to come back to new york where his wife had a good position at montefiore hospital and so he and i would interact a lot even when he was at city college and we brought him into colombia we interacted even more we ran a workshop together which was a really very good workshop and we were at the bureau together so we never published anything together although we did but we did do a paper together which we should have published really it was kind of a perfect kind of rational expectations model the consumption function but limited by the assumption of perfect certainty that people could look ahead and it's a perfect foresight a perfect foresight model of consumption and i was a little bit bothered we didn't quite get the timing right so we put it aside but we should have we should have published the paper it wasn't really quite uh as i look at it in retrospect a very good paper that was the only thing we ever did together but we indirectly told me a little bit about tommy jacob okay he said that he that you divided it up now you must have both been in new york at the time but somehow we were both in the yeah we mailed you a copy and um maybe the mails weren't working very well i can't remember yeah i can't remember not too long ago i had found a guy no it was something certainly we should have published there would have been a good thing bob hall published well yeah and he had uncertainty in it and so but basically it was the same sort of thing with uh you know people make a i'm certainly relevant of course for these problems a lot of the rational expectations stuff you get the essence out of it in perfectly certain situations the uncertainty adds interesting questions because the world is not perfectly certain and things don't don't fully explain anyway anyway that's what we had so we never wrote anything but we interacted a lot victor fuchs when i first met victor fuchs i mean he was a teaching at general studies he seemed like he was a columbia phd like one of these big nice guys who i mean i didn't take very seriously to tell you the truth but i liked him i mean he was a nice person and then he went to the ford foundation for two years and usually you get ruined by going to a foundation but he came back much better than ever i mean he went to the ford foundation not as a research fellow but as a program officer that's what he was doing but it led him to think about a lot of problems health and so on right and you came back as a ball of fire had um after that he had a lot of ideas brimming with ideas so he and i began to interact a a a great deal then we i i got some money i don't remember how i brought in some education fellows for a year um sherwin came in for a year got to know him albert fischel you wouldn't think of associating him with it but he came in for he was working on 19th century education at the time and i inter i brought him in and i interacted with him a lot and i'm still on good terms without how it although his interests have shifted sri gurillagus came in on a different sort of fellowship for years i interacted with him closely um this is in the early 60s this was in the 60s yeah i can't i can't remember the time i you know i came to the bureau from 57 and i left around 69 terms of physically and so it took place over that period sherwin probably came in the early 60s to the bureau of he came in in i think in the early 60s we made sven alfred columbia but he decided to go back to chicago he didn't accept it rosa went back to rochester rosen was going nowhere at rochester they were about to dump him this might be relevant for your study because his work at the national bureau really got him excited he did this book with nedery on dynamic models of labor market maybe it wasn't great but it was at that for this for that time it was innovative got him had a lot of other ideas so he went back to rochester brimming with ideas and eventually you know he became one of their stars right and in the profession and they made him a chair professor and so on but he was very close to being uh thrown out of rochester his work was going slowly so sherman was a slow deep thinking the bureau was a great period for me he always said that was a great period for him um and he he came to our workshop i think i had a big influence on him at that time um and gradually the bureau began to change a little very little i proposed to arthur burns sometime in the early 60s we start a program in law and economics or mid-60s he turned me down now arthur burns you asked me somewhere about arthur burns you know he was like a mentor to me he liked me a lot he gave me good advice i spent i mean he socially invited us to his house he came to our house and when you went in to see arthur burns it was like going into a black hole you were there for an hour and a half or so and he loved to talk and and so on and you know sometimes i'd be trying to catch a train to go back and keep talking and talking but he was a great important influence on me i liked arthur a lot a very smart man and he was very sympathetic to my work but he didn't want the bureau he added the old conception of the bureau stay within your confines he was not somebody who saw any view of expanding economics what the bureau would deal with so while he was quite receptive to the human capital work he could see that um but the law and economic stuff he turned down we did eventually get i think the first law on economics program anywhere in the world which i did start and you know we brought in brought in two major people on it bill anders and dick poser and they were both connected with the national bureau law and economics project and we had other people isaac erlich what was a graduate school so how did you manage to do this given that burns was again well he was first against it you know you're aware we came back again with now fuchs supporting it and um you know they changed their mind exactly why i i can't i don't i don't know what went on in burns right maybe he can see that this was a field rising he became more convinced of it we had other we had we had future want to do health economics we started one maybe the first major health economics project not me victor was victor who started that and i think a very dynamic project going on there on health economics and eventually we put it together in a center for instant i forgot what it was called economic and social something that victor fuchs became the first director of it had victor me jacob bill anders dick posner fine as well i had a i mean a great collection of people in it who all had some affiliation with the bureau some of them through the graduate program at city university which where victor finally went where finest welch went when landis went my grossman came jim smith and a couple of other people it really was a top group for about four or five years when it completely disintegrated but at one time that a really outstanding group of people all of whom pretty much were connected with the also with the nbr and the graduate center was located on 42nd street you know some old uh department store or something i don't remember what they took off they took over some building you might know better but there was some building they took over it was very close to the nbr which was 39th and madison they were 42nd around 5th and 6th i don't remember where so it would be easy for for them to come over it was much harder to come from colombia down but occasionally i would do both in the same day and take a taxi down from columbia to the bureau well i i can go on but maybe you have something specific i i i think going on is very good um we talked about a lot of the people that you uh you uh spoke with at the bureau finest for example so farnas was around there quite a bit he was around and the end of my stay there but he was around yeah definitely yeah and of course victor and others uh and then there was this uh this group of people whom you brought in through this raising of some some funds like sherwin yeah we had some i forgot how we got we had some postdoc funds yeah right and that was very good um and um uh and occasionally you would talk to burns and and and burns was very supportive of the human capital stuff um didn't much of the bureau at new york was involved in the business cycle research stuff but they they were sort of separate and you didn't really talk to them they were very often when i came well pretty much all the bureau was a business stuff pretty much all right um no i spoke i entered i knew them all and i would interact with some of them remember ruth mack of course i knew ruth mack yeah she had done an early study was it on inventories i think i think so boots and shoes and leather yeah right yeah i know i knew ruth neck very well she would come in um she had a little independent income so she had uh she was kind of well well to do she would come in i knew her very well it would interact with her she was very empirical very empirical i mean she didn't you know there were a bunch of people i would say didn't really know economics in any solid way thor holtman you may never even have heard of her i mean very empirical for hulkman was also the bureau was a great place for misfits thought holden as a person was a misfit he couldn't communicate couldn't interact with people but he was great for the bureau and the bureau the great thing about the bureau was i think it has to be said was the bureau was willing to hire minorities of all types jews you know they gave a place for a lot of jews arthur burns was jewish and wesley mitchell was a very fair-minded person and he he didn't care what your background was so a lot of jews found employment at the national bureau saw fabricant who was director research when i was there and it was it was a very good guy i like saul simon simon of course yeah he was already at pennsylvania when i was there he would come in so i got to know him a little bit i can't say very well and i had one little run in with him that he wasn't happy about which we can go into him yeah which i'll mention uh but so yeah i knew of course i knew his work and had a lot of respect for him milton told me some about him and from the bureau and he would come in occasionally but i didn't interact ray goldsmith you know that now yeah i know the wells fargo he came in a lot i got to know him pretty well he was doing his wealth of these wealth estimates i i guess the other person i don't know where he was but who published a book at least during your period that seems to possibly relate it was clarence long clarence long i knew him slightly because he he may have been working he eventually became a member of the house of representatives right and um left academia but i knew his book and i knew him i don't remember if he i think i think he started his book quite a bit before i actually got there may have come out publication yeah but it had a long gestation period and so he was working on that and i knew about it where i'd read much of his book and i thought it was very interesting i think it had an influence on jacob who you know it's famous paper yeah because when jacob said that when he went to chicago al reece uh he he took al and greg's labor course because when when jacob arrived to chicago they declared that he was a labor economist and he said but i don't know any labor and considered it an insult anyhow he said well i'll tell you a story about that too that might be interesting so he um he took their he took their courses and they they uh already spent you know much of a semester talking about you know clarence long's work oh did he okay and uh and he and greg uh what maybe this was in a workshop because the way jacob tells it is he he and greg greg would would debate well how could this be how could we resolve this and and jacob said that this was one of the magical moments of his life when he said oh i can resolve it could be i don't know i wasn't there at the time yeah but certainly um there were people at chicago family well because margaret reid doctoral dissertation dealt with household production in a in in an important way was act is really an unsung book i think it was a good book in a lot of ways uh but if you look labor let me just tell you this very briefly this story about later economics in chicago when i came to chicago i'd come from princeton which had a industrial relations tradition richard lester um mainly who i liked a lot but uh was very empirical which was good because most of the profession wasn't empirical but didn't really know a heck of a lot of economics i would say but did these empirical studies of whether you know whether workers got their marginal product things of that type which i think were valuable in the profession although they didn't get a lot of credit anyway labor economics at princeton all the worst student students went into labor economics so i didn't take any later economics courses when i even when i came to chicago i sat in on greg's course i didn't take it but i did sit in on it religiously and i began to see that late it was very important course for me because it was analytical as well as empirical as a combination but when i was in my second or third year already came to me i and i started work on discrimination he said well you know gary we in the industrial relations center would like to offer you a fellowship i'd had a fellowship he said we'd like to offer you another fellowship because you're now working in labor you know i said i got really upset i said look i'm not working in laser economics i did tell them that i said i'm working in applied price theory al was very nice i mean what i said was stupid i was nice she said whatever you want to call it we're willing to so it turned out when i went to columbia i was replacing leo wallman teaching labor economics which i did do for one one or two years only and then jacob came and did and i i didn't teach it any longer but um at the bureau what i began to see i knew all these people thor holdgren see harry kahn ruth mack victor schwartz victor's honoris knew him very well anybody you can mention without the viewer i knew them well but i'd go in a lot and i'd go all the seminars i'd go around sure i knew them all i had good term i was on good terms with all them uh my first seminar i gave the bureau on my own work i made it very very empirical and i thought it was a poor seminar because i was i felt i wasn't doing my comparative advantage i mean to talk about this now and they weren't that into they started telling me well what are some of the bigger issues you're talking about i mean which is what i was interested in so after that i learned my lesson and i spoke what i wanted to uh but the bureau was very empirical had some very good people very careful as i said but for my tastes not enough analysis and so i began to push as i got increasing influence in more analysis so on the first philanthropy study they had with frank dickinson which was very important i wrote a little paper on how to look upon this from a theoretical point of view with altruism and things of that type and when they had any other areas i say well look look at the theory of this in my own work i began to report on some of the theoretical aspects and i found these people were interested in that even though they were they were highly embargoed so the bureau maintained its strong empirical bent while it was in new york but gradually also began to allow more you know more theory it was still measurement and so on careful measurement but more theory was involved they approved the law and economics project they improved the center the victor headed up not only approved it they they were they thought it was good for the bureau so we began to uh and they and the business cycle stuff began to become relatively less important at the bureau i mean still he had these people working on it was still important but it its expansion was in other areas it's not so much they contracted that work but they began to expand in these other areas so from a relative point of view because it became definitely less important so i assume a question of a couple of projects in the you know bureau that seem there's this 1960 volume in which your first at least what i think of as the first paper on the economic theory of fertility oh yeah comes in what's the story of that volume and your involvement in it and was that done separately or was it part of a bureau project my paper was not really officially part of any bureau project i had no fertility project at the bureau it's something i was actually when i came and suggested i work on human capital for the bureau to me this was just a project to get the bureau of support my first interest at that time was fertility and population of course my interest i was stayed interested in that problem but i gradually became really interested in human capital it was sort of uh my way to earn money be connected with the bureau so that the fertility stuff i did on my own now it was one of these bureau conference volumes but the bureau conference volume had a different type of life than a regular bureau bomb a regular bureau volume you know was done at the bureau he had to go through this difficult bureau process which held up the income from independent professional practices for several years because of this one a board member who didn't like the conclusions about the medical profession i held up george's stigler's work on engineers because of some work and so on he but he had to go through a good pro process a difficult problem the vi conference minds were of a different nature so and so i i don't remember how i got into doing this but i i did this paper on fertility which conference was held at princeton actually not physically at the nbr i went down to princeton and the paper was not well received i mean it was attacked a lot by duesenberry who was my discussion by most of the audience and my i had two defenders friedman and kuznets i'm pretty sure cousins was at that conference i know he at least they they defended that this wasn't stupid you know and so it was well worth doing um but everybody else autonomous as well as sociology are very much opposed to it so but well i wouldn't identify that with a bureau project i may have done it on bureau i didn't keep track carefully but it was never officially sponsored by the bureau none of my population work was ever officially sponsored by the bureau though it came out in this nbr uh conference and then there's this in 62 this amazing jpe issue your work on human capital jacobs george stigler's sort of you know human capital approach to thinking about information in the labor market shaw stats paper on migration which is a bureau it's listed as a bureau um something linked to the bureau what was the story maybe but i would say i would give credit for that more to it wasn't ted schultz yet i would give him the credit for putting it together um there was not enough it may have been some bureau connection but again it was not a bureau of projects which are the universities i think it was the university yes one of the universities yeah that's what it was one of those universities those were those were done differently yeah my work was real bureau work jacob's work was real bureau work jacob got interested in that through our workshop really and i presented some of the theory and he saw how to get some measurements out of it so he had this important paper there shotsteps work on migration had nothing to do with the bureau george stiegler's work on information he never finally i know published any of that really for the bureau that was independent work they did at chicago salmon mushkin had some work on health which is not a bureau work but i would give ted a lot of credit for putting that volume together um and it was not officially a bureau volume although it is in this universities and yeah so the bureau had to you know be willing to go along with it in some sense but conference are outs other people but a good fraction of that volume this was bureau or me and you look at pages probably we're close to half that volume yeah something like that so it wasn't in that sense an important part but it was ted schultz i was in constant communication with ted when i was doing my human capital stuff we had a lot of interaction uh back and forth and i got a lot out of ted i give i gave a couple reports in chicago ted was unhappy with my first paper on under investment in human claiming there wasn't and he had obvious evidence about under investment human capital he said oh you know you're just trying to be too free mark i never saw ted get annoyed i never saw dad get annoyed at me he really did always i was one of his fair-haired boys he treated me very well and i wrote him back look ted i said this is what the evidence looks like i don't feel i'm i'm advising in any way if you can show me any way where it's bias i'll be glad to change it eventually i mean he eventually bought a lot of what of it but his initial reaction was very negative but ted shulls was very important for me for that volume clearly he put it uh together um and um well he was not connected with the bureau as i said me and to essex and jacob but i was in very close contact with hitchcock over that whole period of time and george um was at the bureau uh at the same time right so well yes and no um george was uh one of the reasons i came to columbus i didn't have any other office but uh so i didn't have a big choice chicago yeah chicago i wanted to leave chicago um although if i had no office i would have stayed at chicago but i well one of the reasons was george stiglitz being there i didn't know him well but through milton i i'd known george i sent george a copy of my discrimination uh work and he gave me one useful piece of advice which i did follow an important piece of advice um but i i remind him a lot and i wanted to uh i mean he was a big attractor he happened to be on leave when i came to columbia at the center and he never came back to columbia he went from the center to chicago i remember i wrote him a letter maybe a little bit on the presumptuous side i spoke to him about it lately later i said look george if you come back to columbia i will stay in columbia well he eventually told me um this is maybe off the record because it's chewing my own horn a little bit i don't want to this but that if he had known how important i would become he might have come to come back so i don't think it had any influence on him colombia made a terrible mistake in bargaining with him as colombia made many mistakes um and i think his inclination was to come back but he got a very good offer from chicago and he would have been willing to accept less money from colombia but they kind of insulted him in a way and he didn't come back so i never interacted with him so from that point on he had it maybe for a while a bureau connection with a distant bureau connection he he was affiliated i'm sure from several years subsequently maybe many years i don't remember but he didn't come in physically very much i corresponded with him i knew him and i would send him a lot of my stuff and he would send me comments on but not because i physically interacted with him much in new york only very occasionally would he be you know with milton being would come in very occasionally to talk about the monetary history with anna but he wasn't in very much summers a little bit in the summer he got a new hampshire and you know he'd come in so he wouldn't be around a lot when he was around i usually met him because you know he was although greg was my chairman of my committee uh and i was very close greg and milton were the two people i was closest to so i was very close to milton and so i would make an effort to see him and he would see me when he when he came in he visited colombia in 64. we tried to get him to stay he thought about it seriously but decided not to stay went back to chicago at that time so he spent a whole year at in new york and he was at columbia more during that year what about students columbia students working at the as research assistants so the bureau always had this tradition of having research assistants who were many of whom were not graduate students they were just smart undergraduates who came on and went to graduate school later but this was a it seems to me that this was and tell me if this is the case a new transition in which you had your your graduate students who were working on their dissertations working at the bureau rather than people like bob libsy for example who was a columbia graduate student but he was he needed uh full-time money so he was working at the bureau yeah he came full time yes i don't know if i started the tradition but i certainly was one of the prime pushers i thought it was great for graduate students to be connected with the bureau to get involved in a project and sometimes they could get their thesis out of it or it would be related to the thesis or just be an interesting product so i began to bring pretty much all my top graduate students to into work at the bureau i was able to get them positions so if you list think of the students i had um pretty much all of them isaac ehrlich gilbert guess mike grossman um bob michael bill landis barry chiswick i mean i i i mean all these people are pretty sure maybe i'm making and some others worked at the national bureau and some others a number of them had major bureau books and some of them came out with major bureau books like bob michael and mike grossman each published these monographs which were really extensions of their dissertations mike's stuff on health capital as his association at columbia she did partly at the bureau and bob's study on productivity in the household sector was his dissertation at columbia um isaac proud in his lawn economics book that landis and i edited for the bureau um isaac had his one of his papers in there so he he definitely worked at the bureau guess well guess and i the book we did i don't know was it was it a bureaucratic example i think it's a bureau book yeah he worked at the bureau because it was actually he's one of the unfortunate cases he was one of the top students of his cohort and he just never he had too many mental problems just never never made it but he was a really good student and he was there arlene leibowitz worked at the bureau i'm sure a bunch of others but we did that jacob did it too and all the burns never really did it he didn't have any graduate students when i was there to speak up so yeah we began to do that it was great for the graduate students it was a great experience for them and it was good to get good research assistance and for in the areas where we were working instead of getting these outside undergrads my first assistant at the my education human capital study was just a smart young uh girl who was a graduate of one of the you know seven women's colleges were very didn't know any economics but she was a good assistant to me and that was the tradition then you got these people and some of whom you know some of the research assistants were 65 years old if you look at the people working around the bureau there'd be these old people a lot of women bureau was an employer of women when women couldn't get good jobs so again i was hiring a minorities one of the important things to be said about the bureau was they hide women and not just yet you know and richard's decision you mentioned ruth mack anna schwartz and there are other other women who were regular you know uh researchers at the bureau but there were a lot of older women working there many of whom i got to know edith kuznets was um a research assistant there and that's how she met oh maybe yeah it could be um i don't i didn't know her that was long before gerard bree did you know the name gerhard bree he brought some empirical studies for the bureau may not even know he worked very much with brie and there was a woman forgot her name now who worked for years at the bureau was a co-author was more than just a research assistant became a co-author with him on that so she was there a long time anna had some old timers working for her victor zanowitz there were a lot of old timers working there who had been around for years i mean many of them as i said could not fit in with a regular business type organization so the bureau hired misfits this may sound strange but it was great for the bureau they were cheap they were often good and they you know uh gave them jobs and it was good for the bureau so the bureau in that respect i think was a very important organization i think wesley mitchell set the tone on that wesley mitchell was a very fair amount i didn't know wesley mitchell but he was a very from everything a very fair-minded honest individual and he was willing to hire anybody who was good and his his wife was an accomplished she was accomplished i once read a biography of the mitchells and uh she wasn't she actually i think had a little money even maybe and um you know wesley mitchell got a specie from the university of chicago as one of the first phd students at the university of chicago wrote a very good study on greenbacks during the civil war and very important empirical study and um so he was very important uh i mean other people like milton will know a lot more about mitchell and i would but he was uh but yeah i said he set this tone of non-discrimination hiring the best people you could get and that meant a lot of jews women and a lot of people who were who were oddballs who could work at the bureau but they couldn't fit into a regular type of organization did you notice in the mid-60s that there was any uh dissent about arthur i mean this something did happen in the 60s that led to the change and an author um had these various opportunities to uh yeah you know to be an ambassador for example you know a little bit about that there was a lot of unhappiness at the bureau when arthur accepted the chairmanship of the council of economic advisers on eisenhower that was his first move out i think he accepted that before i came to the bureau but he was he was there when i came to the bureau because i came went down to washington he offered me a position on the council but he said if he was me he wouldn't take that he would go to come in academic go to colombia and had to columbia office if i was you i would take the columbia offer i think you'll do better in that office so he was he was away at the time he came back to the bureau and he became the president a new title they made created for him president he was clearly the boss i mean he is the strongest personality strongest mind compared to people like moore and fabric kanye was just more more able and more forceful than they were and but then he began you know andy for a while starting like when he came back i don't know 58 i don't remember his next seven years he was very important exercising i said he if he turned down the law and economics he pushed the study of the soviet economy by nutter and we had a meeting about and i opposed it i said it's too far removed from what we our competence in and uh i and i said so why should we be going into this and burns are well the rockefeller brothers i think were the ones financing it and that he said it and so i mean my opposition to me i mean it wasn't a vote you know other people oppose it but he decided to go and i think in retrospect he was right i think it was an important study because um you know nada didn't know russian i think he put together gail johnson arcadius kahan and other people who were active in it and i think they they were much closer to the truth and a lot of the estimates that were being made about growth and so on so i think that was an important study but he exercised a very strong will but then he began to tire of it he began to get more in politics you know and they were then looking for a new director and there was nobody natural within the new york office it may they may he may have asked me i think he did and i said i wasn't interested in becoming director i think they asked george stigler and stigler thought about it for a while and i think he would have accepted it if it had been the right terms i don't know the history of that 100 but eventually he wanted to do something like that stiga but eventually he turned it down and then maybe they never even made him an official offer so they had nobody to do and that's when they brought john meyer in that's what year was 66. well you would know the year but and maya i never thought he was a good again he's off the record i never thought he was a good head of the bureau um he would come in he was then at yale i believe he would come in and i don't think he knew what direction he wanted it to go in and so on he didn't bother our center he supported us but i wasn't i i didn't think he was good on the other end i saw the problem there's no natural person in the new york office who could head up the bureau but so was her unhappiness with arthur i don't know he dominated everybody there was no room for on it you know i mean i don't know what saul fabricant and jeffrey moore thought of father but they worshipped him um people like me and jacob and victor well arthur wasn't bothering us so we continued to do and have increasing influence in what was being done and eventually arthur kind of you know pulled himself out he was not happy with my the choice of maya when it eventually worked out he was not happy to weigh my worked out i know that because he had told me that but he he began to take a lesson left i think he went i said ambassador he went to the board at that point he went to the board yeah he became ambassador much later after he was on the federal reserve yeah much later ambassador german but that was much much much later so when he was on the board of course he may have asked the bureau to prepare some numbers for him um as some other government agencies did um the leading indicators were the bureau the bureau started leading india jeffrey moore and arthur burns really started it and jeffrey moore took it over and eventually the government took over what the bureau had pioneered eventually the government privatized it yeah eventually privatize it again exactly uh so he may have asked the bureau to you know compute various numbers for him when he was chairman but that i don't know i wasn't involved in that so was there an heavy witness with arthur probably but that i don't think played a role in any of the these type of the series he dominated the board he dominated everybody around there uh and he was a other burns you never probably never knew him was a very forceful i didn't know him oh you did late in his life and he he um uh i was charmed by arthur and i was told that all women are charmed by and men are dominated by him well he had a very strong personality he had a very strong personality he once told me again i don't know if this should be for public statement uh that when he went to washington he said he felt with he said there were a lot of economists in washington how to do he said he felt he could tie one hand behind his back and handle all the economies and he did he was a very important when he was with the council and so on he had a very and at the federal reserve he dominated the washington economic government economic scene so he's a very strong person very smart i had a lot of respect for arthur burns um and the only things i was down on him about his two anti-theory i think that was a mistake and he and that's why he created that tradition at columbia on the people he taught and he had a two conventional view of what economics should be should be like but to his credit he eventually began to support our work for those but otherwise i know i was i was a big fan of arthur burns okay did we answer for all the questions there was something you were going to come back to but i forget what it is about kuznets right oh well a small thing but it might be interesting the bureau had the policy it was a policy wasn't just a tradition it was a policy that if anybody submitted the manuscript would have to be read by two to three bureau senior staff members so simon cosen submitted a manuscript on long-term investment i mean i you would know what he did better but there's something like that and i was asked to read it as one of the three readers i spent a lot of time reading it and wrote a like an eight page report a very critical of some of it and i said oh well he puts together some interesting data but then he has the last chapter of speculation i said there's absolutely no connection between the speculation and the date he compiled and i tried to demonstrate that i said well the speculation that may be interesting it gives the impressions it's following from his data collection and there's no connection here and i i went through case by case cited it and i said look this is what he finds this is what he's speculating about how can you go from this to that i said so i think i mean i was then it was early i was probably i was still in my 20s i mean and i said i think this thing has to be rewritten to do so so so i sent it into arthur an author sent it on to cousins and i heard from other cousins hit the ceiling who's this young upstarter he's telling him what he should be doing and so on and i don't know how much changes he ever made i mean cousins was already an important economist how much he made so i i think kuznets when he first met me kind of had an uh after that a negative view but eventually he began he and i began to be friendly and we would always speak about things and um when he retired from harvard so mckay he was telling me how don't retire he said he had to retire because those are the old rules don't retire he said retirement is a real problem you don't know what to do with half your time now yet you're on committees and so on before you can only do research a certain number of hours a day i mean i thought it was very good advice um maybe i fouled that advice in my own career um as long as you're active and so on as he was i think retirement was not a good option for him he should have continued as full-time um uh so i you know i had good relations with kuznetsov eventually but i know he was very unhappy over this report on the other hand i think in retrospect my report was right i mean i think what the points i made were right and i think there was a tendency sometimes of what simon wrote to have a weak connection between some you might say the theory or the speculations and the data side and um i think it was worth pointing that out in in in this bureau volume so um uh i mean i i wouldn't retract what what what i've said maybe being young i would have said it in a more tactful fashion now and uh but i think what i i think i was actually i was right on that point he eventually we we got we had good relation but i wouldn't say i was ever really close with him because he was at penn and he went to hopkins and he went to harvard and he you know as coming into the bureau became less and less frequent right in some sense in some ironic sense simon was probably more theoretical than anyone at the bureau until uh the mid 50s when you and jacob absolutely he had a strong theoretical benefit to him um he did a lot of interesting projects he was interested in human capital you read some of this stuff on growth interesting um big blow-ups at the bureau way before you arrived was when he proposed to burns to have a comparative economic growth project in 47 i think when burns just took over from mitchell and versus absolutely not and and simon essentially leaves the bureau in many ways well not only for that reason yeah you know they were competitors for the direct for the head and burns one out and i think that was one of the reasons that's the unspoken thing no one ever said yeah right i think there's no question that was true that there were competitors for that position but there there was an animus between the two of them that no one could put their finger on but a true animus that is there's no question um i had to make one slip small experience about that we're going to run out of tape in the middle of this but that's so all right well this is not that important yeah but you and larry may be interested i was preparing a session for the american economic association on some topic and burns had asked me to prepare it burns was then present the association and i suggested to burns that i was going to invite simon kuznets he said well yes he'd be good for that but if you invited him he won't accept he said i'll i i better that i give him a call and invite him because um you know you're just a young guy status is important to cousins so he didn't call him he did invite him he did accept and he was on him so i read between the lines at that time from just the way burns said what burns said that there was something and then i heard about this that there were competitors right for mitchell so they were competitors you know a lot of people competitors in every profession when they're a comparable age they were both foreign born came over as immigrants to this country and so they had similar backgrounds in a lot of ways although they passed diverged let me turn this off now point i'm sorry that charlie had to leave because i think this is a point he would have made maybe mickey will have something to say about it which is that um that there are spillovers from however we want to think about corruption there are spillovers from it to social relations that if politicians are believed to be venal if business is believed to be corrupt and venal then what are people's relationships to each other what are people's relationships to the state do they pay their taxes do they pick up uh
