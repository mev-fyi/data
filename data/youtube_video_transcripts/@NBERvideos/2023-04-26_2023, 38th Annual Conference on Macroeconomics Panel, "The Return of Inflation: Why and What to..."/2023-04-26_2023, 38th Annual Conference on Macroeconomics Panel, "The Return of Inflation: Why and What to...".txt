this is the survey professional forecasters um it's from May 2021 so it's after all the fiscal stimulus is done after you know how effective the vaccines are when some of the variants are starting to rise and the forecast for inflation in 2022 there was a greater probability put on a negative number deflation than there was on inflation above four percent I think this error is arguably worse not more consequential but worse more egregious than missing the financial crisis Financial crises have you know a multiple equilibria aspect to them they have an efficient Market's unpredictability aspect to them inflation doesn't normally just just pop up from nowhere and go from two to six um this should be something we can see and we can understand and we can predict so I'm gonna uh give you the model that was being used and I'm going to be a little bit unfair and polemical and then talk about how unfair and polemical um I am want to understand you know this forecasting this was it the right model but there was an error term or was it the wrong model or the model misapplied um so here's the unfairly polemical exercise we're going to give one million dollars um to each household that's a fiscal stimulus which is 514 percent of GDP um the multiplier is 0.8 Valerie we can argue about the right number later so uh GDP growth goes up 412 percent um I modeled this in terms of the unemployment rate you get an unemployment rate of zero um and the Phillips curve has a slope of 0.15 so inflation Rises to 2.6 now we go out and actually observe the world and real GDP might be five percent above Baseline it's hard for me to imagine that there's any policy that on a Time Horizon of less than a year could get you more than five percent above Baseline inflation Rises to a hundred percent um and then people come along try to understand this error and they go out and observe that there's lots of ships lined up at the ports the problem was clearly that the ports couldn't accept all the ships that wanted to come in for all the stuff that people wanted to buy with the million dollars um that they were all given um so how unfair and polemical um is that the fiscal stimulus in the United States um these are numbers from Hong and and Debbie Lucas fresh off um a BPA paper that they presented recently adding up the Fiscal Credit and forbearance the United States was about 25 percent of GDP Germany of the economies they looked at was um at the other end of the spectrum 16 but everyone was really large let's now think about multiple um you know the model that was used was just what I said um this is IHS Market they used something sort of like ferbus in the fed's model after the U.S fiscal stimulus the last 10 percent of GDP was introduced they raised their growth forecast from 4 to 5.7 they did not change their inflation forecast and they said that's because they're Phillips curve is linear and flat now I am pretty skeptical of the error term explanations I'm happy to go on it extraordinary length on this but you know my favorite is at first the vaccines were so effective that they were causing inflation in the first half of 2021 and then they lost their effectiveness and that was what was causing inflation in the second half we had Goods prices being high Goods prices being low energy going up energy going down with each one of these things core inflation stayed about the same a lot of the things people called Supply shocks I think were really demand shocks people talk about the Peloton economy where people bought bikes instead of going to the gym the big increase there happened in the spring of 2021 as people were actually returning to the gyms you saw a Goods price Goods consumption and services consumption going up at the same time um so anyway we can we can talk more about it if people want otherwise I'll keep renting um I think that in some sense this was the wrong model or the model um was misapplied so take 25 of GDP and fiscal policy is long variable and possibly non-monotonic lags these pictures are just to humor anyone from this room that wrote any of these papers I'm not saying these are the right multipliers to use for this I have no idea what multipliers one should use for this but the point of this is these multipliers often last sort of one two three years and they're not necessarily monotonic so take 25 percent of GDP is the multiplier at t plus one 0.1 0.1 times 25 I did the math earlier it's 2.5 percent of GDP it's really large 0.2 that's 5 of GDP those are not crazy multipliers to have even at Horizon of one two three years ahead and that the multiplier might go up not down so you can just get enormous things and then there's the question of can the economy absorb that in terms of real GDP which is what was implicit in the models this is what things looked like in December 2020 um the blue line is just the IHS Market forecast but all the forecasts looked like this the gray line is what CBO thought before the crisis so I think you could think to yourself in the best case wouldn't it be miraculous if by the end of 2021 we get back to that Gray Line we'd lost a lot of immigrants we'd lost a lot of people a lot of capital investment hadn't happened there were a lot of disruptions so I think even in some sense the idea that you could get back to the gray line was almost like wishful thinking optimistic but not crazy um so now let's do the standard multipliers that CBO uses that we used to do at cea when you put that fiscal stimulus and this is just the second half of it by the way um you you go up to that orange line that orange line is way above the Gray Line um just taking this and showing you the percentage change this is what the multipliers would say GDP would be relative to the CBO forecast and look it has in Q2 and Q3 of 2021 5 above the CBO forecast so you're just coming out of covid and somehow you're going to get yourself from below the forecast to five percent above um so what could you have looked at when you looked at these multipliers and said no actually there won't be inflation one possibility is the multiplier is much lower um I think that was a reasonable thing to think X empty and it was true but you needed to not just be lower up front you need to stay lower you need basically the person doesn't spend the transfer right away and then it becomes wealth and they spend three percent of it a year for the rest of time not they sort of spend some of it this year some of it next year some of it that you're after big expansion and productivity or you know unemployment well below 3.5 if you looked at the IHS market and you look at the fomc you see they were projecting FMC being more important of the two they were projecting output above pre-crisis Trend free crisis forecast not just level above the pre-crisis forecast and they had the unemployment rate also higher than it was pre-crisis in other words they were implicitly assuming just a big burst of productivity basically that Supply was highly elastic and if you want to buy stuff you'll be able to buy it some which way everything will come together so here's what happened um this is the same picture what you'd think from the multipliers um the diamonds are what happened to nominal GDP the blue is where uh real GDP was relative to the forecast and the Orange is where prices were um so first of all you didn't get those big multipliers people didn't go out and spend their checks Jonathan Parker who claims to be watching this and email me later to confirm um uh you know found small multipliers he didn't get the big multiplies but you get more stuff pushed out later you know is that the multiplier from this the multiplier from 2020 the monetary policy something else the blue lines are sort of output is about as good as you could possibly expect and then all the extra stuff goes into prices monetary policy was also highly asymmetric and this was built right into the rules um it became about shortfalls not um deviations in the unemployment rate I don't think that one ended up mattering but that was built into it the second was fate basically said you should make up for low inflation but not high inflation wasn't actually in their August uh 20 policy statement but there's like that's like the Torah and people that the FED have pointed me to the talmud that interprets it um and they can point to where you find that interpretation um the really important one entered their statements in September um of 2020 which is lift off only when you get to maximum unemployment at maximum employment which literally said you know you could be a tenth off but in on unemployment 10 points off on inflation and you still weren't supposed to lift off that one they actually kept to they did not raise rates until the unemployment rate was three and a half the unemployment rate even when it was four um they weren't uh raising rates um then they had this view that they made this mistake in the past of tightening because of forecast said inflation was coming you never do that we don't believe these forecasts the models don't work wait till you see the whites of inflation's eyes was the basic operating principle except you then do start believing forecasts if they tell you the inflation is going to go away so you can use forecasts asymmetrically um and finally you can cut rates quickly but don't raise rates quickly now that last one they abandoned it to a greater degree than I could possibly have imagined but it was still somewhat asymmetric when I think about this and this may only be relevant for this experience you know I think the standard way that these models work is you have fiscal support through some multiplier goes to real GDP real GDP goes to employment employment goes to inflation and then you could ask um you know do you have higher expected inflation and non-linear Phillips curve speed effects things like that I think that's all just really hard to estimate really on robust I've looked at papers that people do I've tried to do it myself I think in some ways the model that was implicit in what I was saying was a little bit better for the past which is just that our multipliers that we've looked at are about nominal GDP not real GDP and then there's something that tells you how much of that extra spending that people want to do is actual new stuff that's made and how much of it is higher prices for that existing amount of stuff and at some point um you know maybe even thinking of aggregate supplies inelastic is is not terrible so let me talk about where we are going forward I think we're back in the world where everyone who thinks this two percent inflation is relying on a model and they're relying on a Model that is really an edge case like if you take any parameter you could possibly put into something there's a 40 chance that the thing that gets you to is right but you need all three models all three parameters to be that and every one of them almost all of the arrows on the other side so the model is inflation equals two minus something times the unemployment rate minus 3.5 um Supply shock that too you know could it be some lag term because of some inertial process in inflation which a lot of models generate could it be about short run expectations which are still about two points above where they were before could expectations change and Rise now that we're several years into this on the unemployment rate if you added anything else like openings or quits that would say that the economy is a lot tighter than it was before and 3.5 I think there's a much more many more estimates of a natural rate above that um than below that so I would say two percent certainly possible but it still is and it might even be like a mode for each one of these pieces but it's not the one I have so what would I do now we'll talk about it more on the panel I'd put more of a burden on proof of a deviation from some sort of Taylor rule they're still in the sort of six six and a half you have to be really dovish to get yourself to five I'd use fiscal policy two No One's Gonna do that so I'll skip over the slide um you know this one I'm not sure about on a blank slate I would like a higher inflation Target I'm really worried about the cost of the transition to that so I'd Focus right now on reducing inflation I would not go to a higher Target until you're below three once you're below three I think maybe you could and finally I will take 30 seconds more than I'm supposed to on the lessons for the future the quantify stuff I mean this seems like tongue-in-cheek but the number of times people said things just random I saw you know they would say Child Care is behind labor Supply is a really easy thing to qualify how much child care is on labor Supply and you could debate whether it was sort of 0.001 or 0.01 you couldn't get to 0.1 out of it but people just said it over and over again when I say people talking about fomc members I think being a little bit pluralistic about models and not saying like this is the one true model or this is the one true set of parameters often that's just going to spread you sometimes though it actually is quite skewed and almost every story you can tell will either give you to or above two average across those and you get a number higher than two I think being more symmetric some of the feds asymmetries made sense but not all of them collectively being closer to rules I used to think dialing the things the Geniuses dialing them was a good idea because I'm a liberal and think government people know what they're doing I'm not sure of that now and don't fight the last war what that means is constant updating it became clear by the end of 2020 that things were less bad than we thought they were and we should have updated towards more of a natural disaster and less of a financial crisis model so all that's easier said than done if I'd had more time I would have been more like humble and caveat but you didn't give me the extra minute for that so sorry so thanks for having me a lot I had actually an intro which is a bit of a reply to Kristen's intro but I have a lot of things to do so I'm going to say because I have a lot of slides to cover so I'm going to skip that to the answers um I took um in some ways I'm going to do something similar to Json which is I'm going to try to understand answer these two questions to the questions of the panels and I'm basically going to spend the next 30 minutes struggling through it and hopefully as I struggle through it you'll struggle with me and uh and we'll make some progress or something um so what's driving inflation question one skip it in your head item in order to look back I'm gonna look at the present what is driving inflation right now in 2023 will it stay high and what can policy do about it first Canada one that is very often heard it's really all about relative prices it's really striking when you look at not just the standard headline and Coinflation but you add to them one standard deviation of relative price across a roughly 200 PC categories now there's been a dramatic increase in relative price variability it's just and moreover much of it hasn't fallen at all therefore if you say well inflation is really a pure part and a part that's really relative prices the pure part being something having to do with the unit of account you would say well um maybe there isn't actually all that much inflation or at least all of the inflate not that there isn't much there's not much pure inflation it's really all about these relative prices and an early version of this is of course the the classic Poor Man's estimate of pure inflation which is to look at core inflation that early on was lagging behind Edline inflation you take this view which I think again a very often held View and you answer the questions looking for what could drive relative prices ship and Jason's picture ship stuck in the harbor pandemic Supply bottlenecks Ukraine being some of them but then if you go from this also to the second question you say well the prices person hasn't fallen at all so if you want to bring inflation down I have to bring the prices person down and they start talking about price controls or subsidies because if it's a relative price problem then you're gonna go and attack relative prices and little by little you see this sipping through the discussion certainly in Europe already and inevitably someone here in the US let me be very skeptical in a model with nominal rigidities every shock is a relative price shock if you have a monetary shock some firms adjust some don't so what does it mean to say it's all relative prices in the classic Calvin model you write or teach every shock is a relative price shock if you have elevated variants of montropolitan sharks you can have exactly the picture that you saw here to give an example moreover if you go and to illustrate this move beyond the core inflation measure and try to say well let me really separate relatives from absolutes and you know it's a problem that I thought about a little bit about 15 years ago and so let me give you an old model there's better ones but this one I trust that I could run my computer and update it let's do the dynamic Factor model I control for the equity proportional bits and the relative price bits and you update it and do it now when you're doing a bunch of different ways and you know what myself and Mark had found 15 years ago is that yeah the pure inflation the stuff that's incredibly relative prices accounts maybe for 10 of price variability most of it is really relative prices and lo and behold at most and with some standard errors you can account for maybe one percent increase in inflation on account of this pure part most of it is relative prices and this is true now as well and what do I learn from this about inflation is high not very much moreover as an economist I'm supposed to solve for prices not to say that I explain why prices went up by saying prices went up or because relative prices was now at best you can make a little bit of progress and say look let me focus on one very notable well-identified relative price oil prices that I kind of can understand what that is and however if you do that you have to remind yourself that for sure oil price increases were not driven just when Putin invaded Ukraine after all they were pretty high already a few months earlier on account of the very fast Global recovery and if you do the work and of isolating what was really a supply shock here I'm just going to put a picture from a paper by Luz Killian and Jew uh trying to ISO the supply shock you're going to put something that actually is very prevalent if you look at impulse sponsors as well price stocks that they can explain a quarter or two of elevated inflation and nothing left within three or four quarters so when I go over my first question how much does this explain 2023 inflation the old price the answer is not very much and what can pulse you to about it there for maybe not all that much a second candidate and again one that was very very often used in debates is it's all Supply now as a macroeconomist I always struggled with that word because being a well-raised in general trained I know there's Technologies there's preferences there's markets what the heck is supply and demand but I tend to think about well Supply is the optimal technicians coming from the firms demand is the opportunities from the consumers and then it becomes very hard to understand what supply and demand in a scenario over the last two years but luckily there's a very clever answer um produced by a wonderful Economist at the San Francisco fed Adam Shapiro which has been extremely influential especially it shows up in Philippines ECP debates ECB speeches almost every time which say look let's look at inflation and separate the sectors for which prices went up and quantity went up let's look at the sectors where prices went up and quantity went down the latter our supply we split inflation it's an arithmetic decomposition and one is demand and the owner's Supply if you do that answer end up with a lot of Supply driven inflation and again I think this is probably the cleverest way of doing it and a really I hope influential I think not just impulsive in research and you end up absolving but the conclusion is you absolve monetary policy from the current inflation High because after all supplies not the monetary pulse Montreal demand and second you end up with discussions that say well let's not bring inflation down very quickly recall your optimal targeting rules if it's a supply shock you're supposed to trade it if you try to bring inflation far too quickly now you'd end up with a very big recession because it's a supply shop and again you see many versions I think of this I see a few Federal condoms shaking their heads I think they have seen I think versions of this again though let's think about this a little bit more I put a lot of equations here just for completeness but you don't have to absorb all of them think about the textbook mutines and model with two sectors all I'm going to do is just put two sectors in it okay there's just two sectors but I'm gonna have the following three forms heterogeneity across those two sectors one in a when a technology shock hits it may have a bigger incidence one sector rather than the other perfectly plausible not to assume that these are perfectly neutral second when the government goes and spends stuff they may end up spending spending more in one sector as opposed to another one seems also perfectly plausible and thirdly that some sectors have stickier prices than others in terms of the extent of normal rigidities those are all the equations together with a nominal income monetary policy so that I can keep everything static in pencil and paper so that hopefully you don't completely distrust me when I say that the answers of this is when will I have a coincidence composition that it is a supply shock meaning that sector B prices go up but quantity goes down even a sector a goes up and down and the answer is very easily actually if I have a positive monitor Supply shock what happens is if it turns out that one of the sectors is much more Priceless than the other the one that has the very sticky prices is going to be the one that expands production but then because it's going to absorb labor from the other sector the other sector goes down five positive government purchases I buy a lot from Valerie stuff I don't buy from Marty again she draws labor Marty goes down even though this is a positive demand shock I would say and even if it's a technology shock likewise you get that I can have easily have a positive technology shock on both but one of the sectors goes down and the other one goes up I can get any decomposition of supply and demand for any of these three shocks or if you want a more General lesson that Agate demand is not the aggregation of Demands um and there's no link between fundamental shocks and what is Agate demand or Supply Third Kind of one that's very dear to my heart it's expectations and that comes in many ways from a Phillips curve uh view of the world one that I hold very dearly since I'm the Philips Professor um well it's being interviewed by what I know now the entire biography of Phillips like I'm always Phillips how much of the inflation I can tell you all kinds of stories about Mr Phillips how much the team plays associated with as a wonderful composition how much and you saw Jason using it just now 10 minutes ago how much is tightness and activity how much is expectations how much is Supply shocks shifts in the curve let's not use the word Supply okay it's a various organization organizing framework and the optimal new canes in pulse again makes really a crucial the composition between what's credibility what's being offset and what's not and um to look at this again the first answer is and these are pictures that I was showing a couple of years ago um you answer that look there was a real shift of expectations to the right you want to look at distributions because the medians on these household surveys are very slow and so distributions really give you more and you say look a lot of the inflation was indeed the shift in expectations some bad pulse and bad luck but you also end up and this is a compliment instead of looking at the surveys let's look at uh some work that I've been doing last year let me look at options on inflation so you also a sense from financial markets and both this if you pay attention to the gray line which is one of the more recent ones the two more recent ones in the surveys or the markets this one which you've seen last nine months is an amazing re-anchoring a huge success of monetary policy or luck in that expectations have really shifted back left in an extremely decisive way a big win from Talking tough acting tough or not and you end up with some Optimist policy advice their second answer stay on the course be patient it's really paying off you've really re-anchored the expectations but let me be again a little bit scratch my head on the one hand I love this answer I've been doing these pictures let me scratch rack stations I mean excesses are as endogenous as it gets right I love them because they're useful signal but they don't answer the question Marty and Valerie asks and so what's the driver of inflation simplest model of inflation A Fischer equation a central bank that's trying to pick what's the interest rate with some Gap with some estimate of it and so some error and does so by following a Taylor rule of the coefficient Phi imagine that a share of Agents have rational expectations whereas the reminder they expect inflation Target plus some random noise simple enough that again hopefully you can trust me when the solution is this it comes from just combining these inflation Is On Target and deviates from Target when the Central Bank miss the values the state of the economy when agents start expecting stuff and it drives inflation and when you lose credibility in the sense of these speculative hyperinflation last term what this says is that to understand why inflation is high today absolutely understanding erratic expectations is important animal spirits keynesianism if you want and to understand whether you've lost credibility long sessions this can be very important exercise are really important to understand inflation but without those two actual expected by T plus one in this model is completely useless because it's IID no in other words when I look at these plots I think they're wonderful as signals but they don't really tell me if any of these are driving the expected inflation which is what again they asked me to do so let me move to what I think is a slightly better approach and a better approach because I think it's an approach that I learned from coming to these meetings for about 20 years and that is let me think instead of shocks we had two really big sharks from the Biden Administration from the beginning the inflation Recovery Act and the stimulus or the covert Recovery Act and I'm going to treat what the CBO said as the news fiscal news and compare them to Valerie's military spending news now I'm going to overstate it because it's going to say they're all news but I'm also going to understate it because the buy Administration says that the second Sims the ra costs nothing because it's going to pay for itself within like two years immediately so that's why it's so small and I was like this is really promising because it's very large last 40 years to be clear it's not that promise Because by the way these things used to be much bigger as Valerie will tell you but still hey it's significant in the last few years now if I have socks what can I do I can use the vars that value classic textbook VR the ones estimated by Valerie with some slight estimates plug in that shock series how much inflation could they generate and the answer is very little um now maybe say Valerie kind of is in the low multiplier camp yeah fine multiply this by two or three you end up is that may have generated inflation 20 21 22 but by 23 there's just very little inflation coming from here so one doesn't seem like this is the answer and that austerity the thing that Jason ruled out is not the recipe to bring inflation down seems right then we get the monetary policy what's right they ruled that out okay good point you're right you're right thank you monetary policy well let me back out deviations from the Taylor rule given now division rule depends on what Taylor will you use a baseline do you do some interest rate smoothings to do some others but it has some pretty big monetary policy shocks basically what Jason was pointing that policy was pretty loose objection of course using a tailor rule tools are mechanical policies for backward looking but if you plug in those shocks and again at least I'm tying my hands into another wonderful VAR the one estimated by Martian company textbook vars just to make sure that I'm not there's I'm sure there's better vars although Mario maybe say no or yes but you know and then you can explain why in 2023 inflation is again depending on which of the shock series is similar around uh two or sorry oh the label's got Miss tipped this is not a 4.0 4.0 is there sorry never mind uh but somewhere between one and four percent above where it should be and that it's coming down slowly in other words that a lot of the raising core inflation is explained by loose monetary policy and looking for that normalization is about to have starting effects a word of optimism stay on course and if you want it faster go a little faster like Jason suggested you can do this instead with a VAR to forecast the shocks of the tiller rule but I don't have time but just to say that you end up with actually very similar conclusions in terms of qualitatively if not when I did so to conclude what's driving inflation will stay high we've had large and persistent to alternate dispersion we've output in some sectors booming and it's contract we have extra tissues getting out of hand and re-entering and these are all really interesting really useful very good to understand efficient Dynamics and their consequences but data I don't think answer the two questions above one thing that answers it is using vars if so fiscal policy turns out not to be much but monetary policy is perhaps the greatest culprit for why we're having inflation high today but also a word of optimism in that it's about to come down very quickly if I'm going to trust the vr's estimated of course another answer for which I neither had the time nor the energy is together with the errors do the other thing I've learned in this room for 20 years which is would be write a DSG model we're going to see one tomorrow um and try to answer again answers of this type but this is perhaps a more fruitful approach to try and understand to what extent inflation where it is and where it's coming down the one I did I think there's some reason at least for optimism but at least open the debate in a different sense thank you um well thank you very much Valerie Martin Eric for having me it's great to be here in Cambridge discussing this very crucial issue facing monetary and monetary and macroeconomics um so I like to make three points um first on why has inflation returned picking up on some of the points Jason made and regardless well um let me see if this works no okay very good and then it should work okay excellent uh so there are many uh striking similarities in the inflation experience across different regions but there are also some very important differences which I like to discuss especially from my perspective as a policy maker in the UK because those differences are relevant for what to do about it second with elevated inflationary pressures almost all central banks have tightened policy very sharply but third at least in the UK the shape of the inflationary shocks they mean mostly from the large increase in Energy prices coupled with the long Logs with which monetary policy affects the economy means that the most likely scenario now is that we undershoot the inflation Target in the medium term meaning 2025. so starting with why inflation increase and the differences across regions we know well the series of shocks that have driven up inflation all over the world first the pandemic with its effects on Supply coupled with the fiscal response and the effect of the recovery on demand and the rotation of demand and Then followed almost immediately by shocks to energy and other commodity prices caused by the war in Ukraine but while the US the UK and the Euro area have all faced very high inflation the drivers the quantity quantitative drivers of that inflation have differed across jurisdictions um in the case of the UK and the Euro area the main driver of above Target inflation has been the extraordinary increase in Energy prices in the U.S stronger domestic demand has played a bigger role in driving inflationary pressures and to a large extent that strong U.S demand shock appeared as an additional cost per shock in the UK as um that led to higher imported goods prices now a simple way to see this is to look at the terms of trade which measure the prices of the goods and services the country exports relative to those City Imports and as you can see here over 2021 and 2022 the U.S terms of trade improved whereas the terms of trade of the UK and the Euro area worsen materially this again was caused mainly by Energy prices and the fact that the US didn't see such a large increase in gas prices and ultimately the US is a net exporter of energy and other Commodities whereas the the UK and the Euro area are not importers the start stops at the end of 2022 but we now know that that energy prices have fallen back and so much of this movement as well as most of its effects will start unwinding um but in the data we have the terms of trade patterns are also reflected in the evolution of real consumption which is Illustrated here and in the U.S as Jason showed consumption recovered very very quickly from the pandemic in fact it reached its pre-pandemic level early in 2021 and caught up with the pre-covered trend in by the middle of 2021 indeed overtook that Trend meanwhile in the Euro area consumption has remained well below the pre-covered trend and only just returned to its pre-covered level recently and finally we have the UK where we see consumption is oh sorry at the end of last year was not even back to its pre-covered level and remains more than 10 percent below its pre-covered trend um so what we can debate the role of strong demand in the U.S it's difficult to make the case that inflation in the UK has has been the uh driven by a demand room um as as some people have uh thought so on the why I would say the quantitative uh split of these drivers is clearly different across this economies and an enormous cost per shock um by many metrics much bigger than the one we saw in the 70s played a major role in the UK and the European inflation Dynamics but on what to do about it one response could be that energy price movements are changes in relative prices so monetary policy can always ensure that aggregate inflation meets the target and in the medium term that's absolutely true and I don't think anyone in this room will disagree but we're not um by mandate not strict inflation targeters we have flexible inflation targeting Frameworks in the UK in particular the remedy the remit is clear that we are not intended to keep inflation at two percent irrespective of the circumstances shocks will always move inflation away from the Target and the role of monetary policy is to bring inflation back to Targets in the medium term and again we think of Horizons of two to three years at the speed that gives consideration to Output unemployment volatility and this simple diagram here um shows or summarizes how we can operationalize those flexible inflation targeting mandates the appropriate monetary policy response to an energy price shock is not automatic increases in Energy prices can have several different effects that can push inflation in different directions at different Horizons as Illustrated here so we have Direct effects from energy enter directly in in the CPI through better prices energy and utility bills and so on us and and we have indirect effects that's my point too here um through uh Pharmacy input costs as energy is an important input in the production of many goods and services including those entering in the core basket uh these two channels were the main drivers of the quick uh drive up in inflation but since monetary policy again operates with the lag responding to what have proved already to be a temporary increase in specific prices would have added to inflation volatility rather than reduce it instead we need to always focus on the medium term and these are the two last channels that I stress here uh inertia and lower real incomes in the case of net importers of energy so inertia arises from different forms of implicit or explicit indexation and just because headline inflation is the main reference point for contract or wage negotiations and obviously inertia will slow down the return of domestic wages and prices um to um to Target particularly in the context of of a tight labor markets but again because the UK is a net importer of energy this has to be balanced against the disinflationary effects of lower real incomes and lower real wealth so although Energy prices have now fallen back quite substantially the shock has still made the UK poorer and in response lower real incomes have worked heavily on demand over the past year especially for hand-to-mouth consumers ultimately reducing consumption and inflationary pressures in the medium term so uh now as we know in response to these developments are well in the case of the UK monetary policy we have put more weight on that inertia um and we tighten sharply uh materially in as in many other countries this has been uh by the way the fastest sightening in the history of the monetary policy committee and this this uh chart gives a sense of that speed um it shows uh a five-year nominal interest rates in the US the Euro area and the UK now while the paths have different different somewhat we see a significant tightening in all three regions now so far this has had a very small dampening effect on inflation which might lead us to us whether policy should do more and that's the question and of course policy makers would always stand ready to do more if this inflationary pressure start building again and we need to keep an eye on those drivers that we discussed but given monetary policy Lux policy needs to be based on floral looking forecasts and those forecasts at least for the UK are telling us that we may already have tightened too much so to illustrate these points uh this chart shows the overall shape of UK annual um sorry quarterly CPI inflation annual um this is coming from our most recent forecast uh which were made in February so they don't capture the latest data but unsurprisingly given the the very fast run-up in Energy prices this profile is incredibly steep so we go from inflation at the two percent Target in the middle of 2021 to a quarterly peak of 10.7 percent six quarters after that and then falling back to one percent uh below our targets six quarters after that um so those five again this this forecasts are simply telling us uh what's happening with uh with the big level uh increase in Energy prices coming out of the inflation calculation the annual inflation calculation Energy prices another uh commodity prices that also increased uh remarkably during this period um so so then the step the stiffness of the profile um uh actually probably down place what we might now expect because since February gas prices have fallen even more uh now obviously we couldn't uh have known about the war in Ukraine back in 2021 and that was you know one reason for the big errors um but uh even if we somehow did let me illustrate my points on policy lags by showing you what would have happened if we had tightened a lot more a lot earlier um and so here uh I layer on into this mountain of inflation uh uh a tip the shape of a typical monetary policy response and its effects to inflation taken from one hour of our latest uh forecast I have scaly effect to show what would have happened if we had increased bank rate by about five percentage more points more to around eight percent starting in the middle of 2021 so this is still pandemic period um this by the way also happens to be the same amount of cumulative tightening that you would have obtain with the Taylor rule that just puts weight on current inflation deviations from the target uh and a weight of 1.5 oh wow okay so you can see that despite this um raising interest rates um uh by far far more the benefits are relatively small inflation Peaks slightly lower but still well about targets and there are cost to this which we need to consider given the rest of our mandates unemployment would have increased by three percentage points higher but most crucially given our remedies to achieve the inflation Target in the medium term the sharp tightening that is already in place leads to an undershoot by 2024 that's the end of the purple mountain with a larger tightening that Outlook would be even worse when inflation set to turn negative in the medium term so that's uh that would be the sorry the difference between these two lines we would end in deflationary territory if we had done this extra Taylor rule policy now what if we had known about the war in Ukraine and we had tried to upset all of the impact of the war of the war and get inflation at the two percent Target in 2022 well this is the exercise as that's it and I don't want to take it too seriously because obviously I'm raising rates to 30 percent here in order to achieve that that's how much you would have had today and we can discuss um but clearly the economic calls would have been um enormous um and uh you know even putting those aside the medium-term inflation implications from that would have been a disaster in terms of meeting our targets and you could argue also about our credibility if we end up with this uh picture uh so let me just conclude uh um uh as other countries although differently from the U.S inflation in the UK has been caused largely by a negative terms of trade shock um energy has played a huge role what to do about it the appropriate policy response can differ across countries and this has to be considered uh and obviously this assessment matters now when given the shape of the shock and the locks before monetary policy can have an impact on inflation we need to ask what what policy uh well the policy has already over tightened and finally finally I want to remind everyone about Milton Friedman's uh analogy with the full in the shower um when the full starts the water and it runs uh cold it keeps turning the faucet and eventually because he is impatient gets burned purpose
