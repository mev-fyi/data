so see drone walk with pio olivier gorashas and dimitri vallanos so the greek depression is pretty striking between 07 and 2014 greek gdp went down by almost one third so gdp per capita was around 35 000 so this is 2014 ppp constant us dollar and unemployment was around eight percent and in 2014 gdp per capita was 25 000 dollars and unemployment was 26 and a half so the basic question we're asking is what happened now to answer that question we have actually two parts in the paper there is a an empirical investigation and then there is a model based investigation the basic question of the empirical investigation is okay was greece really that bad it depends of course what your benchmark is so the whole point is to build a benchmark by looking at countries mostly emerging markets that have experienced certain stops and the answer is yes it was that bad it's actually much worse than any emerging market sell-off stocks we've seen even if you restrict the sample to strict beggars who actually did not devalue so we didn't know that and um we knew it was a bad crisis we didn't know it was it was that bad um also the fact that it's worse than countries that um keep that kept a strike streak peg uh suggests that it's not just about the fact that greece did not devalue its currency and then we have a model to try to investigate what happened and one story that we come up with is that the reason it was so bad is because greece caught a an emerging market crisis an emerging market disease if you want but in an economy with leverage ratios of an advanced economy so the metaphor we are using is very like catching measles if you catch measles as a kid you recover quickly if you catch measles as a grown-up it's pretty bad uh so that's we think is partly what happened to greece so what we show is that if instead of if you re-simulate greek history with the leverage ratio of your typical emerging market instead of greece you find a crisis which is more in line with what we see historically so less leverage would have helped and then we also i'll show you some counter factual about banking union and fiscal discipline to show you to try to quantify how much better things would have been so let's start with the uh empirical part so we we take a sample of countries that experienced financial crisis or sudden stops or sovereign default or combination of this some are emerging markets some are advanced economies and then we compare greece to these countries so this is a comparison to every country that has a certain stop that includes emerging markets and advanced economies and you have the 90 percent confidence interval so this kind of study dates back to i mean i think for me it's the calvo and then mendoza korenek and mendoza so you condition at time t something bad is happening which is there is a reversal of capital flows and gdp goes down and then so time t is the date of the sudden stop the year of the certain stuff and these are this is our years um so for greece we dated to 2010 so this is 2010 or 8 or 9 2010 and then this is 2014 for greece okay so the second step is typically that you find in a literature is sharp drop in output and relatively quick recovery in greece instead we see a very prolonged decline so it's more backloaded it's also much worse in magnitude so that's again this is the reload per capita you see around 30 30 or 0.3 log points now of course you might say well fine but these guys here include people who had the flexibility of changing their currency or their exchange rate so what happens if you compare greece uh to countries that are sorted by their currency regime so here you have again greece okay and uh and then you have four lines so the green at the top these are floating exchange rate countries so surprisingly you find the usual result that floaters do better in a certain stop day the drop note in output is uh somewhat smaller and they recover faster then you have countries who tried to keep their pegs and failed so these are the debaggers and that's in orange so they do you know they do worse than the floater and then you have the strict beggars who actually managed to keep their peg throughout and these are in blue okay now greece is still much worse than these guys for reference here you also have the evolution of log gdp per capita for italy ireland portugal and spain which are the eurozone country so pretty much every benchmark you're gonna look at greece is gonna be a lot worse the question then is is it really fair to compare greece to these strict beggars well not completely if you think that the reason they kept their pegs is because perhaps they knew the crisis wouldn't be so bad so in fact there is sample selection the ones who really would have suffered a lot from keeping their peg in fact jump from being blue to being orange okay so then we have another comparison which is we have two countries here that we're pretty sure they kept their pegs not because they thought it was not painful they kept their pace because they wanted to get away from russia and they want to stay in the west so that's pretty darn clear and uh even compared to latvia and esther and estonia greece is much worse now not at the beginning notice okay but estonia despite keeping their pegs even though it was minus 20 gdp right they knew that what they were doing they knew the cost they wanted to keep it because they wanted to anchor to the to the eurozone um they recovered pretty much like you know what you would think from a sudden stop episode in an emerging market yeah three years later they are not very different from your typical emerging market bigger okay and greece is um now you might think okay so greece had a certain stop also other things happened they had the credit boom and burst and then they had a sovereign default okay so then you can compare greece who to countries that had the trifecta which is sudden stop sovereign default and credit boom and burst and there it's kind of easier you don't have to put standard errors because there aren't so many of them so these are all of them okay and you recognize the names right these are the case studies that we teach mexico 82 chili83 argentina one greece is still worse than any of them you know four years later now why is it so bad that there are many reasons but one of them that's very important to keep in mind and explain some of what we try to do in the model is the thing that collapsed the most in greece is actually investment so if you now remember y output goes down a lot so here i'm plotting i over y okay so the level of investment totally crashed also but even as a ratio of gdp that's telling you that c over y didn't collapse as much okay so the behavior of investment is quite striking it collapsed to an extent that we don't really see anywhere else now of course this is uh just because this is the sum of this is investment nipah style that is it includes housing so you we have a another way where we look at housing residential investment versus corporate investment and housing crashed a bit more and a bit earlier but the magnitudes are similar in corporate investment so when you write a model about greece you kind of want to ride model with investment and when you talk about no this is not a small shock right this is investment going down by 70 percent so it's gonna show up in k at some point so it's gonna actually it's not going to be like a small change in k um so we wanna and for the persistence it's gonna matter so we're gonna have that in the model good okay so then part of the paper tries to make sense of greece i don't think i need to tell you that it's only partly successful because given the mess and the complication we try to do our best but we didn't succeed nearly as much as we hoped but i guess it's just because we had unreasonable expectations i suppose um okay so what the some of the features are pretty obvious you want a small open economy in the currency union the currency union is going to set the interest rate and there is some kind of foreign inflation there or deflation um so that's what's going on in the currency union and then uh that's a small open economy that trades with the rest of the union and has a fixed exchange rate and it's going to be a standard new canadian dsg so a bunch of shocks and wages and prices are sticky calvo style and maybe i'll come back to that because i think given what we saw yesterday in the paper that we saw yesterday morning um it might matter to the way you you model uh nominal rigidities here so this is the standard new key engine framework and the big players are gonna be the government and then uh the banks or whatever is the instrument for funding the private sector which in europe is mostly banks the banks are going to fund households and firms households are going to have some debt b and then that's going to affect that consumption and then firms are gonna uh also be subject to funding costs that depend on the banks and invest and then accumulate capital okay there's a bunch of shocks so i don't wanna i'm i don't wanna bore you with all annotations but every time you see a zeta that's a shock i call it a shock because it's kind of easier if the shock itself is an ar one so the innovation is like this vibe ceiling okay and so all of these and that's gonna be like the usual bayesian estimation so we specify the stochastic process and we're going to estimate the rows and the sigmas and this indicator there is going to be well they're going to have a bunch of shocks okay so one is going to be a certain stop and it's going to be a spending shock okay so if you show this zeta in the in the next slide that's what they are each of them is like some kind of a one which is then estimated using a bayesian method okay so i don't want to of course i won't show you the whole model i'm just going to show you the the key features the government okay the government taxes there is a flat tax on on gdp um on total income and so that's for the revenues and then the government does a transfer payment and ng i mean spending um and then the way we monitor the government is uh is like a spending rule so it's like a teller rule but except for fiscal policy okay so what's what's the rule is saying the following so first of all there's some persistence that we estimate that feels better and then that's the interesting part so it has like four pieces and this piece here is just saying that if your debt is very high you're gonna get spending this is this is not important for dynamics it's just otherwise you violate you know traversality conditions so that's a small number that's just there for stability of the system um these are the important ones so this is saying the government has some kind of contraceptive fiscal policy motive so if um if n employment goes down you're gonna increase uh spending to try to counteract okay so that's the contrasting fiscal policy motive and then the government is going to look at its funding cost and if the funding cost is high it's going to cut spending okay so austerity induced by um difficulty in funding the government is going to show up in this fr term and then there's this autonomous spending shock this is the thing we can't explain so that's the the part that the greek government does that we don't really understand based on this simple rule so that's based on a previous paper i had with philippe martin where we estimate these rules for all of the countries in europe and they actually work pretty well like the residual for france germany portugal these are kind of tiny actually this will describe except for one country where there is a big residual and that's greece so this is going to play a role okay so that's what the government does okay and then of course it can default so there's going to be credit risk on the government side so this is the fiscal rule then there's a budget constraint and then there's what happened because of default then the households so these households are campbell menkeu schiller kind of household so there are two types one is patient was impatient like you know the cam same thing that was used later in by edgarson and krugman so if you're impatient you're going to borrow and then you're going to hit your debt limit once you hit your debt limit you are like a hand to mouse agent but with one feature which is interesting your hand to mouse agent with some kind of endogenous to the model uh the budget constraint because your debt limit is going to be endogenous in the model okay so you're a hand to muscle but i can move around your budget constraint and otherwise you work you earn labor income you get taxed by the government you borrow you repay you default so dh is the default rate of household and then you get the transfers um and then you have some banks so we try to model the banks uh structurally and we fail so then the banks are going to end up being more reduced form the some of the equations work some don't so the basic idea was banks have some kind of capital constraints like get locked already really um and so they can lend so this this would be from the sum of their private lending to firms and to households but they have a capital requirement which is that their market value or book value depending on which regulation you look at has to satisfy this ratio okay that's going to create some funding constraint for the banks it's going to then translate into funding comes rate for the private sector okay but unfortunately some of the more structural uh restriction of the model there we just didn't have the data to estimate okay so one then so then there's a big part which is you run through the equation you figure out the solution or the approximate solution and these are the key equations that are going to play a role in the simulations first the banks fund the private sector so in long deviations the cost of fund for the pride sector this is the rk that's the rk that shows up in the queue equation depends on the funding cost of the bank and in fact in logs they are the same so it's like a constant spread the banks borrowed two lends at four that brought that eight it lands at ten okay so in logs it's uh it's equal and then what happened to the funding cost of the bank so the thing that kind of matter for the bank is their funding cost sudden stop style that is how much they can borrow what's the rate which they can fund themselves typically it's more like wholesale funding um but of course in europe when the wholesale funding dried up it was replaced by um assistant from the central bank so this is the sedum stop for on the banks and then if the banks make losses so this is private default the sum of household and corporate default these losses are going to eat their capital because it eats their capital they can lend less and therefore the price at which the land is going to go up and so this is how private losses are going to fit in into funding costs for the banks so the funding cost for the bank is the baseline eurozone which doesn't move essentially plus a certain sub spread plus a private default uh induced spread and this depends on the equilibrium leverage of the banks up l then we model private default uh this is reduced form so that's a model where you have intersecretive shock and then some fraction of the population defaults the government's same story the cost of fund for the government is r plus the part which comes from default risk and the path that comes from default risk we model as a function which is increasing in uh so there's a default shock okay and then uh you draw the default chuck and then if your leverage is above the default shock your default so then take expectation take the logs then you get something like that which is the risk of default at time t plus one from time t is perspective it's going to be increasing in your future debt to gdp ratio and of course deflation matters for this nominal debt all right so then we do uh the simulations so the thing i want to emphasize here is just that what we feel in the model is only things that we can observe okay and also does not include investment or gdp so we don't feed gdp we don't feed investment doesn't know anything about that which only feed the government uh revenue and spending interest rate on the government interest rate on so that's rk that's this this guy here funding cost for the private sector the time series for non-performing loans inflation and the time series for household borrowing okay so then you can first check is okay what does it predict in terms of gdp and investment so blue is what happens and red is what the model predicts so we don't predict everything but i think in terms of you know that's something that doesn't have investment or output as an input so that means that the sum of the demand shock that we put in the model and the way we introduce them seems to predict the path for output which is reasonable uh an investment we do we pre collapse we just don't repeat 55 percent instead of you know 70 percent so we are still a bit short in terms of predicting the disaster in terms of the net export we get also roughly right inflation uh well there's a problem which is here they changed the v80 and uh so this spike we don't have in the model which means we break the deflation just one year earlier which is a bit frustrating but that's live okay so then uh once you have the bayesian estimation you can have you can reconstruct greek history so this is what the model spits out in terms of the the shocks that it sees so the way it interprets the boom is he sees this red stuff which is curry demand so it says household wanted to bowl and and they did the the positive uh white sharks here this is saying that the cost of private default was priced very low so the credit market was bullish and so this guy wanted to borrow and they could borrow so then there is a private landing boom it's not that big although in greece what's big after that it's this green stuff that's the autonomous government spending which is for some reason the greek government decides to spend more than what you think based on a simple rule so that goes all the way to a seven and then what triggers the the reversal is first the sudden stop and then uh the sovereign risk that is when the government sees this cost of fund going up it's gonna it's gonna cut spending and after that we get a negative spending shock that's because after the default the spread goes down but the government keeps it spending low because they're in the program so the model interprets that as a reversal of what they did before okay so oh so the counterfactual then so i mean i think you can guess what's going to happen now so in this model everything has short times multiplier multiplier is increasing in leverage leverage of course here means credit to gdp for the price sector sovereign debt to gdp for the government and you see these are the ratios for emerging market like point four and greece is at least twice as high so we're going to do a simple exercise re-simulate this series of shock these are the log shocks so they are scale-free re-simulate that with an economy that has a leverage ratio of your typical emerging market and what you find is investment for instance focus on investment the cumulative drop is about 20 percent less than it was in the previous model so we did that for emerging market then we do a banking union exercise that's easy because banking union literally means that this is zero that's the definition of a bank agreement the cost of fund does not depend on the location so you can just shut down that shock re-simulate and in terms of magnitude again cumulative improvement investment around twenty percent the last one um i can tell you for the last one we did is we shut down the green sharks in the boom which is we put we let them follow the normal rule but without their excessive spending and then of course after that everything looks better because they have less leverage less credit so they have to do less austerity and again ballpark estimate to get about cumulative 20 improvement in investment
