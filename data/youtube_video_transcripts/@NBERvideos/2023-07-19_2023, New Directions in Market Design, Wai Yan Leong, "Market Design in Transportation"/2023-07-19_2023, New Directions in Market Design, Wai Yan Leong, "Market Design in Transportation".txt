thank you very much um good morning everyone I am Hawaiian from the land transport Authority in Singapore so it is indeed a privilege uh to be invited to speak to this distinguished audience in this room uh today I will be sharing a bit about the evolution of Singapore's private vehicle policies and providing a practitioner's perspective on how economics and Market design have been applied to Road pricing and also vehicle ownership policies now because the session is live streamed so as per the authorities policy I have got to say that um we must have saying that these are just my personal Reflections and that I'm not necessarily representing the official position of the Singapore LTA okay now uh first maybe um for those uh for those in the room who are a little less familiar about our geographical context um I just want to mention as you can see in the graphic uh on the slide in front of you uh Singapore is a densely populated highly urbanized city-state with very limited land space so roads take up about 12 of the total Road space uh sorry of total land area uh and that's not far behind housing at about 15 percent so therefore with these land constraints uh there is limited scope to increase Road capacity uh without compromising other land uses such as security and economic development so I searched up the widest freeway in the world it did the Google search on that and um the image shot for Katie freeway in Texas popped up and and this in this picture um it looks like that close to 20 lanes in each Direction and of course this is a freeway of such a scale that I can not imagine something similar to be built in Singapore so now in tandem with our investments in high quality public transport to provide the mobility alternatives to the car we also need to restrict access to and also the usage of the private car and so this is to optimize the carrying capacity of the roads so you might have seen some version of the picture on the right uh illustrating just how much more space efficient a bus is and generally speaking public transit is relative to the private single occupancy car so allowing every household to own a car is a luxury that a land constrained country can still afford So currently car owning households make up about 35 of all households in Singapore that's a little higher than what Mike was Mike thought it was maybe recently five percent but uh it's a little bit higher than that but of course not surprisingly uh it is a lot lower than uh in the US where about 92 percent of all households have a car or cars now but even as we restrict uh car ownership um it is also clear that among those households who are privileged enough to own a car we cannot allow its unbridled usage now because of the historical radio land use patents uh entitled nature of traffic flows between the downtown core the CBD and the outlying residential areas uh congestion hotspots will emerge if we don't do anything about that so as you can see the CBD is in the center south of the island and there are residential areas to the north to the west and Northeast and the East and so this is where what's supporting what's going to cause that radio uh pattern the title pattern closed so having a combination of vehicle ownership and Road usage measures are needed including the ownership measures to control vehicle growth and usage measures such as our electronic Road pricing that's Erp for short and that's and that's a form of congestion pricing so now some cities may have introduced you may you may know some cities have introduced heart ownership measures um so for example uh basing's a license plate lottery so it's that's a hard ownership measure some cities may you will also know that they have introduced Road pricing measures like London Stockholm but Singapore is to the best of knowledge the only city and country in the world to fully rely on a dual combination of ownership and usage restraints I use this restraint measures so many in the room are undoubtedly familiar with the evolution of the theory of congestion pricing from other people's work in 1920 on nationalities uh tourism victories ideas about time of day pricing in the 1950s and then to the Smith report which was commissioned by the UK government in 1964. Singapore was the first country to take up many of the recommendations of the state report with the introduction of congestion pricing in practice in the form of the area licensing scheme or the ALS in 1975 so this is a pricing mechanism to discourage car usage into the more congested parts of the CBD we call that the restricted Zone and paid labels were required to enter the restricted Zone initially those were just for cars and taxis uh later on uh subsequent years they were extended to motorcycles and the commercial vehicles uh implementation of ALS saw an immediate 44 decrease in the number of Motor Vehicles entering the RC doing restricted hours however we had to contend with some shortcomings of the ALS so the paper labels that people had to buy to enter the Zone they were uniformly priced so that means that the scheme could not fully flexibly respond to a time of day or time varying demand and in the in addition then the search for labels on the days where it demands more price inelastic let's just increment where the days can be quite costly and frustrating and also uh enforcement was needed to ensure that Vehicles entering the restricted Zone uh they possess a proper paper license for that day and this was of course quite a labor intensive exercise so they uh a real accessing scheme uh then evolved into the automated Erp in 1998 and the result death of the Erp was to encourage motorists to consider the most optimal time route and mode of Transport for the journeys uh Erp harnesses technology through what we call the in vehicle units uh or I use to allow charges by time of day and by location if if you're not entering the recorded uh providing that the more targeted pricings um charges can also vary by time of year so for example um Erp charges are typically lowered during the major school vacation periods uh because there's just lower traffic demand during that time and with the Erp uh it was also possible for us to implement shoulder pricing so just to mitigate the undesirable effects of the large discrete changes in pricing and so compared to the ALS which charged on a per day basis so the Erp charges on a per use basis and that actually better reflects the marginal external costs of the cartridge so lta's uh chief engineer wrote back in 2005 that in the initial months after the transition from ALS to the Erp volume and traffic volumes into the CBD fell about 10 to 15 percent so it was quite likely that Erp had especially influenced the behavior of those who previously made multiple trips into the CBD and many of these multiple trip makers had reduced their car trips for example the office workers no longer use their cars to go attend midday meetings or to go out for lunch and they come back in again in fact uh they would they would then rely on public transport public transit system instead and and obviously uh the automation alleviates the enforcement label constraint so allowing congestion charging to be practically deployed to more hot spots around the island so in the form of point-based charging so when necessary Erp uh will and can be expanded to new locations uh where the congestion hot spots or congestion levels warranted so for example uh in the 2000 mid uh 2000s it was expanded beyond the CBD to include roads and expressways island-wide which were more congested during the morning and evening peak hours so um let me now make a few brief remarks on how the Erp rates are determined so simply put these are based on traffic conditions of the roads where the Erp system is in operation and also vehicle sizes as measured by Passenger car unit so for example if you're a driver of a large truck or large commercial vehicle you are typically charged one and a half times to two times uh compared to drivers of the passenger car and if you happen to be riding a motorcycle uh you probably pay about uh 50 less um rates are also reviewed every quarter uh and if necessary they're adjusted to achieve the optimal traffic flow on the roads so um so my road traffic engineering colleagues uh have determined that at the speed range of 20 to 30 kilometers per hour on the arterial roads and 45 to 65 kilometers per hour on expressways those are kind of the optimal speeds of the more traffic flows they could expect with the Erp no uh some might say that the Erp is inability to perform a real-time Dynamic charging might be an impediment right uh so yes we do recognize that uh there are examples of real-time tolling uh in practice with managed Lanes in some parts of the US but it was clearly a design consideration uh to go with a different approach with the review of the Erp rate quarterly and with the changes that are if you're giving any changes you're going to be publishing those ahead of the implementation uh we think that the motorists will then be able to make more informed driving decisions instead of being confronted with new and changing information while on Route where they might have little opportunity to react now the more fundamental issue uh with with Erp uh or the current efe system is that this infrastructure heavy and it is increasingly more expensive to maintain ssbj's end of life so the gantries I can see a picture there uh can also be a potential visual dismantity although some people say that that's a pretty much iconic part of uh modern day Singapore well regardless I think uh we will give it to London uh for implementing A system that is a lot less visually intrusive because they do and they do have a system that's enforced by cameras and not by uh gantries okay now uh moving on to the next Generation Erp or next-gen uh Erp for short uh as his name suggests uh we are going to be using this uh new system to replace the current one in future uh we are going to have what we call onboard units or obu's uh kind of like attack refresh uh to be ready for next-gen Erp and when these obu's will tap on the global navigation satellite system uh to help Transit the current Erp uh from the from the current Gantry based system to one that's less costly to build and maintain uh one that's more space efficient and one that requires short-terly time to implement the next gen Erp also provides additional value added services to motorists such as uh it allows you to give allows us to give them Advanced notifications on charging locations it allows us to give them information on real-time traffic going Beyond congestion traditional congestion pricing okay so uh what lies ahead for how uh next gen can support the future of Road pricing policy again happy to share some personal thoughts in this slide and next uh again uh but these do not necessarily reflect lta's official position okay from a technical point of view uh next gen definitely allows us more flexible expansion of congestion pricing and other pricing policies such as distance based pricing uh however um that doesn't actually seem to be a very strong argument for fundamentally changing the congestion framework congestion pricing framework that I just elaborated in the previous slide especially post pandemic the impetus for changes even less apparent well this is because uh the CBD quadrant pricing has been zero since the start of the pandemic and it has remained so even to today as we transition into an endemic a new Norm uh just about three four months ago it is really the first time since 1975 that car traveled into the CBD has been zero rated and go some low traffic volumes at some locations have returned to pre-pandemic levels uh flexi work patterns have resulted in a structural shift in traffic Peaks which are better smoothing out now and so uh of the 77 Gantry is that we're in operation uh before the pandemic only 19 are operating as of today but beyond congestion pricing there are bigger structural shifts on the horizon so under our Singapore green plan 2030 we have a national net zero emissions Target by 2050 and so to achieve this target the land transport sector needs to decarbonize by 80 from our 2016 Peak because the sector currently contributes over 15 of our carbon emissions hence uh in what we are now calling a carbon constraint we need a Greener land transport system with less private Vehicles especially internal combustion engine vehicles and more active mobility in public transport use yeah so now I'm actually deliberately decoupling the word congestion from pricing here because as I've just alluded to the road pricing of future may have other broader social objectives Beyond congestion management uh again uh some of the ideas in the slides are not implemented or even planned yet uh and of course they do and some of them do up to stick over one next gen was uh designed for but uh some of some of these uh potential ideas on how we can think about uh the pricing of the future um as follows so if we need to make deeper Cuts in our land charts by carbon emissions uh beyond what we have committed to so far mileage-based charging and supported by next year and of course uh could be a part of the policy mix and some some academics in Singapore have suggested this precisely relatedly there could be differential charging for vehicles of different carbon emissions intensity so petrol or gasoline and diesel cars could be charged at a higher rate than EVS or zero emissions vehicles uh for example uh in fact in London uh drivers of pure EVS are currently Exempted from paying its congestion charge and I also note from work done by the Minetta Transportation Institute in the U.S that there is actually some support for green framing of Road user charges uh now a future Technologies may allow us to be nimbler in setting up new charge points allowing us to preemptively shape driving behavior in anticipation of our road Reclamation or road report person should we wish to and our tradable driving credits which have been discussed in the transportation literature can put a heart cap on the aggregate number of vehicle miles driven in any given time frame and of course if we wanted to do that that needs to be supported by usage readings that can be collected by the authority so it is this a hot cap on a vehicle ownership that will briefly turn to Nyx in the remaining five minutes or so okay Singapore's vehicle ownership policies complement those that Target vehicle usage since the 1950s we have rolled out vehicle ownership measures in the form of taxes and import duties but the car population continued to rise it surged by about 65 from 1980 to 1989 and study by some Singaporean economists in 1990 found that income elasticity of class was about plus two while the price elasticity was just under a minus 0.5 so in the 80 Days of the 1980s where we had very rapid growth personal income so Rising rapidly taxation policy by itself would struggle to obtain the current population so this situation resulted in the introduction of a vehicle Coda system in 1990 allowing the government to exercise more effective control over the vehicle population in the country we set a quarter on the number of new vehicles registered in Singapore each year based on the allowable growth rate that we accessed to be sustainable in the long term so anyone who wants to register a new vehicle would first need to bid for a certificate of entitlement we call that Coe and that's better for 10 years our renewals are possible at the prevailing holders premium Coes are allocated through a fortnightly auction mechanism with the successful bidders paying a uniform price of highest and successful price plus one dollar a current allowable growth rate for cars and motorcycles is at zero percent so meaning that quotas available for bidding comes purely from the the registrations of the scripting of vehicles uh uh that um that are coming from the stock and so no new growth is allowed so I have just uh touched on the effectiveness and the efficiency principles of our vqs let me briefly now turn to the other principles that we think are important as well for the overall design and and here we are trying to strike a balance between these five principles uh in designing the vqs now on Equity uh we need to have a system that is fair for all existing and prospective vehicle owners so we try to do that by number one making cos time limited to 10 years and number two by having separate coder categories so as you can see uh we have two categories for class uh category a for the mass Market costs category B for the luxury cost um category C is for commercial vehicles D for motorcycles and E can be it's an open category they can be used to register any other vehicle except a motorcycle yeah so this categorization encompasses some elements of our social Equity within the vqs so for example motorcycle buyers do not have to bid with the buyers of the larger luxury Vehicles who more likely have the higher purchasing power likewise the mass market car buyers do not also compete with the luxury car buyers in the bidding process so while we note that uh from the ideal efficiency design perspective you should have a single car category we have decided to retain that distinction of two the A and the B and very briefly on responsiveness and stability as vehicles are deregistered um the intent is to replace the supply as promptly as we can while attempting to smoothen the volatility uh over time so by for example determining the codes are that is available for bidding uh based on the number of some moving average of the vehicle D registered over the previous four quarters okay now uh in the last minute or so remaining as I conclude um so I'd like to remind everyone that Singapore's vehicle ownership and usage measures are trailblazing as they are are just one pillar of our plans to build a more resilient and sustainable land transport system we have a 20 minute pound 45 minutes City Vision with mass adoption of what we call walk cycle ride modes simply put by 2040 1910 active Mobility public transport and shared transport Journeys during the peak period will be completed within 45 minutes so how would we get there Mike spoke a bit about congestion pricing and carpooling being complementary so I'm going to give you another sunbite which is congestion pricing and good public transport are also complementary so we are going to expand the public transport system that will be 360 kilometers of rail network by 2030 which will help connect 8 in 10 households to within 10 minutes of the train station we completed a major bus service and enhancement program uh in the mid-20 times we expected the bus fee by 35 improving the capacity of bus services uh we will press on with polycentricity to bring jobs closer to home uh bringing more homes in the business Central business district into this intensifying the land use of the transport nodes and uh finally we will be facilitating sustainable transport and green uh commutes uh we'll be expanding uh cycling path uh we will be developing car light precincts and uh we will also be uh an encouraging Greener commutes facing our internal combustion engines and uh electrifying more of our buses and with that uh I just want to thank you for listening
