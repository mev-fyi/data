well it's a delight and an honor to speak after these two people uh I'll be trying to respond to some of the points that they gave and so you'll see that my slides are kind of uh I'll be repeating some points but hopefully with a little bit of a Twist uh and that twist is that uh for the past uh five years or so um myself and a bunch of students at Stanford have been working pretty closely with the San Francisco School District to redesign their Student Assignment policy and this was prompted by a board resolution in 2018 to redesign Student Assignment they were already using school choice but they wanted to redesign it to improve diversity predictability proximity all liter lens of equity of access and so if you want to read about the initial stuff we did there to inform their selection of a new policy in 2020 that's in this EC paper that we published in 2022. okay but uh kind of prompted by my experiences there I want to start by asking uh like what are we trying to solve for when we design these student assignment uh settings and uh in San Francisco we saw is that there are potentially other objectives in student assignment Beyond just giving parents the schools that they choose right uh so uh Derek kind of alluded to this but perhaps uh one reason we might like choice is that we think it's a way to identify good schools and what Prague was kind of pointing to is maybe our goal is to assign kids to these good schools to the ones where they'll be able to learn the most that was very important in the San Francisco redesign was this Equity idea and so there's a lot of research in the economics of Education literature and just the education literature in general uh to sort of documenting um growing gaps in academic achievement between white students and black students at the level of you know two two to five grade levels of difference between white black students across different states um and uh also research showing that often a lot of these gaps are correlated with things about who is being assigned to which schools right and so there's Recent research from the Stanford Educational Opportunity project that shows that if we have a racial minority students concentrating in high poverty schools this is really correlated with the highest racial academic achievement gaps and so there's this idea okay maybe we want to improve learning equitably and so and for that reason we might also care about diversity okay and so if we take these as some of our potential objectives we look at how Choice maps onto this uh one thing we find is that uh choice not might not always be a very good proxy for these other goals all right and so parag is a bunch of work uh showing that a choice might not really accurately reflect School quality Effectiveness or value add and um there's also work showing that choice might not capture other distributional District level goals such as diversity so if you're interested in kind of hearing about like the on the ground the social kind of dynamics of what's going on really interesting podcast is the nice white parents podcast one of the points they made in this was this idea of a bliss Point um there's this um often parents will talk about good schools and they ask well how are parents defining a good school what makes a school that a parent is comfortable with and so there's this paper that asks well how many white kids are needed at school to make other white families feel comfortable choosing that school and I uh fortuitously completely by accident covered the answer 26. foreign okay so Choice might not capture other distributional goals such as diversity and this was something that we saw in the data that we had from San Francisco as well okay so what I'm showing you here is a couple of maps on the left I'm showing a redlining map from the 30s so for those of you who don't know redlining was a practice that was very common across the US that systematically denied families that lived in these certain Red Blocks in this map access to a lot of different Financial Resources such as mortgages and other loans okay and so what this does is if you're denying access to to wealth for a whole bunch of families well they're gonna be poor in that generation and that those effects are going to compound over time right and so what I'm showing you on the right is again San Francisco now in 2018 and I have two things here in the background I have a heat map this is the percentage of students living in each attendance area those blocky things those are areas around schools who are eligible for free reduce price lunch okay so this is data that's collected by the school district it's very commonly used in educational research as a measure of socioeconomic need okay so you can see the darker areas and the heat map in the back pretty much correspond with the red line blocks in the 30s okay uh on top of that I have a superimposed uh these circles the circles are the schools the elementary schools and the red circles are the 50 of schools which have the highest percentage of students attending the school who are eligible for free reduced price sludge okay and so this is in 2018 and so San Francisco has been using a district-wide choice System since 2011 and one of the goals or desired outcomes of using Choice was to disentangle residential and school segregation the idea is maybe even though our neighborhoods are pretty segregated socioeconomically as we can see in the heat map if we let you go to schools that are anywhere across the district the schools don't have to be segregated in the same ways okay and what we see is seven years after switching to the choice system we basically have the same segregation patterns in the schools compared to the neighborhoods the interesting thing is when we look closer at the data it's not that everyone is just going to school close to home there's something in the preferences where people are actually going further to school but they're self-segregating again um into patterns that look a lot like the patterns of the neighborhoods okay oh so I guess um one call here is is to kind of think about well how can we design these marketplaces when we do have these liver goals when we have distributional goals like diversity and so I forgot to include a slide on this but there's a I think a lot of um work just kind of assumes we can use reserves we can use priorities but the question of how do we precisely design those reserves and priorities to achieve these goals is one I think that's a little bit understudied and could be really interesting okay so now let me respond a little bit the points made by parag and Derek uh so first uh Barack raised this idea of resource augmentation and I'm going to take that and rephrase the question a little bit uh other policies that move Beyond market clearing just kind of shuffling things around to allow for some kind of Pareto Improvement okay and I'm going to give a couple of uh examples motivated by what we've been seeing in the San Francisco School District if we actually match those up to what perox paper is saying some of these may have much smaller impacts than just closing failing schools but I think um there's still interesting questions worth studying in part because some of these may be more politically feasible than and closing schools I think closing schools is a very contentious Topic in a lot of districts okay so one thing that came up for us when we were talking about San Francisco um it is perhaps we could shift resources around okay so there's this assumption um in when the district moved to full choice that uh if we let anyone apply to any school that means they can access any school right San Francisco is a pretty big District okay um it's a lot of miles across I think it's like seven miles in diameter and it takes over half an hour um to get from one side to the other side and even more in rush hour traffic okay and so you don't really have effective access to schools that are all the way across the district unless you really really really want to go there okay and so what I'm showing you here um the red uh things are the San Francisco all the elementary schools in the district uh and the bluish ones are the ones that have Spanish immersion programs these are a very popular language programs in the district you can see those programs are really concentrated in one area of the district and so there is this uh sort of suggestion uh early on that it didn't pan out because of political issues but there's a suggestion maybe we can take these programs that a parents value and maybe we can kind of move them around a bit spread them more equitably across the district so that everyone has something that they like that's a little bit closer to them okay and you don't have to go across the district in order to be able to go to a Spanish conversion program okay so this sort of joint problem how do we move around resources um and look at what we expect the the choice outcomes to be after moving around those resources and we can also layer in all these other things we mentioned before about designing priorities or reserves or other distributional outcomes like diversity how can we sort of jointly make all of these decisions okay another obvious resource augmentation and you know what resource can we add we can add schools and so that's also something that came up in San Francisco uh sort of a big topic of discussion in the past few years has been this new mission-based school that is being built um and so um yeah I just wanted to point out that this this idea of what are the effects of moving around existing resources or adding resources is something that came up a lot even just in the policy discussion that was going on in San Francisco okay but what can we do from a research research active I think there's a lot of questions here that people have already started looking into so for example in terms of adding resources on top of opening schools we could also just add seats at schools or you know move teachers around to to create more capacity at schools and this is something that has been looked at by a couple of groups of people in addition I think there's also some room to to shift preferences without necessarily changing the squalls themselves right and so we can think of peer effects right there's a basically a lot of work is showing that parents aren't really looking at school Effectiveness they're looking at their peers and and which which appears they want their kids to go to schools with and then that accounts for a lot of the choice patterns and so perhaps it's possible if we do some kind of I don't know Community cohesion approach or we take some more General approach to incorporating effects we can Pareto improve without um yeah we can Pareto improve if we're able to include that in our modeling and then everyone's already mentioned already a lot of these papers on information provision and nudging uh in addition I think shifting preferences um can be thought of as some kind of resource augmentation for the following reason that they can actually incentivize more resources to come in to the district okay specifically I'm talking about the fact that school choice is not a closed system right so when we have our Public Schools as was alluded to before we have this we also have charter schools and maybe we can try to unify these using unified enrollment but we also have private schools right and more and more we're seeing that a lot of families are well well-off families are opting out of the public school system altogether and just going to private school and that does affect the resources that are available to the districts because there's a lot of reasons but a few of them are that resources available from the state and federal sources are often based on enrollment how many people are enrolled at the school and then also a lot of resources also at schools are generated by PCA parent teacher associations right and so if a lot of the wealthy parents are opting out of the system altogether then a lot of that funding is just not available at the schools and so if we can sort of improve preferences I know I started out by saying maybe we are indexing too much on choice but the reason we might still care about choice if we're thinking about resource augmentation is that this could incentivize families to stay it could also incentivize teachers to stay we could think about you know the assignment problem of how do we assign teachers to schools and there's a little bit of work on this by Juliana and co-authors um but like that could also address a problem that there's a growing teacher shortage it's been growing since um the 2010s and about 50 of teachers who were surveyed in a 2022 National survey said that they have seriously considered leaving the profession and so there's this endemic teacher shortage and so can we sort of design various systems that incentivize agents to stay in the school system building off this idea that school choice is not a closed system there's a lot of other interesting directions I'm just going to quickly name them and then move on from here and so uh what other assistance interact with school choice schools and housing and so we might ask well if we change the student assignment uh what does that mean for where people live and then what does that mean for the property taxes and the funding for the schools and then how does that mean for a student assignment and so Aram who is think somewhere yes um has a paper on this and some of my co-authors at collaborators at Stanford also uh looked at the effects of certain geographically indexed policies on residential sorting and and so one of my collaborators is expert and gentrification and so he found this really interesting thing where there is there are these policies that give top priority to students who live in certain areas these areas where those which had historically low test scores the idea is you know historically educationally disadvantaged we're going to give you priority and so he found that all these areas that were given priority the sort of ones that had the the most uh expensive housing went through traumatic a dramatic gentrification because everyone is moving into that small number of blocks to try to get this special priority okay so you know what what other systems are interacting with school choice what are the incentives that this induces in those systems and then how does that affect the priorities that we've been designing in choice um given that we have outside systems and these systems often don't talk to each other for example in our case we have no idea what's going on with private school enrollment and also students who just go to private school and never participate in public school enrollment Public School assignment and so there's also this question of how do we manage this incomplete information about these outside systems and I have a little bit of work okay uh Now to respond briefly to Derek um I think one of his questions is one of the points that he made was that uh we were trying to use information um to kind of do two things at once right we're trying to use information to give parents information that they can use to make informed choices when going to school but then we're also trying to collect information to try to kind of audit how well schools are doing and I think that was a helpful kind of separation for me to think about okay there are these like different kinds of information that we might want to collect and these different kinds of information we might want to provide so I'm going to spend a couple of minutes just thinking about that first kind what how much information do we need to give to parents for them to make an informed choice and has been as it has been said before uh a lot of parents don't have full information there's a lot of suggestive evidence we see this in San Francisco as well what I'm showing you here are histograms of the number of programs that applicants to kindergarten listed so this is out of like 150 programs right people are listing a median of around five programs okay and we see differences by race and socioeconomic status and I'm showing it to you here just by race you can see that my black and African-American families are listing way fewer squalls than white families okay and so so what are the effects of this unequal access well first why are they even listing these short preference lists uh we got some anecdotal Reasons from parents and also the District staff some of this is they're actually forming accurate beliefs about their likelihood of getting into schools and not listing more schools than they need but sometimes they also form inaccurately and then they list fewer schools but then also sometimes it's just costly to figure out which schools that you're interested in so parents misunderstand the system or think that they don't need to put more schools kind of like in Adam's trailer paper um and then they just stop listing schools and the effect is that um if you're not listing schools then you're more likely to be unassigned or assigned to a school that you didn't list and so a lot of this nudging paper has basically taken this first approach um to uh sort of addressing this problem of costly information acquisition let's increase information provided to less informed groups through nudges or recommendation systems and I think this is a really interesting really exciting area in fact we took the approach by Adam at Al in the Chile paper and we tried applying it to the San Francisco school district and we asked what if we kind of lengthen the lists of some of these students who are submitting short lists and we also um did some Choice modeling to try to predict how they would sort of augment their lists okay uh what we found is that in our case this augmentation was actually leading to congestion okay uh people were mostly applying to schools that um were already full or adding schools that were already full and as a result they were not seeing a big impact and if they were they were kicking out other students right so the effects were kind of mixed um it was not clear that that was the right approach in our setting and so I think another approach that I don't really know how to think about which is really interesting is thinking about decreasing the amount of information that is needed in order to interact well with the system right and so I think going back to what Derek was saying well maybe what people need to know is like their admission to Chances right or Derek had three things but that's the one I remember because that's also a point that I make in one of my papers um this is um so I have this paper with um Nicola Marley Jacob Lush known Brendan lucier looking trying to model um what happens in matching markets with costly information acquisition um and one of the points that we make is well maybe what you need to know is your chance of getting into a school and so here's like a really nice picture from uh Israeli missions in 2020 we looked at admissions University admissions in lots of different countries all across the world this one was really interesting because what they do is they have these two cutoffs okay um you have your National score exam score and then if your exam score is above the cutoff you can definitely get into this program okay if your score is below the product so it's the red part you definitely cannot get into this program and then there's this gray area where they're actually saying we're not sure but they're updating it as preferences and admission applications are coming in and so that seems like a really interesting approach and there's a general question of like what is sort of the sufficient information that people need to know okay so that's all I had to say thank you for listening
