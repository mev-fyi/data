thank you thank you um so this is work with uh Andrei uh with Rafael Matthew that are here Pedro unfortunately couldn't come uh what this paper tries to talk about are the drivers of um macroeconomic and financial volatility well it's well known that the aggregate economy is volatile subject to business cycle fluctuations uh in which sectors expand and contract together it's also well known that the stock market displays a significant price volatility and Schiller famously documented that this volatility is excessive if you compare it to what would be reasonable on the basis of fundamentals such as earnings and dividends and these two types of volatility the financial one and the real one are kind of connecting because it's also well known that the stock market and other Financial indicators predict future real activity so how to make sense of these things if you start from the you know conventional approach business Cycles the idea is you know there are shocks that hit the economy these are the sources of volatility and they are transmitted among other things through rational expectations of Agents you know that's a starting point but it's hard for me to get the excess Financial volatility which is on top of what uh changes in fundamentals can account for so there is a conventional way to go to kind of fix the the model by adding variation in required returns of investors like in Risk conversion in the quantity of risk keeping rational expectations to generate significant financial volatility for limited fundamental volatility the problem with this approach is that it's hard to measure directly it's hard to measure directly changing risk aversion and also changes in the quantity of risk and insofar as you look at available evidence on expectations of future stock returns this contradicts the rational models because expectations tend to be high in Good Times not in bad times so what we do with this paper we try to uh pursue an approach that you know it's in some sense uh very neoclassical it relies on fundamental shocks but relaxes the rational expectation assumption and does it empirically uh we are going to look at data on the expectations of stock analysts about future fundamentals of listed firms so we are going to start with this microdate of individual firms and then aggregate them up into Market level measures and in previous work we showed that this kind of expectations depart from uh conventional uh rational expectations in the sense that they overreact to news they move too much and also that they help predict stock returns both in the time series and in the cross section here we are going to you know make a further step in order to connect these expectations to the aggregate economy and also to aspects of the financial markets what is going to emerge out of our analysis is that there is an index which we call LTG which is expectations of long-term growth so the long term here it's really important uh that helps you account for significant price volatility in the stock market for volatility and predictable reversals in other financial markets in bond markets short and long terms and also in credit spread which is an important barometer for uh the the the the credit cycle and that these also connect to standard business cycle indicators they help you predict volatility in investment and other uh and other quantities that I will talk about so we are not the first here uh coming with the idea that long-term expectations could help you reconcile Financial volatility and real volatility in the general theory Keynes talks a lot about long-term expectations and he calls them animal spirits and these Animal Spirits he describes them as beliefs that are very volatile because of the uncertain nature of what's going to come a few years down the line and it puts them at the center of the Nexus between uh financial markets and investment and in a sense we kind of provide evidence consistent with this approach there is of course other work in macro we are related to one is the work you know looking at expectations and news uh shocks here the difference of our approach is focus on expectations data and our expectations are not tightly connected to Future productivity as the standard news approach because expectations depart from rationality the second type of work is work on investment Cycles investment is really Central in what we are doing here but the type of volatility investment comes from beliefs it does not come from changing prices it could work through the supply of funds it could work through the demand of funds but it's not through changes in the cost of investment Goods per se and then there is a growing work in departures from rational expectations in macro and this contributes to that with measurement and also with the long-term Focus so first I want to talk to you about LPG and financial volatility I'll show you how we get make progress on Schiller and other financial markets and then I will look at real investment and other business cycle indicator so uh so Schiller excess volatility puzzle this is the you know uh discount uh dividend discount model that is started from the price of a stock is the present value of future dividends at the constant discount rate are and this idea was that because the dividends and the expectations of future dividend growth don't move very much uh then you know this fundamental variation would be unable to account for the price variation that we see and the way to quantify this was to construct a Price Index P star that would be like a rational price index making an assumption that people are you know a perfect foresight of what future dividends future fundamentals uh would be and what we did here we replicated the Schiller's exercise you using earnings rather than dividends because these are closer to the measure of expectations that we have but it doesn't really make much of a difference with standard parameterizations for the time period that we have and this is uh 81 2022 the excess volatility puzzle in our sample the green curve is the actual stock market price and the blue curve is the Shiller you know rational expectations and you see that you know it just moves a lot uh relative to what would be predicted by realized fundamentals so the standard way to kind of kind to allow for variation in required return here we take a different route we say let's look at expectations data these are available there are stock analysts that make earnings forecast for the future for individual firms and we have them for short-term earnings per share one or two year ahead this is monthly data and then we have them for long-term earnings which are over a business cycle frequency say three to five years and that's called LTG and we have it for each individual firm each month and so we compute aggregate indices of eps TT plus s earning per share at the market level predicted for you know next year or two years down the line and we do the same for LTG foreign then we construct a price index that rather than using the perfect foresight of dividends uses the expectation indices to compute one year ahead growth earnings expectations two years ahead and then we have LTG now we don't have very long-term expectations so we take LTG to account for earnings growth over the average duration of a business cycle in our sample so up to 10 years ahead and then for the rest we just set expected earnings growth constant to a level that matches the average price level in the sample so of course the success of our method is not to match the average price level but to see whether the changes in the expectation term match kind of the prices that we see in the market as they move over time and so this is what we get the red line is uh our fitted price using expectations it's not perfect but it's a significant improvement over the uh rational expectations Benchmark it does not capture the depressed stock market of the 80s in covid you know when kovid stroke there is a Plunge in our red curve because you know analysts became very pessimistic of earnings but prices stayed high but throughout you see that you capture major episodes in the stock market using this and if you look at the quantitative performance of the index you see that the target which is the empirical standard deviation of the realized stock price over one year that's the First Column is 14.8 percent you know the second column is 0.7 percent the rational price is just very far from it and if you use expectations data you get very close so you get close to solving a Schiller puzzle the question is you know what's the role of non-rationality our expectations non-volatile so volatile that they account for this and one way in which we look at that we say okay let's look at a very standard measure of non-rationality which is the predictability of future forecast errors and here I Define forecast error as the expectations minus the realization and so I predict that forecast error using my current index of LTG and if the correlation is positive it means optimism today means systematic disappointment in the future in the form of realizations below current expectations so we do it for um several uh measures of you know expectations about uh future earnings one year ahead expectations that is the first row two years ahead expectation second row and five years ahead expectation third row in all of these cases you see that our index of long-term growth expectations tends to predict the future disappointment for several quarters ahead and these are forecast errors defined zero contemporaneously to the predictor LTG one expectations one quarter after two two quarters after and so on and so forth so there is this persistent excess optimism when today LTG is high in the last uh row what we show is the correlation of LTG our expectation index with expectations of future stock returns by CFOs of large U.S firms now if you uh where in a world in which in Good Times there are low expected returns low risk Premia you would expect that correlation to be negative contemporaneously and in the nearby quarters if anything it's positive which is really telling us that periods in which LPG is high are periods in which markets are optimistic and they expect if anything stock returns to be high in the future so this is kind of underscoring the idea that we are capturing with this index periods of excess optimism and as we show in related work this helps you to predict return so it connects to market inefficiency the same index connects not just to the level of price volatility but also to return predictability both over time and in the cross section so if you look at this you know you now have found this measure that helps you think about financial volatility without much variation needed in uh required returning kind of hard to measure things and what if I bring it to other markets well it is not difficult to bring it to other Market you know if you start from a canonical macro Finance model because you know this bias is in expectations actually look a lot like a Time varying stochastic discount Factor so these are two very conventional equations the first for the current risk-free rate the second for the average realized excess return on a risky asset in the future and Omega T it's an index of current excess optimism that wouldn't be present in the standard model but as we show can be derived from a model of diagnostic expectations in which you overreact to the current shock and there's this Omega T reverts back as expectations are disappointed so it's very standard except for this Omega T where this Omega T however and that's the important thing can be tested because you can Benchmark it against the measured expectations okay so it gives rise to a set of empirical prediction the first prediction focusing on the risk-free rate is that if you are in a period in which Omega T is large there's a lot of optimism that's a period in which future marginal utility is low and so the current risk free rate is large but then this also predicts that in the future the risk-free rate will revert back because expectations get disappointed if you actually look at the equation here you see the last two terms capture both mean reversions the Omega T terms tells you the mean reversion due to beliefs reverting the MU GT terms is fundamental mean reversion in earnings growth the second equation for the average realized return on the risky asset is giving you additional prediction now the only source of time variation is not the fundamental mean reversion but it's like the beliefs Dynamic the Omega T thing and what is telling us is that good news means High realized returns okay or high prices for risky assets but then going forward disappointing returns low average realized risk premium which are not the expected ones okay and so we look at the credit spread for this and what this is saying is that periods in which LTG increases you get good news you would expect low credit spread but then increases in credit spreads in the future so we tested these predictions looking at local projections for the one-year change in Three Financial Market indicator one year and 10-year T bills and then the baa spread in which our shock variable is the change in LTG over the last four quarter and then we include uh you know a large set of controls we control for 12 lugs of the dependent variable to capture fundamental risk aversion we can we capture changes in the policy rate yearly CPI inflation and the S P 500 returns and this is the type of you know financial markets volatility that we get the consistent with the predictions of the model growing optimism higher LTG revision predict increasing interest rates at Short Horizon but then a systematic Decline and also predict a reduction in the credit spread in the short term but then an increase in the credit spread in the future so let me just uh close in the last minute with the connection to the aggregate economy and what the connection would here be that when there are optimistic expectations about the future you get more lending and cheaper risky lending and you also have more demand for Capital by entrepreneurs and so an expansion in investment so here we perform therefore the same type of local projections but with respect to the growth of the investment to Capital ratio and what we see is the same pattern Improvement in LPG is associated with near-term higher growth in real investment up to 2.5 percent extra four quarters out but then you know in the future a drop in investment Associated potentially with a reversal in expectations and to look at that reversal we actually control for the forecast errors in this regression these are the errors that analysts systematically make in the future on the basis of their current expectations and what you see here is that the change in LTG the news in expectations is associated with the investment boom but the errors are associated with the future disappointment so you can link financial and real volatility by using expectations data that put structure on the disappointment and the boom and bust dynamics of these two markets thank you thank you very much
