i want to thank everyone for being here and just so that everyone knows we're going to have presentations to maybe around six a little bit after uh people can make comments from the floor if you'd like and there will be buses going back to this nest at 6 30. so uh so many thanks for being here for this tribute to robert vogel or bob as we learned to call him i remember when i just got my phd and bob called me into his office and he said you can now call me bob and i said thank you mr fogel generous humane brilliant a visionary thoughtful humorous enthusiastic and an eternal optimist as all of us know who would give him stuff that we didn't believe in but he did a mentor a teacher a scholar a friend a beacon and an incredible debater you never wanted to say no to bob so what would our discipline be like had there been no robert fogle that's a very difficult counter factual i can't run the complete experiment i really haven't thought about exactly how to do it but i do know a couple of things number one there would be no dae program in the nbr and therefore there'd be no summer institute for the dae and so he wouldn't be here some of us would not be economic historians i know i would not have been one bob got me to be an economics journal and we would not have the memories and the stories that we're going to share with you today now bob was known to most people through his writings this week through his writings from railroads and i put the dates down because i think that they're very interesting so in 1960 that was the book the union pacific railroad was the book from his master's thesis at columbia and he was 35 years old and if you're wondering what he did with all the other years you have to read his autobiography uh and it goes until uh this year when at 88 years old he wrote political arithmetic and what's interesting is how many books are after 1989 and of course he won the nobel in 1993. so that's the way most people know bob through all of the writings for railroads to slavery to health and population and demography but many of us were fortunate to have known him very well and we're going to have 13 stories of bob as co-author and teacher and co-teacher and mentor and guide and friend in college and the stories are going to show bob to have been an immensely humorous and generous person a hobbyist and even in my story at hippie wannabe i was the hippie um and i set some rules and uh and the rules are that each person has no more than three minutes and each one of us could go on for hours okay so that's why i said three minutes um and each person is to present a true story about bob and the story has to be from the heart and you can't have any notes that was those are the ground rules now we were to begin with stan and stan is back in the hotel but he did tell me a bit about what he was going to say part of it was going to be about the beginnings of the dae and he was going to talk about how bob fogle brought together a group of people bob goldman and lance davis and clean pope and me and stan and himself we all had to go to north carolina to chapel hill because at the time bob goldman couldn't fly so we had to go to him and we went there and that was the executive committee we'd go there and we would eat and bob would record what we were doing except because he would only record while we were eating the recordings all you could hear is the waiters and the dishes and then the d.a was formed and this group was the executive committee and every time we would have a meeting the executive committee would go out and have a really good dinner okay and so stan's story was that when i took over the executive committee got together without me and said there goes the dinner and stan said there goes the executive committee so i'm going to go now to hoyt and each person will say what they would like to say and i just request they stay somewhere between here and here because that's where i'm focused and this is for the bureau website okay you're breaking the rule of no notes okay thank you so the story i want to tell is really a story about stories because bob i think if you if you title it it would be something like spinning yarns for intellectual engagement so it starts with the when i first got to chicago and i asked for an appointment with then professor fogel as the as the nomenclature went and i said maybe a half an hour and they kind of chuckled at me the staff of the cp because i since learned that there are no half-hour meetings with bob fogle because you know once you get unhooked on an interesting topic that the yarn starts spinning and spinning and you find you know the threads go this way and that way and they kind of come back together we've had a number of these meetings over time uh you know my sometimes my wife would call me in the middle of them and she came to understand i would text her meeting fogel and she knew that that meant i probably wasn't coming over dinner or whatever right because that was just the way these things went um but very just a tremendous sense of intellectual engagement and i thought when we had these things and so you know we ran a workshop together for the time that we coincided at chicago and i got to see some of these stories and how they fit together and and more recently you know he he wanted to one thing that i was really impressed about is that he wanted to stay engaged in the classroom um with students with research uh certainly i think many of us when we get to our upper 80s we if we're lucky enough to be metabolizing that's maybe not going to be what we choose to do with our time um but he wanted to do that because for him that was leisure um and you know it's something that he enjoyed so much so i had the opportunity towards the end to help him stay in the classroom and i kind of redesigned the classroom experience to be basically we get to talk and then he gets to spin his yarns and i think he didn't actually appreciate how good he was at it because you know he spoke to um his nurse susan i forget his last name brought him into the first class and you know people once they get to a certain age they're not aware of how loud they're talking and he says in our first class he says well come early because i don't think this is going to work out and and so it turns out i think it worked out pretty well he said it worked out it was one of these things that we started to talk i think i forget if i was presenting that there we had some students presenting that day and you know we get to some point and then the yards start spinning right then everything was there was you know each time you did this there was usually this reaction from the classroom and often from me too where is this going right because it starts off in this thing and it comes here and goes back to it and and eventually you come back to this thing and it's amazing like the tapestry that emerged from these yarns that were spun uh you know one example i give that is not the best one but is the easiest one to relate quickly is what i came to call the spinach story which is whenever we got to the subject of life expectancy or healthcare or something like that we learned that bob fogle really liked to eat spinach and then he would go out his mother would send him out to the store and buy the spinach and he'd come back and he he actually he didn't immediately eat it he said it was actually he had to spend all this time washing it because when he was a boy it was more sand than spinach by weight um and then he says well nowadays you know all that labor service is bundled with the spinach and all this and all the students are like the things they're like why is he saying that he's um healthcare it was one of these things that you know he would bring this thing that you would that's kind of seemingly orthogonal that really illustrates a point and he says well you know healthcare is kind of like that too because it's like bundling all this stuff that you know we look at healthcare expenditure but we we you know if that's all you do you sort of miss the the quality aspect of it um and so you know it was a very again that that sort of approach to helping you think about things by taking you in three different directions and bringing you back was just a sign of a very active and engaged mind and one that uh uh was was interested in following questions where they may how's my time that's probably my three minutes so i'm not timing anyone okay so that's that's what i'll say just to say it was a real privilege for me to be able to have that experience with him and be in the classroom and again be part of the intellectual engagement the bundle of intellectual engagement that he was and enthusiasm that he had for inquiry the overhead light turn off the yeah turn off the overhead and get that last rough lights on well you look really good with words caution thank you yes is it again uh how this would affect media today so the story i want to tell you is about how i complained about my grade so i had written a paper for his course the first course and it was about social rates of return so there are different ways of computing the social rate of return and they're all you know they each had to answer a different historical question so they're all kind of valid right and i get i get the paper back and it says this is this is a publishable paper here you should come and see me about this right and for me this was just thrilling because i had never nobody had ever said anything then i noticed that the grade is a b so i i went into bob's office this is one of the first times that i really had a conversation with them and you know i said professor fogel do you really think this is a publishable paper he said oh yes you there was somebody else who had written something similar i think in a different semester and you should work with him and you should write it up as a note for the journal of economic history right wow so then i said well professor fogel i think you made a mistake about the grade right because you just came to me and in this part i remember 100 he looks at me and he said hugh this is the university of chicago we have much higher standards here than they do at the journals they publish all kinds of crap journals he said and then to to prove it to me he took er off the shelf behind me opened up to a paper by a well-known labor economist and he begins to demolish it and so for 15 or 20 minutes the data is no good the model makes no sense and then he kind of closes it up it's all crap i said oh thank you professor okay so my story takes place in the spring of 1970 and i have been working on my work on urban slavery and i realized that i should go to the archives to do the chapel hill to the southern historical collection and really do the real work not just sit in the library read papers from you know newspapers from richmond virginia and and so in addition i learned that bob and stan working on a project it was pretty big project and had something to do with slavery but i wasn't quite certain why and they also wanted stuff from the archives so was determined that i would go first and so bob said to marilyn get our plane ticket and so marilyn got me a plane ticket and i went i went there and then i came back and i walked into bob's office and as everyone who knows him knows he was sitting down and he had a big smile and he had a cheshire grin smiling from ear to ear and i walked in and he greeted me warmly and he said before we discuss what you found did you give marilyn all your receipts and i said i don't have receipts i don't know anything you've ever seen he said that's okay we can deal with that then just tell her what you spent money on i said well i didn't spend money on anything and he looked at me like i was crazy because after all he had this big nsf grant what was i doing that's only money and he said so well where did you stay at duke i said well i and i used a word that some of you may know i said i crashed on the floor of this guy's house and he wasn't there but he was the boyfriend of a woman i know who has an irish setter he said okay he said but how did you get to chapel hill because i started on a duke i said oh that's pretty simple you take 147 you transfer you go to the 15. and he said oh that's good so where is the car seat i said i i hitched and and his i could see he was he looked both frightened and perplexed and then he he didn't know where to go from there and then he said well for where'd you stay in chapel hill you know i could see he was a little fearful of what i was going to say i said oh oh i said i walked into the southern historical collection and i saw a researcher a woman and i said well where where should i stay and she said you must stay with me and she had an apartment and it faced a garden and it was just beautiful and the the archives closed at 5 30 so a group of us went bowling every night and then we had pizza and i could see in his eyes as many of us know there was this twinkle the radical in him had reappeared and he was the hippie one of them like and then he said to me with the twinkle he said you know stan stan is going to go to the arm cards next why don't you call him and tell him what to do [Laughter] i never again went to an archive on bob's nickel as he would have said without him renting me a car and getting a hotel and we go to rick steckel who's going to talk about bob as guide to the world of empiricism well as someone who's known bob almost as long as claudia my meeting was in the spring of 71 and i was at the end of my first year as a graduate student in chicago having transferred from the university of oklahoma i spent a few years there because i was an economics major who had no mathematics and a history minor like both fields but i had a good mentor he said look if you want to get a phd and become a professor go to some school take a lot of math statistics semicolon transfer to one of the major graduate programs so that's what i did took a lot of math and actually almost became a mathematician at least was offered a fellowship in that area and that george stigler had come down to norman to give a talk i knew his son while i was at oberlin and used to shoot pool saturday nights and so we got talking about that experience and applying to chicago he said sure why does chicago come up well he turned out to be my advisor for four years where he's selling my course assignment uh offerings sheet and anyway i needed a job so i like all graduate students i committed a lot of skills in programming and math and so on and asked around where could i work and someone said well there's this guy bob fogel who has you know big projects going forward by jazz kim so i went over and made an appointment and he was in this little tiny office in the main office often i know claudia knows and marilyn was tucked away in a tiny cubicle next to that and so i go in and say hello he has a tape recorder going conversation with me what is he going to do with my words i had already heard about the railroad work and before photo and after fall gold dfa up all that stuff why does he want to know anything about me but anyway it goes on for some half an hour i have two projects a principles book and a slavery book and the principles book is going to be totally different because it's going to be more inductive than deductive and i'm going to organize all the data around empirical evidence that's going to lead to some generalizations very much in the kuznets tradition and then there's this slavery book and that sounds interesting too what should i do it wasn't quite like flipping a coin in my mind but i i went for the slavery okay go over to the library and start reading all the works you can find by ub phillips now i thought he said hubie h-b-i-e and there are people named but i couldn't find him in the life and i was too fearful of going back to ask him so i went through all the phillipses in the card until i found ones that that was slavery and it was eureka barnell of course and uh started reading them and would report back to him regularly on what i had found and what i thought of that interpretation of the past and it went on from there we met on a regular basis every week or two had long conversations not only about this work but about simon kuznets and the empirical tradition which is uh he's very much descended from simon kuznets in his approach there's just you can see it straight through in this book but i will tell you because we had kuznets stories too uh that came out of this these kinds of conversations the first time he met simon kuznets well simon didn't have a tape recorder but bob came in with a proposal for work on railroads and in there there was a suggestion on how to calculate commodity flows between regions and he gave because that's a two-page summary he looked at it for 10 seconds and then started grilling him so he read the whole thing in 10 seconds uh which bob was always stunned it felt his nuts his capacity there you look up at them and said you propose one way to estimate commodity flows between regions there are three others when you figure out what they are come back and see well listening to the dates that claudia and you rick have mentioned i may actually have known bob longer but not nearly as well because i was neither a student nor a co-author i would just run into him and then of course he got involved with the dae and he talked me into doing some things i don't remember the exact date i met him for the first time but i do remember the second time for some reason namely that he seemed to remember me from the first time and uh said oh tom come over here and meet these people so i remember him better than he remembered me i remember our first meeting at that time but in any case even though i was not one of the students i came up with a small story about his interest in teaching and his generosity well to me at least because back in the 80s i was an advisor in the undergraduate honors program at the university of kansas and we were each given 10-15 students advisors for at least two years if they needed more help we were there for four years and our chief responsibility however was to offer them a tutorial semester-long tutorial in their first year either the fall or spring semester supposed to be on a topic that we thought would not be part of their regular freshman curriculum kind of open their mind to do things and if possible introduce them to your discipline well i didn't think economics tutorial would be all that interesting in the evening for these students so i gave them a tutorial on economic history and i thought well why not have them see what a traditional historian thinks about slavery and then one new new work on time on the cross is all about so i had them read you beat you b phillips that's life and labor in the old south and time on the cross and then i thought well it'd be great if i could get bob or stan to come down and meet with these students talk to bob about coming down giving a seminar to the economics department and then meeting with the students informally and to my surprise i thought i was just politely going to ask bob and then revert to stan you know at this point i was unaware of about generosity and these sorts of things so he said oh i'd be delighted with that and i think he wanted to come down because i offered him the opportunity to talk to some undergraduates now i hadn't yet met the undergraduates and when i did i had some misgivings [Laughter] i have less misgivings now after having heard the stories about it being a hippie wannabe and a mischief with a stain on its own but they were kind of a mixed group half of them belonged in the honor program and the other half didn't they were mixed culturally and socially most noticeably there was a small contingent that probably every other week would come in with long earrings hanging from their ears and their noses and sometimes wearing chains and i thought well this may not go over so well with mom or other members it didn't bother me because i knew what they were up to this class it turns out to be on their way to whatever else they were going to do that evening in this case for this group they were on their way to some place called the outhouse which was lawrence kansas's venue for alternative rock music and since my daughter was an alternative rock musician at the time i knew what this was all about and thought that's fine you can do that but i didn't know if bob would put up with that so anyway he does come down and meets with students and they cleaned up their act they all are a typical college freshman i guess and then i had to go teach a class so i you know here i am telling you about his impact with the teacher without ever having had a classroom on and without actually having watched him teach these kids but now from hearing just these few other anecdotes i can see what happened anyway he talked with him for about an hour i picked him up afterwards and he said gee i thought that went pretty well kind of an interesting bunch of kids and i think we got along okay and so the short run impact of his talking and his kids was the next meeting they were much more interested in the subject the previous four or five weeks you know i'm like trying to pull teeth you know well what do you what do you think about phillips's view on this or that or the other thing oh i haven't felt singing very much anyway after having talked to bob they're in they're kind of prepared and then when we got the time of the cross they're like almost eager to talk about things chafing at the bit was the way i thought about them at the time a little bit of it was because some of them were science majors and they were really interesting but in any case so clearly he had an impact on the larger group of students in the longer run he also had an impact six or seven years later by which time most undergraduates have forgotten who their instructors were i certainly don't remember some guy who came in and talked to them for an hour i get a letter from one of the students the news clippings saying i think this was the guy that talked to us back in 1985 did you know he won the nobel prize [Laughter] and i wrote back and thanked him for that so i thought you know this is amazing have no idea whether any of my students remember me six or seven years later and they're remember remembering this guy obviously this guy remembered me enough to send me the message so after that when i started thinking that maybe this would be a different view of bob fogel and that might be the story i tell i sent i tracked this kid down but no longer a kid he's a professor at ohio state now said given that you remembered bob fogel in the no value you might be interested in this unfortunately and he wrote back and said thanks for saying that he said you know i still have fond memories of that experience and so i thought that was kind of the perfect comment because i think we all have fond memories of our experiences [Applause] okay uh i was not one of bob's students but i was certainly a student of bob's uh for almost 40 years um i had the good fortune to meet him at an economic history seminar early in spring of 1973 and i spoke very briefly with him and about maybe three four weeks later i received this big package in the mail which was a script of time on the cross and it's kind of like what am i going to do with this then he realized i realized i should read it and i actually that was the first true all-nighter that i ever pulled in my life i i got so engrossed reading time on the cross in manuscript form that i stayed up all night and i finished about four o'clock in the morning and reading that like claudia it changed my career choice it changed my life um now i never have worked on anything that bob worked on until i got involved with the railroads but despite that bob was always interested in whatever one was doing he was always it always had really great helpful comments to make he pointed out how naive and misinformed you were on many of these things he would kind of fix you with that gaze of his but he would always soften his his harsh commentary with the the smile and the little laugh that he had but bob you know was both a big data person and a small data person i think the thing that i have carried away from from my experiences with bob aside from his the generosity that people have talked about his willingness to comment on anything is the importance of a single number and i guess that is part of the the statistician that a single number can in fact tell a story but bob was generous he taught me a lot he continues to teach me a lot and we miss it thank you many people here know that i have a life outside of economics i'm a musician nowadays i mostly play classical music but when i was in graduate school at harvard um studying the fog i was a jazz guitarist and i played gigs on occasion a friend of mine who was a pianist he was a casey student philosophy we would play in the area for example we played at the original legal seafoods in england square another time we played a gig at one of the harvard houses in that particular gig we had a bass player he was a african-american guy in his 50s and i could tell from the moment he started playing that i was way out of my league so it was my canvas room and that was because our bass player used to play with the count basic orchestra so i sounded a lot better that gig than i normally did when we were playing i think the piece a new gallon piece take the a train um and i looked up and there was bob fogle he was listening he was snapping his fingers so i talked with him during the break and he told me that he had seen count basie in harlem in the 1940s and i didn't have the presence of mine at the time to realize that that must have been when he was courting his wife i mentioned this you know claudia put up interest in music that's not what this is about it's about interest outside of economics we think of bob as the great workaholic as the saying goes the hardest working man in show business you know the story is that when he won the nobel prize you know he got the phone call at 5 30 in the morning he had already been up for an hour and a half working and he was a really you know hard-working guy but he had interests outside and his interests were at an extremely high level he was a woodworker of great skill almost professional i would say professional level he was a photographer of great skill also almost a professional level i want to make three points about this the first is that this is for younger people in the audience you know it might be you might think that the time that you spend away from your computer is not a good idea because of course you could be writing another article i remember an interview with a member of our group who's not here who was asked when this person was an assistant professor what her hobbies were and her answer was assistant professors have no hobbies i hope that's not the case i think these things enrich us you know they especially enrich us in economic history because we bring our humanity outside of the science to what we do um in box case there's something else that i want i want to say about this in that if i think about what he really was about and what was special about it it wasn't the counter factual it wasn't the technical things it was the architecture all right he had big ideas in mind and big projects but he always could see the architecture of it you could see the beginning the middle the end the overview if you're playing a piece of music you have to have the architecture you don't have the architecture it's just the connection of notes it doesn't mean anything but he had the architecture and if you saw one of the tables that he made in his house you can see that that was there where it came from because you can't make a table that you know is a work of art unless you have the architecture once you get the details right everything has to be in its place and that for me is really what i got from him i didn't emulate him so much of my own work as to see that to see the architecture and to put it together just like a craftsman makes a chair thank you [Applause] michael first met bob fogel uh in september 1965 when i entered the uh the graduate program at the university of chicago and i was enrolled in his uh in his course in american economic history like was called economics 318 and i just arrived at chicago from lsc where i did my master's degree and the lasting impression that i had of bob was his was his warm and generous nature i had a hard time adjusting to the graduate program at chicago after two two wonderful and not too stressful years in london i think i saw 45 plays when i was there i'm also cheap back then and especially challenging to me of chicago was the money macro sequence of the core that we all had to take okay and i'd been immersed in keynesian economics at mcgill and then in canada and then lse and i had teachers like jack weldon and bill phillips and i found it really hard learning how to think in terms of the quantity theory of money as taught by milton friedman i also had a hard time and this people the old veterans from chicago will remember this from that time i had a hard time with a cutthroat competitive atmosphere in chicago with with creepy characters around like like houston stokes and and why um mankind i think maybe a claudia might remember and hugh um and and these guys are looking and they're offering to sell me copies of previous year's core exams okay and trying to steal this trying to steal my classmates so uh into this atmosphere of terror and handle me steph fogle into my life so history his 318 course was really fascinating to me it gave me the feeling that maybe chicago would be okay and when i first signed up for the class and back then economic history and history of economic thought were required courses for the for the phd um i had no idea that i would get into that i would get hooked into economic history i mean i i had these plans from llc that i i'm there i studied i think was called advanced economic theory so i had these sort of thoughts that i'd end up in this stratosphere of of economics so in addition to bob's course being such a treat he was the only professor of chicago who who was accessible his door was was always open and he didn't have a formidable secretary sort of blocking the way he had maryland but she was sort of on the size even so you could just walk right in um and and and i used to just drop by and and schmooze with uh with fog and talk about my doubts about my future in chicago and about economic history and talk about economic history so i'd go in there just as the others said i you know just to say hello and i'd be there for like 45 50 minutes so what happened of course is i continued on chicago i didn't quit and go back to england and i ended up i took a second course in american economic history econ 319 and then i took the economic history of prelim i also overcame my fear of the quantity theory of money and i ended up writing my dissertation with with uh in u.s monetary history with with milton friedman with bob fogle on the committee so um so i mean i don't really have a story to tell about bob i couldn't really remember any of those funny stories but um bob really inspired me both to stick it out of chicago and to become an economic historian and his warmth generosity and enthusiasm for his research and for economic history is what i will always remember
