really delighted to be talking to you today about Mobility facts perceptions and policy and the way I want to organize this talk is to first start by telling you some new facts based on new data on the Persistence of spatial inequality in the US then I want to turn to the really important issue of perceptions of Mobility across a range of settings perceptions that are not always in line with reality and then I want to talk to you about the link between these Mobility perceptions and policy views because what we believe about Mobility is actually very important for what we want to do on policies and then finally I want to tell you about how your own Mobility experiences uh shape something very important which is the extent to which you think the world is zero-sum which will turn out to be a really important predictor of your policy views as well so let me dive straight into these perceptions into the Persistence of spatial inequality based on some new new data here a little bit of background on this data so the data is actually based on this very interesting historical phenomenon in the US which was the U.S general property tax this was a tax that was really special at the turn of the 19th century in the US which was essentially a comprehensive tax on all property so not just on real estate it was essentially a wealth tax and for over a century the U.S relied very heavily on what was a local taxation of wealth now what is interesting for us here although this is a fascinating public econ topic per se is that because of this tax administration we have a very detailed paper trail left about wealth property at the really granular level so we use this data that we collect from a variety of sources to construct wealth measures for the US for all U.S states counties and then also for cities for a more recent period overall we can spend a really long time and it's really exciting because we have some existing National wealth estimates but this is actually much higher frequency comes all from a coherent source and is a really long run data and in addition it was really rare until now to have some consistent and coherent sub-national measures so to look at within the U.S for instance wealth measures and so what can we learn from this data well on spatial inequality there's some really interesting facts so if we start in 1850 and look at the county wealth or County property per capita to avoid issues with prices and deflators I'm just normalizing it by the U.S level GDP per capita so think of it as how much of a yearly income in the US does that County hold in wealth and we can see across the decades a really strong persistence so the Civil War itself will reshuffle things so you will see from 1860 to 1870 a real reshuffling of the of the wealth distribution but after that it is incredibly persistent so even though we keep adding some counties you can sort of see the same places are rich the same places are poor and in fact you can look at this more formally by looking at the rank rank correlation uh between starting wealth so let's take the post-civil war so the rank of a county in 1870 and then the rank of the county in subsequent decades for instance 1880 1890 all the way to 1930. the persistence is quite striking it is a very very strong persistence and you can even roll this over until today so if we compare this to um the opportunity Atlas data by Raj Nathan and others this is our map of per capita wealth in 1930 and 1920 sorry and this is the opportunity Atlas income per capita or income per household data today so obviously you know I've harmonized the colors but you can see a very strong pattern here and if you plot a bin scatter of the per capita property in 1920 on the horizontal axis the rank of a county in terms of per capita property and the rank of a county today in income it is a very strong relation places like Baton Rouge Louisiana are wealth poor 1920 income for today and then places like Larimore Colorado Rich back then and Rich today so very strong persistence and there's lots of additional things you can look at for instance what correlates with wealth in a given place a final fact I want to show you based on these historical data is a bit the consequences of lack of opportunity or lack of Mobility so we can look at what happens when counties were more unequal on their subsequent growth and wealth so on this graph you can see sort of Bin scatter on the horizontal axis we have the top 10 percent wealth share in a county so that's a measure of strong inequality and you can see many counties are very unequal and then on the vertical axis we have the 60-year subsequent growth and per capita property in that county so the points are residualized on wealth per capita in 1970 that's why some will be slightly above one they are re-centered rescaled but even if you start adding covariates like Geographic controls demographic controls Etc there's a very strong negative relationship counties that were more unequal to start with experience lower growth subsequently and a final sort of measure of extreme lack of opportunity and extreme inequality is of course counties that we're relying more on on enslaved people so an extreme form of you know coercion and lack of opportunity for some groups if you correlate the share of enslaved people so this is obviously centering only on on Southern counties if you correlate the share of enslaved property to subsequent six-year growth there is again a very strong and significant negative relationship that is robust to including all these various controls so this is on the brief historical facts here and let me switch to the very important issue of how people perceive Mobility across a range of settings so I'll talk about uh three projects here um and all of them have this method in common so let me just give you a brief sort of pitch for the type of method that we're using here which is a social economic surveys and experiments so surveys as we talked about in many of the papers in the morning as well are something that have been used for a long time to generate statistics and there are some variables which you know today we can better measure an administrative data Larry was making this point very clearly things we couldn't see before with surveys we can now see in a really high quality way yet there's some things that still remain invisible uh in in data no matter how good it is and those are things like perceptions attitudes knowledge and Views these are things which we can't see even in the best sort of admin data out there and so surveys are really more than a tool they're they're sort of approach to research uh I I like to say you can create your own identifying variation and sort of uncover uh those invisible factors with this approach and so of course for the results to be reliable it's very important that the surveys are well designed to put on appropriate samples and and carefully done so let me show you some some key results from some of the papers related to Mobility so the first project is really about overall perceptions of intergenerational Mobility uh in several countries so what we try to do is to try to understand if people have accurate perceptions about mobility and that's obviously a difficult notion so we have to be careful how we ask people so what we do is to illustrate a notion of Mobility for people with this ladder design so we tell them imagine 500 families that represent say the U.S population for U.S respondents or the German population for German respondents and imagine that these families are ranked from the hundred poorest all the way to the hundred richest and imagine now that we take 100 kids from the poorest hundred families where do you think those kids will end up once they grow up will they be in the hundred Forest uh middle hundred Etc and based on this we have a intuitive way you know a visual way uh to help people understand what we really mean by Mobility and so what do we see across across countries so here are some findings so let's start with this probability of staying stuck in the bottom so staying stuck in poverty each dot here is one country and the horizontal axis tells us the actual probability of a child from the bottom staying in the bottom and you can see that actually the US is the lowest Mobility country on average along this metric uh the European countries are more mobile they have a lower probability of staying stuck in poverty the vertical axis tells us the average perception of respondents from those countries and I've labeled the upper region pessimistic because here is where you overestimate the chance of staying stuck in poverty and optimistic would be you know you you overest you underestimate that chance you think there's more Mobility so the US is roughly accurate here actually on average and the European countries are too pessimistic um in terms of staying stuck in poverty here we can look at another notion of ability which is this American Dream idea the probability of moving from the very bottom to the very top so this is here on this graph so same way to read it we have the actual probability on the horizontal axis the average perception per country on the vertical axis so European countries are again somewhat too pessimistic although not as strongly as this idea is staying stuck in poverty but the US is really over optimistic uh the the respondents in the U.S tend to overestimate the probability of a child making it from Rags to Riches in a way that's not poured out by the data and in fact because um because the US is so interesting here we can actually zoom in across States how these perceptions differ so on the left we have the actual Mobility uh probability of moving from bottom to top this is taken from uh Raj and Nathan's data here so for instance uh if there is if there's darker colors it means there will be more kids moving uh from the bottom to the top and then on the right we have the the average perceptions so you can you can already see that everywhere the map is sort of Darker right people are over optimistic in general in the US but if you if you look at it more carefully you can almost see inverse relation between where Mobility is actually lowest like in the Southeast and where perceptions are over optimistic and if you take the ratio which is the perceived over the actual Mobility or moving from the bottom to the to the top you can see that in places like the southeast people over inflate by a factor of two uh the mobility and in other places like the Midwest or the mountain states people are much more accurate uh and and much more you know realistic about the mobility another issue that you know it's impossible to talk about Mobility without without talking about it in the US is mobility and race and this is based on a project that is joined with Alberto and Matthew Ferrone a student at bu where we try to understand how people view racial gaps um how they understand them what they think the causes are so we try to survey uh non-hispanic black and white respondents across the U.S and we survey not only adults here we also survey teenagers aged 13 to 17 to try and see how we really young people think about these issues so we really over sample black respondents here to have roughly half half the sample and we ask respondents in detail about their perceptions of economic conditions and opportunities of both black and white Americans their attitudes on racial issues and importantly their views on what causes racial inequities and then we also ask them about their degree of support for two types of redistribution policy one is General redistribution so income targeted and the other is raise targeted so explicitly conditioning on race so here are some of the perceptions for Mobility um across different racial groups so let's focus on the left column here which is from the adult survey the right one will be from the teenager or youth survey so if you look at the top left panel here we can see the perceived probability of moving from the bottom quintile to at least Q3 so you know middle class and more and we see the perception separately what is the probability of white children moving up and what's the probability of black children moving up in different rows I show you here the average perception for white respondents in the sample and black respondents in the sample and then the reality is the green diamond so in the bottom we see the same but it's now split by political affiliation so we zoom in within white respondents between why Democratic respondents and white Republican respondents what are some key results here well there's two two key findings if we look at the mobility of white children that people think happens in general we can see that there is this slight over optimism uh right that we saw in the previous study remember the previous study was very much about moving from the very bottom to the very top so the numbers will be different and in fact it is especially black respondents that tend to overestimate the mobility of white children by quite a lot and there's also a bit of a partisan Gap where Republican respondents are more over optimistic about Mobility what about the mobility of black children here the story is very clear it is much much lower than people think so everyone really vastly overestimates the mobility of black children there is a much stronger partisan Gap here Republican respondents are much more likely to overestimate it and if anything blood respondents are also overestimating it by a bit more than white respondents what about children or like teenagers what about their perception so here we can't ask them detailed quantitative questions so we simplify to qualitative questions for instance do you think that the chances that a white child moves you know becomes rich are close to zero low fairly high high so it's qualitative questions so we can't compare really across the two panels and we can also not really compare to reality the numbers don't mean that much in levels it's just interesting to compare across groups so what we can see is that um even among among children there's that strong over optimism of black children about what the chances of white children are and you know white children are in generally uh much more you know much more pessimistic about their own chances and then if we look at the bottom right panel we split children or we still teenagers based on their political affiliation of their parents do they live in a republican household or in a democratic household and we can see partisan gaps in the perceptions here too where teenagers who live in Republican households will be more optimistic especially about the mobility of black children than those in Democratic households the third perception I want to talk to you about is how we how we position ourselves relative to others where we think we rank relative to others and this is based on a joint project with Christopher fitberg and Klaus kreiner what do we do in this project well it's a very important perception which is how we rank ourselves relative to others and of course issues of Mobility are intrinsically linked to where we rank or we think we rank relative to others and so people may care about their social position uh let's say their income position among others in various reference groups so what are possible reference groups well I may care about others of the same age as me that would be my cohort I may care about those in the same city as me or those in the same sector or firm uh those in the same neighborhood Etc so those could be my reference groups and each of these reference groups May matter differently to me so what we would try to understand here is how well do people know their position in these various reference groups and then how does this shape their views on inequality on fairness and then ultimately on policy so to do this you actually need a lot of data you actually need data on people's perceptions so this is why we design a survey where we try to ask people about their perceptions of the income distributions of their various reference groups and where they think they rank in them but you also need data on reality so for this we match respondents to their registered data which is a really high quality data in Denmark that has people's incomes but also their whole income histories and Live Events such as unemployment or health shots and then all of that for their reference groups too so for instance we know who your neighbors are and we can see what has been the income history of your neighbors so we know the the perception side here and the reality side at a very granular level and in addition we can see what happens to you based on your position or based on changes on your position due to life cycle changes or life events how that shapes your perceptions and your fairness views so let me tell you in a bit more detail how we do it again to to build some confidence in the methods so first important thing we need to do is to make sure that people uh that we elicit people's perceptions of the income distribution we don't want you to just rank yourself we want to know do you have an accurate income distribution in mind for each reference group so for each reference group we will ask people tell us what the median income of that group is and give us a sense of the top income so the top fifth percentile so first we'll show people an instructional video that explains the notion of percentiles of the median of the top income so that they know what we're asking about and we're going to give them names for instance the median will be p50 and then the top fifth percentile will be p95. and then we'll dig into asking people about each of the reference groups that they're part of so this will be adapted to each respondent for instance this person here is born in 1970 so we'll start by asking them what do you think is the p50 the median income for people born in 1970 so they put in some number and then we're going to ask them about other groups they're part of for instance this year is a man who's born in 1970 lives in Copenhagen has a master PhD and works in finance and insurance and again the respondent will tell us what is the median income that he thinks happen in those groups and the same for the P95 will ask them what is the top income here top fifth percentile for all these groups you're part of and then finally where do you rank yourself in each of these groups uh so this man born in 1970 is asked to rank himself for instance in his cohort and he puts himself at p70. we'll see if that's true or not so what do we find when we ask people to rank themselves like that in various groups well here's the the core pattern that we have so on this graph you can see people's actual position on the horizontal axis and let's start with the cohort which is a sort of natural natural Benchmark group and on the vertical axis you can see their perceived position uh by a bin of actual position so you see this very very clear uh sort of almost mean reversion pattern where people who are ranked lower will tend to overestimate their position and those that are ranked higher will tend to underestimate it and this sort of pattern will be visible for all reference groups so let me show it right away now there's you know your perceived position against your actual position for all these reference groups in your cohort in your gender group in your municipality in your education sector an irrigation or sector group in all these groups although the magnitudes differ there is this pattern and we're going to call it Center bias so it's actually something very different uh from mean reversion because we'll be able to show exactly where it comes from we can because we elicit people's views of the income distribution we can see that the reason this Center bias happens is because your own income very much shapes your perceptions of others incomes in a systematic way so people who are ranked lower who have lower income tend to think everyone else is poor too in their mind the median is shifted to the left and the P95 is also shifted to the left so they become closer to the center because they think everyone else is poor too that will lead them to overestimate their position and vice versa at the top we will see that people who are rich themselves will tend to think everyone else is richer too so they will naturally underestimate their position so it is not mean reversion which uh could be mechanical because you're asking about positions in fact the pattern here shows that it's not at the extremes that people are most wrong so it's really driven by your perceptions of others incomes it's also not this idea of we all think we're middle class because this holds for all reference groups so for instance if you ask someone who hasn't completed high school you know rank yourself their educational group is all relatively low income people so the middle of that of that distribution is not a middle class uh perception it is a much lower income group so it is a very specific and systematic bias that happens here you can also see that it is larger specifically uh for your education and sector group and we'll come back to that it's in those groups that you really overestimate your position if you're if you're lower ranked you do not realize how highly paid others in your sector or with your educational level are another thing you know mainly for fun um is that we also ask people about small reference groups like your direct neighbors your co-workers at your workplace people you went to school with when you were a teenager so we can look at the Perceptions in those groups you see that for co-workers neighbors schoolmates we also have this Center bias pattern and it varies in magnitudes across these groups but we always have that same uh over and underestimation systematically now if you view these small groups as small-scale equivalent of the large groups the patterns are actually very consistent if you view your co-workers in your workplace as the small scale equivalent of everyone in your sector you see that you're much more wrong about your position among your co-workers um and if you view neighbors as the small scale equivalent of everyone in your city you're much more accurate ranking yourselves among your neighbors or among people in your city so geographically then among co-workers in your workplace or co-workers in your sector so clearly info does not flow very well in the labor market in particular people who are actually relatively low ranked very starkly overestimate their position among co-workers and others in their sector in fact you're better at ranking yourself amongst former schoolmates that you used to go to school with When You're 15 then among today's co-workers how do these Mobility perceptions matter for policy views so they're obviously interesting per se but is there something more about policy views here and there is let me organize the the results around three three key findings so the first is that we almost all agree that lack of Mobility is a problem but our preferred Solutions really differ so if we think back of the first project on intergenerational Mobility perceptions across countries well we see very starkly is that most people are quite worried about lack of social Mobility so they think if children's outcomes are tightly linked to their parents that's a bad thing but the preferred solution varies very starkly across partisan lines so on the left someone who's more left and that's not just true for the US that's true across all the countries in the sample people who are on the left and who are more pessimistic about Mobility will want more government action they want more redistribution uh more social insurance and especially more equality of opportunity type policies like education or health policies for respondents who are on the right the solution will actually be less government their preferred solution to more Mobility is let the economy be free let businesses run and and do not have government intervention which of course can be mapped to very different attitudes about government to start with the second big result in all these studies is that the perceived causes of lack of Mobility matter it doesn't just matter that you think there's lower high Mobility it matters why you think there is and we really disagree on that so let me build this around the paper on racial gaps because it's very striking there so across partisan groups and racial groups people definitely perceive the conditions and the opportunities of white and black Americans differently we saw that on the chart but by far the biggest disagreement is actually in how people explain these gaps to themselves and what the perceived causes are and consequently what they think should be done about them so we can show very clearly that people support for either General redistribution or race targeted policies doesn't actually depend on the magnitudes of gaps they perceive it really just depends on why they think those gaps exist and the perceptions here are very strongly divided by partisan lines so if we look at black and white Democratic respondents uh together these are respondents who will generally tend to think that you know today's today's racial gaps are really due to uh past enslavement historical factors discrimination racism basically systemic factors not individual actions on the right it will be very much the opposite where people will attribute a lot to individual action rather than systemic causes and consequently people on the left will tend to support income targeted and general redistribution policies and people on the right will not what was very striking to us is that these racial and partisan gaps are actually very prevalent among teenagers already so the views of teenagers are very much aligned with their parents partisanship and in a way that's very very polarized already we also do an experiment in this in this project where we show people two different types of information so the first is to show information on existing racial gaps and how they haven't diminished over time for instance on the earnings gap between black and white people or on the mobility Gap and this has really no effect because it changes people's perceptions of these gaps but it has no effect on policy View because telling people how unequal things are as we just said doesn't really change their policy views you have to try to change their views on why things are unequal and if you actually show a video or an explanation of more of the systemic causes of today's racial gaps that actually has a much much bigger impact on people's policy views so really showing the how is not sufficient you have to dig into why and explain to people why things are like that so in a sense you know although there's clearly very large racial gaps and many people are at least to some extent aware of them the narrative they have about why these gaps exist is very different and that really leads to very different views on policies the third big big result here is that how you rank yourself relative to others is really important for how fair you think things are and your policy views so this is something we can see in this Danish project again where this time if I show you your perceived position in every group in every big reference group and you're perceived unfairness of income differences within that group how fair do you think is it to have income differences within gender group within education group within sector group you see that the higher ranked someone is the more they will think inequality is fair or the less unfair they will think inequality within those groups is and you can also see that the largest perceived unfairness is actually for education and sector groups so people tend to think those are the most unfair inequalities so let me walk you through the results a bit systematically here so your rank will be related very strongly to your perceived unfairness uh the higher rank you are the more fair you think inequality is it will also be related to a whole range of other things for instance uh the perceived role of effort versus luck if you're ranked higher you'll think it's rather effort than luck uh you are more likely to vote right of Center uh you're more likely to support lesser distribution and of course this is a correlation but we also try to show this experimentally by actually telling people where they rank and shifting their perceived position and that confirms these correlations and we also look a bit closer experimentally at life events that happen for instance unemployment shops that shift you down in the positions or you know promotions at work that shift you up and that this shapes your your views on inequalities and as I already alluded to there's some inequalities that people consider to be more unfair than others in particular inequalities between co-workers and a firmer sector and people with the same education are both perceived to be most unfair and also are much bigger than people think they are so in a sense we're much more willing to tolerate inequality condition on things that we think are not key determinants of income like municipality gender Etc and less willing to tolerate inequalities conditional things we think should be determinants of income like sector and education and the final part um is about your own experiences of Mobility uh you and your your ancestors actually your family history and this very important notion of zero-sum thinking let me introduce that because it's a little bit unusual so is mobility Zero Sum obviously the the answer will will actually matter so throughout much of human history uh the world was potentially Zero Sum in the sense that there was no growth uh and so if you do better it has to come at the expense of someone else now in in recent decades maybe centuries there is much more growth so it's about a question to ask how much of our success today actually comes at the expense of others and this has implications for policy if you look at these headlines here from Time Magazine and Forbes you know there's this question does someone's success especially for instance of the wealthy come at the expense of other people and it will matter for policy because in a zero-sum world there's much more role for governments uh to tax and to sort of try to reduce what is a zero-sum game that happens between different groups so what we do in this paper which is joined with Nathan Nan sahio chinoi one of our students and Sandra Sakira is to do a pretty long running survey it's been going on for two years and and we'll keep going where we ask people about you know their background but very importantly about their whole ancestry so we go back three generations where we ask where people's parents lived what their occupation was what their educational level was same for their grandparents so we have really granular uh and a pretty big sample data to follow people's history of their whole families um in terms of Economic and location factors Etc and then we ask people about their policy views on a range of issues and importantly there are zero-sum mindset so let me give you four four key questions on how we measure zero-sum thinking so we try to see how do people think about different interactions between different groups and to what extent do they think these are zero sum interactions if one group gains the other loses so we asked them about whether they think interactions between ethnic groups are zeroism between immigrants and non-immigrants between different countries in the arena of international trade and between rich and poor or different income groups and based on that we can construct for instance a zero-sum index like a principal component index and it turns out that it's extremely strongly related to a range of policy views so on this figure I show you the correlation between the Zero Sum index and these outcomes which are policy views on the on the left side in rows so the Bold the Bold policies are basically indices that summarize uh policies on a topic and the first one is General redistribution policies I put all the components here individually because they're very much a focus of the paper but then we also have a race attitude index to what extent you know do you do you are you racist or or not to what extent do you think it's discrimination all these things we already discussed an anti-immigration index and then a gender attitudes index and direction of being more you know uh more aware of discrimination more supportive of affirmative action Etc so there's a strong correlation the different dots are basically adding different controls so beyond Baseline controls like age or gender adding things like party fixed effect income or education uh State fixed effect but it doesn't change the relation much and overall we see that the more Zero Sum you are the more you want redistribution for instance the more Zero Sum you are the more anti-migrant you are as well the more Zero Sum you are the more you actually and think there's a conflict between men and women in the workforce so the more you're going to support uh you know uh gender gender you know affirmative action policies so it's a very strong predictor of your policy views and in fact you may you may wonder is this just capturing something else and you can't see it on this graph but it turns out it's a very different and fundamental mindset from other things so for instance if you try to control for people's Mobility perceptions or to the extent to which they believe effort versus luck matters zero sum is a distinct notion so it doesn't just matter for instance to people that someone is doing well and had lots of lots of opportunities it also matters to them does the success of that person come at the expense of others or not so it's a sort of new but also very important mindset in addition to these other things we talked about like rule of effort perceptions of Mobility so you know in a nutshell uh yes maybe Jeff Bezos worked very hard and it wasn't just all luck to do Amazon but does his success come at the expense of others or is he contributing to others is a very relevant question and then another thing you may Wonder uh just quickly is is this a systematically partisan mindset and it turns out no if you plot the Zero Sum uh attitudes you know for the different say Democratic and a republican respondents there is a little bit of a sense in which Democratic respondents are slightly more zerosome especially on income issues for instance they perceive more zero sum between different income groups but it's not a very systematic thing it is it is there within all types of respondents to different levels foreign let's map this back to your experiences of Mobility uh now that we introduced this important notion that's really relevant for policy so there's a few determinants of Zero Sum thinking that we focus on in the paper which are very emblematic of the US experience the first is economic Mobility experiences the second is immigration experiences and the third is experiences related to race and enslavement and these of course the latter two are are direct have Direct effects but also very much shaping lack of opportunity and lack of Mobility for different groups and we think of experiences as having both Direct effects like whether you or your ancestors have experienced them that's what's called vertical transmission or whether you have exposure through your environment uh which is called horizontal if it happens contemporaneously or oblique if it's about your environment in the past and so a few things one is what if you have experienced economic Mobility through generations so on these figures we show your zero sumness how Zero Sum you are so the higher the index the more Zero Sum you are and relative to Mobility experiences so the first graph is relative to your own lifetime so are you doing better today than you are doing when you are growing up the middle is relative to your father are you doing better uh were you doing better as a child than your father was doing as a child and then relative to your grandfather so obviously we take a father and grandfather given the you know economics earnings power of women back in time and so the higher the mobility index the better you are doing so you see that people who have experienced more Mobility are significantly less zero-sum and then once you are to the left of zero it means you're you think you're regressing you're doing worse than yourself in the past or your father your grandfather once you're there it doesn't really matter how much worse you think you're doing uh it's kind of constant and it's significantly more zero-sum than than someone who's doing better and we can also relate it to this issue of Mobility look at how zero-sum thinking varies across cohorts across Generations so this is showing the Zero Sum mindset uh according to respondent age on the horizontal axis so overall you can see that young respondents are much more zero-sum than older respondents with some interesting fluctuations and if you map this to the economic environment these people grow up in for instance if you if you look at what was economic growth when these cohorts were growing up uh It lines up almost perfectly with the zero-sum attitude so people who grew up in in worse economic environments and obviously this is growth but you can also potentially map this to Mobility experiences that have potentially declined the us maybe used to be less Zero Sum in terms of Mobility than today you can see this clean generational pattern and I want to just tell you that this is not just about the us if you look at World value survey data they actually likely have a question that is relatively about zero sum which is people can only get rich at the expense of others and you can see that people who grew up in environments where where growth was low so in their first 20 years of life if GDP growth was low across I think it's 20 or 30 countries here they have significantly more zero-sum attitudes then in the interest of time I'm just going to quickly fly over the other uh two big um too big phenomena that are related to zero sum one is immigration which is something where big immigration ways uh were actually correlated with Mobility especially historically immigrants witnessed big improvements in life quality relative to their children and this didn't come at the expense of others it's been shown and what we can see is that if you are an immigrant yourself first generation or second or third relative to non-immigrants you are significantly less zero-sum so that's the vertical if you want transmission of immigrant experiences but we can also see something similar if you live in places with more immigrants especially these historical ways of immigration uh being exposed to those immigrants for instance if your grandfather lived in those counties which received a historical immigration waste you today are less zerosome and I'll end with this um you know this third very important thing which is the link between coercion uh and zero-sum thinking so of course the the most extreme form was was enslavement in the US but there's other forms of basically enslavement that that were happening afterwards so the first thing to see is that by race this is very clear uh you know African-American and black respondents have much higher perceptions of zero-sum uh than white respondents or other racial groups and if we look at other forms of enslavement zooming in only on non-black individuals so these will be things like the Holocaust experiences the three ancestry of the Holocaust um or other forms of of abuse and coercion you're significantly more a zero sum if there was such a history in your family and if you live in places which had a highest share of enslaved back in the 1860s whether it's you your parents or your grandparents there's a much more higher likelihood that you think in zero-sum terms today so I know this was a little bit quick but so just to just to wrap this up um going back to the beginning spatial inequality has been very persistent in the US um perceptions of mobility in the US are generally over optimistic especially regarding the mobility of black children there's systematic Center bias whereby we think we are closer to the center because our own income shape our perceptions of how rich or poor others are and these perceptions of mobility and ranking are really important for policy views so the more we believe in equality of opportunity the more we're willing to tolerate inequality of outcomes in a nutshell but there's this other very important thing which is did your success come at the expense of others which is this notion of a zero-sum mindset that is strongly related to your experiences or your exposure either yourself or through your families so thank you very much
