great this is Joint work with David Berger Duke Andreas Costa is Simon monkey my new colleague and they're all here in the audience so the modern monopsony literature is based on three paradigms to generate labor market power often rely on worker firm specific preference heterogeneity so if you value a job over and above the waves that's paid firms could potentially pay you less in your marginal product second common Paradigm search frictions so search frictions can depress your outside option in bargaining and affect your rate of contacts in your wages potentially can be less in your marginal product the third Paradigm is firm granularity so think the finiteness of the number of firms in a market independent of the first two if you have bird Tran competition or Corno competition you can generate equilibria which workers are paid less than their marginal products so what we're going to do with this paper is ask how these three separate mechanisms shape wages job flows and worker welfare we're going to ask which of these mechanisms account for the wage markdown which we're going to Define to be the gap between what a worker's paid and their marginal revenue product of labor the way that we're going to approach this question is we're going to propose a model that captures all three of these paradigms we're going to estimate the model on matched employer employee data from Norway and then we're going to quantify each source of these channels in average wage markdowns in the conclusion I'll tell you how this can help guide policing so let me jump straight into the environment so in the model there's going to be many labor markets indexed by this lowercase j you can think of a labor market here as being an occupation within a commuting zone so dentists in Oslo or psychologists in in Bergen these labor markets are independent workers are not going to be able to flow across the labor markets and we're going to assume that there is a single final good then each of these labor markets J there's going to be a measure of X anti-identical workers after which they're either employed or unemployed and may have heterogeneous wage profiles based on their contacts there's going to be a finite number MJ of firms that we're going to index by K so K is going to take values 1 up through MJ within Market J So within that market J within dentists in Oslo I'm going to drop the the subscripts firm K is going to produce with a linear production technology z k is their productivity and they have a stock of workers NK that work at that firm at home workers are going to produce homogeneous amount B now firms are optimizing they're going to post VK vacancies we're going to be solving for a Nash equilibrium in those vks at a flow cost covk where the convexity is governed by this parameter gamma the combination of a firm's productivity and the convexity of this cost of Hosting vacancies are going to pin down firm size and equilibrium now let me talk about the search and matching protocols this differs a bit from Coke pulsory Robin so all of the unemployed workers are going to apply for jobs some fraction less than one PSI e of employed workers are going to apply for jobs some measure of those applications XK are going to reach a firm's desk they didn't go into our matching function to tell us how many meetings occur so the number of vacancies that measure of applications this matching function along with the match efficiency are going to pin down the measure of beatings crucially here because of the granularity of the firms if you're employed at a given firm K you're going to partially direct your search so you're only going to apply to firms that are not your current employer now before matching workers are going to draw an idiosyncratic preference shock so worker I is going to draw an amenity at firm K uniform where the lower amount of support is zero and we're going to estimate the upper bound of that support it is observed both by the worker and the firm and it's constant during a match workers are going to maximize their flow utility over wages and this non-wage amenity discounted at a rate beta now as I mentioned before workers of firms observe Epsilon and they're only going to consummate a match whenever Surplus is greater than whatever is the outside option whether you're poaching or hiring this person out of unemployment lastly the bargaining is in Hook Palestinian Robin they micro found this with an alternating offer game which boils down to what looks like Bertrand competition pinning down the workers outside option and then Nash bargaining over the remaining Surplus with the bargaining parameter Theta so let me just pause here and highlight the differences between what we're doing in the Baseline hook Paulson and Robin so you're going to see concentration show up in this finiteness of number of firms we've color coded these throughout the talks to to correspond to the different paradigms and the purple bit here is uh is the search and matching frictions and the red component here these non-wage amenities gives us these new classical forces for markdowns so those are the three wrinkles so let's go into how we quantify this model so indoor way we approximately have access to what is the lehd plus the CPS why is this crucial well as in the CPS in Norway we observe occupations for the universe of workers so we can Define concentration we can Define markets based on occupations we have data from 2006 to to 2016. in that time period we we pull the data and we group we Define markets by grouping occupations within a commuting Zone that is going to map in our model notation to that lowercase j our definition of a market so how do we group occupations well we we begin with the 250 four-digit occupations that are present in Norwegian data so I think dentist psychologists and and the like what we do in the first step pre-processing step is we isolate 60 of these occupations at extremely high self flow rate so the flow rate condition on making a job move back into its own occupation is greater than 50 percent and these are your your usual suspects these sort of Highly occupation licensed to uh occupations dentists and psychologists being two of our examples in in Norway the remaining 190 occupations we cluster unit using a k-means algorithm we do this on the lower dimensional object of the occupation to occupation worker flow Matrix so this is a 190 by 190 Matrix telling the rows telling you where you begin and the columns telling you which occupations you end up in the next month so we cluster based on the similarity of those rows all right now you have to come up with an optimal case star so in the the spirit of all of these machine learning algorithms all these clustering algorithms what we're going to do is pin down an optimal case star in Every commuting zone so it'll be a separate case star in Oslo as there is in in Bergen or stravenger um to maximize goodness of fit which is maximizing the average self flow rates we want them to so flow at a high rate but we also want to penalize for overfitting we want to rule out the degenerate solution of sticking all of the occupations into into one cluster so running our algorithm we end up with about 83 clusters per commuting zone so about 4 000 markets in in Norway with a self flow rate of about 51 percent to Benchmark this we consider also three-digit occupations so three-digit occupations would yield about 110 clusters per market and it would be about 5 000 markets in Norway with a lower self flow rate of 45 percent if we were to adopt the jeroshim chicken Sorkin stochastic block method so this is where you group firms based on worker flows which is computationally intensive they don't have the benefit of seeing occupations they only see Industries and there the cell flow rates about 41 percent importantly when we run this clustering algorithm about 70 percent of the workforce in Norway is in markets with at least 150 firms per market so it looks fairly competitive and you'll see this when we do some of our concentration experiments we're not going to get a lot of kick because most people are in Fairly competitive markets so let me give you an example of what these markets are let me put some names and labels to to some of the notation so consider a market consider the commuting Zone Oslo and consider two companies Dental firm ABC and and log company XYZ the dental firm hires dentists and hire secretaries the law firm hires lawyers and hire secretaries the lens of our framework we're going to split these into three separate markets so in the First Market that's going to be dentists in Oslo and there's only one firm in this stylized example in that market potentially they have monopsony power in the second marketer lawyers same story is true lawyers in Oslo one firm competing from the services of of lawyers in Oslo secretaries on the other hands will look more competitive the secretaries in Oslo Market is going to have two firms who are competing head to head for the the services of the secretaries all right so with markets in hand what we're able to do is summarize a relationship between Market concentration and job flows the way we haven't seen in existing data for instance the United States now I'm going to point out here that really Us in the existing literature have no good instrument for for her fiddles almost all the instruments you can think of don't satisfy the exclusion restriction for instance the local exposure to to National exits will alter the herfindale market certainly but also changes the ladders of uh the job rungs of the latter in that market instead what we're going to do is show you a benchmark set of covariances relying on two very different sources of variation so if you write down a model in this literature you should be able to compare to to one of these sets of covariances and and land on top of it we're going to use is within your occupation cross region variation in herfindals so you can think this set of variation Compares dentists in Oslo to dentists in Bergen you might worry well in Oslo dentists are paid more it's more competitive they're sorting and in Bergen is more concentrated potentially they're paid less so we also show you another separate set of variation which uses within occupation region across time variation in herfandel so you can think of comparing dentists in Oslo at deity to themselves at t plus one where we ameliorate any concerns regarding sorting so this is what the variation looks like we find a robust negative covariance between job flows and her controls on the on the x-axis is a residualized verified all converted into a z-score so these units are standard deviations on the y-axis is residualized e to e rate in percentage points you see is that a two standard deviation increase in the herfindel associated with about a 0.05 percentage Point reduction in the ee rate job flows are lower in Norway so this actually corresponds to about a 10 reduction relative to sample average the job finding rate follows by one whole percentage point for that same variance in in herefendols which also corresponds to about 10 percent of the sample average job finding rate in a given month in in Norway so with the market definitions in hand or definition of concentrates we're able to read MJ the number of firms in each of these markets straight from the data so we're going to feed that into to our bottle on average there's about 73 firms per Market in in Norway so these markets look fairly competitive but I heard it's going to indicate that uh there's uh the competitions equivalent to about 10 equally sized firms in the market so it still is fairly concentrated we're going to pose a linear relationship between the number of workers in a market and the number of firms in the market we go through the paper and argue one that's actually a fairly good fit in the data so we split the parameters into three blocks the first block has to do with the search and matching Paradigm the middle block has to do with the new classical amenities and the last block has to do with concentration so fairly uncontroversially the match efficiency is pinned down by the unemployment rate and the on-the-job search intensity size pinned down by the aggregate e to e rate the amenities are only are the only source of movements down the job ladder so if we were to shut down the amenities we're set Epsilon bar to zero no one would flow down the job ladder in our model economy so this is also fairly uncontroversial the concentration so there's two components to this the first of which is a standard deviation of productivity which we're going to estimate to match the standard deviation of log wages conditional on that productivity draw how do we match concentration well the vacancy cost elasticity that curvature to posting vacancies is really going to penalize firms the more convex it is for being disproportionately large so what we end up with is a concentration that as I mentioned before concentration employmental then that is equivalent to 10 equally sized firms in a market so 0.09 on a Model 0.08 the data lastly we're over identified and we we target the average relationship between the average wage and the herfindel and wage dispersion in the herfandel what are these negative relationships mean in data a one standard deviation higher hearthandol is associated with about a two and a half percent lower wage level and uh five percent less wage dispersion so nopsy looks like it compresses wages we also match non-targeted covariances of the EE and UE flows that I showed you on the last slide as a validation of our framework so let me show you the first result in terms of wages so we're going to assume that wages are fixed until you receive an outside offer as an accounting device we're going to keep track of only a worker's promised value as a share of total Surplus so Sigma is going to be the workers Surplus share putting these together we get a close form expression for wages in terms of surpluses so the flow wage of a worker whose promise value is uh is a sigma of total Surplus at firm K who has an amenity draw Epsilon is given by your usual convex combination of what's produced in the match so the marginal revenue product of that worker ZK and their outside option but there's two extra wrinkles here the first of which is there's going to be an amenity discount and the second of which is you have the quit and promotion discount so this first bit the output share comprises about 91 percent of the average wage in Norway the opportunity cost is about 42 percent and the amenity discount puts a downward pressure about minus 20 on the wage whereas a quit promotion discount is about minus 15 let me briefly talk about the economics of the amenity discount so if you show up at a firm and you have very little uh bargaining power so you just showed up and you have no outside offers your Sigma could be quite low it could be take a value of theta which was 0.18 in our calibration you would face a fairly significant uh amenity wage penalty as your offers bid up more and more as you meet more firms and sigma starts to approach one you start to take more and more of the Surplus the amenity wage penalty disappears and the worker takes home their marginal product ZK so let me talk about our key counter factuals so we're going to provide this decomposition to three paradigms and ideally what we would do is we would take MJ to Infinity but actually conceptually there's some issues with that that I'm going to talk about computationally it's also infeasible for us to do that Brute Force the paper we invite approximation to this but today I'm going to show you a simpler experiment where we just double the number of firms in a market the second which is reducing amenity dispersion to zero which we're going to show you here and the third of which would be to remove search entirely but our models cast in discrete times we're going to do the best we can which allow everyone to meet every period so this is the Baseline economy that's the hurricane that I showed you in the calibration table and the markdown such that workers take home 79 of what they produce so w over Z is 0.79 I also call that a 21 markdown the E rates about a third of what it is United States about half a percent per month so let me show you the first experiment the first experiment we do in a very particular way which is we take the Z Vector in every Market in Norway and we duplicate it okay so the top rung of the job bladder and the Bottom Rung of the job letter are the same in every rung in between it's just now you have to compete against your doppelganger we're also going to double the number of workers to remove any mechanical density effects okay so this is a very particular experiment designed to isolate the role of pure concentration what we find is that wages increase by about point seven percentage points welfare goes up by a quarter of a percentage Point inequality increase by about 0.8 percentage points surprisingly to us markdowns only narrowed by one percent so workers used to take home 79 of what they produce after we duplicate the set of firms we get to only eighty percent so a markdown airing of one percentage point the mechanism for for the wage gains and the wage inequality Rising is that the bottom rungs of the job letter the same when you come out of unemployment you meet the least productive firm you get paid about the same in either of these counterfactuals but at the top now Google has to compete against his doppelganger all right and you can you can see that wages at the top fan out and they're kind of pinned down at the bottom and you get greater wage inequality as we increase competition second we reduce the amenity dispersion to zero but we keep being amenities fixed okay so we we calibrate the average amenity so that we get it right but we kill all the dispersion markdowns here Narrows significantly by points by seven percentage points interestingly the herffendol triples so you go to the top and you stay at the top the amenities never draw these workers down the job ladder again as a side effect of that productivity goes up by almost seven percentage points almost eight percentage points lastly if we reduce search frictions and you see immediately here the ee rate uh more than doubles there's an increase in the herf and all uh and there's a there's a large narrowing of markdowns so markdown's there almost 14 percentage points so in the last few minutes let me talk about bargaining and and concludes so when we doubled the number of firms in the market we were surprised that there was very little effect on markdowns and then what we realized in the course of this project was that a lot of the concentration was hardwired in the duopsany in the bargaining process so how do we get at this in a counter factual we do experiments here where we add a third firm to the bargaining table so whenever you meet a firm you meet the next best ranked firm and partially equilibrium this doesn't affect allocations you're always going to flow to the top ranked firm only letting the next best ranked firms show up okay so you're always going to flow to the same place it only moves the workers outside option here to rank firms we need to get rid of the amenities okay so to cleanly rank the firms we're going to start from a baseline where we have one single amenity we bring the third firm to the table and markdowns reduced by almost 11 percentage points suggesting a large role for for strategic interactions so large that it's equivalent to tripling the worker bargaining power we think much research needs to be gone into understanding the source of these strategic interactions and opening this black box of of the bargaining protocol so let me conclude so we estimated polsonary Robin with a finite number of firms and this neoclassical source of markdowns we found that about a third of the markdowns in steady state so of the 21 percentage points almost 10 were due to to to non-wage amenities half were due to this duop sinistic hard-wired strategic interaction in the bargaining protocol and two-thirds could be ascribed to search and matching frictions which are perhaps immutable with respect to policy concentration in its pure form holding bargaining fix had small effects on markdowns but large welfare and wage effects and the non-additivity I should point out here is because the model is highly non-linear in in ongoing work we're looking at the minimum wage which really addresses the non-wage amenities in the duopsonistic wage bargaining and in in in very recent work we're looking at merger guidelines where the penguin ran a house Simon Schuster merger really put monopsony at the Forefront and we're finding that if you would apply product Market guidelines to the labor market the 1982 guidelines would leave workers on a harmed where if you would apply the current 2010 guidelines workers would lose in your average merger in the United States so leave it there thanks
