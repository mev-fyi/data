get away mathias yes uh thanks for having us in this great conference this is a joint work with titan alon sinha costco uh david cole and michelle tetcher and i think uh i see almost everybody here so there will be uh multiple people to answer questions later on so we are in the middle of a big recession and has been noted that it's an unusual recession in many ways certainly in terms of its cause but also in its impact on women versus man in the labor market so just to give a first illustration this picture shows you the relative change in women versus man's employment comparing the great recession of 2007-2009 to the pandemic recession right now so we're looking at changes here after february of of last year and what you see here is uh that in the um uh great recession uh back in the uh early uh late uh uh 2000's we had um what's uh called the man session namely the employment of women went up so the positive numbers here means that women's employment increases relative to men so even early on there was a bit of an increase for women and as you go later in the recession there's a substantial rise in the employment of women compared to men conversely a decline in men's employment which corresponds to this concept of a man session that this great recession had a much bigger impact on man versus women in the labour market and the similar pattern holds for earlier recessions that before so this larger impact on man has become a common feature of u.s recessions uh since at least 1970s now if you look at the uh pandemic recession this is the solid lines over here you see that women's employment has declined in relative terms overall and has declined particularly strongly for women with children so this compares a woman and man with children in the labor market a very sharp decline of up to about five percentage points and the relative employment for women in this in this group so it's a very different outcome uh a really very unusual impact on working women compared to pretty much any recession we have had uh in the past it's something that's really quite distinct about this recession now what we do in this paper is to look at this pattern in a lot more detail and also ask if this holds more generally across countries so the first thing we do is to uh look at the regular recessions and ask whether this a man session feature of men suffering more unusual recessions holds uh in a number of countries or that maybe you are specific and then we turn to the pandemic recession and look at this from a number of different perspectives so first we ask whether this pandemic recession is a she session everywhere or maybe just in the united states and then we go to the causes so how much of this can be accounted for by child care you know which is a bit suggested by the first picture but maybe also by industry occupation composition you know by what kind of jobs women and men have we're going to look a bit at the impact on productivity and then we're going to discuss the wider implications of this so how does it matter for macroeconomic features of recessions whether it is women or men who are affected more and also what are the long-term implications of course when workers lose jobs in recessions that has some repercussions for future productivity there's also changes in the labor market because of the recession such as more working from home now but perhaps also beyond and so we will also want to look a bit at the potential repercussions of that so starting with the uh first point uh you know are regular recessions man sessions the answers they are so in in most countries regular recessions indeed hit man's employment more we do this in a lot of detail in the paper i just want to show you one picture that illustrates this so um on this picture simply shows you by country the correlation of gdp deviation so deviation from a hodrick prescott trend and the ratio of women's versus man's employment so the negative would mean a negative correlation so women suffer less in recession men suffer more and the basic thing you can see here is that this correlation is a negative in the vast majority of countries so it's indeed the case that uh regular recessions meaning pre-pandemic recessions are manned sessions almost everywhere the sample of countries here is uh the eurostat area so the most european countries and we add united states and canada which of course are countries uh we care about now moving on to this current recession is the uh pandemic recession the g-session almost everywhere and the answer again uh turns out to be yes so it is similar to the united states not in every country but in the majority of countries so what this shows you it's something a bit simpler it is simply the uh postcode log change in the ratio of female to male employment so negative numbers means women lose more jobs and the comparison here is uh q4 of 2019 to q2 of 2020. and so you see that in the vast majority of countries we have a larger losses for women only a few countries where men have lost more jobs you can do the same thing for hours worked as opposed to uh employment so also taking account of the intensive margin you get the same pattern with actually even larger differences so most countries hours of work declined more for women relatively few you have the opposite pattern now another thing we we did in this comparison is to say well um most uh countries have manned sessions in regular times men are more affected you can also ask that in these countries where men did a little bit worse in this recession are they doing as badly as they do usually or maybe at least somewhat better compared to the usual standard so what is the impact on employment compared to what you would expect based on the usual pattern and if you do that then you get something kind of even more clear-cut that even in the countries where men lost slightly more jobs they generally still lost fewer drops compared to earlier recessions so here we essentially show you a correlation between the predicted change in the labor supply between women and men uh compared to the completely actual so uh being below the 45 degree line here would mean that uh women are affected more compared to the usual pattern and that is true in almost all countries but there's just two exceptions one of them is sweden and you know sweden well known to have uh quite different policies during the pandemic than other countries gives you already some ideas of some of the factors that might matter here okay so summarizing so far we have we have manned sessions and regular times and we have a she session now why is that now we're going to look at child care but another natural factor to consider is the industry composition of employment you know what jobs do women and men have and that does in fact turn out to drive quite a bit of the patterns again we do this in some detail in the paper i want to show you just a picture that compares this this factor for the united states between the great recession 2007 2009 and the pandemic recession right now so this picture shows you essentially employment changes uh over uh industries uh we sort these industries by what we call cyclical volatility so high cyclical volatility means that employment in this sector is highly correlated with the business cycle with overall gdp and low would mean it's a it's an acyclical industry we also saw these uh these industries by employment so the red industries here are industries with high female employment shares so we're relatively many women work blue are male industries with many men and black are roughly balanced shares of male versus female employment and so this is the great recession so like a regular recession and here you see kind of the very typical feature that in a regular recession the industries that have the most men really go down hard you know so construction manufacturing down here you know those are male dominated industries and they really tanked uh very strongly and so you kind of click this correlation between between the male dominant industries and declining in the recession and that accounts for a big part of the man session that we had uh in 2007 2009. now i want to show you the same picture for the current recession so this again shows you employment changes uh q4 2019 to q2 to 2020. and so here you see that this is a completely different so um for the most part there is a little correlation between the usual cyclical volatility and what happens now but there is a couple of industries that are very heavily affected and the most important one is leisure and hospitality now so so lesion hospitality completely stands out in its impact and that happens to be an industry where many women work you know and so if you look generally at industry data also in many other countries you find that this sector is really the most important one and to the extent that many women there that accounts for already a lot of the variations so clearly that is an important factor we do a few more things with the cross-country data of course it's cross-country data so there's only so much you can learn from them it's interesting to ask you know what do employment losses and relative impacts on women and men correlate with in this cross-country data and i won't show you uh tables here but just give you kind of the punch lines so a couple of things that are associated with larger overall employment losses and not specifically for women and men just larger losses overall are more extensive school closures so if schools are closed more fewer people get to work a larger share of the hospitality industry you know that's something already suggested by the previous picture if you're a country for example with a large tourism sector you know then on average you're going to suffer more in this pandemic and also another factor that's very important is how many jobs can be done from home i will come back to this theme that in a lot of this work it turns out to be really a super important factor are you able to work from home like we do right now on zoom or are you not you know and so that's a predictive at the individual level it is also predictive across countries so countries with more of those jobs are somewhat better protected in terms of employment effects in this in this crisis now it turns out that at this cross-country level relatively few factors correlate with a relative impact on women and men in fact the only one that is uh clearly there is uh is this issue of telecommuting so uh places where there is a relatively few jobs that can be done from home not only have larger employment losses overall but they also have larger employment losses specifically for women so again telecommuting ability to work from home turns out to be an important factor here okay everything so far was based on aggregate data now so just using these these national services and kind of summing numbers up of course we're going to know a bit more about the details of the cause between what's happening and for that it's useful to go to the micro data so so then we went to uh labor force surveys from six countries to really dig into kind of what uh you know accounts for specifically speaking for these different impacts so we're doing this for the united states canada germany netherlands spain and the united kingdom to some extent because they have data available but also because these countries span kind of a nice range of experiences for example the european countries germany netherlands uh spain and the uk generally had more interventionist labor market policies so more employment protection uh more furlough pay compared to the united states you also have two countries in here germany netherlands uh have the structure of labor supply where women are relatively unlikely to work full-time so you have high participation but mothers in germany in the netherlands usually work a part-time so it's a bit different from the united states where we have a fairly large number of mothers who work full-time where you might think this impact of child care needs for example is more important okay so we want to use these surveys and now to ask at the micro level so country by country kind of what accounts for differential impacts so the structure we're going to have is we're going to look at outcomes such as employment or hours worked we're going to regress this on the gender the um the recession so so this data is going to be 2019 2020 we're going to have a recession dummy for the uh second and third quarter of 2020 and then we're going to be we're going to have some controls but we're going to be mostly interacted interested in the impact on the interaction of being a female and and the recession so what is the differential impact between women and men uh unemployment on hours in the recession okay so this is going to be a measure of the basic gender gap in the recession and then we're going to do more regressions to look at the causes behind this gender gap so in particular this regression over here adds a distinction of whether or not you have children and whether these children are large or small so kind of a preschool age or school age and so then we're going to interact this essentially separate for each child group so we can ask what is the gender gap among mothers say among parents of school-aged children versus people who don't have children and we're also in here going to have controls for uh industry and for occupation and we're going to allow for differential trends among those in the recession okay so we're going to allow for example that if you are working in hospitality in a certain occupation that you have a differential trend uh going into the recession so kind of to filter out how much of this is because of a different employment distribution say uh relative to uh the direct impact of uh having a child at home okay and so this may be trying to measure the overall impact and put them into kind of different components so i'm going to show you a few of these uh regression coefficients always focusing on the interaction terms for for women so really just on the gender gaps of course there's more other stuff in the uh regressions too so the first one over here is for employment uh so here's our six countries the first draw that shows you what the overall employment decline is so uh women and men combined you see already here it's quite different you know that it's kind of a large employment declines in the united states and canada it's much smaller uh generally speaking in the european countries except the netherlands which already kind of suggests an impact of employment protection there and then the coefficients i show you are the ones that are significant many are you know essentially zero uh and uh and quite small you know so so you can uh kind of focus in on what's uh what's important so the first coefficients here kind of show you the overall agenda gap so it's about a one percent extra decline in employment for women in the united states about half as much in canada not uh significant changes in the other countries and if you then break it down among uh whether or not you have kids and how all these kids are you can see that these gaps are the largest among the parents of a uh school-age children okay so so here it's a it's almost a two percent uh larger impact on the moms compared to the deaths in the united states um it's only about half as large for people without kids okay there is some impact on pre-k kids but one interesting thing we find is that uh it's really the school age uh uh where these effects are large is not so much the the youngest children okay um in the raw data the youngest children you do see a large impact but that seems to be to a large extent accounted for by industry and occupation so so the uh so the moms of of young children have different occupations on average and that accounts for a lot of their larger impact you can do this also for uh hours so this is now the intensive margin and here you see uh more positive entries so so now also a lot of the european countries have some some changes going on what is the suggestive off is that in some of these countries the employment protection kept people formally into their jobs but uh but they were than just reducing hours so you were still officially working but say in germany you could reduce to zero hours so your intensive margin would then respond quite a bit if you look at this you see that once again uh uh these school age kids is where the big impacts are so uh much larger house reductions in the united states and canada also in uh in spain and uh and the uk the exceptions for these school-age kids are germany and the netherlands and uh so so there's no impact here as i said before you know those are the countries where uh moms are relatively likely to work a part-time or be out of the labor force so so what we think is suggestive of is that part-time employment provides a you know kind of less need to kind of really drop out of the labor force or reduce ours because you already have enough flexibility to deal with this extra child care needs during school closures which is less the case if you're working time then there's relatively more moms or parents in general who will reduce ours i also want to point out that after we do all of this controlling for industry trends and so on we still get a quite sizable gender gaps for uh people who don't have kids at all who either too young or kids already gone to college so it's not the case that industry occupation accounts for everything there is something about this recession compared to other recessions that gives you a larger impact on women that is not just child care or industry occupation okay so there is uh there is uh more stuff but uh you know um i think the important uh messages to take from the micro data are that being a school-aged parent is important this is where the large gender gaps are industry occupation matters accounts over 20 percent of the impact on women in the united states uh and policies do seem to matter if you kind of compare outcomes across countries with different uh kind of policies one thing i'm not showing you because it's you know almost too strong to show is that you can also see the micro data that uh working from home is super important so if you group people by whether or not they can work from home or not you see essentially all of the gender gaps coming among the people who cannot work from home so put differently uh being able to work from home like we can really uh take these effects away both overall much lower impact overall but also essentially no gender gap you know so uh so what we do right now is really very protected for working women it has a big impact and that's of course suggested for the future because we do expect that working from home is one of the features that is going to stay with us at least to some extent beyond the crisis last thing i want to touch on is uh productivity you know so so i i said two minutes two minutes twenty years two minutes okay two minutes two minutes perfect yeah that's just on time um so um i said that working from home is kind of beneficial for women in terms of the impact on employment that in some sense uh is a potentially optimistic message if there's much more work from home in the future you might say that this added flexibility will really benefit women and mothers in the labor market and give us a kind of lower gender inequality but the issue with that is that well maybe uh this working from home kind of uh hides some inequality that's not really showing up in employment numbers and the possibility here is that even if employment is not affected there might be an impact on productivity so this picture over here is from the new york times now this is a feature on a few uh couples during the crisis here you see a working a couple both are working mom and dad it's the mom right now who is taking the work call it's the dad who's relaxing at his beautiful desk uh so you kind of wonder you know are they really equally able to to get their work done during this crisis employment goes on but there might be some impact on what they can actually do you can see this in the data you know so so for example the dutch day that we have there is a survey where people are asked whether they are taking care of children at the same time as working and you can do this for people working from home you can then look for fathers and for mothers for young and for older kids how much of their time working from home they also spend on taking care of children you see that the numbers for women are much larger so women really are more split between at home work responsibilities and at home childcare responsibilities than men are they're both at home this is all conditional and being at home so it's really a question of the division of labor in the household there are some other papers that we that we discuss that's not part of our analysis that look at some direct measures of productivity for example academia you can look at who's writing working papers who's writing covet papers in this crisis and then you also find that women are doing less of that and mothers are doing less of that which is suggestive of a differential impact on on productivity so uh so i think there's a positive message from the working at home but there is a caveat that if uh maybe social norms you know give you a very unequal division of labor at home even if both parents work at home well then this potential may not be fully realized okay so that's what we wanted to show you today there's a lot more detail in the paper so i encourage you to to look at that but i think you uh got the main points we do find that the pandemic recession is a a big recession for women in most countries we do find that industry occupation and child care are very important but not the only ones there's something that goes beyond that policies matter and working from home is hugely important what i didn't get to talk to about but i think maybe we can get to the discussion is the implications of that so we argue that this really matters uh also for the macro features of uh the recession and the recovery essentially because female labor supply is really very different the way it behaves that male labor supply so whose labor supply goes down and up you know gives you different macroeconomic properties of the recession and it also and before shedding this a little bit with the work from home it also matters for inequality for gender inequality in the labor market in the in the long term now working from home might stay the scaring effect of the recession might stay for many workers and this will shape uh what the labor market market looks like in the years and decades to come that's all we have thank you very much matthias our first discussion is going to be uh laura pilosa um we don't have a sh okay cheers can you see my slides or am i sharing the wrong screen yeah i got you slides perfect um so thank you very much for inviting me to discuss this paper um super super interesting topic so the basic idea here is that a narrative of the pandemic recession has emerged in which occupations that can't be done from home or may require high physical proximity i'll get back to that that aspect of jobs um have been more exposed to the pandemic recession and moreover there's been obviously school closures um that happen due to social resistance measures and child care needs put further constraints on anyone that might have school age children so to the extent that we know that women are more likely to work in specific occupations that may you know not have as much ability to be done from home or might have more physical proximity requirements and we already know that women are more likely you know spend more of their time on child care than men you know we should expect that there should be a she session rather than a man session so what the paper does is it confirms this hypothesis that i think is one that we should expect to see in the data given our priors um it does so for various countries um as you can see the the authors put in a lot of work for uh gathering detailed micro data for all different countries and i think that's a really nice piece of the paper um but what i want to focus on is actually one of the questions that i think it opened up that matthias actually um mentioned in passing in his in his talk which is that um you know some some parts of the gender gap in employment are left unexplained and i think the answers for why that's happening are a bit less obvious okay so um here is basically my version of man session versus she session so everyone's familiar now i think with these kind of pictures given the first paper that was given so what i'm looking at is the employment to population ratio of males relative to females uh during different recession periods so each bar corresponds to a specific recession period and you can very clearly see in this picture and i know actual is going to be upsetted into a spider plot but i think it's become really apparent just from this that um the employment gap you know starts favoring women normally in typical recessions and if you start looking at the pandemic recession you get the completely opposite results so it really is something that's um very much out of the door so the way that the the authors actually show this uh is it is through um i think rather convincingly through a series of regressions so they start basically by looking at a basic gender gap regression which just has some standard controls like race education and so on and has a female dummy but then a female dummy interacted with uh whether whether whether or not you're in the coveted recession period so they're interested in in the the coefficient beta 3 on the female interaction dummy so to understand how much of the gender gap that you would get in either employment or hours outcomes during the colgate recession coming from these differences in occupations or industries basically what the next step is how does this coefficient change if you add in job or industry or occupation dummies so that's the next step is adding that in look then looking at the change in the coefficient on on the email domain interactive position and finally to the extent that having kids is going to matter for whether or not your employment outcomes change we're gonna do a further interaction of whether or not you're a female in the in the covert recession and then you know those groups of dummies for different children so here i'm just some uh pulling their their results kind of uh the ones that i thought were the most relevant for this so what you can see is that if you look at the gender gaps and employment in hours from that first basic regression you get these large numbers that's the the she session which you don't get in the standard recession so compared to the rate recession um once you start including these job controls you start to see that the the gap declines so it is the case that as we expected controlling for occupation and industry matters um and then finally once you add in those those interaction terms they show that actually having kids does matter there is some variation in what happens to employment and hours outcomes depending on the age of kids so i think these types of regressions actually confirm the narrative that you know occupation and child care are things that really matter for this this uh she session narrative um and what makes it more convincing is that none of those patterns emerge if you look at prior recessions but i think the more puzzling thing that's left unexplained is that even if you look at women who have no children um there still remains a gap between uh men and women so why why would that be um at first to me it wasn't really obvious it was it was it was quite surprising so part of the answer i think does come from this issue of telecommuting so if the authors kind of redid their regressions looking at actually people who ended up telecommuting during the pandemic versus those who did not end up telecommuting during the pandemic and for that they use actual um the cps questionnaire in which they actually asked during the pandemic whether or not you were taking up work from home and what you can see is that if you look at the regression outcomes during for those who did telecommute you get the same pattern um in terms of the going from the basic gender gap to the to the one where you include industry controls and that the industry matters still but now you see no difference among uh women who have children of different ages so that suggests you know that further supports this narrative in that it's saying those who can tell the commute may be able to more easily take care of kids now by that what i mean of course i'm sure all the parents in the audience are like their jaws are dropping what i mean there is that the idea is you can watch your children um and maybe shark a little bit at work or not be productive and just not get fired so that's the idea here now if you look at the no telecommuting regressions you get a similar pattern except the the gap between men and women for those who don't have kids still remains so to me that puzzle you know part of it is being explained by the telecommuting but then even if you look at those who are not able to tell commute and you're looking at individuals who don't have to make a choice let's say between going to work and staying home to take care of kids you're still seeing this gender gap and um i don't think any of the stories put forth in the paper are able to really kind of get at that so i want to just spend a few moments kind of trying to think about what are possible reasons that could be coming about and i just just want to mention that the pattern doesn't hold for other countries like once you do this separation um the gender gap actually disappears also for like the uk and the netherlands for the no telecommuting workers okay so one possibility is that you know we're still within the realm of the story of uh caring for people but maybe we just didn't capture all all all the relevant types of hearing so the first is if you look into the cps data and i think this is what the the authors use but um you can let me know if i got this wrong the third category includes individuals who have no kids of their own but may also include individuals who live in a household in which there are kids so that's one possibility is just that you know that the fact that you're still getting a significant difference in that third category is because despite the fact that maybe women don't have kids of their own you're still picking up people who are helping to take care of their whatever siblings children or so on and so forth and it's still the case that women may be more likely to take up those kind of duties than men well that's one possibility the other possibility is that um there's elder care and you know i i haven't seen any evidence on this but it's also possible that one of the things that need to happen is that um you know older parents started to have to take care of their their sick their sick uh parents and women are gonna be more likely to take on that role as well so i think that's something that you can actually check in the cps as well because you can see all these household relationships and who's living with whom and if that kind of wipes out the the gender gap that's still in that category i think it's then it kind of still fits in the same narrative of uh this idea that women just have to care more for others more generally of course child care matters probably the most but then you know it's still within in in this story of caring for others that that women have been relatively more hurt during this recession [Music] uh the second possibility is this idea of physical proximity of a job which um is not discussed or brought into the paper at all so what do i mean by that um so i have uh done earlier work with simon maggie and alex weinberg in which we use data from the ona to characterize different occupations is either having a high or low ability to be done from home and as having either high physical or low physical proximity requirements so the the indexes that we come up with for each occupation come from questions about the job uh duties that are done on the job so you know whether it has to be done outside where there's a lot of physical labor how many you know how many people are around you during work that are within arm's length and so on and if you take if you look at those indices uh across different occupations what you find is that occupations that are lower from home meaning that they are unable to be performed from home more generally speaking they're also going to be ones that have high physical proximity associated with them um so those things are positively correlated so here's an idea and i have no idea if it's true but i think it's worth entertaining if women are more risk-averse than men which i think is something that i've documented in in other work uh with patricia jessica and faucet but is um you know there's host of papers that have elicited risk preferences and shown the same thing um maybe even within a specific occupation if women are more risk-averse they might be less willing to actually kind of take on the health risks that are associated with going back to work then you might you know get some similar patterns as what you're seeing because those those two job activities are correlated and then what's not being picked up um and still matters even for women who have no kids is this this idea that it's risky to go to work um i would have originally thought that that's kind of a crazy idea but there is a lot of evidence and evidence my own work that suggests that these differences in risk attitude actually matter for job search outcomes um pretty uh pretty significantly so the other thing i want to point out though is that you can use our so we have all these measures are available online so you can download them freely and one nice thing about that is that you'll be able to merge them with the cps occupation data and what that will allow you to do is actually um one distinguish between these two characteristics of an occupation but it would also allow you to compare you know run similar regressions prior you know in the greater session uh or earlier sessions in which you don't have information obviously on telework take up rates because that was only fielded during the code recession but because these are characteristics of an occupation which we define sort of in a separate survey you can actually run similar regressions um in earlier sessions and then show us the differential um regression coefficients in you know prior sessions and then in the corporate recession so the last thing i want to just touch on is what to expect going forward which i think ms pointed out uh mentioned that maybe this will be part of the discussion later on um you know we we might expect that there's a large literature that says that losing your job is costly and has very persistent effects on earnings and employment so this evidence um that women have been more severely affected than the quota recession is actually not looking so good right um but we there is some evidence that maybe makes me a little bit more hopeful and that comes from uh recent evidence from data collected by the new york fed survey of consumer expectations so the new york fed survey of consumer expectations is is a story that they they feel in-house and so they can add questions in an ad hoc fashion whenever they like so one of the questions that that were that was added in january was the following so approximately how many hours per week did you spend during the following activities in the last week so this is going to apply to january 2021 and then they asked the hypothetical consider a situation where you know covet is gone schools have completely reopened and everything goes back to normal what do you expect to be your time allocation across various activities so to me the evidence suggests you know a little bit that they could be short-lived and i just want to thank my my colleagues who are actually working on uh on this data he's only robert so this is the data from the survey of consumer expectations and what you definitely see playing out in this data exactly as what you see in the cps that women are actually taking on much more child care hours than men but if you look at the expectations about what's going to happen after a cove whenever that may be um you see a significant reduction in the number of hours per week that women are going to spend on child care uh relative to men where the reduction is a little bit smaller so this suggests to me that as soon as things go back to normal i think we can expect that the child care angle will be eliminated of course the industry occupation issues are are going to remain and we're going to have the you know the scar in effect might still be there but one thing to point out i think that's different about this recession compared to other recessions is that because it was such a widespread kind of shock in which all restaurants closed um whole sectors were just completely shut down the signaling kind of the signaling involved in a spell of unemployment might be slightly different in that um you know people who typically lose their jobs in recessions maybe there's a more of a signal attached to it and that they're kind of like a lower quality worker compared to those who don't get laid off and so on whereas in this recession it could be the case although the evidence uh you know remains to be looked at maybe uh that signaling effect will be less severe and if that's the case then we can expect going forward that um the lasting impacts on women relative to men will will not be as as bad as um previous research suggests so to conclude i think this is a really nice paper that synthesizes a lot of evidence on on this notion of the she session i didn't touch on any of the evidence across countries but um there's a lot of work that went that was involved in collecting the data for looking at various countries and i think it it definitely supports the narrative that women were just in sectors or occupations that were more likely to be exposed to the kovitch shock and condition on not being able to work from home and with these childcare needs women took on more of the child care role i think this question kind of remains an open one i think it's a really interesting one like what what is it about this recession then that is making it bear more on women than men if it's not about child care it's not about the industry and occupation composition of women relative to men thank you very much laura our next discussion is lucas cara barbunus ah okay so you see my screen good okay uh so thanks to the organizers for inviting me to discuss this paper uh this is a massive paper in terms of data so there's a very rich set of empirical observations on hours worked and as you saw this is disaggregated by gender by family status by industry so there are you know i wouldn't be surprised if there are thousands of moments in there so i thought for this discussion what i would do is uh so to ask the question what do we learn from this uh data work okay so what what what is the kind of the punch line and are we surprised so uh my prediction is this is going to be the to go paper in terms of facts which it's very comprehensive and very interesting so i'm not going to discuss the facts i'm going to take it once even and then sketch a framework and try to learn from these observations and the framework i'm going to show you is going to have four key elements that i think are important when thinking about the pandemic recession so it's going to have gender uh it's going to have home production so child care is one component but there are other components also cooking maybe or grocery shopping should be in here there's going to be an asymmetry between time inputs and what i'm going to label a social norm and i'm going to show you that and then there's going to be partial insurance so let me jump right into the the model um that i'm going to sketch so the the economy is going to be populated by heterogeneous households and the houses are going to be heterogeneous in terms of their consumption weights in terms of their technologies at home and their technologies in the market and there is a lot of notation here so i apologize but i'm gonna i'm gonna denote to ease the you know the way you i present it to make it easier i'm going to put in blue color the the source of heterogeneity okay so white houses are heterogeneous so first let me begin by describing the utility and consumption so house was going to maximize this standard value function where uh this is not mysterious it's very standard so it's going to be log preferences with respect to the consumption aggregator and then all the action is going to come through the consumption aggregator which is not going to be just spending or just consumption but it's going to be a combination of various inputs value sectors and the inputs are going to be both in terms of spending and in terms of hours okay so let me uh go over this expression uh so the omega here is going to be a preference weight a consumption weight for uh what i'm going to label a market good so x0 is going to be something like eating in a restaurant or utilities or insurance or gas okay so it's a good that it's more intensive in spending and not so much in time okay so that's i'm going to call it i'm going to label the market good and then there's going to be a series of home-produced goods like in gas and backer are indexed by k so you can think of different so one of these would be child care the other could be cooking or whatever is you know being produced partly at home and partly through market inputs and the inputs that go into these categories are going to be spending hours by females and hours by males okay so the household is going to use three inputs to produce these goods and the key assumption here the way i set it up is that female hours are going to have a different substitutability so this input here is going to have a different substitutability with spending than male hours and i'm going to label that social norm okay so it's interesting to to understand why this is the case but here i'm going to take it as a feature of technologies and in particular i'm going to think of this sigma elasticity that tells you how much hours are substituted to spending is greater than the fire elasticity we tell you how much hours in home production of men are substitutable with with spending okay so i'm going to assume that sigma is going to be higher than 5 and this is going to make women more responsive and men more insensitive and then i'm going to move into the the market sector where there's going to be a straightforward linear technology that converts labor supply into earnings for every gender g so the earnings labor market earnings of gender g is going to be the product of the weights with labor supply okay so labor supply is going to be your endowment minus total hours spent at working at home and then the weights i'm going to write it as having two components the one i'm going to call alpha and the other i'm going to call epsilon and the difference between the two as i'm going to show you later is that the one is going to be uh uh insurable and the other is going to be honest so the alpha component is going to you can think of it as a permanent shock to wages that is more difficult to ensure whereas the epsilon component you can think of it as a transitory shock uh to wages that is easier to insure so what i'm gonna do uh before i move to an application uh is uh um i'm gonna study um a sequence of planning problems okay so i'm gonna study the sequence of planning problems and the goal here is to derive the locations of time and spending and then try to filter the facts in the paper through this framework and ask what do we learn okay so the way i'm going to solve this model is study these planning problems so first let me precise so a household here is going to be a sequence of time endowments consumption weights production efficiency at home and then the shocks in wages the transit the transitory shocks and the permanent chokes and then i'm going to start the planning problems defined at 11 of what i'm going to call an island so what is an island here is going to be we're going to partition the economy in um which consists of all the households into different islands so the island is going to consist of households that share the same sequences of everything except for the transitory component of wages okay and then i'm going to start the island level planning problems with the goal being of solving for the allocations of spending and time within an island and the reason i'm doing that is because that's going to give you some intuitive notion of insurance within an island okay so within an island uh all these shops are going to be perfectly insurable in wages and that's why i'm studying these planning problems and then on other stocks home home production shops and permanent social wages are not going to be insurable because by assumption here islands cannot trade with each other okay let's spend just a minute going through this problem so uh the planner is going to maximize this average utility within every island and it's going to do it subject to a resource constraint that says a total spending equals total labor earnings uh just a quick comment here on the spending so in the background there's going to be general equilibrium when everything is linear and easy so uh there's going to be an assumption the total output in the economy can be converted at a rate of one to one uh in terms of the market code which is the numerator the x0 and at a rate of one over pk for other goods so pka is going to be the relative price of goods so one thing i'm going to do later for example is is variety spk so i'm going to think the price of child care increased massively in covid how does this affect the allocations okay so that's enough that's another issue so let me before i show you the application just make two comments on the on the framework and how to relate to kovid uh so the first is uh so the nice thing about studying these planning problems is that's easy to solve everything analytically so uh you can write an expression for the inverse of the marginal utility which is the just the multipliers on the on these constraints and what you get here is that the margin utility basically depends only on that's why i call it uninsurable the uninsurable component of wages for men and women and nothing else in particular the transitory shops are going to be fully insured now the uh if you don't like the island model the rest of the analysis still you know you can still do it condition on lambda by starting the you know the demand system coming out of your condition on lambda but this already gives you i think an intuitive interpretation of the pandemic because the um you know the way i'm going to think about the pandemic mainly is a constant lambda pandemic so it's going to be a transitory shock on other things except for alpha that i'm going to keep relatively constant when thinking about the pandemic and uh you know this expression formalize that now the second line maps the lambda into the allocations uh and that gives you an intuitive you know sense of what is the marginal utility here which is just the inverse of uh the market value of total consumption okay so what is the market value of total consumption for the household is the total expenditure this is how much you know groceries and schools and utilities and everything you buy in dollars plus the included value of home production okay so home production is not tradable so it's not you know part of gdp here and part of measure consumption but true consumption is different from expenditures and that's where it comes from so when we study the pandemic and we think that lambda is constant doesn't mean that consumption is constant or or time is constant it means that the sum of these things are its constant okay so as i i'm as i'm going to vary the shocks the the primitives here there's going to be reallocation like maybe you reduce your consumption of spending of this thing and put more time on home production but everything is going to adjust in a way that makes lambda constant unless the permanent component of weight is more now the the second point before i move to the application is going to be the so what comes out of the the model is going to be an intra period uh first order condition that dictates how the household allocates time between uh females in home production and males and that's pretty intuitive okay so it depends positively on that on the relative consumption weights uh it depends positively on male wages so if male wages go up uh the household is going to direct more time into female home production it depends negatively on on female wages meaning if this goes up this ratio is going to go down uh and finally and that's something i'm going to discuss later as well there is this pk in here it's the price of goods that can't be purchased in the market but for which you can also produce them at home and if you see here the key elasticity that determines how much the input ratio changes with this price is going to be this difference between the two ls distances and in particular because of the sum because of the way i nested things when the good k becomes more expensive so suppose childcare becomes more expensive so the household is going to try to reallocate inputs away from spending towards something so how much goes to men versus females is going to depend on the intra good elasticity versus the elasticity across goods and because i'm going to have sigma greater than phi i'm going to get this asymmetry okay where women shift more of their time to home production as opposed to men okay so let me just do a kind of an application so what's the goal here the goal is um i want to think of some data so it's not real data it's made update okay just to be clear i made up some data which i think however is intuitive and then i'm gonna solve the model under this data i'm gonna say what does it take for the model to match this date and then i'm gonna shock the model and try to match some of the empirical observations in the paper and ask what do we learn okay so the application is going to have let's think about two or two households uh the one i'm going to call the symmetric households the and they don't have kids they both earn one dollar they both work 40 hours they both work five hours in home production say they cook and then all their spending is concentrated in the market okay so the the couple without kids spends everything on x0 and nothing on home production and then i'm gonna think another household with kids uh that they also have symmetric outcomes in the market so they are in one and they work 40 hours in the market but here the female input uh is you know the female puts more hours uh in home production relative to the to the male and also this household spends five percent of their basket into say child or whatever is this good okay and that's that that household starts from asymmetric initial conditions so that household is gonna react differently to the shocks uh so that's gonna i'm gonna take that as an input and then i'm gonna evaluate the shocks the shocks are gonna be transitory shocks to wages or the price of childcare or the consumption weights and then ask what does the model produce and compare that to the empirical observations in the paper so as i said there are you know thousands of moments in this paper so i'm going to pick only three that i think are most uh the most informed three of the most informative the one is ours uh fell by by a lot okay that's 36 that's the first div and then there uh you know the regressions in the paper you can think of them as uh you know double differences and triple differences so the there is a gender gap even for households without kids so this six percent means that if hours fell for for me for men by 33 percent for female they fell by 39 okay that's the way to read that but this gap is much larger for households with kids okay so the triple difference is the you know so is the difference over time the difference over gender have been interacted with whether you have kids or not is roughly 12 and that's kind of the key informative moment okay so let me walk you through some comparative statics um so first i'm going to show you some comparative stats with rested to female wages the transitory components all the figures i'm going to show you will have the same format so let me explain one so y-axis always have labor and x-axis has the thing i'm valuing and i'm thinking as you know the shock moving before covet relative to after code so before profit is going to always be at one or most of the time and labor is always normalized one for everyone okay and then i'm going to show you in the in the left panel the the first household the one without kids and the other with the right panel the house will with kids and uh uh the blue is going to be the the male input and the female input in production is going to be the the blood okay so here what you get is uh the for the household with kids the female input is is way more elastic in fact what i'm bloating here is the the constant lambda labor supply so it's it is the slope here is the freeze elasticity so why is that because i'm wearing an epsilon and remember i saw you london before where lambda doesn't body with epsilon because of complete markets so uh pick a point here for example so that's a freeze elasticity of one which gets much lower okay so this is quite non-linear it gets much larger here this is smaller than one this is around one gets much larger now for the household without kids the freeze elasticity is much smaller for for even for females it's roughly one-third and this matches the evidence we have on freeze elasticity so the gap in gender uh elasticity of labor supply is concentrated among married women women with kids and that's kind of the labor supply literature and the model is going to give you that okay so why is that because uh because of the social norm i built into the the technology uh or preferences whatever you know in the guess and better model they are the same thing uh females in the model here is going to start with a higher initial uh um home production time so a small shock that's going to move this time you know by giving percent it's going to matter a lot for labor because labor and home production enter additively in the time constraint okay so starting with something big uh if you show up it is going to matter a lot for late and that's what's giving you the asymmetry uh now for men that's not the case okay so men are insensitive here okay they don't move much their labor supply is relatively inelastic uh now you can look at permanent shocks okay so uh remember i had these log preferences so with low preferences permanent shocks on wages you have the standard result income and substitution effects cancel out but here i have nonseverability so this doesn't apply and actually the non-separability here is so strong for females that permanent soak in their wages for the for the cup for the household with kids he's gone he's gonna he's gonna move labor a lot for women uh if you do a permanent uh male weight shock actually you find something interesting so for men income substitution effects almost cancel out so this is one okay it doesn't move much uh but you get a negative cross elasticity okay so you get a negative cross elasticity and that's because the you know the household is poorer so they want to consume less of everything and what is the most flexible input of the household is female labor supply at the home for the household with kids so here you're going to have home production time going down and labor supply going up which is exactly the opposite of what we saw in the date okay so you can teach this case as uninteresting and my kind of most favorite interpretation of the the pandemic comes in these two figures the first is the shock to the price of goods that have a close substitute at home uh child care is one example you can think of other you know restaurant eating is another uh we so this shop is not going to move relative labor supplies for the household with with no kids but that was explained before is going to move here labor supply uh asymmetrically for the household with kids if this elasticity is greater than this elasticity two minutes look at two minutes yes perfect uh so you get and you know quantity again this is kind of a toy model so uh but quantitatively so one way to think about the results in the paper is you know child care was not exchanged in march to may so we don't observe price in the data so if we know the elasticities i can use the i can use the different different div to infer okay to reverse engineer what is the change in the price of these goods that leads to the allocations we saw and you know like a 15 percentage point gap would uh would imply a change in this price by a factor of by 100 okay so the price of childcare doubled in the in the pandemic if you believe my elasticity numbers uh i think the most uh kind of the most natural way probably to think the pandemic is a change in the consumption weights so here i'm going to change the the consumption weight on the market good so people didn't going to consume goods at the market they want to consume them at home and that's not going to this is gonna drive both labor supplies down but in a symmetric way for the household without kids for the household where the female is doing more for production initially again you get the larger responsiveness okay so that that's you know presumably mostly related with kids production but also other home uses okay so maybe it's switching or maybe it's laundry so if women are doing more to begin with the model will give you this asymmetry and again you can generate a larger symmetry here so let me just conclude uh by taking stock so um given the presentation we saw and the the facts and the and filtering the facts through the model i want to ask the question is it puzzling i think not so much okay so i think you can think the great recession as a combination of men's shock partly an insurable shock and partly an uninsurable i'm saying natural because consumption also fell more persistently and yes that's construction manufacturing driving that and you can think of the pandemic recession as a shock that reallocated inputs away from the market towards the home sector and lambda didn't move much because it was transitory uh so i think you know the paper gives valuable facts where you can use them to get the quantitative answers on either the socks or the elasticities or the combination of both what i think one recommendation i have is would miss from the paper is um in studying labor supply it's very difficult to study labor supply without also thinking about wages expenditures and home production so any additional data so some of it is in the home production time in particular is there in the dutch data set but you know bringing additional observations on wages and expenditures should be very helpful thank you
