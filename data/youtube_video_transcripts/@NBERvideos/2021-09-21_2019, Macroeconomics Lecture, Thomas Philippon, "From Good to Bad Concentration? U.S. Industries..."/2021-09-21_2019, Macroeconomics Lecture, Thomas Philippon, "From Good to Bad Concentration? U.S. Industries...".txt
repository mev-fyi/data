so as you know there's been a growing debate about the interpretation of this fact which is the growing concentration across many industries within the us so here i'm plotting the change over time of cr8 which is so eight means eight firms so cr8 is the cumulative market share of the top eight firms in a given industry so you can do it for each industry and then you take the average of that measure across industries and then we plot two groups here one series for manufacturing the other series for non-manufacturing the dotted line in the middle is because there's a change of sic to nx code so it's not exactly comparable so you can see uh cr8 went up by about eight points uh in the u.s from a baseline of about 0.3 so think of it as women from 0.3 to 0.38 on average and so that's the fact that there is much disagreement about what this fact means so we're going to try to make sense of it and of course in the context of other stylized facts the first one is at the same period as you see the increasing concentration you see a sharp increase in profits so this is the after tax net profit margin which went from about seven percent to about ten percent over the same period of time and of course exactly at the same time you see a drop in the labor share by about five points from about 0.64 to 1.59 so these are well-known facts the first thing we want to emphasize is these are u.s facts that may be a bit more controversial actually but this is not happening in other countries okay so this is concentration for comparable measure to the extent possible so this is the oecd measure of concentration that they gently uh agreed to share with us there's a lot of war going on in the background of these figures so you see concentration in the us versus europe so there is a little bit of an increase in europe as well but i don't think that that's a striking fact in that figure profits same story the only place where profits are really increasing quickly is the u.s you don't see that in europe neither in the eurozone nor in the eu 28 but you don't see that in japan in korea either finally the drop in the labor share since 2000 is also a u.s pacific phenomenon this is the laboratory in europe as a comparison it's completely flat okay so the key message of the paper is of course that concentration in and of itself doesn't tell you much directly because concentration is an indigenous subject and it could be associated to good changes or bad changes so here's a simple model to think about all of that at the end of the day there is only one equation that matters that's the free entry condition everything else is a bit less important but free entry is the key so start backward these are the profits you make exposed okay so imagine a industry where the average markup is mu and i'm looking at the profit of a particular firm with a productivity little a when the productivity of the industry is big a and the elasticity of demand is sigma and py is revenues for the industry n is the number of firms and fee is the fixed operating cost all right so this will be the profit that the firm is gonna make every period now three and three says that the capitalized value of the profit so here i'm assuming some discount factor r and some exogenous destruction rate delta so the capitalized value of the profit has to be less than the entry cost kappa so from now on kappa is going to be my entry cost okay so when i think about shocks to three and three i think of shocks to kappa now if you look at the symmetric equilibrium for one second so imagine all the little a's are equal to the big a then of course things drop out and every firm is going to produce the same amount and then the free entry condition directly depends on how many firms are going to be active and the number of firms is going to be given by that formula which is just making the free entry equal now this formula tells you pretty much all you want to know that shows why concentration enough itself is not informative because you could have bad concentration so if kappa goes up then the number of firms is going to drop the market is going to be less competitive and you're going to have you know more concentration of the bad type that could be driven by burst entry which themselves could be driven by regulations capture the regulators all kinds of stuff or you could have the good concentration which is driven for instance uh by higher competition exposed so if your exposed profit margin mu is smaller then you need to be larger to recoup the entry cost in which case a more competitive market will lead to concentration and there is plenty of evidence of that going on in in the u.s in other countries it could also be an efficient response to a change in the distribution of underlying productivity okay if the distribution of the little a has a power low and you fatten the tail then you're going to get more concentration too and it might very well be very efficient so final point that's very important from this is that if you bring back heterogeneity then a key inside the literature is the selection effect okay which is if there is heterogeneity in little a then what happens is some firms are going to try to enter but they're going to drop out because they are not productive enough so in that case the free entry condition says that the flow value of the fixed cost or plus delta k must be equal to the expected profit condition on survival and this s star is the cutoff and it's easy to see here that if sigma goes up a star goes up in a more competitive market you have more selection effect therefore you have a higher chance of not being able to produce but then the flip side of course is that conditional on producing so for the firms you actually observing the data they're gonna make higher profits okay therefore higher realized profit could also be a sign of higher competition okay so that's the challenge we want to tackle in this in this paper okay now i'm going to try to find indices cross-equation restrictions that are going to separate the two ideas of good and bad concentration the first thing we're going to do is we're going to look at one case where we know exactly what happened which is chinese entry the entry of china in the wto so we know that's a massive competition shock for u.s producers and we're going to see what happens okay well what happens is exactly along the lines of the selection effect you would expect so on the left you have the number of firms normalized to one in 1991 okay so and that's the ratio so if this thing is 1.2 that means the number of firms went up by 20 percent and there are two lines because we draw the line for industries this is a number of firms in industries that have a low exposure to china in green and in red is a number of firms in industries that have a high exposure to china as you can see they share the pre-trained very well so until two-thirds and they are look very similar and since 2000 of course massive change and today the number of firms about 60 different okay so it's a massive selection effect um so that's the first thing and then obviously that means that now if you look at manufacturing and you ask yourself why is concentration increasing manufacturing well a lot of it is import competition but of course that's the good type of concentration okay and one way to see how big that is is on the right you have manufacturing industries that are in the top half of their openness to trade okay so in the naive measure of competition of concentration the green line would show that domestic concentration is rising here but if you bring back imports and you do an import adjusted measure of concentration it's still going up a little bit but it's mostly flat okay so the bottom line here is that quantitatively if you look at the part of manufacturing which trades evenly heavily then we think that essentially all that's happening is driven by foreign competition there's not much else in terms of concentration but the china shock also allows us to do something else which we didn't quite expect but turned out to be very interesting which is how do the survivor respond to china shock well they respond by investing more and by investing more specifically in intangible assets they produce a wider variety of goods and they try to innovate that makes sense they know they can't compete in price with china so they will compete in other dimensions but now think about what that does their capital and cost structure is going to shift more and more towards intangible assets and intangible expenses okay so although on the left you can see their profits going down this is just log of their profits over time so china this is the coefficient on the regression where you put the ntr gap as an instrument so you can see their profits get hit of course when china enters but they shift their expenditures towards non uh towards intangible expenditures which means that and they do it to such an extent that the ratio of sales to the cost of goods sold actually goes up now the literature that we've seen recently that measures markups in countries and over time tend to use that as the measure of markup okay essentially their measure is sales over cogs times some elasticity which is essentially not time varying therefore at the end of the day this these measures tend to attribute any increase in sales over cox to an increase in market so if you use that as a measure then i would tell you after china we see more markup less competition okay so we don't think that works very well therefore we're not going to use it in the rest of the paper and this is not just for this was like a case study of about five or ten percent of the u.s economy which is the one that's heavily open to china but it's true globally so this is sales over cogs in green for all the big countries versus profit the the trend increasing sales of a cost is all over the place it's actually almost exactly the same even numerically quantitatively in every region okay so that's not so when people say markups have been going everywhere that's because they are throwing the green line but i don't think that measures competition you see the china shock instead the green the red sorry these are profits and there you can see that there is something specific in the u.s relative to the other regions okay so now what we want to do is find predictions that are different okay where we can tell apart quote-unquote good concentration from quality code bad concentration okay so here's one example suppose you write the standard model and you add productivity shocks and demand shocks then the market share from i in industry j at time t is going to be given by this simple formula h is the demand shock that's the demand shifter to your into your demand curve n is the number of firms and then of course you have the ratios of productivities you relative to your industry to the power sigma okay now in this model take the log of that compute the variance over time the variance of log market share is going to be the variance of the log demand shocks plus sigma minus one square times the variance of the productivity shock so if you hold constant fundamental shocks to either tests of people and productivity of firms an increase in sigma would predict higher turnover of market shares okay and that's very different from the prediction of the model based on restriction to entry which predicts less exit less entry and less turnover so now i'm going to highlight four dimensions in which cotton called the good story versus the battery make the opposite predictions and i'm going to show you you know which one fits the fits the data and the punchline is going to be that early on with the signs such that we had a lot of good concentration since 2000 this what we find is mostly consistent with the bad concentration so point number one turnover that's easy so this is um this is that's a really easy one you just take all the firms by industry you rank them from the first one to the last one in the industry you do it over five years windows and you compute the correlation of the ranking right so suppose that there is absolutely no change no turnover whatsoever then the ranking would be the same in the t and t plus five therefore the correlation on the ranking would be one this is one minus the question of the ranking okay so that's a measure of churning or reshuffling so roughly speaking the turnover went from about 12 percent to about six percent or maybe seven percent so okay so there's much less reshuffling of market shares of who is the leader who is the follower within each industry in the u.s today than there was 20 years ago test number two um investment so if you increase sigma you make the market more competitive exposed firms are going to grow larger in fact they're going to be closer to the perfect competition benchmark okay then q theory is going to work even better okay on the flip side if you want is that if you estimate the q theory equation then the relational q equation could be a measure of the competitive or lack of competition so here's what we do we just run a q equation for the growth rate of the capital stock for all capital equipment structure and ip okay this is just from the ba data and what you can see is that in all dimensions you see an increasing gap between what you would predict from should do given tomin's q and what they actually do in terms of their investments of course so equipment and structure that may not be surprising but what's interesting is this is true even if you look at ip okay in other words the 1990s according to the bea i'm sure we can discuss you know measurement but according to the ba the 1990s was a period of very fast growth in intangible asset but that is not true today with the same measure final test the correlation between concentration or the covariance i should say between concentration and either tfp growth or prices or markups okay so imagine you write a simple structural model and you you shock the model by shock to sigma okay what kind of cross equation covariance are you going to generate in that model well you're going to generate positive covariance between productivity and concentration you're going to create negative covariance between prices and concentration and you're going to create a negative covariance between concentration and markups and as you can see this is exactly what we see on average to three two thousand with two thousand you could say that if you pick at one domain industry and you see that that industry is getting more concentrated more quickly than some other industry you could guess that it was an industry that also had higher tfp growth lower price inflation and lower market growth if you do it since 2000 it's exactly the opposite so to conclude we try to give you a way perhaps hopefully a way of thinking about all of these facts at the same time okay and that's the challenge that was the challenge in writing the paper so we come up with this idea so since we are trying to tell a binary story good versus bad is it true that in the data you could come up with something like that so we just run a principal component on all the variables of interest and it turns out that the first two principal components actually capture a lot of the variance indeed okay and it also turns out that they are loading are consistent with the story that we're telling so here you have a lot of data so on the left measures of concentration here you have all the stuff with the intelligent investment here you have import competition here you have profits here you have the labor share productivity growth here you have inflation and here you have the turnover measure and then the investment gap okay now if you look at it pc1 looks very much like what you would get in a wall which is driven by shocks to intangible investment opportunities or uh and perhaps driven by a higher competition in the market or for the market because that's a pretty simple component that predicts more that actually doesn't lead to a lot more compression but somewhat more concentration it does give a little bit more markup not you but some more market as you would believe but it comes with high investment in future jiva and um you know low price inflation or even negative probably less than the average that looked at the good stuff okay the red one has exactly the opposite we predict a massive drop in a little more share it is as a negative on foreign competition as you would expect and it creates a lot of concentration but at the same time it creates high markups but the market comes from higher prices so that looks more like a bad concentration part and so it turns out that first as a description of the world it's not too bad in the sense that it does capture quite a bit of the variance so using that you can start to tell a systematic story that is sector specific point number one and point number two these are the scores on these two factors so that's something the story we want to tell which is pretty unfortunately the data in the further back you wrote data becomes less available so we cannot do like a very long time but it is suggestive that since 2000 the relative importance of the pc2 has increased relative to the relative importance of pc1 so we are not saying that there are no industries out there that are driven by fast intelligible investment and competitive market we're not saying that you're saying that there are fewer than before and many more that are driven by something that looks like rising now why would that be so the first thing you could imagine which we test and find support for in the data is that um you know if construction goes up the marginal negative impact of contemplation could increase the level of concentration in other words if you go from like point one to point twelve maybe that's not a big deal but if you go from point four to point forty two maybe that's a big deal and we do find evidence for that so like the marginal increase in the markup is higher when you start from an already concentrated industry so that explains some of it the other thing we find is that actually the nature of the confrontation shock has changed and there the prime suspect here is definitely a lobbying which is the one thing that has changed in 2000 massively and in the u.s specifically is corporate lobbying by like several orders of magnitude and and in the research i'm doing with hermann we find that the kind of regulation or the kind of barrister entry or the kind of concentration you find after a big increase in lobbying is quite different from the kind of regulation you find not preceded by an increasing lobbying and so that looping predicts the bad type of concentration okay the one where you see higher prices and higher profits of incumbents and lower growth rates for the small firms
