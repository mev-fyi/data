the broad motivation for this paper is that we all know that economic analysis provides a theoretical toolkit for disciplining our opinions about government policies and a common tool to do this kind of calculation is a marginal excess burden or a marginal dead weight loss type of calculation for a policy change and this is kind of building on these kind of classic works of harbor marty feldstein's work and others and the the key thing with a marginal uh deadweight loss or a marginal access burden calculation is that it requires us to decompose behavioral responses to policy changes into income and substitution effects perhaps we all remember from our kind of introductory uh public finance courses that it's really the substitution effect that governs the distortions involved in government policy changes and so this means that only the compensated effect of a policy change is what's relevant for a calculation of the marginal excess burden or the marginal deadweight loss of a policy change now there's also this growing literature that is is focused on getting plausible estimates of causal effects of policy changes and this literature has really advanced a lot of quasi-experimental methods natural experiments in some cases even randomized controlled trials to get really good at estimating what policy changes do to behavior but moving from a positive analysis of what these policies do to behavior to a normative analysis of whether or not we should do those policies is then difficult for reasons that i think austin ghouls be put quite well where he wrote that the theory largely relates to compensated elasticities whereas natural experiments provide information primarily on uncompensated effects so rarely does a policy change leave people's utilities constant and so rarely does the uh behavioral response to those policies reveal a compensated uh response for getting whatever the policy did to their behavior and so what do i want to do in this paper will they clarify that you actually can use causal effects the behavior the causal effect of a behavioral response to a policy directly in the welfare analysis of government policy changes and the basic idea here is going to be to not calculate marginal excess burden or marginal deadweight loss we're going to abandon that welfare framework because of the difficulties in constructing those compensated effects and i'll argue that actually another measure of welfare is going to be both easier to estimate and also easier to interpret in terms of comparing across government policies and that's going to be simply an individual's willingness to pay for a policy change per dollar of government revenue spent and so we're going to talk about how to construct this particular number but the key for thinking about the types of behavioral responses that are going to be relevant is that in a broad class of models where taxes are kind of the only distortions operating in the background there's no other externalities the causal impact of a policy change on the government budget so you can think of this as kind of a fiscal externality is going to be sufficient for all behavioral responses that's really going to be not only uh the the causal effect of that but it's also going to be the only causal effect that we're going to need to keep track of and so the key message from the paper is to calculate the fiscal implications of behavioral responses so if you have some kind of policy change that changes the eitc and you see look if people hadn't changed their behavior this would have cost us x dollars but because they changed the behavior it cost us 1.05 times x that suggests that there's kind of a 5 increase in cost because of these behavioral responses that five percent number is going to turn out to be exactly the kind of numbers we want to have for thinking about the welfare impacts of government policy changes okay and so the nice thing here is that these numbers are going to nest into a general normative framework even though they're not technically a measure of deadweight loss okay all right so i'm going to walk you through a model we're going to build up a welfare kind of apparatus that's going to look a lot like kind of consumer theory from uh uh from the uh the day in which he took uh took micro and then we're gonna use that to construct a measure of the the marginal value of public funds so a lot of government policies you know spend uh money and aren't budget neutral and we're gonna think about how to nest that into the into the model and then i'm going to show you how to apply this to a a range of government policies so we'll talk about changes in the top tax rates the earned income tax credit the job job training programs food stamps and housing vouchers so i'm going to steal existing estimates of causal effects of these policies calculate the revenue implications of those behavioral responses and use that to nest it into this welfare framework and at the end of the day we're going to be able to say should we spend more on eitc or should we spend more on housing vouchers should we spend more on food stamps we're going to have parameters in our minds that are going to allow us to think about which of these types of policies are the most relevant okay so i want to talk through a model so this is going to be a very general model just to illustrate that you can nest a wide class of models uh into this kind of a framework the goal of the model is just going to be very simple we're just going to try to measure people's marginal willingness to pay for a government policy change where this marginal willingness to pay is going to be thinking think about it as how much money they willing to take out of their billfold and put on the table for this policy change so we're going to have a set of individuals indexed by i and they're going to do a couple of different things they're going to choose some goods and they're going to engage in some labor supply activities so they spend money on stuff and they do things to make money there's going to be a government the government does a couple of different things it provides some publicly provided goods and services which we're just going to index by gi you can think of these as school expenditures you can think of these as any kind of a government expenditure that you want to have in mind and you can imagine that those have some kind of cost to the government which we're going to denote cj for the particular government activity j okay the government's going to impose taxes taxes on goods and labor supply activities so we'll let those denote by these taus that are just going to be the taxes that the government's collected on those two activities and finally the government can make direct transfers to each individual and i'm going to allow the subscripts these i subscripts are allowing these transfers to potentially be individual specific that's not required it just allows us to kind of nest a a structure where individual government can potentially provide transfers to each individual and so this can nest non-linear income tax schedules by thinking of that transfer as a virtual income okay so on the production side of the economy i'm going to shut down some various sets of things that one could potentially allow in a more general model i'm just going to imagine that one unit of goods is produced with one unit of labor supply so individuals just have a very standard budget constraint that should look fairly familiar the amount of money that you spend on goods which is just one plus tau times x it's the total amount that you have to spend on the good has to be less than or equal to the amount of money you earn on your labor activities which has to be subtracting out the tax rate there that tau l plus the transfers you get ti plus the non-lab any non-labor income that you you might have sitting around utility functions i'm going to be pretty agnostic on what utility functions might look like here each individual is allowed to have their own particular utility function ui that's uh some function of the goods they consume the labor supply activities they engage in and also the publicly provided goods that the government is is providing to them now agents are going to maximize their utility subject to their budget constraint i told you this is going to be a very standard consumer theory type of a problem and so this is going to lead to an indirect utility function that it maps what stuff that the government does taxes goods transfers maps that into a level of attained utility for each individual in the economy so vi is just the level of utility that the individual obtains in the event that they the government has set this set of taxes transfers and publicly provided goods now because i've left the utility functions completely uh uh unspecified it's going to be helpful for kind of normalization purposes to think of a normalizing by an individual's own marginal utility of income so that we can put units into dollars so let lambda i just denote the marginal utility of income for a given individual and so this now gives us this framework that maps policy parameters so taxes government provided provided goods into an individual's level of utility vi we want to now aggregate that across individuals and so i'll just follow a standard procedure of just taking individual utilities and imagining there exists some weights call that psi i to construct some measure of what one might call social welfare just a weighted average of individual utilities where these weights are obviously going to be important for thinking about whether or not we should do policies but for now i'm going to remain agnostic on what those weights actually are there's going to be inputs into this this uh policy setup and then they'll come to be very important later on when we talk about policy 1 versus policy two okay so this is the apparatus so we just walked through a standard kind of consumer theory set up where individuals maximize their utility and we're aggregating utilities across people so what's the question that we want to go after we want to say in this environment what's the welfare impact of a local change to taxes transfers or publicly provided goods imagine the government does something differently what's the welfare impact of that change okay so i want to describe the government doing something differently so how can we do that in a fairly general setup well let's just imagine uh that we we construct this sort of what i'm going to call a policy path p of theta which just characterizes a change in taxes and publicly provided goods relative to the status quo so you can think of you know we have some tax level today some level of publicly provided goods this policy path is just going to parameterize maybe an increase in taxes and an increase in spending on publicly provided goods or maybe it's just going to be an increase in spending on publicly provided goods maybe it's just going to be an increase in in transfers it's just going to describe as we change theta and increase or a change in some type of a policy and so the way i'm going to describe this i'm going to say we're going to imagine a change around the status quo so at theta equals 0 we're just in the status quo world and then as we change theta we're going to imagine that we do a slightly different policy and i'm going to assume that that's going to be a continuously differentiable change so we're going to talk about slightly increasing the tax rate and spending a little bit more on schools or slightly decreasing the tax rate and maybe spending less on something else so p of theta is going to describe that policy change okay so now that we've got a policy change described in this environment the question we want to ask is should the government do that policy change what does the model tell us about whether or not that's a good or a bad idea well first let's talk about what the policy change does to people's behavior the assumption that i'm going to make is that when the government changes policies that individuals will optimally choose their goods and labor supply activities in that new environment and so as we change this policy as we increase taxes or change publicly provided goods and services individuals will re-optimize and choose potentially a different vector a different set of labor supply activities or a different set of goods to consume and so we can describe those just with functions x hat of theta and l hat of theta which just describe what do people do in this world where there's a slightly different policy you can think of this so for those that know this sort of potential outcome world thinking about causal effects of policies these are just the potential outcomes it's what we would expect to happen in a world where the government does policy data okay okay now it's going to be helpful to keep track of the net government resources allocated to each individual in the economy this is basically an accounting exercise that just says okay well the government is is spending a bunch of money on publicly provided goods and services that costs c times that g there it's also providing transfers to each individual and so those are kind of the outlays that the government has to people in the to an individual eye in the economy but it's also collecting taxes uh from the goods and from the the labor supply activities xnl and so this ti function is just telling us how does the net transfers to each individual in the economy change as you change the government policy budget neutrality would mean that when you sum across everybody this would just zero out we didn't change any of the whole government outlays uh but in general you know we could imagine that there's a distributional consequence of the policy and we're going to want to think about keeping track of that okay now these are obviously related when people change their behavior they impact the net government outlays to them so if you know you decrease taxes and you increase your labor supply earnings or you increase your taxable income you're going to provide more money to the government and so we want to keep track of uh of that type of effect and this relationship is is kind of well known so the total impact of the policy change on the tax revenue that's collected from the uh by the government is the sum of two components there's a mechanical component which says suppose people didn't change their behavior how much would government revenue change and then there's a second component which says suppose people hold the taxes fixed and think about the size of the behavioral response how much does the behavioral response to the policy impact the government budget and that's going to be this behavioral impact on government revenue which is going to turn out to be important as we start to think about the welfare impacts of these policy changes okay so the normative question that we're going to be interested in is how much are people willing to pay to move along that policy path so we threw in some kind of policy into this into this model and we want to ask the question how much are individuals willing to pay to pursue that policy what is that number well that number is in in theory is just how does their inter how does their utility change as we change the policy normalized by their marginal utility of income this tells you how much money are you willing to take out of your back pocket and put on the table for this policy change okay and so that's the number we're going to try to characterize this is just a standard kind of money metric utility function that is locally equivalent to equivalent variation or compensating variation so if you want to have those kind of more standard notions in your mind that's totally fine as well okay so the the main sort of characterization in in the paper is that you can write this marginal willingness to pay as the sum of three components and this is all kind of deriving from the the envelope theorem which just says that we can to first order ignore people's behavioral responses but when we go to think about the impact on government revenue those responses are going to become important again and so these three components are to the extent the first component is the net resources allocated to a given individual to the extent to which a policy just puts money in your budget in your budget as you as an individual just be willing to trade that off dollar for dollar right if the government says i'm going to give you a dollar how much you willing to pay for that component a dollar right the second component is if the government decides to spend some amount of money on some publicly provided good or service which isn't directly fungible or exchangeable with money then we have to think about to what extent are you willing to pay a different amount for that good or service relative to what it costs the government to provide it so this is sort of a samuelson type condition just the difference between your own willingness to pay for that publicly provided good relative to the cost of providing it so we get a little bit of an extra kicker if people are willing to pay more than the cost for that publicly provided good we get a little bit less uh of a kicker people are willing to pay less than the cost of the government of providing that good and then the third term summarizes all of the behavioral responses in the model and this is just the behavioral impact on government revenue so this is uh sufficient for any other type of behavioral response what it says is all we need to do when thinking about how do behavioral responses enter into this formula all we need to do is calculate what's the difference between the revenue we would have expected if we didn't have any behavioral responses and the revenue that we actually realized given the behavioral responses that's sufficient for all of the behavioral responses in in the model and the intuition is just simple is that the behavior responses matter to the extent to which individuals impose a resource cost for which they don't pay when you change your behavior in response to a tax change this envelope theorem logic that we get out of standard consumer theory says that you don't really uh to first order you don't really care about your behavioral response but you are imposing externalities on the government to the extent to which the government has a stake in the amount of money that you earn okay all right so what types of elasticities then are necessary for this welfare measure for measuring individuals marginal willingness to pay for for a policy well it's just the causal impact of that policy and in particular the causal impact on taxable behavior and so we can think of these as policy responses if you wanted to estimate these in levels or policy elasticities if you wanted to estimate these things in logs and moreover if the government is really the only if government taxation is the only wedge between social and private costs so there's no other externalities in the model then a single causal effect is sufficient here just the impact on government revenue is sufficient for all those behavioral responses and so there's no need for example to know the separate response of people's behavior on ordinary income and capital income so we don't necessarily need to know how do you differentially respond on those different line items of the of the tax form what we need to know is what is the end impact on the tax revenue that you're providing to the government now note that this means that we do not necessarily want to know the taxable income elasticity that aggregates across tax bases if capital income is taxed differentially from ordinary income as it is right then we need to we can't just sum up those two sources of taxable income what we really want to be forecasting here is the causal impact on tax revenue not the causal impact on taxable income and if there's different bases with different tax rates those are going to be different but what this does suggest is that there still is one sufficient number that we can go after which is the causal impact on tax revenue all right okay so brief aside how is marginal excess burden or marginal deadweight loss different from this so just to give you some background this is a canonical welfare framework that's often proposed in these environments if you look through the handbook chapters and what these approaches do is they follow this harburger tradition of comparing policies to a first best world in which there's individual specific lump sum transfers to every individual in society and they ask a slightly different question than what we just tried to ask we just tried to ask what's an individual's willingness to pay out of their own income for a policy change what does marginal deadweight loss calculate it calculates how much additional revenue could the government obtain if a policy is implemented but then individuals utilities are held constant using lump sum transfers so this is a slightly different method of thinking about the welfare impact of a policy change and you can actually define it uh oh let's see do i want to let no i do not um you can define this inside this framework uh so we can let some let v denote some vector pre-specified utilities imagine you've got a government policy so we're going to change taxes we're going to change government revenue how would we calculate marginal excess burden well what we'd say is okay well let's not think of that policy let's imagine a slightly different policy where we do that policy you have in mind but now we hold everybody's utilities constant by sending the money into their budget constraint and that we send enough money into their budget constraint to hold their utilities constant all right and now we ask a slightly different question if we did that hypothetical policy how much additional government revenue would we get that's the marginal excess burden experiment by construction that experiment requires knowledge of compensated effects because we're holding individuals utilities constant in this modified policy experiment that we construct okay and so as a result we end up it ends up looking like we need these compensated effects of policy changes which you do in order to construct this measure of how much government would government revenue change if we followed this different policy but you don't need them to construct an individual's willingness to pay for a policy change okay all right so conceptually this is a perfectly reasonable measure of of thinking about about welfare um it's just really hard to estimate and i'll also argue that it has uh uh some some potentially uh more difficult to interpret aggregation across policies and individuals okay so one particular funny feature of many government policies uh is that they're not budget neutral everybody probably knows that in this in this room and so you know as a result it's common to adjust these policies for the marginal cost of of public funds for example now what the model illustrates is how to translate causal effects into a benefit cost ratio for non-budget neutral policies and so what's nice what's going to be nice about this is that you're not going to need to decompose into income and substitution effects and moreover if you have a non-budget neutral policy the model actually suggests you don't want to adjust for the marginal cost of public funds rather you can think of the welfare measure that you get from your policy as a measure of the marginal cost or marginal value of public funds and so i'll just walk you through how this can can work so imagine you've got a policy and for now let's let's just normalize it so that it's spending about theta dollars uh per beneficiary there's two cases that you really want to consider one is a policy that just changes prices or just changes taxes or transfers to an individual then on the margin as we were walking through a few slides ago that individual is going to value those transfers dollar for dollar uh if there's a non-market component to that uh uh transfer then there might be a difference between how much you valuing that good uh that the government provides relative to your own income and so that's where this uh partial derivative ratio there comes in how much you willing to pay for that expenditure relative to cash okay so what is the the measure that comes out of the model that suggests a marginal value of public funds it's just a benefit cost ratio what is your willingness to pay for the policy change divided by the cost of the government of providing you with that uh with that policy so the numerator is the benefit how much are you willing to pay for that policy change the denominator is the cost to the government no need to decompose these into income and substitution effects and moreover if you you can show that if the marginal value of funds for one policy is greater than the marginal value of funds for another policy and they target the same population then the policy the second policy is gonna then uh spending less on the second policy and more on the first policy can lead to a pareto improvement um if these populations differ we're gonna enter in these welfare weights uh that we were talking about a few slides ago okay so in the last couple minutes that i have i'm gonna walk through some applications for how to actually do this in practice the paper walks through all these these kind of different calculations um so there's a set of different policies where i just basically take causal effects from existing literature and put them into this model so we're going to take top marginal income tax rates and think about the elasticities of taxable income eitc expansions at the bottom of the income distribution the introduction of food stamps taking from some causal effects in hoins and schonsenbach job training taking from rct that was uh analyzed in bloom and co-authors in a paper in 1997 and then section 8 housing vouchers in chicago analyzed by jacob and ludwig where they show some labor supply impacts of this policy okay so the following table summarizes everything into a simple cost benefit across these different policies so when you look at a top tax rate policy the evidence suggests that when you increase tax taxes on the rich they decrease their taxable income now we can all debate about what is the size of that response maybe you you don't have to actually believe it but i'm going to take the kind of the midpoints of these uh of these estimates and say that about one point for every dollar that you spend you lose about 25 cents to 50 cents on the dollar because of behavioral responses if you believe that then for every dollar of welfare you try to provide at the top for every dollar of tax reduction you provide at the top you deliver actually 1.33 to 2 of welfare at the top because when people adjust their behavior responses they have a positive fiscal externality on the government conversely at the bottom of the income distribution the pattern looks a little bit different when you expand the eitc people enter the labor force or they distort their earnings to the revenue maximizing kink point as a result they increase the cost of additional eitc expenditure and so you can take the estimates from a couple of papers in the in the literature here and it suggests for every dollar you spend at the bottom of the income distribution you only get about 88 cents of welfare benefits food stamps job training hauser and vouchers there's also similar calculations in the paper but i want to just emphasize how now do you compare across these different policies well if you believe these numbers now how do we think about should we increase taxes on the rich and decrease and spend more money on on the poor well whether or not you want to do this depends on how much are you willing to kind of to lose when you take money from one person and you give money to another person so for example if you believe these estimates are the marginal value of funds suggest for every dollar you take from the top of the income distribution you can bring 66 cents to the bottom of the income distribution ratios of these marginal value funds are just telling you how much money can the government move from one person in the economy to another person in the economy by estimating these fiscal externalities we're able to just say how productive or how much does it cost the government to move this money around and so then we can step back and ask are we happy with this kind of a of a transfer and so this suggests that you would be indifferent to the current structure of the tax schedule if you uh were indifferent to having an additional uh uh 66 cents at the top of the income distribution relative uh to about a dollar at the bottom of the income distribution and so that's just sort of frames this sort of you know this is where the welfare weights come back into the logic are you willing to make these types of trade-offs okay so just to sum up causal effects can be directly transported into this kind of welfare framework you don't have to decompose things into income and substitution effects a single causal effect is sufficient here and it model motivates this marginal value of public funds
