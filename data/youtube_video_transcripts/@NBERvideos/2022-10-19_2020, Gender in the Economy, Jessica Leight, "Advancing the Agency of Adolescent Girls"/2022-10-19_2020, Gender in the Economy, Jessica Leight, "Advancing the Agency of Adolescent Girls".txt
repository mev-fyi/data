foreign good afternoon everyone my name is Jessica light it's my pleasure to present work today on advancing the agency of adolescent girls this work is joint with Eric Edmonds at Dartmouth College and Benjamin vegenberg at the University of Illinois Chicago funding for this project is provided by the United States Department of Labor the developing World women and girls face severe limitations on their ability to exercise agency in important choice domains that includes education work marriage fertility and other key choices and these limitations have remained stubbornly persistent even as other dimensions of women's and girls welfare have shown rapid Improvement in recent decades for example in this study's location of Rajasthan India net Primary School enrollment rates for girls nearly tripled over roughly 25 years from 25 in 1983 to 85 percent in 2009. however we observe an rfo an hour evaluation sample that over 90 percent of adult women in respondents households state that a wife should always obey her husband and at an average age of 11 17 of our subjects are married the objective of this project is to explore whether it's possible to increase girls agency and stimulate the development of more Equitable gender Norms in a setting of intense gender disadvantage and through these attitudinal changes increase girl schooling attainment specifically we evaluate the impact of a life skills curriculum and mentoring program through an RCT including 2 459 adolescent girls enrolled in 119 schools in Rajasthan India the program that is the focus of this evaluation is known as gep the girls education program it seeks to enhance girls agency and enable them to advocate for themselves in decision-making processes the core elements include in-school bi-weekly life skills classes and group mentoring sessions the curriculum was developed by the partner organization room to read and is implemented by a core of female social mobilizers all of whom are from the areas that women to read is serving and have completed Secondary School room to read hires trains and deploys these social mobilizers to participating schools to implement gep this is an international program it's included nearly a hundred thousand girls in nine countries since 2007. the objective of a dep is to build girls life skills and increase the probability that they complete secondary education life skills or non-cognitive skills in this context cover a range of traits that are seen as important determinants of academic achievement labor market success and long-term individual well-being more specifically I'm going to read identified 10 life skills targeted by the program that include self-confidence expression and managing emotions empathy self-control critical thinking decision making perseverance communication relationship building and creative problem solving GP also seeks to engage girls in applying these skills to simulated situations it evolves as girls age and regularly revisits topics with new scenarios that may be more age-appropriate foreign the experimental design can be described as follows GDP is a program that typically begins in grade six and continues through Secondary School through grade 12. however primary data collection for this evaluation took place after two years of programming when girls have completed grade seven in addition in other contexts GDP has included material support as well as family and Community engagement but these elements were not included in the version of the program evaluated here GP only provided the bi-weekly life skills classes as well as mentoring the evaluation site is ajmer District within Rajasthan and India a state in which one to read had limited prior engagement and a cluster randomized trial was appropriate given the GP is a school level intervention that includes all girls in the Target grades in a given School the sample was selected in stages first we identified 119 schools that were eligible to receive GP to be eligible a school needed to enroll girls in the Target grades six through eight it needed to meet an enrollment Target of between 16 and 32 girls in grade 5. in addition girls in addition schools that had other NGO based life skills classes were excluded and schools were required to have an adequate classroom available randomization was conducted at the school level and was stratified on the basis of a school Quality Index generated by the research team [Music] all girls enrolled in grade five in the year prior to the evaluation were then eligible to be surveyed at the Baseline and included in the sample and ultimately any eligible girl for whom a parent or Guardian provided consent was enrolled in the evaluation that includes 2 459 girls in total the Baseline was conducted approximately six months prior to the start of grade six unless six months prior to the rollout of GP programming around three percent of eligible girls were never enrolled in the study due to a failure to provide consent at Baseline by n line only 24 girls fully attracted that's a nutrition rate of less than one percent and 72 girls failed to complete the child survey online though they or their parents completed other parts of the data collection process and we conduct bounding exercises in the paper to assess the importance of attrition foreign engagement in GP programming by sampled girls is high so each program year grade six and grade 7 provides 16 life skills classes in both years the modal girl attends all life skills classes so complete attendance is extremely high and less than 10 percent of girls never attend a life skills class [Music] we also assess balance by treatment assignment this graph shows the fraction of household and child covariates for which balance is assessed reporting a p-value in the estimated range there is only one variable that has a p-value below 0.10 suggestive of some imbalance between treatment and control as well as a false Discovery weight below 25 percent the variable is an indicator for whether the child works and we will describe how we address any potential imbalance in the estimation strategy foreign models and variables of interest for this evaluation were all pre-specified in a registered analysis plan The Benchmark model includes a dummy variable for treatment assignment controls for the Baseline value of outcomes of Interest a vector of age dummies capturing the age of the index child at Baseline as well as controls for Baseline variables where imbalances were identified the additional controls included in the specification are used to increased Precision but there are no significant changes in estimated treatment effects vis-a-vis a simpler specification including only the treatment dummy and in the paper we report consistent effects in the simpler specification this graph then captures the key results of the evaluation for non-cognitive skills variables these variables were measured in surveys administered primarily to the girl but also to her parent or Guardian again two years after the initiation of the program following the completion of grade seven we constructed a series of indices capturing dimensions of non-cognitive skills targeted by the program and of interest to whom to read we can observe in this graph that there are large and statistically significant increases in indices capturing a number of non-cognitive skills that includes future planning gender Norms empowerment socio-emotional support we observe that girls exposed to the treatment are more able to articulate goals for the future they perceive more Equitable gender norms and express a preference for boys and girls to be treated equally they express a greater willingness to advocate for themselves and they identify more sources of social emotional support among their peers their communities we fail to identify significant treatment effects on some other dimensions including aspirations self-esteem freedom of movement and canto's ladder and for marital expectations we observe a negative treatment effect that reflects in fact a decisive shift by treatment girls toward naming 18 as the appropriate age of marriage relative to both younger and older ages room tweets curriculum places a substantial emphasis on 18 as the minimum age of marriage and that appears to have caused some girls to update their prior about an older age as an appropriate age for marriage down to 18. at the bottom of this graph we report variables linked to parental attitudes we see no shift in Parental reported gender attitudes perhaps unsurprising given that their direct exposure to programming was minimal and we see a negative shift in the parental perception of the girl parents report girls are more selfish they are less likely to cooperate and that's consistent We Believe with the previous evidence that girls are more likely to advocate for themselves or more likely to stake out an independent View finally enumerators were also asked to assess girls on their ability to manage the interview to answer questions their self-possession and we observe also a significant and positive increase in the enumerator's assessment of the girl it's also important to note that we measured girls performance on some demonstration-based tasks designed to measure life skills the most notable was a scavenger hunt in which girls were asked to find certain items in the community and negotiate to obtain them however implementation of the scavenger hunt was complex and implementation challenges vendor interpretation of this null result difficult the second key set of outcomes pre-specified for this analysis is education here we will port a series of variables linked to Dropout the first two are reported in our own inline survey conducted following seventh grade so we observe a reduction in Dropout by n line and an increase in the probability that girls have progressed to 7th grade we then analyzed Dropout and administrative data that we obtained for grades six through nine so by grade nine this is about slightly over a year after the end line in the first months in which girls would be enrolled in grade nine we can observe that the decline in Dropout is persistent and significant and it's of roughly a consistent magnitude which is a 25 decline in Dropout relative to Dropout in the control arm it's important to note that the initiation of Grade 9 secondary school is a major point of Dropout in the Indian educational system particularly for girls so we observe in the control arm Dropout increases from around 10 percent in grades six seven and eight up to nearly 25 percent in grade nine but the treatment effect showing that girl is exposed to him to read are less likely to drop out remains persistent we also examine the effect of girls education program on a number of other outcomes of Interest that includes School attendance test scores on tests administered by the survey team at home the Acer test as well as administratively reported test scores child labor and child marriage and we observe statistically insignificant effects on all of these additional outcomes we also conducted a series of pre-specified heterogeneity analyzes and found little evidence of heterogeneity with respect to school quality based on child age maternal education or exposure of the household to recent Chucks thank you just to briefly discuss the results we find the growth and socio-emotional support reported for our life skills indices is consistent with reduced Dropout and that girls appeal to Value social engagement more with no effect on school performance so girls may be remaining in school because they benefit from stronger peer relationships they appreciate those relationships they're eager to maintain their higher level of social engagement but they do not appear to have shifted their level of time invested in school or academic studies something that we test directly and they do not appear to be more successful conditional enrollment in school we also find that girls clearly are exercising more decision-making power but it's not obvious that they're using this agency to negotiate with their parents around staying in school in fact we find evidence that parental and child preferences around education seem relatively well aligned and that both parties have a strong preference for further education even in the control sample at unline two-thirds of parents reported that they expected their daughters to complete at least senior secondary school that would be grade 12 and 71 stated their daughters would complete at least five more years of schooling Beyond grade seven so despite the fact that girls report greater levels of empowerment it's not clear that in this context they're using that greater empowerment to negotiate vis-a-vis their parents just to sum up while past research has demonstrated that material transfers can be used to promote schooling we show that non-material interventions targeting attitudinal barriers can generate shifts in schooling as well gep has a significant impact on girls social support in school and this appears to play a central role by increasing the shadow value of continued School enrollment from the girls perspective it's also important to note that there are clear advantages to delivering this program in school rates of program participation were high and a school-based delivery mechanism enables the intervention to amplify effects of strength and friendship networks that already existed in school of course the trade-off is that the most vulnerable girls may have already been absent so even by grade six they were no longer enrolled and were not targeted by the intervention so this highlights the trade-offs inherent in targeting programming particularly focused to girls inside versus outside schools thank you very much [Music]
