thank you very much for having me this is joint work with sarah eckmeyer from university of munich this study is a collection of messaging experiments designed to test ways to increase vaccine demand among a disadvantaged population in the us our motivation for doing this work is that there are stark racial health gradients that antidated cova 19 but certainly were highlighted during the pandemic many factors contributed to the pre-existing racial health gap but low take-up of preventative care explains part of it this low take-up is not only costly for individuals in terms of increased morbidity mortality but it can also be costly for society in the transmission of infectious diseases moreover take-up of preventative care is very uneven and it's lower among those disadvantaged by race income education and it's lower for men than women prior work in oakland testing interventions to address racial health gaps found that race concordance between black doctors and patients in real life medical encounters significantly increased the demand for preventative health care among black men however the mechanism for those findings were unclear as medical doctors were not scripted and there were no white participants moreover it takes a long time to train a doctor is there anything that we could do in the interim in this study we precisely control and experimentally vary the script given by perceived medical experts in a one-way communication setting that includes both white and black subjects we conducted an online experiment distributing a standardized video message about the safety and effectiveness of the flu shot our sample consisted of black and white men without a college education and we conditioned on not having received a flu shot yet we experimentally varied three aspects of the message first for both white and black respondents we buried the race concordance of the expert sender keeping the signal constant the next two iterations were only for black respondents given the pipeline issues and the current non-diverse physician workforce we tested whether acknowledgement of past injustice by discordant experts could help bridge trust gaps and we tested whether a non-expert such as a community health worker would work as well as an expert if non-experts were non-inferior it could be a quick scalable intervention that would also provide community-based jobs we collected data in two ways last blue season and this flu season during cobia 19. this figure shows the study flow we recruited online elicited prior beliefs in vaccine intent and then randomized we recruited around 600 1600 black respondents in varied dimensions of lay versus expert within concordant concordant versus discordant within the standard message and then within the latter discordant arm acknowledgement of injustice versus the standard signal for white respondents we vary concordance only we distributed flu shot coupons those shots are often provided free or covered by insurance and had an inline survey that asked about whether respondents had gotten a flu shot anywhere to produce our videos we created a script about 40 seconds long and hired 10 actors 5 black men and 5 white men that were of the same age range and relative builds actors either dressed as an expert or a layperson in the expert condition they wore white coats and stethoscopes and they had the same dress shirt tie and background in the late person condition they wore white t-shirts and again this is within uh racially concordant actors for black respondents only our main script stated the centers for disease control and prevention or cdc recommends everyone six months and older get the flu shot this was the official recommendation then it said the shot protects you from getting sick by cutting your chance of catching the flu in half this was a statement about its effectiveness it also is very safe less than 100 vaccinated people experiences a side effect this was a statement about its safety we also dispelled a common myth the shock does not contain an active flu virus so you cannot get the flu virus from the shot we ended with a personal endorsement i get the flu shot every year to protect myself my family and my community also highlighting the externality there and ended with a personal recommendation i recommend you look into getting the flu shot as soon as possible for the injustice acknowledgement we added three short sentences i know some people are nervous to follow medical advice about vaccines in the past there may have been times when the medical community broke your trust but i hope that sharing some information with you can help you understand how important the flu shot is now there are many degrees of freedom with such a message could be delivered but actually our message was quite prescient in fact it was very similar to what was recommended recently in the annals of internal medicine when talking to communities of color about the kova 19 vaccine now i'm going to turn to the results and they're organized by hypothesis discordant versus concordant racial expert and also within hypothesis by outcome family so starting with discordance versus concordance and also starting with black respondents so we have here rating of the sender which includes the sender's qualifications to give medical advice rating of the signal recall of the factual content of the message beliefs are about the safety of the flu shot interest in getting the flu shot as proxy by looking uh up a nearby pharmacy for example intent to get a flu shot and in the second season of our study coca-19 vaccination intent since it's possible that vaccine hesitancy affects both types of shots now what we find is was that for black respondents assigned to a race concordant expert that increased the rating of the sender by 0.18 standard deviation units and the rating of the message that same exact message just read by a different expert a different race expert 5.14 standard deviation units the other outcomes particularly those on flu shot and covet 19 vaccination intent are positive but are not statistically significant we also find no difference in terms of redemption of the coupon or self-reported vaccine behavior this slide has the exact same layout but is for white respondents note that we see no effects of concordance across any outcome so some coefficients are positive and some are negative this rules out the notion that our black expert actors were somehow just better than the white experts again there was not an effect on vaccine taco this slide answers the question what is the impact of acknowledging racial injustice on flu vaccine demand among black respondents who are paired with a racially discordant provider this is a very important slide because it speaks to the modal experience of a black patient who goes to the healthcare sector today compared to the standard message from a discordant provider the acknowledgement message increased the rating of the signal by 0.142 standard deviation units this is precisely what we manipulated the signal so it's fascinating to see results on this margin and it's in fact very similar in size to the point estimate we saw for race concordance for black respondents similar to the last findings we also observe weekly positive effects on both flu shot and cova 19 vaccination intent but no effect on the outcome of flu shot take-up next we test whether a concordant lay person could substitute for a medical expert in terms of providing information to black respondents again this is to address the policy relevant pipeline issue indeed we find that laypersons are rated as 0.540 standard deviation units lower than the experts the signal is also rated on average slightly more negative however this is the only intervention to actually increase recall of content in a significant fashion by 0.117 standard deviation units moreover it also increased code 19 vaccination intent by statistically significant 8.8 percentage points for 20 lastly it was the only intervention to actually affect flu shot take up by non-significant 1.8 percentage points at the individual level and a significant four percentage points or 52 at the household level next we compare across all interventions this is for the outcome of flu vaccination intent we start looking at the light blue bars on the right these represent white respondents and again here we see no effect of concordance on the left the dark blue left most bar represents again the modal experience of a black person seeking health care today which is to be prepared with a discordant medical expert giving a standard message this group this randomized group has the lowest intent to get vaccinated only 34 but by pairing with a concordant expert or one that acknowledges injustice we can increase this to close to 37 and get the highest intention when actually paired with a concorded non-expert 39 these differences are even more stark than looking at the novel coca-19 vaccines which were under emergency authorization at the time again starting with white respondents we see no difference in means across arms concordance for them doesn't seem to be playing a huge role 45 no matter what but moving to black respondents we can increase from 40 to 43 to 45 percent with a concordant expert or a discordant expert who acknowledges past injustice and can get even higher to 52 percent when paired with a concordant layperson lastly in this paper we look at heterogeneity specifically we are interested in examining how individuals at different distances from the take-up threshold would respond to the interventions and we proxy for this distance by prior vaccine experience in particular whether they have never received a flu shot received one recently or received one in the distance past we label these as never takers ever takers and recent takers what we find is that the layperson effects are really driven by individuals who have never received a flu shot in the past those respondents make up about a quarter of our sample and even their rating of the late person signal is now positive and this stands in contrast to what we find for the concordance effects the concordance effects for on black respondents the positive signal and sender effect as well as the positive effects on covet and flu shot intentions are all coming from recent takers again we can look at the p values here and see that they're actually different that these two groups of respondents are responding very differently to the same intervention similar to the concordance pattern we see the pattern for acknowledgement where acknowledgement from a discordant expert has positive effects among recent takers and negative or null effects among never takers and those differences are often significant so the bottom line is this for people with more familiarity health care system an expert who is concordant or one that is discordant and acknowledges injustice works best for those who have less experience with vaccinate and are likely more wary of the health care system a knowledge lay person works best so in summary we found that concordant experts have positive effects on ratings of the signal and sender but for black respondents only there is no effect of concordance any out white respondents could we must be acknowledging past injustice well we didn't find a backlash in fact we found positive effects you know and on coding 19 vaccination intention but it's important to underscore that these interventions work best on individuals who already have some prior experience with vaccination what about building trust via social proximity remember our sample is limited to individuals that don't have a college degree in this sample non-expert concordance lay people were judged as less qualified but had positive effects on recall intention and importantly flu shot take-up and these effects were concentrated on among respondents with the least prior experience with vaccination so our findings suggest that the message and the messenger should be tailored to an individual based on how far he is from the take-up threshold they also underscore the importance role non-expert senders can play in providing trusted medical advice thank you
