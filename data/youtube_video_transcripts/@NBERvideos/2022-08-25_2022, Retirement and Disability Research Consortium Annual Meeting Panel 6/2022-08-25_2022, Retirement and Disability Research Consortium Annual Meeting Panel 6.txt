thank you nicole thanks for asking me to moderate this really interesting panel and the impacts of kova 19 and thanks to everyone for tuning in to the last session of the conference which i um guarantee will be a great one so as we all know the kobe 19 pandemic has just brought so much disruption to many areas of our lives and to name just one i don't think any of us thought that we would still be sitting here in our living rooms at our third uh virtual conference of the rdrc um but the three papers in this panel will be examining different aspects of how copit19 has affected retirement social security and the role of household composition and helping older adults weather the pandemic so we're going to first hear from angie chen from boston college who will tell us about how covet 19 induced early retirement compares to the great recession the second paper will be presented by leora friedberg and is entitled how will copen 19 excess mortality affect social security benefit payouts and finally we'll hear from samara sheckler at harvard about household composition resource use and the resilience of older adults living in the community during clover 19. so i think everyone knows the drill by now authors you have 12 minutes and i will verbally give you a two minute warning the audience is welcome to submit questions through the q a and the authors will be answering as they are able but we might come back to some of those questions during the discussion at the end so without further ado i'll hand it over to angie thank you um can everyone see my slides um all right so i am angie from the center for retirement research at boston college and i'm going to be talking about the impact of covid on social security claiming um and this is joint work with uh cion liu and alicia menel also from the center thank you for ssa for funding this research and nvr for organizing this conference our standard disclaimer so like the great recession the code recession came after several years of strongly expanding economy and while initially many feared that code would result in a spike in early claiming among older workers research on the pandemic recession has found only very small increases in retirement rates and so the difference in outcomes reflected is in the many ways that the covert recession is different from the code of deception first and foremost the cause of kobud was a health crisis that shut down offices and businesses and increased mortality um the covert recession also did not induce a collapse in the asset and housing markets um and three the duration of the recession was very short relative to coded there was a lot more expanded relief measures including the eip and much more generous ui benefits as well as expansion eligibility and then lastly the demographic's also different for example coded what had a stronger effect on certain uh minority groups because they're both more susceptible to um covet related health risks as well as more um uh likely to face job loss as well similarly uh women carried most of the child caring burden and so would have had different employment outcomes due to coverage as well but people continue to claim so the focus of this paper is how do the characteristics of code induce early claimers differ from those induced by the great recession and how did uh that affect the lifetime social security benefits of claimers relative to the great recession so the hypothesis is that workers facing given the different the unique nature of covert recession workers facing higher health risks uh and who are unable to work remotely would be more sensitive to higher unemployment rates during cohort and more likely to exit the labor force and claim early uh wealthier workers would have likely benefited from the booming stock market and housing markets during covid and enable them to claim earlier workers with lower earnings would have faced a higher replacement rate um and making claiming ui or looking for a job much more much better than uh claiming social security so but given these opposite forces at play um the effective covert on early claiming of um different workers overall can be a little ambiguous um so we work uh so when comparing these we um we define early claiming as claimed before the fra um the claiming age of most respondents comes from will come from administrative linked data the results shown in this powerpoint are from self-reported claim data because we didn't get the results through the closure in time and the samples comprised of respondents for between ages 62 and their respective fra during the 2004 to 2010 waves and the 2016 to 2820 waves of the hrx so the analysis proceeds in two steps one the first step is we use a hazard model and that reveals the extent to which the two recessions um differentially affected different groups and then from there we use the results from the hazard model to estimate how the changes in claiming patterns affected monthly social security benefits and how they differed in the two recessions so a unique aspect of cobit is the expanded ui benefits um so to measure how ui generosity changed during the great recession and the code of recession we constructed a pseudo placement rate for workers in each tercel of the earth's earnings distribution these rates were defined as the ratio of the maximum possible ui benefit to annual wages for workers who are projected to be eligible in each share cell in each state the state number is within average to get a national number before covert eligible workers are defined as those with sufficient earnings in the base period who are not self-employed and who do not quit their jobs as you can see from the sample calculations on the side the policy relief during the covert raised pseudo ui replacement rates proportionately across all tercels but by doubling the maximum benefit for everyone whereas that differed by earnings to yourself during the code requisition so the results show that certain groups became more likely to claim early during the recession while other groups were less likely there are three groups that i want to focus on for the great recession the first is the behavior of advantage groups so college graduates homeowners those with retirement access and you notice that they during the great recession they before the recession during the good times um they were less likely to claim early but then um when the recession hit they became just as likely as other groups um to claim um the second is poor health um this is important for comparison with the current recession um and so notice here that they were not less likely to um they were less likely with that to claim but that that was not statistically significant and the third is is low edge workers and notice that there is not um there's no difference so here we look at the code of recession you see the picture it looks really different and so a few forces are at play here um so interestingly the behavior among the more advantaged groups are somewhat split workers who are homeowners had a deeply planned or had other assets were more likely to claim early when unemployment rates are high relative to an unemployment rate low this contrasts with what we saw in the great recession when the stock and housing market crash resulting in many losing some of their retirement savings uh on the other hand workers with a college degree um another advantage group were less likely to claim early during the um when the unemployment rates were high during coverage the claiming behavior of those poor health are much more sensitive to high important rates than healthy workers um and that was unlike the great recession mainly because this recession was caused by a health crisis and so but the major differentiating aspect as you can see from the big red bar at the bottom of the chart is the unprecedented increase in ui benefits so these expanded benefits were also targeted at low wage workers as the additional 600 weekly benefits would replace a much higher share of earnings for low-wage workers than for higher rates workers and indeed the enhanced ui benefits had an especially strong effect on reducing the airline claiming of lower wage workers relative to high wage workers so changes in early claiming have implications for social security benefits because those who claim early will receive an actuarially reduced benefit and during the great recession the induced effect was strongest among workers in the middle earnings store sales was roughly true percentage point increase in early cleaning property probabilities however had smaller effects on um on monthly benefits in contrast due to the generous ui benefits the code recession had virtually no effect impact on early claiming particularly among lower earners and for this group the generous benefits negated the impact of unemployment rates and resulted in no changes and claimed penalties on their monthly benefit level so in conclusion the health and luck the health and lockdown impacts of covert increase the likelihood of early claiming but exceptional gains in the asset markets and unprecedented expansion and generosity of ui pushed against the health effects in the end the competing effects largely canceled each other out and resulted in virtually no change in early claiming as a result of the code recession however it did result in increase in the relative likelihood of early claiming among those in poorer health women and interestingly those with assets on the other hand generous ui benefits prevented induced early claimers for um among lower owners that's it i'll turn it back over to gobi thanks angie that was great um we'll move right on ahead to the second paper um i'm told that leora has connectivity problems so but thankfully her co-author tony webb from the new school is available to take her place and present their joint paper hi sir tony webb here uh i wasn't anticipating uh presenting this so this is entirely unrehearsed um um so we we we're examining the the impacts of covet excess mortality on the social security benefit payouts uh now we anticipate that and this is joint work with irena douchey of the social security hi tony uh sorry do you want me to show the do you want me to help out with the slides i have them here oh i would really appreciate that if you can load them now how do i advance them um give me one you can just tell me and i will do that for you so give me one second here okay thank you so much okay uh right move on to the next slide okay so we we we're anticipating that uh during coverage there will be increased benefit payouts to those who increased earlier who who who chose to retire earlier earlier than expected and there there will be increased benefits to the survivors of kobe victims who died unexpectedly early now offsetting this we are going to have a saving of benefits to people who died earlier than expected uh move on to the next slide please okay so the the question is uh uh how big will the the saving in in interest trust fund payouts be now it it really all depends on the frailty of those who die and the the number of years like the number number of year years of life expectancy of those people we know that the the the coveted deaths were concentrated amongst those who who were frail and we we started off by making a baseline assumption that coveted mortality was proportional to all causes of mortality and this assumption makes our our job easier uh so that is the the the uh but the the complicating factor is that the death of a frail individual may accelerate the payment of of over benefits to that individual's uh survivor move on to the next slide please so we we start off with a simple spreadsheet model that makes the assumption that the recovered mortality is a a proportional to all causes of mortality by age group we we calculate the the number of of years life lost now we then do a a more sophisticated analysis which involves the merging of the several administrative data sets we we calculate the the mortality if the pandey the pandemic hadn't happened we calculate the number of pandemic deaths and for for both scenarios we examine the the earnings histories and marital status uh move on to the next slide please okay so for for the simple spreadsheet model we find that the number of life years lost is extremely small move on to the next slide please and the this is a graph showing the the average number of months of life months of life lost by by age averaged over the population and as you can see at younger ages the the the the the the average length of life lost was uh under one month and as older ages it was only approaching 1.44 months so so we'll move on to the next slide please okay so we we we then carry out a uh of a more sophisticated analysis we're we're we're calculating first of all the the the mortality if the pandemic hadn't happened um uh we we the the the the the basic data set is the cps merged with the the cpsa sec merge of administrative data the problem is that the cps doesn't have data on on health status uh move on to the next slide please um so the the the methodology is that we estimate a [Music] a a multivariate prohibit model using using health and retirement study data we we calculate the probability of each individual in the hrs having a any one of a number of of dread diseases given their socioeconomic status we we use the the output of the hrs model to to to to protect to to to project mortality onto the cps sample now with the the cps sample we we we also estimate a gumparts mortality model using the hrs data and we use the the the gompertz mortality model plus the the projected uh health statuses to calculate individual specific uh lifetables for for individuals in the cps uh we we examine the cps data for the period of the 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 we figure out who has died of covid and we we calculate the number of years life lost for each individual who's died of govid given their socio socioeconomic and imputed health status uh we we we then examined the individual's earnings records and calculate the the the benefits saved as a result of the individual's untimely death now a a part of the work that is is not yet uh complete is merging the cps individuals into households and figuring out how much of the saving of the the the deceased person's uh benefits is offset by earlier than otherwise anticipated payments of a survivor benefit we find that we we find that a differential mortality as a result of cps is higher for people under 50. we find that [Music] the differential mortality is is lower for women and lower for for individuals in the the highest quarter of lifetime earnings interestingly we find no differential effect by education marital status race or ethnicity which lends support to our our our base case height base case base case hypothesis that uh covered mortality was was broadly proportional to all cause mortality move on to the next slide please tony you have about two and a half minutes oh i'm sorry i'm i'm i'm i'm running slow so we we we find that the impact on the trust fund is you're on your last slide tony so you actually have to be here okay all right so we're we're finding that the the the impact on the trust fund is relatively small uh consistent with with gal's work uh the the the impact by sds is is gonna be more consequential now a a final word here the research fits into our broader research agenda our broader research agenda the that is examining the the impact of differentials in mortality and and and claim-age behavior by a socio-economic status and the the broad message of this research agenda is that there's a less we less uh redistribution through social security that than we might expect and we we we're finding there's a similar effects as a result of covid that a loss of that the the redistribution as a result of cobin in terms of lifetime benefits is relatively small even prior to factoring in the survivor benefits and is even less after factoring in the fact that the deceased spouses of individuals who died from covid will go on to get a survivor benefit so i thank you for your your time i apologize that this was a somewhat unrehearsed uh as as courtney said uh leora was having trouble with her laptop and i had to go through the presentation uh doing it cold so i thank you for your time and i'll hand it back to the chair well thank you tony for stepping in on a moment's notice we're going to go right to the third paper um and i'll hand it over to samara thanks so much gopi um let's see i think i've got should be able to see my slide yes um oop sorry about that all right so i am really excited to be able to bring home this fantastic conference with a discussion of the work that we've done on household composition so this work was co-developed by chris herbert and jen bolinsky obviously with the support of social security administration the university of wisconsin i'll start with our standard disclaimer that the work doesn't represent federal government policy or opinion but we'll get started so our project explored older adult resilience we frame this as the ability to maintain health and welfare through a disruptive period we worry that people in a resource poor circumstance are going to have a harder time adapting to a disruption we also worry that older adults are more likely to live with chronic conditions which makes them less flexible and it reduces their ability to cope with an unexpected event household composition which we're describing as living alone or living with a partner or with a family or unrelated co-resident could affect this resilience by changing the resources that are available to an older adult so for instance some household types might experience more economic stability other household types might have better access to informal care and support depending on who is in that household on the other hand we could imagine that household composition might increase exposure to health risks to caregiver strain to isolation or to loneliness we expect resilience is going to be related to some of the characteristics according to household composition let's see i wonder if i could get um if i could get the slides presented for me i'm having trouble switching back and forth between my notes and the slides without switching the screen share of course give me one second here sure um i'll just talk while you're getting it up um so there has not uh been a lot of resource research that compares household types to each other but the literature does it generally supports our intuition that experiences do differ by household composition type so for instance single person households tend to have a higher rate of poverty loneliness of social isolation and of mortality and partner households tend to have more economic resources available to them and better health and we also see co-resident arrangements that are more economically efficient so let's see co-residence also creates opportunities for care exchange that that doesn't necessarily exist in in the other household types we also see that older adults were more susceptible to severe disease from coved and they general they generally had less access to technology oh i'm sorry could you advance to the next slide thank you so much um we could imagine that uh that certain household types would be better positioned uh to help residents cope with these many changes um and early evidence has suggested that older adult outcomes may in fact have deferred by household composition type so we think that cova 19 was a good uh stress point to test our our question about household composition type and its impacts if you can advance the slide please um so our research first explored the resources that were associated with each household composition type pre-pandemic um before uh before the pandemic happened and then we then framed the pandemic period as a stress test to detect the ways in which resilience was associated with the different types we expected that older adults living alone would have the fewest resources to adapt to the pandemic and would experience the greatest rates of unmet needs during the pandemic and that older adults who lived in more complex houses would have resources to adapt but they would also have to respond to more complicated household circumstances more uh disruptions and changes next slide please we used uh go ahead yeah thank you we use the health and retirement study um including their supplemental covet survey which was conducted between june and september of 2020 um the primary survey was fielded between march and may march 2020 and may of 2021 so that expanded a pretty wide range of experiences from shutdown through vaccination all right next slide please we considered measures of resilience associated with financial adequacy um such as whether a household had rationed food or whether they were able to meet their housing costs we also thought about the supports they received and whether these supports appeared to be consistent and commend spirit with the health and functional ability of the respondent next slide please we defined single person households as any adult who was living alone spouse partner households lived only with their spouse or partner and no one else um and then cult resident households describe the rest of our sample about a third of 2018 households fit into each category with partner households just a couple of percentage points smaller we further differentiated co-resident household types for our research but i'm not going to discuss these findings today for time all right next slide all right keep going we'll start with our pre-pandemic experiences it's helpful to identify trends by race and ethnicity due to disparities experienced in education employment housing and health care so in this first slide we see that a large share of both black and hispanic residents cluster into co-resident households we also see that the share of black residents living alone increases with age that's that purple barn next slide please on the other hand home ownership can be a protective factor since homeowners uh don't have to deal with housing cost increases uh that are enforced by the market and the house itself is an asset that could be used to smooth disruptions partner households at every age you'll see are more likely to be homeowners so there's an advantage in this household type uh advance this slide please partner households also had higher income overall at all ages seen here in those purple bars the orange bars show the share of income that was contributed by any social security program benefit these are both rand constructed variables as households age so you can see these are divided by h brackets social security becomes the largest portion of income for partner households advanced slide please this shows us the rate of respondents who need or receive help with their activities of daily living including things like toileting getting in and out of bed eating bathing walking or dressing under age 65 single person households needed more help but they received less support than the other types so that's the top part of our chart they were also more likely to rely on professional supports by age 75 so the bottom set of bars co-resident households needed more help than other types but they were also much more likely to receive assistance particularly they relied on adult children for this help partner households had the lowest rate of functional difficulty go ahead and advance please taken together single person households had lower income they received fewer benefits going into the pandemic they relied on more professional support and were less likely to receive uh functional assistance compared to their rate of need partner households on the other hand had higher income they had more benefits they were more likely to own their own home they also had less functional difficulty and then co-resident households were more diverse they were likely to rent but they received more personal care and assistance from family members likely in the home all right go ahead and keep going now we'll consider the pandemic experiences by household type so we're looking at 20 20 experiences co-resident households reported more pandemic pandemic-related economic hardships these were especially more likely to uh these household types were especially more likely to have missed a rent or mortgage payment um partner households on the other hand were least likely to experience financial difficulties in fact more than three out of four of the partner household respondents said they didn't have any of these uh listed pandemic hardships at all and the way this question was constructed it basically listed all these potential hardships and said did you experience any of these and and only 25 of partner households had any challenges in these areas all right next slide pandemic related income changes might have been at the root of some of these hardships that we're seeing in the co-resident households so almost a quarter of the residents thank you household types estimated income loss due to the pandemic um primarily due to changes in earnings from work the darkest blue slices of the pie chart show that spending increases shown in the yellow bar were also common experienced by well over over a quarter of those co-resident households all right next slide we use the covid supplement to statistically assess significant pandemic income changes that we're seeing and and see if we can detect any uh any statistical significance the primary independent variable was household composition and we controlled for these various individual characteristics next slide partner households were in fact about three and a half percent more likely to maintain a steady income through the early pandemic period and three percent less likely to experience an income loss related to the pandemic when compared to their co-resident counterparts relationships like of the remains steady across quintiles but they were larger differences for the younger respondents go ahead and advance two slides um so support and assistance is another key metric that we'll want to explore this chart presents the total hours of monthly support by year in 2020 there appears to be a drop in hours of assistance received by older adults who lived alone which is that purple line and we took a closer look at this group as a result next slide we modeled an outcome variable from the covet survey that asks whether anyone living outside the home helped resident with errands rides chores this kind of thing because of the pandemic we found that people living alone were 22 percent more likely to rely on help from outside the home than those living in co-residence these differences didn't vary by age or income and this makes sense right suggesting that uh differences in pandemic period supports may have been related to the availability of these outside of the home caregivers all right next slide then finally we took a look at total hours of support and assistance between 2010 and 2020 with standard errors clustered at the household level the the treatment effect was the interaction between household composition type and year we didn't see any meaningful differences so we restricted the analysis just to respondents who received any help whose income was in the bottom three quintiles or are under about 60 000 a year and who identified themselves as black or hispanic so this outcome table it compares the output each year to a baseline of co-resident households in 2010 and shows that this group of lower to middle middle income adults of color received 63 hours less monthly support in 2020 as compared to the co-resident households in the base year of 2010. um so it might have been harder for these older adults living alone to get support in 2020 um and we see that there may have been some disparities by race and ethnicity all right next slide please uh we worry that these findings suggest that there were disproportionate rates of unmet needs for care and assistance experienced by older adults who lived alone during the pandemic this might have been especially true for older adults of color living at middle and lower incomes co-resident households had stable access to assistance but may have experienced more financial disruption and hardship as evidenced by uh the self-reports of income loss and and the various economic hardships that they noted spouse and partner households had more economic resources and better health at baseline coming into the pandemic and they showed fewer changes in finance or health during the disruption all right last slide please um so our findings suggest that to help older adults cope with periods of disruption such as the pandemics such as uh you know weather-related disruptions and and other major disasters we explore policy opportunities to improve financial stability of co-resident households and increase support and assistance resources available to older adults who are living alone thank you so much i look forward to our conversation all right thank you um i think we have about 20 minutes left for discussion um i've seen a few questions in the q a but you can keep those coming while we kind of give samara some time to catch a breath i just wanted to ask the authors of the first paper question so i was wondering if you were able to examine in addition to social security claiming anything about um work or self-reported retirement and in particular i'm curious whether there was either more or less of a you know coupling of those two during the covid recession relative to the um great recession or if you've looked into that at all or planned to in future work yeah that's a great question um so in our particular paper we didn't look compare the differences between social security claiming versus retirement or self-reported retirement um but other papers have including i think kobe you have one and some of our my colleagues at the center have also have a paper that shows that uh even though typically uh social security claiming and retirement are connected um very strongly um koben seems to be one of the first times where there's a little difference um in terms of claiming versus retirement um there it also um seems to matter like when you look at the data so a lot of these studies that did look at the difference um kind of focused in around 2020 or early 2021 um but just sort of casual looking casually looking at employment data by age um we do see that there was a different kind of an increase in employment among older workers um sort of in the second half of 2021 and has continued so i think to revisit this data later and see how whether they are still linked strongly linked like before or whether there's been a separation but that's temporary um will be very interesting yeah i mean one advantage your data has that at least some earlier work including my own suffers from is just the ability to look at both of those in one data set which i think was valuable um so uh to leora and and tony um i was wondering if you could talk more about just the mortality experience by married individuals versus singles and just the implications that that differential has for survivor benefits and in particular whether that differential changed at all um during the course of the pandemic there was also a question asked in the q a which i saw that you answered but you know if you could talk a little bit about the potential for you know correlated sort of mortality risk within households because of the uh infectious um disease risk that affected these populations during this time okay i'll take the second question first say very good question uh we we will be examining uh whether there is a correlated mortality risk the correlation may arise both as a result of infection and and also as a result of of correlation and socioeconomic status the problem we have is that even with our relatively large data set we don't have that many covered deaths so it may not be possible to say that much as to the level of correlation uh now as to the first question when we estimate our gumparts mortality model we observe the usual mortality differentials between married and single individuals the key finding of the the mortality model incorporating covid is that the the coveted mortality rate is not higher amongst single individuals and amongst the the covert mortality rate is not higher amongst the single individuals and amongst married individuals uh now uh uh bear in mind that that when we're estimating a a covert mortality model we're estimating a a probit model and therefore the marginal effects vary with the uh the the the non-covered characteristics so it doesn't mean that um uh the single individuals unconditionally have a lower a a greater risk of covid than married individuals all right um a little bit on a similar topic samara in your paper i i noticed that co-residents were sort of the it was the catch-all category and but i but i think that your summary showed that these there's actually some variation within this co-resident group and co-resident can mean very different things could you talk a little bit about those findings too which i know you didn't have time to present yeah it's a great question we actually spent a lot of time at the beginning of this project trying to figure out how we wanted to even discuss co-residents because it is such a diverse category a diverse group so we ended up um constructing two different um sub categorizations to to see kind of try to understand what matters right because obviously some of these structures may be for economic reasons you know some are for caregiving reasons probably they differ somewhat by age um so first we broke out co-resident households um by relationship um so we noticed that about one in five of the households in our sample included a relative and all residents in the household were over 18 and then another 10 percent included a relative but there was also a child a minor child in the house and only two percent of the sample had um only unrelated residents living uh with an older adult um so so we had this kind of relationships criteria and then we also looked at an age based categorization and found that about a quarter of the co-resident of of all our household types were were all adults um eight percent were uh adults with a minor in the home and and four percent uh had just the older adult uh plus a minor child um and so we saw some differences uh by these categories so we ran all of these um you know descriptives according to these different categorizations and we noticed that when there was a minor child in the house um the respondent tended to be younger they were more likely to be working still they had higher income remember the survey captures people as young as 50. so so this makes sense like we would imagine that this is probably the case these households were also like less likely to need support and assistance for health reasons also this would make sense relatedly during the pandemic these household types when there was a kid in the household they were less likely to demonstrate any unmet need for functional assistance during during that pandemic we're still examining financial hardships of these various household types but we think it's likely that they also benefited from some of the pandemic programs that that were out there targeting children so they may have been able to um kind of dip out of multiple pots even though they were complicated to to support but it's also noted that in in these households when there was a child the older adult uh clovid rates were higher um so so it's um you know there are there are some concerns also about about this household type that's great um so i wanted to ask all three of you a couple of questions if i may just kind of broad overarching questions one is you know um the the pandemic has of course sort of drawn out um much longer than i think many of us anticipated and um some of the results that you all have talked about may be you know speaking to something that's very temporary in nature or something that is has shifted more more structurally going forward and i wonder if each of you could just speak to that a little bit um in your own context about whether you expect some of the effects that you estimated to to continue out you know further than the scope of your data that you were able to analyze thus far so i can start um so so it's it's interesting because the general trend of early claiming um has been declining for several decades and so we were looking at whether there was a sort of a blip uh bump in um early claiming which we did see during the great recession and so the question was whether we would see it and cover it and with our early um analysis up to i think the data goes up to the december of 2020 um we didn't see that i would due to the strong effects of the generous ui benefits i would be curious to revisit it with later data once the ui benefits have largely expired to see whether there would be almost a delayed bump in terms of increases in early clinton knee during coverage i recently we were just looking at the i think the annual statistical supplement from social security for 2021. um there does seem to be a small uptick in claiming at age 62 for example um much smaller in magnitude than that of the good recession um so yeah keeping an eye out on that is definitely on our agenda okay should i go next sure um yeah so the the way in which our our calculations are set up uh we are calculating the the saving in the social security benefits on the assumption that the covid comes to an end in september 2021 which is the most recent mortality data we've got now our our results are not affected by by the fact that those who live are the healthier and longer life expectancy individuals so there's no knock-on effect as there was in gals paper now the big unanswered question is what is going to happen with covid after september 2021. uh even if it mutates in something like a rather nasty seasonal flu we are likely i think to see higher deaths than we've seen a lower life expectancy than we've seen in the past as for the magnitude of that effect i i haven't calculated it but i suspect it might be relatively small i think that there are a couple sort of colliding trends that we noticed that that older adults experienced by household composition type um during covet um but i think uh that a lot of the lack of access to care that we may be observing for folks who lived alone is the real result of their reliance on professional care um you know paid supports which i mean the bottom kind of dropped out of that workforce string during the pandemic right um so i think that there are a couple things that we can take from that first of all we still see um struggles in that area right in in that industry to to provide um the support and assistance you know to staff people and and get people in um i think one thing to take one one note to take from from this observation is the um potential instability that we introduce with our really significant reliance on on informal care um on and and and also when we uh you know pay well you know some some some uh payments are only available uh to unrelated caregivers um so so we see in the co-resident arrangements we see financial hardships um and we see a lot of unpaid care being provided and we see in in folks living alone uh we see uh kind of probably a drop off of paid professional care um so we could imagine we could close some of these gaps with policies that were paying folks to provide care to their families because they that would stabilize the income stream through disruptions like this and we would have less sort of workforce stutters that that could be introduced by all of the economic challenges that that happen during various kinds of large-scale disruptions well thanks samara you touched on my what was going to be my next question um and so uh and maybe my last question because we're getting close to time um but i wonder if um if angie and tony at least could also um add a little bit on what you think are some of the policy implications of your work um so just generally how do your findings inform the way that we should think about older adults in in either future downturns or hopefully that future pandemics okay shall i come in on this um [Music] so i i think that our our research speaks to the the progressivity of social social security uh the previous research has examined the progressivity in terms of the three-part benefit formula in terms of differences in terms of socioeconomic differences and mortality the reality is that there are many other ways in which the program is susceptible to adverse selection that that may affect the the progressivity of the program and i'm thinking of things such as a socioeconomic and racial differences in marriage uh socio-economic differences and claim ages and the relationship between the claim age and mortality um we have a number of papers that are various stages of completeness and our long-term goal is to to put it all together and make a somewhat more definitive statement about the extent to which the program is or not progressive as a basis for policy makers to to consider the uh equity uh uh uh implications of possible reforms um so our paper our big finding was really that the expanded ui benefits did impact did help lower income workers um sort of reduce their early claiming um inducement and so to the ex and so what one of the charts i showed was that um in the great recession the ui was sort of benefit was spread out across the different income groups and that didn't lead to uh much differential effect among early claiming whereas this time around where the ui was really targeted at lower income groups and it's really seemed to help the um reduce the they induced early claiming effect of the recession and so that that is something to think about um in future downturns of like targeting different groups that might be um more vulnerable to job loss or early claiming what is also interesting on the flip side though is the the amount of actual monthly benefits lost because of induced early claiming and so you know lower income workers um do tend to claim early regardless of whether there's a recession or not and so the difference in months for and how that translates into actual benefit loss um even though there was i think two to four percent percentage point increase in early claiming um that only translated that translates to a much smaller decrease in uh monthly benefit loss so um kind of comparing the the trade-offs there um would also be important so essentially the expanded ui um helped lower income workers from using the early retirement as sort of an unemployment insurance program in a way so um samara is there anything else you want to add in addition to what you already talked about um only that i think it's really helpful to think about the framework of resilience when we think about aging folks are dealing with health related changes they're dealing with income related changes and simultaneously you know they need resources to to be resilient when when there's you know external you know additional external changes that that they have to navigate and and i think it's helpful to think about the household as one of those sets of resources and and to um you know incorporate that into into an understanding of of what is available to to that older adult um whether um whether those resources are funded right whether that person is being paid to provide support or whether it's um you know they're providing economic stability um but i think you know considering those those additional those additional members of the household at for for the supports that they're offering the older adult is a helpful framework to to think about resilience in context of weather-related emergencies and um you know economic disasters and and even just the health care issues that folks deal with regularly as they age well thanks i think that um wraps up this session um thanks to everyone for joining and um weathering these technical difficulties and especially to tony for jumping in on uh on last minute's notice so i'll hand it back to nicole thank you gopi can you hear me yeah okay well my my my headset made it down to the very last minute um but um i apologize for the for the audio quality it has decided that we are done but before we close um i'd just like to conclude with some thank yous first of all um on behalf of all of us we'd like to thank the social security administration for their unwavering support of the rdrc mission over these past 24 years rdrc research has built an evidence base for policy making that i think will continue to improve program efficiency program access and equity across the u.s population i'd like to also thank the directors of the wisconsin michigan and boston college centers michael collins alicia mannell and john leitner as well as their staffs for helping us put together a great program special thanks are also to janet stein the administrator of the um of the nbr center who makes everything we do run smoothly in one of her her best decisions everest to hire kansa mahum um this conference would not have been possible without without kanta um i'm just incredible to her advocate to her expert attention to detail and preparing and managing this webinar conference from soup to nuts you'd think she had done this before but this was her first conference so um a big round of applause in the virtual uh zoo space tekansa thank you thank you for everything so lastly thank you to all the presenters and to all of you in um in the zoom and youtube audiences thank you for your interest in your engagement with rdrc research a recording of the company available on the nbr website and on youtube in the coming weeks and with that this concludes the 2022 rdrc conference
