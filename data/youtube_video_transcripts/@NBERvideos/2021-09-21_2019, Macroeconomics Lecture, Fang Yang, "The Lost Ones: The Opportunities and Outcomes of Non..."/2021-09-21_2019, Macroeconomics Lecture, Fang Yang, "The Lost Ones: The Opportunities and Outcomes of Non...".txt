what motivates our paper is the following in an economy that is growing the more this most successful surf cohorts actually uh should be better off than the previous ones however reason even that indicates that where the economy is still growing some of the recent cohorts actually also off so what we are going to argue that it is actually important to be thinking more about changes in lifetime opportunities across cohorts and large groups within those cohorts so let me be more specific about what we are measuring as lifetime opportunities and and why so first we're going to measure wage of men and women and wage as a function of human capital and why do we think which is interesting recent paper governor kaplan and winter they measure lifetime earnings across cohorts and uh they found out that um for the medium lifetime earnings for men born in the 1960s cohorts is actually 12 to 19 percent lower than those men boy in the 1940s and the opposite pattern is true for women so um when we a woman boy in the 1960 birth cohort the medium left men is is actually 22 to 33 percent higher and uh well those fundings are really interesting and the change in lifetime earnings may be coming from changing labor supply which is what we want to um actually want to study therefore we're going to measure the change in uh wage in any in particular wage as a function of human capital and also as you can see that the change in main way main actually in the opposite direction and we want to understand whether the change is affecting married and single people differently because most people are in the economy actually in couples and the opposite direction of change may be mitigated and next we're going to measure a change in medical expenses by using aggregate data and cohen jones showed that the ratio of medical expenses over consumption actually has been increased from nine percent in 1975 to 15 in the year 2000. well those are large changes in the aggregate want to see that if how this changing aggregate translate into changing uh in across cohorts and finally we're going to measure life expansion leading life and influential paperback case and dating should measure um mortality rates of white and non-collegiate educated middle-aged americans and they found that multiple of this group actually has been increased by 22 percent and again this is a substantial increase in mortality rates want to see how much of the uh change in mortality rates translate into change in life expectancy and uh let me be more specific about what we do in this paper so we're going to focus on white and non-college educated americans born in the 1940s versus 1960s and why do we focus on this group of people and this is a group that kids and dating have fun to have increased mortality rates and then we document the new facts about the changing in opportunities that those people are facing in terms of in terms of wage medical expenses and life expectancy and then we calibrate a structure model with married and single men and women for the 19 foot 1960 cohorts and then we ask what if we give those group of people the wage schedule medical expenses and life expectancy of the 1940 cohorts and how would the labor supply saving and welfare will be different under this new lifetime opportunities so in summary it's our paper is about documenting the facts of the changing lifetime opportunity and evaluating the effects of those changes through a structural model and uh let me give you some key uh feature about model and in the model they are single and and people and married people and we also model military transitions and uh we allow for human capital here in capital is modeled as past average earnings and human capital is a fact in wage which we find is very important in the data and people in this economy face risks during the working age and also during the retirement age and they can self-insure against those risks through either saving or changing labor supply and we also model specifically government taxes and transfer programs because those programs can provide insurance and they were in place so they maybe have mitigated some of the changes and some of the more detail about the model and it's a lifecycle model when one period in the model is one year and uh during the walking stage which is from age 25 to 65 people are alive for sure and they face weight shock if they are single they may get married if they are married they may get divorced and both spouses in your country can choose to whether to work or not and how many hours to walk and then we move to the retirement stage which is from age 66 to 99. people face health shock and health status may affect medical expenses it also may affect this survival probability and i'm not going to go to more detail about the model instead i'm going to talk about the change in laptop opportunities that we are documenting from the data first i will be talking about changing in wage so this is the estimated wage as a function of of of age when the left panel are for mild people and right panels are for single people and let's look at the married people first so the one on the top is the meat is the average wage for married men born in the 1940 cohorts and we see that average men average which for men boy in the 1940 cohorts is much higher than the average sorry then they uh wage for married women which is the one on the bottom and so there's a pretty large yen wage guy for the 1940 cohorts however over time as we see that on the top we get a wage for men actually has been dropping by nine percent so this is substantial dropping given that the economy is actually growing uh within the uh 20 20 years and then the opposite is happening for married women you see the wage for the women actually has been increasing across cohorts and the painting for the single women a single people is actually very similar to the fighting for many people and both graphs shows that the the gender wage gap that has been observed for the 1940 cohorts is actually being reduced for the 1960 cohort due to the reduction of wage for um for men increase of wage for women so um next let's look at wage conditional human capital so here we have the wage function which is which by age and uh the one on the uh left is four oh one on the left is for for men and the one on the right is for women so uh the solid lands are for 1960 cohort which is the newer we want it to be more available and the dashed lines are actually for 90 40 cohorts and uh let's uh so we have five lines for each cohort and each five line and the human capital library has been fixed so let's look at the one on the bottom which uh the two bottom lines which are for they uh which are for the um people with zero human capital which means that they have not been worked at all so they just entered into the labor market at each age and uh they were on they solo so the one so uh the 1940 cohorts the wage is actually higher than 1960 cohorts so this means that if we have this 90 40 cohorts and the 90 60 crores who are going later the wage for money is actually three dollars and fifty cents lower than uh the people who are born in the 1940s and then as we actually move along the human capital we see that the difference is shrinking so um the power right even at the top which is the people with 99 percent of human capital so those are people really with high human capital we see that people who were boy in 1960s the wage is actually still lower than people who were born in the 1940s so this is true for um for men and if we go to the right panel we see the wait for women we see that the pattern is actually switched so now people were born in the 1960s the wage is actually uh higher than people who were born in the 40s so it's about 30 or 30 cents higher and if we move down the human capital we see that the comparison is being switched again so at the bottom of the human capital we see that uh married women with zero human capital and at 1960s their wage is about 90 cents lower than people who were born in in the 1940s so um the job is true for women too however the job is actually lower than the large job for for men both in terms of the absolute value and also in the percentage term so what we can conclude from this graph is that this large drop in wage conditional human capital and the law is the human capital the larger is the job across corcorans and this is especially uh true for for men and uh so now let me move on to the measured uh out-of-pocket medical expenses which we construct from health and retirement studies so this is only the only happens in the retirement stage so we measure out out of programming expenses from age 66 to 1899 and the graph shows that the medical expenses that face the 1960 cohorts are expecting is going to be uh 80 percent higher than those people who are born in 1940s so again this is pretty large substantial increase for those peop cohorts who were born only 20 years apart and finally let's look at life expectancy and we construct we estimate mortality rates from his data and then we construct life expectancy and we have uh two measurements this is at age 50 and the reason that we calculate life expectancy at age 50 is because this is the age group that case indeed in uh study and then we also construct life expectancy at age 66 because this is more relevant for our model because in the model we don't allow people to die before age 66 due to a computation reason and uh so we see that life expectancy at age 50 is um for men it's 77.6 for at eight for 1940 cohort and for women it's higher it's 79.8 age and we also see that uh across cohorts life expectancy at each age 50 has been dropped by 1.5 years for men and for women the job is slightly slower so they see good okay [Music] and for women the job is lower is about 1.5 1.1 yes and the job of life expectancy at age 66 is very similar it's only slightly larger than the draw of life experience at age 50. and so what we do next is we're gonna we calibrate our model to fit uh the outcome of the 1960 cohort and then we do a four counter factors and we're going to change either wage function or medical sorry medical expenses and life expectancy and finally we change all the three together and then we see how what is the change of labor supply and saving and also welfare so let me first look at the effect of changing wage schedule on participation and the left panel is for married male people and the solid lines are the outcome for the 1960 cohort and dash lines are the outcome of the people that with 1940 which schedule and so what would what we see is that for married women the participation has been increased substantially and from my men there's a drop of participation so this is because now my remains are facing lower wage opportunities so as a result they work less and the married women actually compensate by working more and the we also see the change for singles and uh single women actually also are working more so they're participating more and this is because um partly because they were expecting to marry husband with low wage and uh then let's look at uh the uh hours conditional on work and um we see the noticeable change is for um for my women when mild women actually are working more and they increase hours by 100 hours a year under this 1960 which schedule and now let's look at saving so due to the electric wealth effect coming from their reduction wage rate and saving for retirement has been dropped and this is substantial for a single single person a single man and the job of this assets at age 66 has been dropped by 21 percent and for single women the change is much smaller and for couples the change is also small is about 6.1 percent so there's already a highlight it's important to model a couple has both men and women therefore when women can work more they can compensate so there's less reduction in in saving and finally let's look at the changing welfare so we want to see how large people are worse off and or better off under the uh the new wage schedule so we're going to measure the welfare as the one-time asset compensation that we need to give people at age 25 so that they are indifferent between the 1960 versus 1940 which schedule so we find out that everybody losses due to the change in the wage schedule and in particular the one-time asset compensation then we need to give the single men is about 7.3 percent of the present discard your lifetime any so that's a pretty big loss and for couples the loss is 4.5 percent of the present lifetime earnings and for single women it's 3.4 percent and uh now let's move on to the change of medical expenses which has been increased over across cohorts we find out that saving and goes up because now they have to save more to compensate for the uh expected medic higher medical expenses and there's a smaller change in participation and hours and also people are going to lose warfare under the higher medical expenses and one-time asset compensation for single money is 1.4 for single women one percent for couple point nine percent and uh then we we're going to look at the changing life expectancies so over cohorts life exact pricing has been shortened so as a result of that saving went down because now they have a shorter retirement period and there's almost no change in participation and hours and also uh since people value life so they also suffer welfare due to the shortened life expectancy the one-time asset compensation for single main is 3.2 percent for single women 2.4 percent and for couples 2.2 percent and finally we're going to put all the three changes together and we see that there's changing participation and hours mainly for married couple and this is largely driving by the changing wage schedule and saving goes up slightly because those different forces are moving saving in different directions so however the increased medical expenses dominate the change of other effects so we still see increase of of saving and all the changes leads to welfare loss so that adds up to pretty substantial wealth for losses for single main is 5.5 percent for couples 8.1 percent and for single women 7.3 so those are substantial change in welfare and to conclude so we have documented that people who are born in the 1940 96 cohorts among the group of non-college non-co-educated white americans they have experienced substantial uh worst thing out the lifetime outcomes than those who were born in the 1940s so they will experience much lower wage over the lifetime and they expect to have much higher medical expenses and shorter life expectancy at retirement stage so um all those changes leads to substantial welfare loss and our paper indicates that it's important to be thinking more about the changes of of lifetime opportunities experienced by different cohorts and also by education level and for example those are some interesting policy questions and we have modeled certain government policies and to what extent did those government policy attenuated those changes and should the government have done something differently should they introduce new uh policies or should should they change some of the policies and if they do what are the policies and at what stage should this policy be um be introduced
