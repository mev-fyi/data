first I'm not speaking for Google um tie aside um uh I want to say something about Market design for a market design conference so we are three completely uncoordinated talks we're we spent a few minutes trying to put a created intersection and you can be the judge uh let me start by saying a couple of things that I find really exciting about the about Market design today versus let's say 1994. uh and the first thing I would single out is David parks and his colleagues who are uh who have gotten and you could argue about how how uh real this is but that they've essentially gotten machine learning to discover Myerson and that just seems huge to me because it's the proof of concept we know that in certain circumstances myerson's optimal options are the optimal auctions if the AI can Discover it the uh then we can actually apply it to the situations where we don't know the answer and that just seems like that's going to be huge um it's not a uh accident that uh Parks then goes and spends a sabbatical at Deep Mind yeah so I think we're going to see cool things out of that uh that's just um and let me say I'm also keen on adversarial networks generally because uh they're evolutionary in nature and something that I was convinced of oh it's getting on 20 years at this point is that the right way to think about human behavior in almost all circumstances is evolution it's not optimization and what's nice about evolution is it tends towards optimization but does it get there that immediately and the reason that's important is when you actually got to look at the data they don't get there immediately nobody plays the Nash act will everyone because you know they're going to be some people out there there are plenty of models back to the 90s of this but you know they're going to be people out there that aren't playing the national library and you're going to react to them even if you're a very sophisticated player you're going to react to them and this gives rise to a concept I call the half-life of optimization which is at what point are we 50 of the way to to the optimum so so thanks to Michael the answer to that is six weeks and I know that because Michael ran these wonderful experiments where we knew what they were supposed to do because we tweaked the system and we can follow how long it took these are advertisers how long it took the advertisers to adjust to the thing that we knew they were supposed to do in equilibrium because knowing what they were playing before we can calculate the equilibrium this is uh thanks to Michael that that so but the thing is if it takes six weeks to adjust well that's really let me say it's relevant to a pricing optimization for example and also explains lots of other things another thing about this technology is that you can build a firm that not only has no employees it doesn't involve any people whatsoever it just operates it's got uh it buys from from preferably Google Cloud but it could be AWS um it buys uh computational uh you know gpus to operate its Ai and it goes and say trades on the stock exchange or it uh writes books I don't know if you know this but Publishers are shutting down the ability to submit books because they get well there's a Sci-Fi uh magazine that normally would get about 20 submissions a month and then in December they got 500 in January they got 5 000 because AI could generate books anyway maybe you could now watch a company that's what it does is publish books and and um and operates and and doesn't actually need any people and by the way those companies could then turn around and say I'm going to hire somebody okay um um so um another thing that so so I used to kind of laugh about uh psychology and and behavioral economics and I now find that eats up 50 50 of my uh efforts so uh that's something else that's changed from 1994 is that that and part of that is because the behavioral economics itself got much better is a part of the reason for that uh but if you don't you know it fits with the evolutionary point if you don't actually think about the way people uh uh behave you don't actually get the right answer and and that's important let me talk a little bit about Market Design Within inside companies because that's mostly what I've been doing and um it's not uncommon for me to be in the room and from my perspective so that is to say as an economist and it's in some time computer scientist even my perspective is actually the least important perspective in the room because there's engineering and they're the people who decide whether we can or can't do whatever it is we're posing there's marketing who will make it sell or not but if they but uh um there's Finance if they don't if they don't agree to underwrite it it doesn't get done and then finally there's legal who can come along and just say that he can't do that um and so but here's the thing about and I don't know if you really want to call this Market design but I speak the engineering language because they love optimization and we've been doing optimization I mean you know they're happy to talk optimization all day long marketing we invented their language right Net Present Value uh uh the rates of return all of this stuff the marketing you know that's economics language the finance people pretend they're a separate field but it's really just a subfield um and then finally I know a little bit about legal because I've testified and said man I trust trials and so I can usually I that's the area I know the least about but I can usually get along so what it turns out is is that the market design that I do with half of it is just translating I'm the only person in the room that can speak to everybody in the room and that's a really useful thing for getting a good outcome and there's nothing I want to call it quite Market design because it operates whether we're talking about markets or not so so it's design of some sort but it fits with this whole Market design toolkit of understand what the customers want and then figure out what how to optimize for that and it's just a different set of customers because it's the different special interests in the uh in the company and uh let me say Dilbert is real but there's an anti-dilbert in fact for every Dilbert cartoon there's the opposite Dilbert cartoon where the manager is listening to the engineer say something that's completely idiotic from a management perspective okay um so so this is about regulation uh um a point that I wish was made more is that Anti-Trust is a really blunt instrument it's a bludgeon at least with regulation you've got some hope of of using a scalpel let me give you an example as kind of a pet peeve which is software doesn't uninstall properly what incentive does a software writer have to make their software uninstall properly because you're leaving them they you're no use to them this is the least valuable thing for them to invest in this is a place where you could regulate this is that you know you leave a bunch of crap on my computer that's still running that's a that's that could be uh you know that you could use a regulation to get rid of that all right but having said that let me say the right The Innovation cost of Regulation is pretty high the thing about regulation is is that big companies can amortize the cost of doing the business over uh uh with the cost of implementing the regulations over a large volume of Commerce and the little guys can't and so they in you know in the United States they just violate the law in Europe they uh they don't exist um they follow the law don't exist but but um and and so and the reason that's that a lot of Regulation is harmful to to and some of you will will think this is obvious but but uh the the regulation is harmful to innovation is because big companies are pretty happy with the status quo they're big it's a little companies that are hungry and so if the regulation differentially impacts little companies that's going to make it hard uh for Liberal companies to to innovate and so I kind of you know I want to argue that that market design for regulation a lot of it is just using a light touch and I know Michael's been in the press in fact he's having his 15 minutes of fame uh right now about this exact issue so hopefully he'll bring it up um where that leads me next is why the EU has lagged in Innovation compared to the United States and um you know we have this virtuous cycle it involves universities Venture capitalists and startups and it's produced a ton of innovation and lots of companies that grow to be big companies and employ hundreds of thousands of people and a major chunk of this virtuous cycle are actually the big tech companies because they they buy a lot of these startups and that produces a profitable exit which is what gets the Venture capitalists to be willing to put money in because if you just said yeah I'm putting money in this because I think it's a unicorn and it's going to make a trillion dollars there's eventually going to be worth a trillion dollars there's so few of those that you wouldn't be able to light the fire whereas if oh by the way half of them will get bought by Apple or Amazon or some other big companies um yeah then uh that fuels that uh that uh Innovation cycle um so that in a way like it could do a lot of damage to actually stop the purchasing of these startups because they could do a lot of damage to the Innovation uh cycle uh let me say this has made all the worse because China is not you know they're really gunning for this in uh space Green Technology Electronics Rail and AI they're investing like uh crazy uh the Chinese uh now produce 50 more AI papers in the United States and um even if you condition on them having at least one citation that's also still true uh and that's ignoring self sites um okay um Susan brought up content moderation uh I would say that's the one thing I promised to talk about and then I thought do I really have anything to say about this um and regulating inputs and outputs there's a nice way of kind of framing it because um so section 230 says a platform is not responsible for Content it doesn't create why we know that's a bad thing way more people are dying of measles that's why we know it's a bad thing that's a horrible thing is that people are putting bad content out there and they are convincing people not to get vaccinated against measles and then people are dying all right so that I think is a proof that something has to be done um uh the um think about this is though is if you say okay you can't have misinformation that lead you know we put a strict torch standard they uh on the output you can't have misinformation that causes people to die that will kill those platforms or just without any doubt is the very little money is made on the content of this on if you put that kind of restriction on that where you start paying for that you're out of business and that's also a bad thing and so so uh it could actually make our information problems worse uh let me say we're about to get a deluge of making this whole situation worse because we can use AI to make our misinformation more effective and that's coming uh and and thanks to Facebook it's been exelerated dramatically because Facebook very cleverly figured out how to put a large language model onto a single GPU and then lost it and let the bad guys get a hold of this so you can now run this on you know a beefy uh uh PC um how many at a time ah perfect oh I can actually say everything then um so um so gdpr so I was involved in the discussions around gdpr the gdpr is the uh data protection uh regulation of Europe and that's why if you go to a European website a bunch of pop-ups come up and say you have to you know agree as far as I can remember nobody was saying the actual predicted the actual problem that gdpr was going to create which is that you're going to get so many of these pop-ups that either you just say okay I'm not going to ever go to a European site again or you say and some of the American sites of course do it especially if you they think you're in Europe because you're using a VPN all of a sudden yeah you got to agree to all this European stuff no would actually forecasts that even though in retrospect it's obvious now what I forecast I use my market design how to put my market design hat on is ah we charge for our services Facebook Gmail YouTube but if you give us uh opt-in to the free data we'll give you the service for free but what I predicted as far as I could tell no one did that that is I got that a hundred percent wrong now it's still something that's in our back pocket uh but uh so it's an interesting experiment IT addresses a real problem that Susan brought up which is that people don't understand what the Privacy implications are and then there are companies like Target that are not good stewards of our data and uh I don't want to single at Target because over 60 companies spilled my credit card information uh and so so Target was just the first one to hit the news in a big way um and a whole bunch of companies are not taking proper responsibility so something needs to be done about this but but I don't know okay uh I tell you literally don't know what to do um okay Apple's green bubbles all right let me remind you the two-part test from for uh violation of the antitrust laws do you have Market power in a relevant Market and did you use that market power to maintain or extend that Monopoly power okay so what's wrong with so first I'm not going to talk about whether Apple has Market power uh I'll let you be the judge of that but what's wrong with the green bubbles you know what I mean by the green bubbles is so so the way iMessage works is that if all the people on the call are on iMessage you see it in blue if anyone joins from a non-imessage app doesn't have to be Android it could be windows but but uh not that many os is around I suppose it could be Linux um Hal might join with Linux um uh the last Linux user so if anybody joins the whole thing turns green and the problem with green is it's a very light green in which the white text is pretty much illegible this is a brilliant dirty trick it's just a brilliant dirty trade but it definitely has the effect of locking in uh and getting the kids to say ooh don't let the Android in for example um they actually do another trick there's not much in the news which is at the same time that they did that they degrade the quality of uh video and and images so that and they do that not just to the Android you could justify that you know my so so what my wife and both of my kids are on iPhones uh you could justify this by when I joined yeah they're gonna send me a bad image and they're going to blame SMS that would be perfectly fair but why my wife doesn't get to see the good quality image that my daughter sent out when they're both on iPhones and that only happens if Android is involved that's a very dirty trick let me also remind you of a dirty trick that's finally gone away which is for about 10 years if you were an iMessage user and then you switched to an Android phone SMS didn't work because iMessage intercepted and did not forward your message that's a very dirty trick okay so I think the the uh the use of the power to maintain or extend is demonstrated whether or not you're going to say they have Market power these are the guys that convinced a British court that iTunes was not part of the music business because Apple records have a contract that said you can use the name Apple provided you never enter the music business when they launched iTunes they said oh it's digital it's not music it's iTunes and they managed to convince a court that this is not violated the contract okay last point we talked about Evolution a little bit um the there's this you know is AI is there a threat of world domination I'm personally a fan of the movie The Terminator you know the AI woke up realized Humanity was the biggest threat to its extinct to its existence and and that was you know wrote our death sentence right at that moment so here's the thing we have a billion years of evolution telling us that we should get more stuff AI was has you know not a billion years although it's probably a billion years worth of computation telling it it should get more hours of Engagement it doesn't actually have so this idea is it's fully anthropomorphizing to say AI is going to want to grab power from us no that's us we're that way the AI you shouldn't think of as being that way now it's got lots of problems and the problems of AI in the hands of bad guys are really formidable because all you know you think that there's there's bad spam and misinformation now wait till you're getting videos of Obama saying that he actually supports Hitler because that's easy to do or it will be easy to do I don't know that'll be actually convincing but but um that's probably not the right one uh so so anyway more of that is coming and that's the thing that I find really scary about AI is not that it's going to take our jobs but that it's uh that it's going to uh make the misinformation problem much worse thank you
