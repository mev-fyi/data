thank you very much and i want to thank uh duncan thomas who i i guess organizes even further advan in advance than me and sema do uh for inviting me over a year ago to give this lecture um so the title of this talk is the challenges of social protection in the developing world so by way of introduction this just this is a graph just plotting a share of kind of gdp on social protection programs kind of broadly defined social insurance redistribution programs transfer programs and as probably all of you against log gdp per capita and it's probably all of you know uh it's an upward sloping graph right so you know developed countries are doing much more of this in developing countries but you know the point i i want kind of our launching point for today is you know this is not zero okay and there's actually a fair amount going on in the developing world uh in these in these in these kinds of countries and in kinds of programs and in fact if you look at it this is from a great publication called the world bank state of social safety nets there's a really large and expanding number of programs of a wide variety of types in the developing world so for example you know unconditional cash transfer programs they have they know 40 countries in sub-saharan africa alone have some different type of uct program for conditional cash transfer programs programs like progressa you know it's over 60 pro countries developing countries around the world have some type of cct program okay so there's a lot of these programs going on and the other thing to note is that they seem to be increasing over time right so you know almost a doubling in cct is uh also doubling in ucts in sub-saharan africa even over the past you know in in this relatively short period of time so you know why why are these things increasing well you know as these low-income countries are starting to develop as they become middle income tax capacity tends to increase but there's still a lot of inequality remains so these countries start to become richer but there's still a tremendous number of extremely poor people and that that means there's substantial scope for redistribution and these countries are becoming increasingly able to do it in fact actually uh pandey and paige have a really nice figure in the beginning of their recent jep paper uh which i've turned into a graph which just sort of shows you that in fact most of the extreme poor are now living in middle-income countries not in low-income countries so in 1987 right you know there was a lot more extreme poverty this is kind of a two dollar one dollar ninety cents pvp uh per capita poverty line you know there was a huge amount there's been a huge reduction in um in extreme poverty over the last 30 years but what's happened is that you know a bunch of countries like india china indonesia nigeria pakistan all these countries have become middle-income countries not sort of low-income countries and as a result most of the extreme poor now are actually living in middle-income countries today not in low-income countries right and these countries are the ones that are increasingly having the capacity to sort of run these kinds of programs and combat inequality within the countries so part of it part of the reason these things are going up is just economic growth the other thing which i think is kind of interesting is that this this is a graph that that uh that i made which is sort of kind of a prestan curve type graph so this shows you the um relationship between gdp per capita uh on the x-axis and the share of gdp per capita spent on on these social insurance programs in 1995 which is the earliest year the data is available in 2015 which is the most recent year the data is available and the other thing which is kind of interesting is the curve is shifting up kind of everywhere right so it's part of part of the growth that we're seeing in these programs is countries are countries are getting richer so they're moving along the curve but part of it is the curve is starting to shift up so even at a given level of income country countries seem to be doing more of these kinds of programs okay so um you know that's all by way of background uh sorry the final thing i want to say by way of introduction is these programs i've sort of lumped them all together as far as like social insert and social protection there's a wide variety of programs with a wide variety of goals okay so what are the kinds of goals these pro some of these programs are trying to smooth temporary shocks they could be idiosyncratic shocks they could be aggregate shocks at the kind of the village level aggregate shocks in the whole economy they could be redistribution programs trying to redis you know correct for sort of differences in the permanent component component of income they could be about breaking poverty traps and i'll talk a little bit more about this a little bit later they could be within generation kind of static you know poverty traps for a single generation they could be intergenerational poverty traps they could be about pensions moving smoothing over the life cycle you know and given this kind of wide variety of goals it's actually not surprising there's a wide variety of programs and so this is just showing you that the sort of again from this world bank native social safety nets the kind of smorgasbord of programs in the developing world so there's you know 124 developing countries according to this report that have some kind of school feeding program um their unconditional cash transfers are very common in income transfers public works programs fee waivers social pensions conditional cash transfers there's sort of a wide variety of programs kind of throughout the developing world so you know just because it's small as a share of gdp compared to what's going on in say the us or the eu doesn't mean there's not a lot of these kinds of of activities happening in the developing world so you know hopefully what that suggests to you is that you know we should there's a lot of these programs and we should be expecting to see more of them kind of as as time goes on what i want to focus on today though is you know what is the sort of what is distinctive about the fact that we're trying to run these kinds of social of redistribution programs or social insurance programs in the developing world so what is it about um developing countries that sort of makes running these programs different um than what you would do if you were doing running these programs like in the us or in the eu okay and i'm gonna focus on three um three kind of main challenges for running these programs in the developing world that i'll talk about today so the first one is uh what i'll call the targeting challenge right so that's the challenge of how do you figure out who the beneficiaries of these programs are and i'll talk in a lot of detail about why that channel and that's a challenge everywhere but i'll talk about why that challenge is different in sort of a low information environment like we have in most developing countries and how do we potentially think about handling that challenge the second i'll talk about program design challenges and this is sort of you know sort of a kind of lumping together the fact that you know different forms of programs or different kinds of transfers uh different types of program design may be appropriate when we have the kind of extreme poverty levels that we're seeing in a lot of developing countries when we have a large informal sector we have high participation in substance agriculture all these things may mean that we might want slightly different kinds of programs and so that's the second thing i'll talk about and the third thing is a governance challenge and that's the fact that um how do we ensure that these programs are delivered with kind of low leakage uh in environments where sort of the you know the the government the governance uh maybe not um may have a lot of challenges and there can be a lot of leakage and corruption okay so this is this kind of so these three challenges are gonna be sort of the overview of uh of the talk um before i i begin uh in in earnest i wanna this is sort of a word of thanks that i owe so i'll draw on you know both uh work that i've done as uh as well as work with many other people in this room uh but i just wanted to thank so you know there's many people to thank guys want to thank all the institutions we've worked with both in indonesia and now in pakistan my many many co-authors on all these projects i particularly want to thank abhishek banerjee with whom i've done many of these studies and rima hannah which who i think i've has been my co-author on virtually everything that i'm going to talk about today and also the many generous funders whose fund funded this work so thank you to everyone um okay so so to to begin so what is the targeting challenge so for many types of programs okay uh redistribution programs programs targeting poverty traps whatever we like to target the poor okay so you know there's lots of reasons to do that but we'd like to do that the basic problem for for targeting any program to the poor is we'd like to know who is poor okay that's that's the problem we don't necessarily know and if you were to sort of uh you know take you know think of you know your basic intro public finance class of course this would be a problem everywhere right this is not like a uniquely development challenge but the way this problem um is typically set up in like the u.s literature is that we you know we observe typically like in the u.s we'd say the government observes your income we'd like to uh observe is your true earning ability and so the thing we're really worried about is that if we set sort of we target based on income we're going to sort of distort your sort of labor supply decision okay and there's a vast literature right you know obviously merlies i picked you know merely 71. in 2001 et cetera thinking about how do we set kind of the optimal income tax structure taking this problem into account okay um if we know more characteristics um that predict poverty like widowhood for example we can tag these individuals and assign them different task schedules across a very nice paper sort of starting off that literature but but the basic issue i think i would frame in the developed countries is you know we'd like to know earning ability uh we don't observe that we observe income and so we can target based on income but then we worry about sort of what is that going to do so move to the developing world and the problem is right we don't really observe income okay for anybody sort of within sort of the realm of uh potentially poor okay so you know pervasive self-informal employment you know we talked a little bit about that earlier this morning means that most people's income just isn't going to be third party reported at all right and hence it's excluded from the tax net so anders jensen has a very nice paper which shows that this is the employee share across countries okay against log gdp per capita and you can see that you know in the developing world most people are not kind of employees in in firms whereas in the developed world they are and the the income tax structure sort of really mirrors this right so this is the sort of share of employment um that is covered with the income tax space that is sort of non-exempt from income taxes and what you can see is that basically in the developing world you know sort of the the income tax thresholds are such they're only sort of taxing maybe the top twenty percent or the top ten percent of the population everybody else just excluded entirely from income taxes and the reason sort of jensen i think argue's pretty convincing the reason that they're doing this is because there's no hope of sort of getting information about these people because there's no there's no third party reporting okay so taking this is given what this means is that for the bottom you know 80 from here on out the bottom 80 of the population the government is just not getting any information about your income so if you wanted to differentiate between the bottom ten percent and everybody else the bottom twenty percent everybody else about thirty percent everybody else the income tax system is just not going to help you okay so you need to do something different um so one implication of this by the way is that this is going to mean that universal transfer programs like universal basic incomes are going to be are going to the calculus that you're going to make in terms of thinking about these programs is going to be really different in a developing country setting than it would be in the u.s okay and the reason for this uh is because you don't you because of the of this implication of the large tax-exempt region okay so for example imag this is just this is from a graph of a paper that reminder i wrote last year in the jp so this is just sort of you know these are made-up lines but this is illustrating this is your pre-tax income that's your post-tax income so this is sort of showing you kind of a standard you know progressive income tax schedule right so your post-tax income is you know a declining you know concave function of your pre-tax income and this sort of says if you were in a developed country we could add a universal basic income we could raise the intercept here and then we could just adjust the marginal income tax schedule to sort of pay for this thing what that means though is that you can see that the the net change in the transfer we can change that kind of arbitrary not arbitrary we can sort of start taxing that back pretty quick pretty pretty quickly right because we're observing people pretty far down in the income distribution so we're not going to give the same net transfer to everybody if you add in the fact that say the bottom 80 percent of tax exempt what this graph looks like in a developing country is that you have to give the same net transfer you know these people aren't paying any tax that's the 45 degree line right and so this if you added a ubi the same net transfer kind of goes way much much higher up in the distribution so if you think about kind of the cost effectiveness of ubi's in a developing country versus a developed country you have to take into account the fact that you can't just give the same net net transfer to the bottom 10 or 20 percent and tax it back you're giving the same net transfer really high up the income distribution so given this i'll come back to this and i'll come back to sort of what what the implications of this are in a minute but but given this you might say well gee we'd like to find some other way of differentiating between all these people okay is there some other way that we can we can try to differentiate differentiate people in that tax-exempt region and it turns out there are a lot of strategies that that you can do to differentiate people in the tax-exempt region so here are sort of i think this may not be an exhaustive catalog but here's many of them so suppose you wanted to differentiate among kind of the the poor in that region here are some things you could do so i'm going to define them and sort of group them into two different groups explicit targeting and choice-based targeting so explicit targeting says the government's going to try to find some way of sorting you anyway and the choice one is the government's going to set up some kind of ordeal or some kind of mechanism to help you sort of self-select so explicit targeting there's sort of three big options one is what's called a proxy means test this is probably the most common option and i'll talk a lot about this about a lot of detail but the basic idea is you know the government would really like to observe why we can't observe why what we can do is we can run a big census go door to door collect a bunch of information about your assets predict why based on your assets and target based on y hat okay so proxy means tests are targeting based on y-hat community-based targeting is using some kind of local input which is say the government you know one thing we think is very common you know common theme throughout development economics is there's lots of local information that's used in a wide variety of settings maybe we can try to use this information somehow to targeting for targeting we can sort of decentralize to the very local level and say you know okay you guys know who's really poor you guys kind of sort it out and the third one is geographic targeting which is to say it's kind of difficult for the government to collect data on every single individual because their people have incentives to lie but the government could collect some average data on sort of what the average incomes are in a region and target based on that second set of options are choice-based targeting so this is like ordeal mechanisms right so that's adding a cost that kind of screens out the rich and the second one is kind of a price-based subsidy right so you could charge some p you you for you could sort of discount the price for certain goods that tend to be preferred by the poor okay all of these there's no kind of like you know strictly dominant a priori uh solution here right so all these approaches have potential drawbacks and there's so there's not going to be an anti uh obvious right answer so what are the drawbacks so for proxy means test the problem is basically that the prediction is imperfect right so you're gonna have lots of inclusion in exclusion error i'll show you in a few slides what that looks like for community-based targeting you're there's a you that maybe they know in from they have local information but if you try to say okay you tell us who that who who uh who should who should get it and we'll give those people a bunch of a bunch of good stuff you could be worried about sort of you know elite capture at the local level you know geographic targeting that that could work if it because it that that could work but it could miss within region inequality it could also distort migration decisions right so there's some interesting work that you know um i think clemont and others have done about how you know how the enrique program for example in india destroys people's migration decisions right so that could be a potential issue um ordeal mechanisms well the problem with that is it can impose a bunch of costs on the poor right so that that's kind of a negative right you they have to pay all these costs plus it may actually not necessarily screen out the poor if sort of the poor have a very high marginal utility of income they actually might not necessarily pay those costs actually designing an order deal that works can actually be tricky and the price-based subsidies well it's actually hard to find these good these inferior goods sometimes uh and in practice actually the political economy political economy means that the goods people end up subsidizing end up looking a lot more like normal goods rather than inferior goods which kind of undoes the whole point of this as a redistributive effort so that's all to say there's no kind of a magic bullet here and instead it suggests that what we need to sort of provide policy makers with is sort of a set of kind of understanding help people to sort of understand what the trade-offs are right and sort of think through kind of what the what the options are so um i want to give you some a little bit of an overview of sort of what some of these trade-offs kind of look like in the data so to start um i mentioned sort of that proxy means tests are imperfect so in the same paper that rima and i did last year we took the sort of simulated in some da in some data the proxy means test formula for indonesia and for peru and you know what you can see this is sort of predicted predicted y this is y hat and this is y okay in the data and you know what you do if you is you basically you predict why half base and assets everybody below with y hat below this level gets kind of the the benefits and everybody above it doesn't right so you can see there's a you know pretty good r square here it's i think between point four and point six in this data that's why this thing is a very strong upward sloping line but the problem right is that so these are the people who are correctly targeted these are the people who are incorrectly targeted or sorry these are the correctly included these are the correctly excluded but the problem is kind of these quadrants over here where you can see there's lots of people who are being misclassified right so so that said is well this is not uh this is not perfect um and and not only is this sort of you know not ideal from a social welfare perspective this can actually create real political problems right if you're someone who's over here right and you don't necessarily even necessarily know why you're sorry if you're over here and you don't necessarily know why you're over here this person's over here you know you might sort of these things can actually be technocratically good but potentially creating create some political problems as well so um so what we did with with co-authors is is um we've did a series of experiments trying to understand you know what the trade-offs are between this kind of baseline method of using assets to target the poor and other methods so um you know let's start by talking about community-based targeting so there's a really nice paper by by alderman and sort of which suggests that the local communities actually do have some information about who's poor so this development economics idea that people have information seems to be true about poverty people do seem to know something on the other hand sort of barton and mukherjee and others have argued that this may not actually be very helpful right because if you try to actually extract this information in a setting where you're going to be giving um giving assistance to the poor kind of the local elites may kind of swoop down and sort of you know uh and take over the process and not necessarily sort of give it to the poor but might give it to sort of people who they're connected to or whatever so so what we did to sort of investigate this is we ran a randomized trial in indonesia which basically took the following steps so one thing that's kind of unusual is we debate the survey here happens first in this so we do a survey first we try to measure the truth in kind of a low stakes environment so it's a survey done by researchers where people have no incentive to lie we measure people's true consumption and some other stuff that i'll talk about in a second and then we randomized villages to target a transfer in this case it was a one-time transfer that then replicated it with sort of larger transfers later using either kind of a proxy means test a community-based approach or sort of a hybrid of the two and um the just you know the proxies already talked about what is the community-based approach to look like well in our context the way we did it is we basically uh enumerated everyone who sort of lived in the hamlet had a list of everybody and then sort of you know had people sort of brainstorm you know what local what poverty sort of meant in there in their context and then take turns sort of ranking people so that we put the cards in random order started by saying okay well ben versus michael who do you think is better off they say okay you know michael's better off they put michael to the right and they pull up the next card and they say now we're gonna do andy and so on and so forth until we get sort of a complete enumeration of the entire sort of neighborhood okay and that's kind of the local targeting order then we can draw a cut off and sort of give them give the benefits to everyone below some cutoff so what does this do well we can compare um the people who were chosen as beneficiaries through either the regular proxy means test approach which we also then did in another set of villages the community-based approach or the hybrid let's forget about the hybrid for a second so what do you see so on the one hand so this is just showing you the log per capita consumption of the beneficiaries the key point is the proxy means test approach is picking poorer people okay so it is the case that the proxy the database approach does a better job picking people who in our baseline survey we measure it as having lower per capita income so the database approach is doing better than sort of the the the community-based approach um it's worth noting that the differences by the way are are almost entirely very close to the line okay so actually for the for the extremely poor actually the community-based approach does a little bit better uh but for people who are kind of close to the line for whom you know reasonable people in the village might might disagree those are the ones where the data actually does a better job sort of sorting people uh on the other hand if you look at other sort of measures of kind of welfare you find it sort of a slightly different story so the other thing we computed is in our baseline survey in addition to sort of your per capita consumption we ask you to sort of rank each other in the privacy of your own home who do you think is better off and then the thing i think is the most interesting is we got your self-assessment of sort of how how poor you are okay scale ladder ladder scale one to six you know who do you think how i you know where the richest or six and the poorest or one you know where do you think are oh i'm a sex i'm whatever and we can compute rank correlations between whatever the the targeting ranking was in the village and uh by our different targeting method and and these different kind of welfare metrics and what you can see is consistent with a previous graph i just showed you the community method is doing worse at matching consumption so the rank correlation between the what the per capita consumption and kind of what comes out of the targeting is worse for the worse in the community method but it's much higher if we look at the correlation with people's self-assessment okay so what this is saying is it's not the communities are necessarily doing some totally random thing it's that the communities have a slightly different notion of kind of what poverty means at the local level people seem to you know i think i'm poor everyone else agrees that i'm poor and when we run the community targeting the people who everyone in the village seems to think are poor are the ones who actually get the benefit and so i think of the the results here is sort of saying there's this is actually i think uh you know back to what i said before there's no right or wrong answer here it kind of it kind of depends on your there's a trade-off here and i think it it depends on kind of what your objective is the other thing i wanna i wanna note is we actually did a bunch of measures to sort of see what peop which of these methods people liked better and um essentially no matter how you slice it people thought the community method was better so whether you asked like about the method is this method of targeting appropriate right that you get much higher scores for the community treatment we also then show people the list in the privacy of their own home and said is how about this list anyone you think should be subtracted anything should be added you get many fewer changes to the list in the community method so it seems like you know a reasonable summary here is if your goal is to maximize head count poverty as measured by the consumption survey you know the data is going to do a little bit better not a huge amount better but a little bit better but if your goal is to sort of maximize what local people local welfare the local wealthy metric actually the communities seem to be able to do this and i should say in this project we did it with pretty low stakes we then replicated this you know what we showed this to the government indonesia they said this is well all well and good what would happen if it we did this for if if the stakes were much larger then the elites would come in we said that's really great why don't you let us do an experiment with really large stakes they said okay um that's sort of summarizing like two years of negotiations um and uh but but these results kind of broadly replicate even with large stakes as well okay so that's one set of trade-offs a second thing that we investigated was choice-based targeting and so um here the you know this is an idea that you know that goes back to nichols and zekkauser that sort of these ordeals can be used to target the poor you can set up an ordeal and have people screen so suppose you need to you know the idea here one idea suppose you need to wait in a really long line to your unemployment benefits you need to wait in line at 10 a.m right that's going to be really costly for someone who's employed to go to work but not very costly for an unemployed person that'd be a good screening device okay um so in in thinking about these ordeals i think they're sort of two broad categories so one category is large ordeals right so these are ordeals where the you know the thing that you have to do is is pretty costly relative to the benefits that are involved so i think of the you know nrega in india as a classic example of a large ordeal okay the government of india is willing to sort of give anybody who wants it 100 in rural areas 100 days of kind of minimum wage work but you have to go stand out in the hot sun and dig ditches and fill them in again or maybe build something productive um and and so that or that's an ordeal that can screen and and there is some evidence about the screening from from murguy revaliant and van der waal but the costs of the screening are pretty large relative to the benefits i think sort of a really interesting idea is that maybe small ordeals um can also have some benefits if they're sort of well constructed so um here are two examples so i'll tell you about one that we did by uh of on-demand applications for benefits also a really nice paper by by depaul at all um which looks at sort of vouchers instead of free delivery for chlorine which is sort of a similar idea sort of a small ordeal can actually potentially have really large uh screening benefits as well so what's the one that we did so the one that that we did was we we said well let's go back to the targeting case with sort of this on-demand application with a with a proxy means test you know you may be the key idea is what if we require households to pay a cost kind of in order to apply for the benefits and why is this going to why might this work well the idea is that households know their true income the government doesn't that's the error in that proxy means test formula but if people don't fully understand that fully understand what's going on the decision to apply may actually reveal some part of their of the income that the government doesn't observe okay so so here's a simple model you decompose people's income into the observable part that's the part that the government can observe through the proxy means test and the unobservable part that's the residual right the proxy means test thing the fact that the government sort of you know the the proximity test formula says that with probability mu of y zero that's not a that's not a step function because there could be error in the pmt if people don't understand exactly there could be error in the pmt sorry so the probability you pass the proxy means test and the the lambda of y is is the your your probability of getting the benefits condition on your total income okay the the key issue is this lambda thing or this unobservable thing is isn't only part of income so that's the both this formula has errors and the it only observed part of your income so some some rich people are getting in that's what we saw before but when you when you choose select you're gonna if we make you apply you don't necessarily know kind of what that is all you know is your overall income and so you apply if your probability of getting it as a function of your overall income times the benefits is greater than the costs okay that's going to help us because households with low observable income but high unobservable income aren't going to bother to apply okay that's going to be the key idea so we we test this as an experiment um actually this is another part of the high stakes kind of randomized trial this is for a conditional cash transfer valued at 150 a year for six years this is like real money um and people had to come and apply for this benefit by standing in line for a couple hours so the cost is a couple of hours of standing in line and the potential benefit is 900 us dollars you know uh spread over six years and what you can see is that the the indeed if you this is kind of your observable incomes people with low unobservable incomes are more likely to show up people with high oh sorry observable income people with high observable income are unlikely to show up so that's good that sort of says that this is saving the government the cost of having to go screen all these people because they don't even bother these ones are going to get cut out anyway but the real benefits i think come from this where if we look at the unobservable component of your income the people with low with high unobservable components of their income they're much less likely to sort of show up and apply to people with low unobservable components of their income so that basically says look people are that's sort of what's with our model people are showing up based on their total income and that's helping the government because all these people who would have kind of slipped through the cracks and gotten onto the program but didn't need to they are on net getting screened out that can be really helpful particularly when you're trying to target the very very poor because most of the people in your in your world in some sense are uh non-poor right and those non-poor this is in our in our in our control group which is the proximity test had some small probability of slipping through the cracks and getting onto the program in the treatment group where or in the on-demand application group those people are basically all self-selected out of the thing and and essentially none of them get on the program so this uh there's another benefit as well which is actually the government even though it tries to do a census in the proxy means test may miss some people and actually in the on-demand group those people can kind of make themselves known so this actually suggests that on net um these small unobservable costs can actually make it make a big difference by sort of helping improve kind of the government's targeting but you know stepping back for us something back again sort of you know going back to what i started with on targeting the i think the big question here is you know these these mechanisms have all these mechanisms have trade-offs nothing is perfect right so you know maybe community targeting can improve a bit on on proxy means test maybe the on-demand application can improve a bit but still nothing is perfect so i think there's a really active debate about should we actually go ahead and should we still kind of bother to target it all so we can try to put some numbers on this um so um by comparing kind of targeted programs to kind of a universal uh basic income taking into account the fact that if that universal is going to have to be uh to everybody and therefore the benefits per capita holding the budget fixed are going to be a lot smaller and so we can compare kind of the trade-offs between um you know giving benefits to everybody and uh and um giving a smaller benefit to sort of a to a larger to a larger benefit to a smaller number of people so what we did is we sort of put a simple welfare you know through a simple welfare function on this and just tried to think about what how does social welfare look uh how does social welfare look as you vary kind of the inclusivity of these programs and also we can look at sort of what is the sort of trade-offs between between equity right for for equity of sort of treating the same people the same and and this sort of summarizes i think we do this for both um for for indonesia and peru and i think basically in some sense i think this sums up the policy debate right so it's pretty clear that if you just wanted to maximize social welfare at holding your budget fixed as measured by kind of a standard utility function a program that's going to be really so this is a ubi has 100 you know you're including everybody so that's you know all the way to the right these are more narrowly targeted programs kind of to the left holding the pmt technology fixed that's what these graphs are so you can see that social welfare looks kind of peaks at sort of pretty narrowly targeted programs this turns out to be like a program targeted around the bottom 20 of the population that's the one that sort of yields the highest welfare by a standard sort of social welfare metric on the other hand what we also compute is sort of horizontal equity which is people who have the same per cap what's the probability of people who have similar per capita income kind of within five percent of each other or get the same or treated the same either all get it or all don't get it and what you can see is that basically you know kind of mechanically right if you have you know i'm a county actually if you as you kind of become more universal right horizontal equity is gonna is gonna improve so in some sense i think this is kind of just again you know where you choose to be on this graph depends on your on how you sort of weight these two things right if you really want to sort of maximize social well welfare through a sort of standard utilitarian social welfare metric you're going to choose a really narrowly targeted program um but you're going to do so sort of noting that there's going to be sort of a pretty large cost in terms of horizontal equity but advice but the converse is also true so if you go for a universal program you're going to end up sort of uh you're going to solve the equity problem by definition but you're going to end up giving benefits that are sort of substantially smaller in welfare terms okay so and the final question what should you target is this does this targeting at all have distortionary implications right so um actually when i when i when i very first the very first time i i ever presented our targeting paper uh angus deton was in the audience and told me a story about about england and scotland and he said well you know the problem with targeting based on assets is well you know is is the following we said in the 18th century uh england and scotland had a tax on windows which is a great asset it's super easy they were very expensive at the time it's super easy to observe but the problem is it's led to very dark houses right so everyone basically boarded up their windows because they were sort of they were heavily attacked and actually a really nice paper and also in the jp sort of about this phenomenon by uh by ocean schwab so um how about how about this in a modern context well to look at this we actually recently just completed a large um trial with the indonesian government where we actually working with the government we we randomized several new questions onto their nationwide poverty targeting census so we added questions on whether you had a flat screen tv in some provinces added questions on whether you had how many cell phones you had in other provinces and then we actually looked at sort of tv sales and actual number of cell phone subscribers to see if those things actually adding these questions on the poverty census distorted subsequent asset decisions and the answer is basically not we found a small decline in reported televisions in the subsequent government data six months later so if you in the provinces where the where the where the government was asking about about uh tvs people did report about 12 percentage points um sorry 12 fewer televisions um in those provinces uh but that disappears a year later and there's no decline in tv sales that we can see from from sort of a survey of tv retailers and we can certainly rule out that this decline that we see in the data is driven by real declines that sort of suggests that that because these things are so complicated they're you know we're targeting on 40 different assets the formula is kind of opaque at least in this this evidence suggested it's not really creating a lot of distortions so summing up this whole sort of set of issues right on targeting i think a reasonable summary is you know nothing is perfect there are ways potentially of improving upon you don't just have to sort of you know treat everyone the same there are a lot of options um but sort of which one you would choose you know has some trade-offs particularly in terms of you know per capita consumption versus local welfare metric and you know uh and do you want to impose those costs and can you find a way to do it like we did with on-demand targeting where the costs and poser are relatively low okay so that's targeting the second set of challenges i want to talk about are challenges of program design so how does the fact that we're operating in a developing country context mean that we should be designing these programs in different ways then we would do that if we were doing it in say the you know the eu or the us so you know backing up you know what do we mean by program design i think the benchmark is kind of a like an ongoing stream of uh unconditional cash payments that's kind of the benchmark and there's some really nice work now that's starting to sort of actually explicitly benchmark uh other kinds of programs to this um but what are your alternatives well there's sort of you know many and there are many and buried okay so for example some popular ones include conditional cash transfers in-kind transfers like food housing etc lumpy cash transfers or asset transfers price subsidies social insurance programs pensions um and and and so on there are also a large number of design decisions okay so um for example how long should the transfers be guaranteed um who in the household should the recipient be um should these be bundled or separate um and many and many other sort of uh many other decisions as well now these policy options in some sense are available everywhere if you were designing a program in you know new york city you you have the same set of options available to you by and large as you do in the developing world not not maybe not perfectly because of some logistical constraints but they're available you know what are sort of the distinctive developing country issues that would help affect how we would think about these choices so one is poverty traps right so there's a lot of a lot of work and development that suggests that you know really extreme poverty could create poverty traps that could be either um that's just there could be a really big role for lumpy transfers rather than if you really believe the poverty trap story you think that that plus savings constraints might mean there could be a big role for lumpy transfers rather than sort of a steady stream of payments um there are you know low levels of basic human capital suggest that maybe intergenerational ability uh maybe lower in developing countries uh particularly disadvantaged groups there's a nice paper by asher novosad and rafkin um which suggests that you know certain that that mo at least the develop that i think india um some other countries i think remember correctly has lower intergenerational mobility than all the sort of developed countries they look at uh the u.s i guess has the is the worst of the developed countries but it's actually lower in some sense that even there if you believe this sort of lower intergenerational mobility particularly for disadvantaged groups that's a rationale for cc for conditional cash transfers right the idea there is to say you know maybe we can not only combat current poverty but we can break this intergenerational cycle of poverty um another issue is rural and poorly integrated markets right so that means that there can be price effects of in-kind versus cash transfers so kunai georgie and jaya chandran make that point nicely so we're looking at rural transfers in mexico that actually the price effects can sort of change of cash transfers can be can be non-trivial and change kind of welfare implications relative to in-kind transfers uh in these rural settings there'll be local spillover effects so muralidar and uh nihaus and sikhtankar have a paper looking at that maybe if these if these markets are sort of relatively isolated and not connected these transfer programs can have aggregate effects and that could be different or larger potentially if markets are more isolated um there could be substantial agricultural risk right we talked earlier this morning about how agricultural uh our substantial fraction of households are in agriculture much larger than than in developed countries that agricultural risk can be non-trivial for for many households and these programs can have an important role sort of smoothing that and you might that may be important for program design um we talked about the substantial informal economy that creates all kinds of challenges for how you would design unemployment insurance workers comp other labor market programs and there could be challenges in distribution i'll talk about this in the governance section so these are all sort of issues that that are different about the designer programs because they're in developing country settings given the sort of limited time i have i can't talk about all of them in depth i'm going to just talk about this first one in a bit more detail talk about poverty traps okay so as i think all of you probably know right uh the the basic idea uh you know if there's some kind of non-convexity plus some kind of savings constraint that can generate a poverty trap and that can mean that sort of a large lump sum transfer can sort of move you from kind of the bad state to kind of a good state okay that's the basic idea i think we're all familiar with that right so the question is that actually is there any evidence that's actually happening so i had a look around i think there's two uh classes of study that have tried to look at this and please forgive me by the way if i'm if i'm leaving anyone out so one set of studies looks at lumpy cash transfers okay and the the give directly experiment by house software and shapiro did many things it had many different sub treatments but one of the really interesting ones of these from this perspective is it randomized kind of giving people a lump sum transfer uh versus a stream of kind of monthly installments okay now what they found was actually they did find that sort of you know looking at nine months after the transfer the lumpy uh the people who are randomizing the lumpy payment did different things than the people in the sort of the the the stream uh predominantly they bought themselves metal roofs this was a there was targeted people who didn't have metal roofs so that was kind of a large lumpy investment kind of waiting to be waiting to be made and they made it um so there is some evidence that people are have are doing different things with kind of these lumpy investments three years later there was sort of no difference between these two groups okay um you know how do we take away from this well this was a large a very large kind of in magnitude lump sum transfer but you know we're also only so the monthly payments were only spread over nine months so you know if you think about kind of the the lump sum was large and but the difference between the lump sum and the transfer was relatively small in the sense that even those kind of you know it was only nine months compared to say like a lump sum of you know take an expected stream of transfers for a cct program might last for six years or nine years right take all that discount back and give you a lump sum that difference might be even larger so you know this doesn't sort of say i don't think this is sort of shame that the the lumps have made a huge difference here uh relative to the monthly transfers but maybe in sort of a place where it was more extreme that that might be there another context is is this uh paper by barrera oserio at all uh sorry at all which looks at cct transfer conditional cash transfers in columbia and they modified one this is an education based cct and they modified it so that a third of the payments were made in a lump sum at the time of next school enrollment okay and so this was both making it lump sum and helping solve a savings constraint and giving it to you at a time where you were where you were making kind of one of these important decisions this lumpy decision and there actually they found that that actually does seem that this does seem to increase secondary and long-run tertiary enrollment relative to the stream of payments so i think this is you know suggestive evidence that maybe sort of this distinction matters but i think that sort of whether this is actually sort of you know could make a big difference if it was done sort of really at the extremes i think we still we still don't necessarily know the other sort of set of um papers which has investigated this issue are the ones that look at lumpy asset transfers okay so uh many authors including a number of people uh here have been involved in involved in evaluating the targeting for the ultrapoor programs um these were pioneered by brac and have been replicated in more than 20 countries and although there are some variations roughly speaking these programs consist of a large lumpy productive asset you know think livestock although it can be other things bundled with regular cash payments for about a year some skills training some savings some health education and some regular visits for coaching so it's a big asset plus some stuff to kind of help you use it effectively kind of way to think about this what i think is really intriguing though about these these things is they do seem to have um some pretty long long run effects so these so th this set of studies um looked kind of roughly at four years after the transfer sort of you know a couple years after the program ended this study uh looked seven years after the program started so about five year after the five years after the program ended okay what you can see so this is actually i took this this from bandiera at all but they also helpfully give you the same treatment effects from those other six studies from energy at all so you can see them both the key point is looking kind of um you know this is the four year end line so that's i think this is the if i remember correctly these are both post the end of the program right so this is like you know i think it's six years six or seven years after the program this is i guess uh four years after the program started but both you know these are years since the program ended you're seeing really large increases in per capita consumption for these programs so you know what what to make of this i think that suggests that these programs where you give these big lumpy assets actually do seem to lead to sort of substantially higher levels of per capita consumption even many years later the kind of the key question for evaluating these things are these things are really expensive so is it actually sort of leading to kind of this growth beyond kind of the value of the of the transfer being given you know these authors are obviously all aware of this and do kind of various calculations it basically depends on on on both the discount rate and how much far how how far off into the future you think these things are going to continue these things continue kind of at this level forever these things look amazing if they fell off a cliff you know the day they stopped measuring they would look pretty terrible from or not great from a return from a sort of a you know from a return perspective so you know in some sense this is amazing that we've seen this evidence sort of you know so many years later but to sort of say have we really sort of you know catapult so it's amazing we've seen it this far this much later it says we sort of catapulted these households to kind of a new consumption level um but you know is this actually sort of you know getting them is this better than are they better off than if we just kind of given them this the the value of the program we don't we don't know that yet but it suggests that according to continuing to measure this could could be really valuable um the other thing which is i think would be would have been really nice is if we could just compare these to cash right so this is a setting where you're doing this really lumpy thing that's very very valuable it would be really nice to compare this to kind of a small stream of payments like spread out over seven years and sort of see which is actually doing better and i think that would be a a wonderful study for for someone to do but so you know where where do i sort of okay so so that that's on poverty traps you know the second kind of thing that i think the second kind of poverty trap that i think is interesting is this intergenerational poverty trap those are static poverty traps that same household the second kind of poverty trap people are trying to solve is these intergenerational poverty traps by sort of helping sort of you know make the next generation better off and this is i think been the big idea behind conditional cash transfer programs so ccts like for example progressa is obviously the the most famous of these these programs are trying to break intergenerational uh poverty traps by giving sort of assistance today and conditioning that assistance today on uh maternal and child health behaviors and school attendance sort of things that might affect kind of the human capital of the next generation and in fact santiago lavi levy who helped pioneer progress in mexico has a great quote which says look you know clearly achieving good health is a cumulative process and temporary investments are going to be a little help the same is true of education children must be supported year after year and and the effects of progressive will generally gradually occur through the accumulation of human capital okay so right the idea of these programs is you know they're explicitly sort of saying we're going to give the cash now but the whole idea of the conditionality is to affect the human capital so that maybe the next generation will be better off so is that working um you know these programs are spread really rapidly over the past 20 years as i mentioned they're now in more than 60 developing countries and there's lots of short-run evidence uh both from these kind of pioneering studies of progressive but then in sort of other studies um that have sort of replicated one sort of amazing fact about cct is the original one was randomized many of the sort of expansions have also been randomized there's sort of a tremendous amount of evidence on these programs and i think by and large they do seem to at least in the short run increase kind of those health and education behavior so they do seem to be increasing kind of these human capital investments in in the short run um some notes uh about this you know some baird macintosh nozzlers show that they um the ctts lead to higher increase in the condition behaviors but there is a downfall here of cutting off the transfers um to the people who are uh unable to meet them because often these are like the poorest of the poor or right and you may be cutting off this may have targeting effects or other sort of the cash would be really valuable for these people too so it's not necessarily a free lunch and and um ben has seen it all show that just sort of telling people at the cct and not cutting people off not actually enforcing people has at least in their in their study essentially the same benefits as actually running a real cct so actually you may be able to sort of if you can maybe obfuscate a little bit um get a lot of these benefits without actually having to pay these costs but by and large sort of the short run evidence says these things do seem to affect kind of the the desired outcomes in the short run but you know the whole rationale was breaking intergenerational poverty traps so does that work well the problem is most of these experiments progressive being a notable one but not the only one you know they they ran the experiment for a short period of time 18 months then they treat the control group so you don't really know what the sort of the long run implication of these things is for for the next generation it turns out though there are a couple of examples um where this didn't happen okay so uh and the and here for whatever reason the control group did not get treated and here we're starting to get in the last like year or two some medium run studies um which are which at least can start to say you know a number of years later you know what what's happening so um one that sort of that that uh that rima and i were involved with is in indonesia so the indonesian cct was implemented as an rct for six years um and they didn't treat the control group they chose to expand elsewhere in the country instead uh so the control the control experiment remained intact so here we actually can contract households who basically or kids who basically grow up their entire lives in these programs and we find that there's these kids are substantially less stunted sort of six years later okay so that starts to look like an outcome um this program by molina milan at all tracks a honduran cct implemented for five years they actually then follow these these kids 13 years after the start of the program using administrative data so it's administrative data so they can't look directly at um a health a health outcome but they can look at schooling and some wages they find substantial results on secondary and tertiary schooling here um and increases in international migration for young men it's kind of inconclusive on wages but that may be because people are still in school so i think uh the the other one is this baird baird macintosh nosler they ran they followed their two-year malawi cct two years later and and had some muted effects although it's worth noting this only ran for two years where this one was running for five years it was running for six years so these were kind of much more sustained investments in human capital so you know this is not kind of the very long run but now at least in the medium term it's starting to say that that there's some suggestive evidence that those intergenerational um improvements may actually be happening alternatively there's some other variation as well um parker and vogel use cohort variation and geographic variation and progressa they find sort of effects on schooling and female labor force participation um and then actually sort of in the u.s this is not a cct but i think it's kind of an amazing study so i want to mention as well so azer at all studied the mother's pension program which was a program in the u.s run from 1911 into 1935 and they can really track the really long run um by comparing successful unfailed applicants to this program and find that this actually led to male children having more schooling and higher income in adulthood so you know all this together sort of suggests uh paints are starting to at least paint a picture i think that these programs may have some success at breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty um so you know lumpy acid transfers are generating static changes recipients you know npv of that we're gonna wait a number more years to sort of see but it looks like looking pretty positive and these ccts may be general that creating lasting intergenerational change so you know on on this question of poverty traps i think it suggests that that you know maybe these kinds of program design decisions which are um you know changing the way these programs are designed to deal with these issues may actually be having some some success okay so that's the second topic i want to talk about the first is targeting the second is sort of program design focusing on poverty traps the third thing i want to talk about which i think is a developing country challenge is governance so and what is that that is the basic the issue of making sure benefits actually get delivered and making sure the targeting rules are followed okay so um um so here are some selected examples so um uh you know of some of the challenges so uh knee house and car look at uh the indian nrga program in erisa in uh two in 2007 2008 they find 874 to 86 percent leakage rates um moreover and nikolas and konkar find a 30 leakage rates in auriga and ap in 2012 so it's come down but still quite extremely high these are like you know money out the door didn't get go in um in indonesia so i have a paper from 2006 saying at least 18 of the right assistants at the time didn't reach any beneficiaries um you know we had a follow-up paper um in 2018 which suggests that eligible households only received a third of the intended subsidy these are obviously very selective examples right people don't write about leakage when they don't find any um by and large this is so i don't think you should take away from this that like leakage is a rampant problem everywhere but at least there is an issue that needs to be solved so um there's also cheating on sort of some of the the scores as well so you know what to do about it so this is spurred kind of a tremendous amount of research into what to do about this problem um you know the traditional approach might be sort of like monitoring and audits et cetera i want to sort of highlight i think kind of two different approaches which i think are showing promise and i think um can be useful for thinking about these challenges moving forward so one one is payment systems and the other is information so um there's two recent papers that study reforms to payment systems in nrega or nrgs depending on how who you are i guess it goes the act in the scheme um so one paper by murray and because in such our study reform where basically um the payment sys a payment system reform that that gave direct payments to beneficiaries verified by biometrics and also cut the local government out of the payment flow okay so instead of having uh you know the um you know where the kind of the requests go all the way up and the money go all the way down the requests go up and kind of the money goes directly to the bank which goes directly kind of the beneficiary um ban energy at all in bihar sort of a kind of a similar in flavor study here they're going to look at a different kind of back-end technology which is replacing advanced payments with just in time payments based on actual receipts again here the key the key step here is actually just just about changing the way the bureaucracy works okay so in the old system basically you have to sort of like make a request that goes like up up up up and then eventually the funds come down and they the fund request because it sort of takes so long um you don't have to do it you don't have to you you get the funds essentially before you sort of provide the proof in the new system basically they cut out a bunch of layers and because they cut out a bunch of layers they can basically pay you once you sort of submitted the the proof of who worked so both of these are kind of in some sense you could think of them as kind of you know back ends kind of systems reforms and the the kind of upshot is both of these things substantially reduce leakage in these programs okay so the ap smart cards are for them reduce leakage from 30 30 to 18 that's a 41 reduction in leakage um the the bihar payment systems reform reduced program expenditures by 24 you know households reported no changes in wages i couldn't quite compute a similar kind of reduction in leakage percentage from this paper but it but it's also suggesting large reductions in leakage so that sort of says you know beyond sort of the traditional that's audit people let's monitor people changing the way these systems are constructed can help potentially have important kind of governance implications the second thing i want to highlight um is information sort of giving going the exactly the opposite way and sort of empowering kind of beneficiary to sort of like demand more of their rights so here um you know we have a study we did in indonesia where we basically the government worked with the government of indonesia and mailed out kind of cards to beneficiaries and basically said here are your rights under this program okay so uh here's a card this is a sample card that's not a real person's name and it basically says you know under this rice program you know you're entitled to 15 kilos of rice per month and this version says and here's the copay price you have to pay for it and these were mailed in an envelope through the post office to sort of all the beneficiaries of the program uh in some villages they were also sort of posted in public as well so people could kind of see maybe the idea here was generate some common knowledge right not just that i have a card but i know that everyone else knows that i have a card and so on and so forth and the key kind of takeaway here if you look at the total amount of subsidy received by eligible households you know it goes up by about 15 just by standing out sending out the cards it goes up by almost thirty percent if you send out the cards and sort of post the information about the cards so this sort of says even for a program that's been going on for many many years right just giving people kind of information and sort of a tangible proof of their information uh leads to substantial reductions in leakage and more uh more subsidy being delivered and so you know what's the sort of what's the kind of bottom line um from these studies i think that you know going back to the beginning of the government section it looks like there's sort of the substantial problems in governance right there's lots of leakage i think that both of these two different kinds of studies say this problem is not an immutable problem right there are uh this is a problem that actually can be solved even within these developing country environments and i think it suggests that sort of thinking through the kind of the back-end bureaucracy of these things and making sure that works effectively and providing information to beneficiaries are both kind of ways that you can sort of solve this problem and substantially reduce leakage even in these kind of environments okay so um to wrap up because i want to leave some time for questions um you know where do we where do we go next so if you think back to what i started with right we can see that a lot of these countries are sort of are growing right um we're moving sort of into a lot of these countries are moving and becoming middle-income countries and i think that has some implications for um kind of the next set of challenges for sort of thinking about the these kinds of program designs um as countries move into that so one is you know i think that a lot of the programs i've talked about have been programs where you're basically giving stuff to the to the poor i think the next frontier that a lot of these countries are thinking about are more sort of social insurance type programs health insurance programs workers compensation workplace injuries unemployment insurance um pensions if you don't if you think about that social insurance or not but but you know all of these are are our types of programs that we sort of see uh in the developed world i think as as countries are starting to get a little more tax capacity and a little more administrative capacity you're starting to see a lot of these kind of lower middle income countries trying to start to struggle with what how do we do this and each of these problems i think each of these types of social insurance programs is going to have their own sets of challenges when you start to deal with this in in the developing in the developing world you know for example the the really large informal sector right means that a lot of the the the ways you would typically handle some of these things are going to not going to work for sort of large numbers of employees in most of these urban environments so how do you how do you solve some of those problems i think that's one i think that's kind of the sometimes i think the social insurance programs are really kind of the next frontier another thing i think is really important is um you know one thing i mentioned about targeting is um you know the targeting that we were doing that i was talking about in the targeting section was all very much static right we were targeting based on kind of um or sort of targeting based on your level of income there's um i think you know some interesting uh work from the program effects literature which says that you know there can be a lot of heterogeneity and treatment effects in these programs and i think one really interesting question is can we design ways of targeting based on heterogeneous treatment effects can we sort of figure out who the people who are going to benefit from the most are and how do we sort of you know layer on top of our already sort of large targeting challenge that additional challenge of targeting based on treatment effects so um uh rima nan khan and i are trying to start a project in pakistan working on this issue but i think there's like a tremendous amount uh to be done on this as well and then the final thing is you know i would sort of say what are the broader impacts of these programs so i think that you know there's one paper i mentioned you know what are the general equilibrium effects of all this stuff as these things start to be scaled up how do we think about how that's going to affect the economy there's a paper by a new paper a paper by by on enrique which thinks about some evidence that actually a big part of the effect of enrique is is not on the people who who get it but actually on how it changed equilibrium wages um some other work i mentioned on migration you know what else is going on how do we think about the general equilibrium effects of these programs i think that's kind of a really important phenomenon and the final thing i want to sort of lead on is you know all of this has been done from sort of a micro perspective when you talk to policy makers um one reason that they think about running these programs is actually is a macro perspective so you know if you want to um in the face of a negative macro shock in you know um you know for example in in the early 2000s the us click cut checks to everyone to sort of you know provide a stimulus the infrastructure sort of cutting checks to everyone is actually kind of complicated and actually one rationale policymakers have for building the infrastructure of these programs is that when there is a macro shock they can sort of use them as sort of a you know turn on the spigot and sort of just increase size the transfers and use that to sort of smooth aggregate shocks so i think understanding how these things are affecting kind of macroeconomics uh and the macroeconomic smoothing in developing countries is a really interesting kind of unexplored area okay thank you so we have
