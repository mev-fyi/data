good morning my name is Mary Cunningham I there's like which one of these things is not like the other in this room and that's me I am not an economist um I am a researcher by training um I work at the urban Institute I'm the vice president for the Metropolitan Housing Community Center there where I run a center of about um 80 researchers and policy staff so we tend to focus on a range of issues from homelessness eviction public housing housing vouchers just discrimination in the housing market to broader issues like community and economic development climate change and communities and so on um I am here to bring a policy perspective to this conversation and I have been doing work in my career on the Housing Voucher Program I've been involved in um I actually started my career off as a caseworker for families with housing vouchers and have done a lot of research on housing vouchers one of the big pieces of research which I'm actually not going to talk about today is on discrimination against voucher holders and then more recently been doing a lot of work on homelessness and looking at how homelessness programs work and I'm not going to talk about that either but I would encourage you to look at some of the work that we've done on housing first and Supportive Housing and what it means as a solution to homelessness today I'm actually going to talk about the broader housing market and give you some perspective on what we're operating in and also really think about look at housing and security and then call for more empirical work on trying to think about market failures regulation in the market or deregulation of the market I'm going to talk a little bit about land use and zoning and then more Investments how can we design social programs so that they're politically palatable so I'm hoping you can all solve my political problems when I'm thinking about does this really work um and especially in an environment where evidence isn't always the first thing that people look at on the hill um and and um in other places in the policy environment so let's start by talking about what's going on in the housing market um housing market housing costs have grown significantly they're growing faster than incomes I think we all know this um this is uh looking at both the uh U.S median home values and incomes as well as specifically DC because we know that in particularly in major metros that um uh spread between income and housing costs is really bigger um but that is a nationwide problem and what we know is part of it is is that housing is not keeping up with demand this is housing starts uh per 1000 households um we know that not only do we not have enough housing production to keep up the supplies and keeping up with demand but we also know that most of the housing is um really concentrated in single-family homes and so if you're thinking about renters if you're thinking about low and moderate income people you're really not talking about the market that we currently have which is really focused on a single single family homes the other challenge um here is that um when you uh when there is multi-family development it tends to be much bigger buildings usually a lot of the development now is in the sort of luxury side um two and four unit buildings and even five to 19 unit buildings have been on the decrease that's the blue and the yellow lines and then the black line is 20 or more units which is a little bit um increasing but really generally speaking those small units um small buildings that are really what make up the affordable housing stock um are on the decline so what does that mean it means that we have a nationwide a nationwide shortage of about 7.3 million rental homes that are affordable for extremely low-income renters and so um and this is actually National low-income housing coalitions map it does a really nice job of breaking this out by state so I would encourage you to go and look at it um but what it tells us is that you know voucher recipients people who are facing eviction and homelessness are really operating in a market that's not set up for them at all they are competing for scarce units they're also facing significant discrimination in the market from from landlords um so public subsidies generally in the U.S have been on the decline and that's especially true for deep subsidies um we have public housing and housing Choice voucher programs some people know it as the Section 8 program um have um have public housing in particular has declined because we've been demolishing public housing units and really vouchering out those programs um there has been some um investment in low-income housing tax credits which is really a private Market program to incentivize landlords and developers to actually produce low-income housing that produces about only about a hundred thousand units a year so this is uh just to give you a sense of what our housing market looks like compared to other housing markets um places like Chicago Los Angeles New York a major metropolitan areas um the the units with either project-based subsidies those are the blue um or private Market subsidies tenant-based subsidies housing vouchers more specifically is a really small portion of the market so under 10 when you look at places um like France and the UK you see a much bigger portion of the market actually has subsidy so uh 20 to you know 35 percent of the people who are um in those markets are actually receiving some kind of subsidy so we have a pretty um uh uh tight rental markets across the country especially in major metropolitan areas um we have low housing Supply and not enough units it's sort of like a game of musical chairs this is a sort of uh example or analogy that a lot of people use which is like at the end of the day um the people who are left standing without housing are usually the most vulnerable who can't compete with other people in the market um so I have a three million eviction filings per year I think that's actually an update from the eviction lab when he talked about some of the challenges with eviction data I think this actually represents not a new number it's like no I think it's actually there's new data being added more geographies and so you're just actually adding um this is no denominator there so um about 1 million of those households are evicted so there's you know obviously a big difference between in filings and the actual eviction process um this particularly affects kids but it also particularly affects um women of color um black women in particular are affected by the eviction crisis um homelessness is um was actually I've done a lot of work on homelessness I used to feel really optimistic um I think it's a solvable problem I think we actually have evidence-based solutions to solve for homelessness we just not have not scaled those Solutions um and we haven't invested in those Solutions so um right now homelessness is around 600 000 overall at a point in time that's a snapshot that um communities take usually in January there are many more people who experience homelessness over the course of the Year about a million and a half and that's sort of the movie not the snapshot homelessness was going down until about 2015 because there were significant increases in Investments Congress made significant investments in um ending veterans homelessness so funding actually a version of housing vouchers for veterans um there's there were significant investments in Supportive Housing and the numbers actually started to go down so uh I felt very optimistic because both the data on the program Effectiveness was lining up with the population level um uh estimates of of some of those numbers going down um more recently though we have seen an increase in both chronic homelessness so people who have been um homeless for long periods or have a disability and as well as unshelter homelessness if you live on the west coast I'm not telling you anything new there has been an explosion invisible homelessness and encampments um across many of our um uh major cities and even in some of our suburbs um so I want to take a step back because um I talked a little bit about housing Supply um and how it's not um uh keeping up with demand um I want to talk a little and I've talked a little bit about the sort of grim consequences of that um I want to focus on what are some of the things that actually explain our housing deficit um the first that I'll point to are strict local land use regulations so locally jurisdictions make decisions about land use often through planning boards but also there's both uh detailed policies that um you go through but there's also sort of informal processes that often are used to make land use uh decisions and that is why we have what we have um in terms of mostly predominantly single-family homes and I'll talk about that in a minute um and then we have uh inadequate financing options especially for low and moderate income households so even if you are a developer and you want to develop housing for low and moderate income people it actually doesn't pencil out for you it doesn't I make Financial sense you can because of all the costs associated with the entitlement process to go through the news and zoning boards because of the construction costs what you can get at the end of the day for rent doesn't really pencil out to be able to pay back your debt that you're going to take on um so there really is a market failure there which is that there is this demand that people need housing and um for landlords they're really not incentivized to actually develop that housing and then I talked a little bit about limited government subsidy um to sort of correct for some of those people who are really left out of the market so in terms of land use and Zoning which I see is a really fundamental roadblock I'm actually not only use the zoning expert I'm not I have researchers in the center you want to free Mark is one of them I don't know if anyone knows Jonah um but who does a lot of work on this and um but I more and more have started to think if I really want to encourage more housing for people who are experiencing homelessness or evictions I have to get back uh to a bigger level to start to think about things like land use and Zoning because we have places and this is a great New York Times analysis that basically shows that um in some locations upwards of 95 of the land that is is zoned for single family use only so you can't it is actually illegal to build apartments in these locations and that is a major major uh roadblock to um to getting house developed um I think most like regulation uh for this Market is really distorting the market it increases costs it limits options uh for people so if you want to say you live in a neighborhood my mom lives in a neighborhood right now it's a single family home she wants to actually age um in her town she wants to buy a condo there are no Condos for her to buy so it's not only an issue of are there apartments and condominiums for people who are low and moderate income it is an issue that goes across uh income and um uh in ages it also exacerbates segregation so one of the reasons why voucher holders cannot find units in Opportunity areas it's because literally when you look at those maps of Bellevue and Redmond there are no Apartments there are very limited limited apartments and so really being able to find units in those locations is a very competitive process um there are also environmental and climate consequences still in Houston zoning because it encourages car use um and then what I really focused on is making um it makes alternative unit different types of units even things like accessory dwelling units um uh difficult to build so I am feeling a little bit optimistic but not totally optimistic about um the recent wave of Lane use and Zoning reforms so there has certainly been places May Minneapolis um more recently the Puget Sound region uh Arlington County and Virginia where they are passing a wave of land use and Zoning reforms but these have been pretty um slow and there's only probably a dozen of places that have passed significant reforms and some of these look like up zoning reducing parking requirements allowing different types of structures um also by right development so these are some sort of some of the sort of waves of land use and Zoning reforms so I'm going to talk a little bit on my last slide about what some of those land use and Zoning reforms might present for um so for research for all of you but I want to First also just note that the other um reasons why we don't have significant um we don't have actually enough housing for folks is because we need significant investments in all sorts of Housing Programs we need investments in not only public and people now say social housing I don't even know what that actually means I think that just means subsidized housing is like a rebranding of public housing because people when you say public housing everyone says we're not doing that again so now people say social housing um you know there is uh I think a real need for Universal housing vouchers there's political challenges to that certainly Congress has not shown a great appetite for expanding the voucher program um but there's also I think Market um challenges with that if you flooded the market with subsidy where they're you know how do you actually design um the adoption of a universal housing program and and allow for a market absorption so that um you wouldn't be increasing rents um and um and uh um really distorting the market um so the other is increases in low-income housing tax credits but I also think we need to experiment with other ways to stimulate and incentivize housing production so I had to put the slide in because I think often people like ask the question of me why is there little Federal investment in housing and um I will say first and foremost it is not understood as a market failure people stigmatize uh poor and moderate income people um it's more of a risky person bad choices model um and so instead of saying hey we actually don't have enough units in the housing market they say people have made choices and have um risky behaviors that result in them not having housing certainly there are there's a relationship between having mental health challenges uh substance use disorders and other things that make people more vulnerable in a competitive market but we also know that from the evidence that if you help a person pay the rent that they actually can stay housed and for people who have serious mental illness we know that if you actually combine rental assistance with Supportive Services that they can stay housed and so it's not a question of whether or not the housing works or not or their personal challenges it really is whether or not we have the right level of subsidy for people who are not competitive in the housing market and then the last thing is is that housing is often viewed as a reward and a wealth building tool and not meeting a basic needs or fundamental right and so um it is really uh viewed as something that we give to people who have earned it and not um is something that people deserve or that we want to make sure everyone has so this is you probably hear some frustration in my presentation um this is me sort of taking a step back from a lot of the research that I've done on housing vouchers on homelessness programs on eviction and trying to think about how can we reimagine the housing market um one I think there is a big question of how do we get to a more momentum and actually Nationwide um uh a land use and Zoning reforms I think there's questions around not only government incentives that Winnie raised but also are there ways to compensate um current uh uh landowners homeowners who are really the people who show up at those planning boards is there a way to actually create a market where they're interested in um actually zoning reforms so I think that's a question but I also think we need to know what the impact of these reforms are because this is um really a fundamental first step to creating more housing it's illegal now to build multi-family housing in most places but um just changing the laws doesn't mean that you're actually going to have the market respond so we really need to know how to incentivize that market um and then the questions around how can we really address market failures for low and moderating companies Also let's do government intervention I think that there isn't a lot of political support for public housing and housing Choice voucher programs I've done this work for 20 years and there haven't hasn't been any significant increases so are there different designs to programs that are more Market oriented that are more politically palatable um tax credits other um uh different um approaches what share of the housing market that we have should be subsidized or I don't use use the word a lot do you commodified because it usually is pretty inflammatory um and what are the best mechanisms for subsidy delivery um and I don't know I think Winnie did a great job a much deeper dive into how to think about some of the market design issues in some of these questions um but I will say that we are really at an unsustainable place now with the housing market um not only our low and moderate income people having trouble affording housing but middle income people as well people who are young and want to break into the housing market and buy their first homes is really challenging and we just need to reimagine what the housing market looks like because otherwise we're just really tinkering around the edges that's it
