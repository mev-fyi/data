thank you very much for inviting us to present this paper today border adjustments are policies that tax all imports while allowing an equivalent deduction on all export sales they are a recurring topic in policy debate and they were a hot topic on the news last year during the negotiation of the corporate tax reform indeed in 2016 the ryan ready proposal advised to charge the corporate tax on all imports of the u.s while allowing a deduction of the corporate tax on all export sales now this particular feature of the policy was dropped from the bill in 2017 because of pressure from importers and because of uncertainty due to its economic effects another typical policy that involves a broader adjustment is evaluated tax and this is because evaluated tax is usually levied on all imports and rebated on all export sales this is also another policy that in the u.s context is often discussed especially in alternative to other sources of revenue that the us government may use now at this point it's important to note that we're going to analyze an introduction of these two policies that differ in one important aspect in one case we are applying a border adjustment on an existing tax the corporate tax in the second case we are introducing a border adjusted attack that is tax there is a fresh introduction so they seem pretty straightforward superficially but they have complex effect in pla in practice and these effects are often misunderstood even among economists so we hope to shed light on the macroeconomic effects of these policies and we're going to set aside the important issues related to long-term effects for example these incentives to profit shifting and business location that the border adjustment is supposed to influence uh border adjustments are often perceived as protectionists ironically economists i love known that border adjustments and they're exactly the feature that undoes protectionism for example in the case of a value-added tax if we didn't apply an export rebate that would be equivalent to applying an export tax in case we assume inelastic labor and the learner symmetry result tells us that that is equivalent to applying an import tariff at least in its real economic effect equivalent similarly for the corporate border adjustment tax the learner the learner symmetry tells us that we are applying a true of setting taxes when we uh border adjust the corporate tax system and that should also have no real economic effect or in other words it should be a neutral introduction of this border adjustment and the intuition behind this is that when we are applying order adjustment the wedge applied on import and export prices should be compensated either by a wage a domestic wage response relative to foreign wages or to an exchange rate response so the original conditions for the learner symmetry relied on flexible prices and trade buttons there these conditions are often met with skepticism because they are they rely on the fact that we are we're having multiple price changes in general equilibrium offsetting these taxes so a natural way to approach this topic and to approach this skepticism from us was to take a step back and think again of more general conditions for this this neutrality result to hold and then after finding these neutrality conditions in general look at where they're more likely not to hold and then find a quantitative effects out of this this relaxation of neutrality conditions so we find five five of them in a new condition dynamic setting with sticky prices sticky wages and intermediate goods and trade imbalances to reflect the modern economy and these five conditions are the following they should hold all together in order for the neutrality result to hold the first of all is that there should be symmetric pass-through for taxes and exchange rates into prices the second is that the country introducing the corporate border adjustment should have only international asset position in foreign currency then the monetary policy should follow a pretty much standard tailor rule and it's important that it doesn't target exchange rates in the end this border adjustment should apply uniformly to all imports and export and should be one time and unanticipated for the value added tax exactly because in this case we are introducing a new border adjusted tax we are not introducing a border adjustment to an existing tax then there is also another stringent condition that we need to add to the five above and that is that labor supply should be inelastic so in the paper we analyze more or less all of them and departures from all of them but in today's talk i'm going to focus on the first two specifically and then for the value-added tax we're simply going to calibrate a standard free elasticity of 0.5 to have a plausible response of the labor supply so let me give you more details on what the first condition what we mean with the first condition so i'm asking you to visualize here the dynamic of prices in the u.s at the border and in world prices when a corporate border adjustment tax is introduced imagine that i mean assume that prices are sticky in the currency of the producer in this context so in the case of u.s imports prices will be sticky in the foreign currency and that is denominated with a superscript star when this good is sold in the u.s that price is converted in dollars with a variable epsilon meaning amount of dollars per foreign currency and then the border adjustment is applied and that burden adjustment because prices are sticky is passed through right away into consumer prices this is what we mean by having symmetric pass-through of taxes and exchange rates you can see here that the only variables that moves are the ones highlighted in red and so the condition is matched because exchange rate movements and the border adjustment are passed through right away similarly for exports the domestic producer in the us prices goods in dollars optimally and that price is sticky when this good is sold abroad then the corporate adjustment deduction is applied and passed through at the border completely at this point it will be converted in foreign in units of the foreign currency with the exchange rate variable and then again we have that this condition is met for consumer prices of the rest of the world as well you can see now why we have this condition implying neutrality here because in general equilibrium the exchange rate as long as it perceives a complete appreciation will completely offset the corporate adjustment tax and you can see also here that this condition is more general than the learner the original derivation of the learner symmetry because we don't have flexible prices here we can even have fully sticky prices and the neutrality result will still hold however there's a problem with this rigidity assumed here and it's the fact that as more evidence comes through on the rigidities in trade markets the producer currency pricing approach is rejected and what seems to be a more accurate way of representing rigidities in trade markets is what is called the dominant currency pricing approach in this context prices are sticky at the border four dollars both in imports and exports so in the domestic currency of the case in the case of the us we know this because 97 percent of u.s exports and 93 percent of usc imports are priced in dollars and we know that a large majority of them are sticky in dollars so when the border adjustment is applied in this context the neutrality will fail and this is because the exchange rate of the dollar appreciation cannot pass through into import prices right away so in the short term for u.s consumers only the border adjustment tax will do the work and and this means that imports will have a higher tax the price will go up imports get killed and this sort of justifies the concerns that importers had related to the introduction of this border adjustment for exports similarly the prices are sticky at the border and so now it is the deduction that cannot cannot pass through world prices and so that those world prices will change only according to the exchange rate now this particular departure of the neutrality condition breaks neutrality only in the short term in the long run we assume that prices are flexible again and so we will still have neutrality in our quantitative section the second condition that we imply for neutrality is that all international assets and liabilities of a country should be in foreign currency you can see why this matters just by looking at the budget constraint of the us expressed in foreign currency now the the net foreign asset position is fully in foreign currency and there will be no change after an exchange rate appreciation after a dollar appreciation and for the trade balance also there will be no no change in value because the export subsidy or the export exemption of the corporate adjustment tax will be completely offset by the dollar appreciation but we know that this is not an accurate way of modeling the net foreign asset position of the u.s in particular we know that most of us liabilities are denominated in dollars and so we must enrich this budget constraint and with a new variable called b here highlighted in green because it's denominated in dollars and when we introduce this variable then an exchange rate appreciation at dollar appreciation will increase the amount of liabilities compared to assets for the u.s in this case this is equivalent to a transfer of wealth from the u.s to the rest of the world that is we calculate b equal to 1.09 multiplied by the amount of the appreciation in percentage points in general equilibrium and we're going to give you we're going to be able to give you a number for this after the quantitative section so let's look at the the quantitative effects in this slide i show you the impulse response function after an introduction of a border adjustment in the corporate tax system of the u.s on the first quarter this border adjustment is one time and permanent so let's look at the producer currency price case here in which both of our assumptions hold in that case we've seen that the neutrality hold and then and this implies that the exchange rate the the dollar appreciation is complete is 20 exactly equal to the border adjustment rate and that will have no effect on export import volumes or output volumes now what's more interesting is to check what happens when we under the more plausible assumption of dollar currency pricing the ex the dollar appreciation in equilibrium is still close to 20 percent and but imports and exports behave differently in the case of imports this dollar appreciation cannot pass through u.s prices right away and only the border adjustment in the short term will decrea will increase import prices and will trigger a 30 volume drop for imports similarly for exports now it is the subsidy or the exemption of the corporate tax that cannot pass through world prices and all the work is being done by the dollar appreciation output just increases moderately when both assumptions so of that we find are are are not met so when we assume a dollar currency pricing world and uh the possibility of a valuation effect then the exchange rate appreciation is at only 15 in the short term and this is because the this is because there is a wealth transfer from the us to the rest of the world now there is an asymmetric effect on exports and imports for imports it doesn't matter that the dollar appreciates less than under dcp because prices are sticky in dollars but for exports that lower appreciation will imply a twenty percent drop rather than a trend thirty percent drop under dcp and this will boost the trade balance will turn into a trade surplus for the u.s and that will boost output by almost two percent as well so let's now give you give some estimates for the valuation effect and fiscal revenues now we know that the appreciation under valuation effect is of 15 and so we can calculate that there will be a wealth transfer from the us to the rest of the world equal to 16 of gdp under border adjustment these car revenues are also were also a hot topic during the the discussion of this policy the intuition uh behind its effects is that when we are shifting uh from a standard corporate tax to a border-adjusted corporate tax we are changing the tax base from exports to imports and so in the case of the u.s where the u.s is running a trade deficit we are we are shifting towards a bigger uh tax base we're shifting towards imports and so in the short term while the us is running a trade deficit there will be a revenue boost that we calculate being equal to four percentage points of gdp in the long term though in order to keep the negative net present the net negative net foreign asset position of the us that trade balance the trade deficit should turn into a trade surplus and so in this case the border adjustment on the corporate tax will be equivalent to a drop in revenue of 15 percentage points of gdp now let's look at the second policy that we analyze the value-added tax the first condition for neutrality is similar in spirit to the border adjustment tax there should be complete pass-through of value added into prices in the short run if you look at import prices related to the aggregate domestic price you can see why this ensures neutrality as long as the value added tax is passed through completely on both imports and the domestic prices then there will be no effect on import demand for the case of export exactly because this is a new introduction of the value added tax nothing will change and so the relative prices of u.s exports related to the foreign prices of good will not change notice that because this is a new introduction of the value-added tax and not a border adjustment of it then there will also be no exchange rate pressure and in under neutrality we don't expect a dollar appreciation but we do need an additional assumption which is stringent fairly stringent which is inelastic level supply or fully rigid wages and this is because the value at the tax will increase domestic prices and that will make real wages drop and hence trigger a labor supply response so let's look at the quantitative effects under an elastic labor supply we find almost by construction that there's no effect right but then when we assume a standard fresh elasticity of the labor supply of 0.5 there is a large output drop due to the response of this labor supply in the case of the dollar appreciation the appreciation is fairly small in general equilibrium and so there will be a little implication for the volume of trade as well in conclusion we find more general conditions for the neutrality of corporate border adjustment tax and value-added tax but we find them to be unrealistic on the first quarter impact of a 20 percent corporate border adjustment tax which is a border adjustment applied to an existing tax we find that there will be real effect on trade volume of minus 30 percent and also a large appreciation in equilibrium for the case of a new introduction of a border adjusted value at the tax the main effect is on output and there is a drop of five percent on output but there are moderate effects on trade volume and dollar appreciation for the case of corporate border adjustment tax the valuation effect is equivalent to a 16 wealth transfer from the us to the rest of the world in terms of gdp and fiscal revenues have a short-term boost of 4 percentage points over gdp with a reversal of of in net present value in the long term so of 15 percentage points over gdp of revenues thank you very much
