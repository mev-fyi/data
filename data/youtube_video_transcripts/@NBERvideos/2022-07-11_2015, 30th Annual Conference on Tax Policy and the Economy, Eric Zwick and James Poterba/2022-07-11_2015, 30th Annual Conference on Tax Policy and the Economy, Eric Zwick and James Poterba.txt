at this year's tax policy in the economy conference sponsored by the national bureau of economic research you presented some new research findings that suggest that the tax treatment of high income individuals depends a great deal on how pass-through entities partnerships and other related entities are taxed under the u.s tax code could you say a little bit about those findings and their implications well as is well known the top one percent income share has grown from 1980 to 2013 by 10 percentage points what's less well known is that more than half of this increases come in the form of pass-through business income and so how uh this income is taxed which includes carried interest uh which includes uh dividends and capital gains as an important input into thinking about conversations about inequality and how tax policy interacts with it and understanding this pass-through income is an important part of that conversation one of your findings seems to be that the role of pass-through entities in the u.s business sector has grown over time can you elaborate on the numbers behind that yeah well what used to be the case is that 80 percent of total net business income was earned by traditional c corporations and the remaining 20 was earned by informal businesses or sole proprietorships but since then there's been a dramatic growth in pass-through businesses which includes both s corporations and partnerships so that now less than half of total net business income is earned by c corporations with a rapid growing share partnerships being the most rapidly growing but these pass-throughs are incred increasingly important in business activity in the us now we find we find pass-through entities of various kinds throughout the income distribution some low-income households uh in informal businesses receive income of this kind as well as high income where has the growth taken place well much of the growth has come if you look at where the income is received within the household income distribution it is increasing incredibly concentrated in the top of the income distribution for formal business past past their businesses so s corpse and partnerships both see almost 70 percent of income in 2011 was earned by households in the top 1 percent i see and how does the tax burden on these different kind of business entities compare traditional c corporations s corporations partnerships other pass-through entities yes so we we are able to use uh tax calculators to estimate the tax rate paid in 2011 for each of these types of businesses c corporates c corporations paid the highest rate at 32 percent uh partnerships pay uh paid the lowest rate at fifteen point nine percent among formal businesses with s-corps in between um and the reason why the partnership rate was low uh is partly due to the uh a large fraction of this income being in preferred tax forms such as capital gains and dividends and largely because the partnership form is very flexible such that foreign entities and tax exempts can also participate and they face a very low tax burden so given a lot of this income is capital gains related what what industries are the are these are these entities operating in so they typically classif so so on an income weighted basis partnership income is very concentrated in finance and whether what are called holding companies so the structures of these underlying businesses are actually somewhat difficult to discern using the tax data that is reported s corporations have a standard a much more uniform distribution across the industries in the economy which suggests the rise of pass-through isn't just about finance but is also affecting a much broader swath of industry
