i would like to reflect on is our research insights that we've gathered here at oxford about infrastructure procurement its management and [Music] under the big umbrella of cost containment and cost control and cost risk and this is a particular great interest to me because one of the key things that we've done here at oxford in the last i forgot now 13 14 years is to not only look at transport infrastructure where we started but actually look across different sectors so here you see that as this hasn't been published yet so there's a couple of publications that are going through the usual process that will make these uh numbers public uh public domain knowledge so for now you've got the slide and the very first look about what it actually looks like what you see here on this slide is a snapshot of this big database where we now have more than 16 000 projects where we track the cost evolution through the front-end process so from the typical stages of strategic case to outlying case to final investment decision and then compare those x risk against the actual out turn cost so a classic exposed versus x under study the interesting thing that we see here so you see a couple of those picked out and it's not completely random what i picked out here so it is the very best by the mean cost of the run so the mean cost overrun is in the in the first row here that you see the frequency of having a cost overrun of any size that's the second row then there's the mean schedule overrun the mean benefits overrun which means that negative number here as you see is uh is the case for all of these projects where data are available a negative number means there's a shortfall so in transport infrastructure um because that's the most comparable measure that means passenger vehicle numbers per day and uh compared to the plan and then you see there the final cost uh final rule has something that is uh subject to some of our most recent publications which is when how often do these projects turn into statistical outliers or to use a popular term for that black swans which in this case is anything that has cost overruns of 88 or greater compared to fid so they pretty much double its cost so extreme events that shouldn't be there and what you see here is some of the very best capital investment projects you can do solar power on average or the mean is one percent cost overrun two percent schedule delay and then you see on the right hand side some of the worst things you can do so the worst project category and i know some particular part of this audience here that you might be tangentially impacted by this because might happen in your state and uh you know we're burning a lot of taxpayers money at the moment is to find storage location for nuclear waste where we see on the mean overrun is 238 with 70 percent delay for these projects and there's also quite a large benefit shortfall in terms of usable capacity at the end of it and to some extent you can see isn't that you know the classic idea sort of the classic transport infrastructures like roads rail uh that sits somewhere sort of at the lower end on the left-hand side of this chart so roads not as risky as rail yet on average in both of these cases we do see uh sort of in rail particularly at 40 percent cost overrun on on average uh schedule runs around 30 to 40 percent as you can see here and also some uh sizable benefit shortfalls and the other thing i wanted to highlight here is particularly one thing that i don't know if it worries me but i find particularly interesting as a rich research ground is digital stuff what we call tit led change and whether that is the change that is then driven because an owner operator might digitize processes and systems used internally and the way they operate assets or it is actually having an effect on how we how users are using these assets think smart motorways think different hauling systems and different ways of well if i these days say charging for traffic that sometimes charging for traffic then charging traffic if you um anyway so there's a lot of more i.t in our projects uh that are coming online so that kind of big push towards digitization uh as you can see here and particularly when we talk about road infrastructure actually adds a whole chunk of uncertainty and risk to what we are procuring and i find that super interesting now from our research perspective how we look at this we typically chunk projects up into what happens during the planning process and what happens afterwards in procurement and then execution so what happens before the final investment decision uh we can almost summarize around these things so all of these projects no matter what industry what sector make promises typically around the three key characteristics of any npv calculation which is cost time and benefits and if we're asking the question right you might say even on road even in rail right 40 over here 40 under there happens in you know 60 of the case 70 of the cases if you look across the board how good are we at making these promises when it comes to the investment decision we see here that about one and two of those decisions then deliver against the promise cost estimate so half of the projects are delivering on budget or better we then also ask the question how many did not only deliver on budget or better but also on time or earlier than it's about 1 and 12. and we're asking the question okay how many of these projects have also delivered not only on budget or better on time or better but also on benefits or better than when in the space of one in 200. um my colleague bent flubia who's probably a household name and this beautiful audience has called this a long time ago the iron law of major projects that projects are over budget over time and their benefits over and over again or you could flip that around and simply saying is that it is just showing how hard it is to get the uncertainty right and i think shashana's paper just now showing us sort of how we can adjust options to better deal with that uncertainty because getting that uncertainty right understanding it right and finding a better split of where do we place that uncertainty in the market in the supply chain on the owner operator side on the financing side of things that has big implications on how we can improve project delivery so the way we look at it and the way what we see here is and what i want to split out is kind of these two elements of it so first of all what can we do to what can we do up front when we're having sort of in our planning capability and i would say there is a lot about our decision quality so how can we get decision quality up on that side of things and then thinking very simplistically about projects i know this might be a gross oversimplification of you know what happens if you have billions to invest in millions to spend then it is all about value control and that has to do with our execution that has to do with our procurement and commercial management of cost containment so i'd like to unpack these two dimensions now what we see here is uh some of the particular front-end consideration when we're talking about decision quality at entry so why are we underestimating uncertainty and uh that auction model was very driven by you know understanding true ranges of uncertainty the level of uncertainty the level of standard deviation and these kind of things is really important and if you followed our research you will know that and you've seen that before the data actually show a systematic bias towards underestimation individually in each of these dimensions when we're taking course scheduling benefits but also collectively so just show one in 200 projects that is more than an error there's a systematic bias in the data which then leaves the question to these kind of you know how do we bring behavioral economics into the game through the great work that kahneman and tversky and everybody else after that have done around decision-making biases and the second question around so the great work that martin wax has done uh a long uh a while ago on you know actually the way we are procuring things with the way we're awarding work the way we're setting budgets within government departments that is creating incentives where we get very rational responses where we want to under report true cost and we want to misrepresent or under represent the true uncertainty in our projects now when we're faced with this kind of model what do we do and uh so i've got a i did a a thing where i went out and asked some of the leaders of these capital projects um and this is a uk sample so i asked these people who look after things that in the uk context are bigger than 25 million so they're classified across government in the uk as major projects there's about a hundred at every any given point in time so as you know as in our economy is a little bit smaller our ambition is a little bit smaller than in the us and i asked 240 of these projects leaders which of these biases has most impacted your project and you can see here the biggest one is optimism so being optimistic having that over confidence in the supply chains that we're procuring in the deliverability of the projects that is uh 25 percent a quarter of the respondents status and that's actually what has impacted us the most and then the second one 14 they talk about uh is the biggest detriment to their project has been that self-interested that political bias but it's not that unforced optimism that unforced over confidence great level of ambition but actually a very rational uh response to the incentives we set in the budgeting process and you see here there's a couple of other projects there that have been negatively affected and one of the interesting things thinking about this list from the behavioral economists actually is around the effect heuristic where you find that projects are falling in love or the people doing the projects are falling in love with their project and as a particular thing in the public sector i found and particularly when we're talking about decarbonization projects whether they are in the transport sector whether in the energy sector the housing sector etc almost nobody doesn't you know we all know that as a big issue so it's very hard to stop these projects when they're going awry now looking at the second side of things when we're talking about value control and this is coming closer from our procurement angle and what has procurement to do with this right so there's one element about the decision quality at entry and how do well do we actually understand how well do all operators understand the risks they are trying to then manage place in the market mitigate transfer etc commercially or through other processes but way too often and that is i think true in every single jurisdictions we're looking at uh we're seeing this kind of picture that we're throwing risks over the fence and trying to place them uh with um whoever's being able to carry them and assuming often that these risks have been mitigated that kind of oh yeah i'm glad that that hall is not in our end and uh in particular and i really like the previous talk around how can we get better at the bidding how can we move away from the fixed price lump uh fixed price lump sum auction kind of suggestion which always and i think it's uh it's just here in the first sentence that's and you know that it's you know it's unwise to pay too much but it's even worse to pay too little uh because if you pay too little you might end up with nothing at all um to paraphrase this uh quote that has actually completely unknown origins but typically attributed to uh john ruskin uh a member of uh well sort of an early sort of economist arts and craft person and and where we see this uh this going is actually sort of some of our insights and what we have looked at these things is in terms of when we're looking at procurement models and when we're talking to people who are making procurement strategic procurement decisions about the avenues of procurement to go down to there's often a little bit of a confusion about what are we actually procuring and i found this kind of categorization and thinking quite helpful to think about is that are we at the low end of the scale where we're actually putting something that's relatively low risk a product uh i like that example of traffic cones right let's procure a bunch of traffic cones right there's a product we're placing an order somebody will deliver that order it's relatively little uncertainty then the second step up is where in the markets we actually want to form a product project around providing an integrated solution so this is multiple products that need to come together a higher risk of uncertainty we're actually starting our journey into the design procurement decision making around the explication of user needs and we then want to procure against those user needs and we're open to different technical solutions the next level up is we want to go on somewhat of an innovation journey together and so we really want to procure insights and ideas we want to procure novel innovation again a greater level of uncertainty greater level of risk and that actually requires often long-standing relationships something sort of from this space on what the public sector is typically not very good at procuring um because it requires that long-term collaboration and then the top half the very top one there is where we really want to procure partnership so the classic ppp model where ppps we know always fail when there's too much risk involved but uh particularly actually we want to really create a shared business understanding and we want to procure and institute strategic partnerships with our suppliers in the supply chain about procuring some of those now so you can imagine that i find this particularly helpful to ask the question particularly to owner operators of are you do you know what you're procuring therefore do you know what the risk is involved and what that that means for your procurement strategy and different types of procurement because you can get it wrong to be on the top right hand side and i think this chart might be a little bit unhelpful because you know i'm from a business school so the top right corner is always the best so what we see there is that building those kind of relationships having those key supplies in your ecosystem that is a lot of work that is a lot of bandwidth where on the other side if it's just the product it's just the product traffic cones it's just a traffic cone right so and similarly for suppliers in the supply chain you can make good money in any of these configurations and the the worst thing is if you're trying to create or sort of look at a level of uncertainty and your relationship and sort of your approach to that kind of procurement isn't aligned with that or you might be over investing in terms of sales even sort of in the way we are going through procurement exercises in uh you might be over investing in what you're doing say for instance in australia i've recently seen because of doing some work and research there standard past and parcel of a lot of that kind of partnership style alliancing procurement is almost hr assessment center styles behavioral interviews where of a joint venture the leadership of the joint venture the operational leadership of the future joint venture needs to come in and goes through war games and scenarios and each of the shortlisted bidders goes through these scenarios and it takes a week so they come in for three full days they're not allowed to bring any lawyers just for the client to then select the people that they think as a gv have figured out how to work together and how to make decisions together so a massive amount of investment there and the procurement thing when on the left-hand side in the transactional space you would have much leaner much meaner procurement processes much more focused on different elements than say for instance ability to jointly solve problems um in our recent case studies and this is very much driven by looking into what's happening in the world in singapore hong kong the uk and australia so this is where we drew our case studies from particularly looking around this instant office and how do we how do projects create value and how do procurement and commercial arrangement create values here's a couple of those success factors that we see in terms of what does successful partnering look like when we're in that space where we want to share risk we might not even fully understand the total value of risk but have to explore that space together with our suppliers and this whole divide between you know just one side of the contract is another side of the contract becomes a lot less murky and diverse um so and one of the things here is that i kind of you know you see these things and often well the punch line is it's actually about relationships so the contractual form the commercial form that you're creating is is sort of underlying that is building the foundation but or providing sort of a basic cushion but it's not the foundation so you have to have that relationship particularly that trust between contracting parties the shared framework of value is established first and then that becomes sort of the guiding thought and the guiding principles by which you're executing the spirit of the contract rather than the words of the contracts and that is is very interesting and also like to really point out here so points three and four on my list which is the particular question about risk ultimately risk particularly once you are differentiating between risk and uncertainties and the liabilities for that often the liabilities flow back to the client and the owner operator the principle of the contractual arrangements and and that comes often also with a lot of responsibilities we do see that many jurisdictions many clients placing more contracts where they are taking more of the role of the active system integrators and we're seeing the typical procurement of going with big turnkey contracts that being diminished also driven by market developments in the last five years where we do see that if you want to place a lot of risk into the markets the risk carrying capability of a lot of engineering construction company isn't that great anymore and projects at particular big size carry a lot of risk and you other than the bacterials of this world you find very very few companies of a balance sheet large enough to really carry large amounts of risk so there are some of those things if you place this in sort of the the wider research and i always like to highlight this because this comes from stuff some some folks who kind of whose research you often don't particularly look at as economists because you know we like to sing exposed ex-army uh and then define our baselines but what actually happens in between so this is a study from uh my adaptation of a study from giuliano danny cool at university college london who has basically done a lot of kind of the literature review very systematic literature review and anything that we know about major large-scale construction projects and the success and failures of those and this is kind of a systems of systems analysis and as i just said isn't sort of what our research shows is really that a lot about is that decision making quality at entry and we are particularly found a very fruitful ground to explore the behavioral economics side of these things but i do think when we think about future research there is a lot more to be done in terms of trust in terms of relationship and the relationship between contracting parties that is that remains to be explored we in our world we often look at sort of what are good contracting approaches called contracting models so there's a question here for me isn't how does that fit in with wider strategic considerations so more of the operational strategy strategic conservation organizational development strategic consideration of owner operators so how does that fit together i think we talked enough about risk and uncertainty and how we can think about allocations sharing mitigations but also thinking differently about on the one hand that liability and the actual managerial so on the one side here we have liability consideration on the other side we have active risk mitigations what we can do about that and then of course you see some of the other things which is a big element around politics we know that politics exists uh we are seeing i'm seeing kind of very exciting research coming out of stakeholder management and engagement consideration and then there's of course something that when we're talking to suppliers and construction industry what they're particularly interested in is around so how can we get more into the space of excuse my about drawing on this little chart here around manufacturing more digitization better systems integration upskilling more innovations around the programmatic tools and the systems we use and the procedures that are placed once you know we're in contract but also some of the commercials that govern how the supply chain itself work together particularly around that element of system integration and how we see changes in the role of the owner operator and the system integrator so that's what i kind of wanted to leave you with as a summary when i look at the research and we look at the research here there's a lot of work that has been done there's a lot more work to be done in terms of how can we get that decision quality at entry up uh we know that the psychologists have been really great at raising the awareness of some of those decision traps have provided us with great checklists there are some there's great power and data and as economists we're really good at data and so there's great power and data to help with that and then when we're looking at the value control what happens after final investment decision in my oversimplified model no offense dejan is done around us and sort of what can we see when we're thinking about procurement in a broader consideration than just cost so what we're seeing at the moment big trends towards sustainability procuring for value procuring for behaviors and also then how we deal with risk and uncertainties in these kind of different settings i think there's a lot of conundrums still to be solved
