i'd i'd like to talk about uh vaccine financing um you know there are obviously many other important questions about r d and pandemics on diagnostics therapeutics uh non-pharmaceutical interventions uh but but the area that i've been working on is vaccine so we'll we'll present that and as jim's uh indicated i've been working on this for a while so rather than just present one paper i thought i'd try to discuss a few different papers and i'll do it a bit uh sequentially okay start by talking about some work prior to the covert 19 pandemic on ways to incentivize r d on vaccines then talk about the work that we did early in the pandemic when we just had candidate vaccines and we didn't know if any of them would work then talk about things after vaccine approval and finally i'll conclude by talking about some research on preparing for for future pandemics okay um so um rachel glennister and i laid out the idea for a technique called advanced market commitments in our book strong medicine and we propose that donors commit in advance uh to help finance the purchases of vaccines if they're developed and if they pass certain technical standards and if countries agreed to effectively pay a copay for this um and that type of commitment can both provide an incentive for the development of vaccines and ensure that if vaccines are developed um that they'll be able to reach people and you know our book focused on malaria and hiv so we were thinking about target you know vaccines that are needed for for very low hiv obviously affects both high and low income countries but overwhelmingly the the cases are in low-income countries so uh cases these are cases where you really have to worry about access um i was um i was you know partly based on this work was asked to join a working group at the center for global development to think about how can we move from sort of the the abstract idea the academic idea to something that could actually be be implemented and um you know the desire um you know a lot of on the political side although we had focused on sort of long run targets people wanted a quicker win and so we recommended both going for a short run and a longer run target now that what was wound up being funded by a group of donors um was a 1.5 billion commitment for an vaccine against the strains of pneumococcus which are common in low and middle income countries so there were already vaccines against pneumococcus for the strains common in high income countries but more work needed to be done to develop a vaccine against the strains in low-income countries and this was uh formally launched in 2009 two vaccines were developed and now we have a third and you know 200 million children have been vaccinated and it's estimated that 700 000 lives have been saved um so um and we actually you know with chris and with john chris snyder and john levin uh we actually happened to just before the pandemic write a retrospective on what was the what was the evidence on this um and it looked like there was much faster rollout to low-income countries than normal it normally can take a decade for for things to diffuse from high income countries to low-income countries for new vaccines this moved much more quickly we we argued that we learned something uh that uh from this experience that it probably made sense to tie advanced market commitment funds more closely to capacity commitments to get a large-scale capacity out there and probably to bring down the the country co-payments and we argued that it made sense to try advanced market commitments more broadly including for more technologically distant uh targets um so early in the in the pandemic before the vaccines when we just had candidate vaccines very early on i was contacted by the council of economic advisors and they were interested in could we use this approach for covet and you formed a you know a group of of economists um that we called the accelerated health technologies group to help think about this request and that included a number of nbr affiliates susan athey eric buddish scott commoners christopher snyder who was very involved in the in the the first amc and we tried to try to think through some of the issues one of our early starting points was the immense losses due to covet 19 creates a huge premium for speed so we're losing just in short run gdp costs alone 500 billion globally uh from coba 19 and the full losses are much much larger so cutlers and summers estimate just for the u.s alone it's 890 billion dollars per month and while vaccine is uh vaccine investment is difficult and expensive uh the costs of that pay all in comparison to the uh to the cost of the economy of coba and to obviously to our health on lives so let me give a little bit of background on on vaccine production so most vaccine candidates fail there's multiple different platforms technological approaches firms tend to be specialized in these and even countries tend to be specialized you know the us was uh very advanced mrna vaccines china had specialization in in sort of much more standard production there's a saying in the industry that the process is the product for vaccines so it's very different than small molecules than drugs you know there somebody can if you know the formula you can create a generic you know i don't want to claim it's easy but it's it's not i can't do it but uh you know there are firms that specialize in it can do it vaccines are very different what's what the regulatory authorities approve is not you know a molecule or something like that it's actually the process it's the individual factory and every step needs you need to develop special testing procedures for each step in the process and get those approved so it's a very complicated process intellectual property is not doesn't play the same role that it does in in drugs it also takes a lifetime to build out capacity you can't put together a factory overnight um it and there were questions about capacity constraints you know there um a lot of people would argue there's no way you can speed up this process you can't get that much new capacity there you know economists tend to think that maybe this if you throw enough money at something if you create big enough incentives that uh that we can get you know more production and you know that was the attitude of our team and i think we but clearly there's also something to the pure engineering perspective that there are limits to that probably much more elasticity in the long run okay typically typical process this takes three to four years um and um of course even after things have approved and uh and the capacity is there you know there's a risk of production delays there's a risk you find side effects it's a very tricky business to be in so one thing that you know we really emphasize is that the commercial incentives to install early before the trials have been done uh you know that's a very risky thing to do and to install at the sufficient scale are much less than the social value so we estimated the you know this was a more recent estimate we estimate the marginal social value of additional vaccine capacity you know at thousands of dollars per course for you know annual course of production i know of course that you can produce but in a pandemic there are social constraints there's on profiteering you know this think of these as ethical constraints some firms said they're doing this um you know non-profit basis but there's also just sort of political and legal constraints so the current prices range from six dollars to forty dollars per course of vaccine and that creates a case that huge gap between the private incentives and the social value creates a case for public support for early and large-scale capacity installation so um you know we did some put together you know pretty crude but um but nonetheless a model to try and think about what type of investment makes sense um and the results from that suggest that it makes sense to invest in a wide portfolio of candidates so you have many shots of gold we actually assumed to took our figures from the historical success rate of vaccines i i would argue we've actually been incredibly lucky we've had a much higher success rate than with covent thank goodness uh but we took our figures from the historical success rate so then you want many different shots on goal many different possible vaccine candidates and diversify the type of candidates across these different platforms it makes sense for to invest in very large scale capacity as well if you can even do that maybe you run into supply constraints but you know governments should try to invest this should be done in parallel with trials rather than waiting for the trials to be done it makes sense you know we did this calculation for the u.s but then it's very easy to do it for other countries as well and a striking finding is this didn't just make sense for the us or europe it makes sense for you know the middle income countries in latin america and even for low-income countries to invest although at different scales so for the u.s it's optimal to try a whole bunch of different candidates even pretty low probability ones and to build out a lot of capacity for a low-income country they can only afford to take uh take the you know to invest or you know at risk in the most most likely candidates and the ones that are you know more affordable okay let me mention that the finding that very different scales of investment so if we again i'm looking at this from a just a straight economics perspective uh from the standpoint of national interest when i say that the the different uh investment levels for different countries um but i think that has implications for incentive compatibility and what sort of global system we set up so some of the early proposals for kovacs the global uh global effort on on vaccines were you know they would say look we're gonna they've had a lot of emphasis on equity you know the low-income countries are going to get it at the same rate as the high-income countries and they're going to and they actually put in provisions that if you were a high-income country and you bought on your own then you would have to not you wouldn't get your allocation from from kovacs that but they were looking for financing from high-income countries and i think one of the lessons is you know i wish yeah i wish people were uh took a more um global perspective on this but i think we have to be realistic democratic i don't think this is just um you know uh the politicians you think of as most nationalistic a democratically elected politician is going to be have very strong incentives when they're losing seven percent of gdp and you know hundreds of thousands of lives to focus on their on their uh first on their on their on their domestic population um i'll come back to later to implications for the international system and how we can organize things perhaps better for next time um but you know our analysis suggests it would be very hard to make that sort of very strong restriction on what high-income countries can do make that actually work um and that it's probably better to structure things to ask for financial contributions from high-income countries but not ask them to restrict their vaccine use okay there were also a lot of implications for contract design so actually somewhat in contrast to the advanced market commitment idea they do what's done for co for covet is also called an event's market commitment and there's some aspects of that idea that have been used you know a few that are being used for uh for covet but we would write we recommended something that was a bit different um the advanced market commitment the original one for pneumococcus the rewards were only you only got paid if you produced a successful vaccine for pneumococcus because happy to discuss this more later but it looked like the optimal design was to have still some combination of push and pull but rely much more on push i am upfront funded um and that had to do with the great you know relatively easier to observe capacity installation costs and relatively difficult to observe probability of success together with the fact that you want many shots on goal you don't just want to fund the best candidate um we argued that it makes sense to include explicit provisions on capacity um you know broadly defined not just the equipment but you know the acute quality control capacity the human capacity etc in the contracts you know if you think about hiring a contractor for your home you know you know that they may be late and that that's you know and that once you're in the contract it's hard to do anything about it i don't think you'll get to perfectly solve that problem but at a minimum you should include some some milestones for capacity uh uh putting capacity in place i say construction it's often uh repurposing um the also we argued that it was important to invest in supply chains and again there are multiple reasons for this double marginalization and so on i think the biggest one is that the market signals that are not going to pass through appropriately during the pandemic when there are restrictions on on really raising your prices when something's in shortage and that means that you could have a situation where you offer to buy the end product but the uh of the but then the vaccine manufacturers can't get the inputs they use even if hypothetically it would be worth it from a social point of view to construct new factories or uh to produce the intermediate goods but that those those would only be profitable if they were amateur amortized over a very long period of time and there's a risk that that wouldn't be the case so it makes sense to directly finance the supply chain capacity okay let me say a little bit about um you know mid pandemic after vaccines were approved i'll skip this slide um the oh gosh i'm over skipping that side uh let me just tell you what we found um okay sorry i'll keep this sorry i won't go over this slide look these are we said what's the value of an additional 1 billion courses of annual capacity you could also think of this as what's the value to uh of additional capacity of an additional unit of annual capacity and you can see this varies a lot uh according to the the you know scenario but if you it's would it's much more valuable if we got this in april than if we got this in july this is from a article that came out in science um the um but it's still very valuable even if it even if you got brought this capacity online by july the um if you think that there's four billion doses of of uh capacity already and you know it could be less that varies every day depending on what's happening with production problems and and side effects uh but it's still worth 257 per unit of annual capacity and one other thing i would note is that the benefits of of more capacity i've argued from an efficiency point of view that we want more capacity it's also great from an equity point of view basically what you're doing is you're shortening the queue so if you think that it's going to be two years till the world's vaccinated and you double production then it's one year for somebody at the front of the queue that doesn't make much difference for somebody at the back of the queue that makes a big difference so we see that this would speed up vaccination in this example only by you know half a month uh for the low income country for the high income countries but for you know two and a half months for the world and that's um and you might think is it really worth spending a lot of money for that well the answer is yes because every month makes such a big difference even though these are uh you know you might have to spend billions on on vaccine capacity but that's worth it when uh when the world's losing 500 billion a month okay um okay now that said um it's now getting later and later and given the lag times it's gonna this is getting harder and harder we would still support more capacity um there is questions of you know how much more capacity is is even out there um but the current work we're doing suggests that there may be very big gains from another strategy which is finding ways to use existing capacity more efficiently and we've seen that some with first doses first increasing the policies increasing the spacing between doses the uk has done that um you know the original tests were done with three weeks they're doing three months that looks like it's been very successful um let me we're you know part of our paper talks about those strategies but i'm going to suggest something beyond that or at least exploring something belong that you know there's a lot of uncertainty around the optimal regimen and optimal dose normally you're looking for the thing that benefits the individual patient or you know this is a circumstance with shortages and in shortages the socially optimal dose might be much less than the individually optimal dose add to that that we don't really know they were moving very quickly they don't test every possible you know there's some pre-testing but you know it's very limited uh particularly in these circumstances we don't really know what the right dose is you know brazil used one-fifth doses to stop a yellow fever epidemic in 2018 with recommendations from the world health organization and there's you know some evidence that could work for coba 19 now the first dose there's actually you know there's a famous mistake with astrazeneca where they um they gave accidentally gave a half dose um that you know it's a bit confounded with some other factors so it's not clear but there's um but there's reason it looked just as effective uh with pfizer and moderna there's there's also some some evidence for this um uh you know not that it will work but that it might work okay we put together a standard epidemiological model and looked at the impact of fractional dosing so the top row in red shows what the impact would be if you don't if you don't if you don't lose anything relative to a full dose with 95 efficacy and you could see if you could you know if you could double the number of if you get two doses for every dose you know you roughly cut in half the number of deaths if there's no loss and efficacy which is a you know potential scenario but let me note that for small efficacy losses even even a small increase in in vaccination speed makes this beneficial so let's say let me actually just focus on you know half doses so you've had half dose and you could double the number of doses uh because you're only using half as much uh you know substance um then that would let's say that reduced efficacy to 80 then what you would be doing is you'd save roughly a quarter of the lives that were losing to the epidemic and you'd have a much bigger impact on infections the the infection impact is bigger than the death impact now a half dose would would produce gains unless the efficacy is you know below 70 a quarter dose would produce gains unless the efficacy falls below 50 percent um the what what we would take from that is that it's worth experimenting um so there's huge option value of testing fractional dosing and you could do adaptive testing you could start by just examining the immune response do you get the immune response some of that's been done already and looks positive but you don't need a full-scale phase three trial you could embed this in vaccine rollout so you wouldn't need to deliver uh delay delivery there's low risk because the safety is already tested in fact to the extent that there's concern about side effects you'll probably you know you'll move that down a little bit there's actually a trial we just found out a couple of days ago that a trial started in belgium but uh i think we would want to try this with multiple vaccines multiple different veg regimens you know half dose quarter dose three-quarters dose different doses you know half dose for you know the first or the second and try this against multiple variants you know the potential of this is you could dramatically speed up the timeline of the world being vaccinated with huge benefits for uh for health and huge benefits for the economy and and the social outcomes more generally the private incentives for this for this testing are much less than the social value because even if the firm could cut the dose in half and change charge the same amount for each half dose the social value the private value of selling a dose is much much less than the social value i also note the national value of this is much less than the global value so no even from an individual country basis no country has has sufficient incentives to do it how that said you know talking to experts um i think this could be done quite inexpensively and so you know i think it's actually a realistically possible to try this so that in some ways that would be my top part you know trying to do some testing of this would be top policy recommendation uh for for dealing with covet right now okay on i'm preparing for future pandemics you know one bit of this is is so i've been a member of a g20 panel or panel which is advising the g20 which the g20 asked ngozi and larry summers and a former singapore finance minister to charge to chair um and they're trying to make proposals to the g20 on pandemic preparedness which again is much much wider than vaccines but i think some of the lessons from our analysis are are relevant um the during the pandemic you need to really rapidly expand capacity for many different candidates and that requires a lot of different inputs so i think it's important to keep stockpiles on hand and standby capacity on hand for production of vaccines and for production of the intermediate goods i don't think you can expect firms to do this just based on private incentives because they're going to expect limits on pricing during a pandemic so there's a sort of straightforward case for governments helping cover the cost of maintaining the standby capacity in stockpiles but i'd argue that there's a another case which is more subtle and that's relates to maintaining the international trade system during pandemics you know no country not even the u.s can read should should rely uh on entirely on domestic candidates in the supply chain you know right now pfizer that's relying on a german developed uh a partnership between pfizer and a german firm but more broadly we really need to keep international trade during a pandemic going you know maybe the u.s could sort of manage we wouldn't have the full spectrum of technologies available to us things could have turned out very differently instead of so many vaccine candidates so many different platforms succeeding could have been the chinese vaccine worked and ours didn't or or or vice versa you want access to the globe and that's for the u.s if you think about you know the france italy australia canada peru zambia it's clear most countries are going to rely on that but when they're short if the price if there's a shortage you know everything we know about you know principles of economics in the third week of the semester you know if you put on price controls a whole bunch of things start happening and one of them will be the true value of these vaccines are immense in a pandemic countries are going to be tempted to put on export restrictions and we've seen that and to hoard vaccines which some people argue the us is doing right now it's going to be very difficult to address that through moral persuasion that was sort of the incentive compatibility point i was making earlier so we need to think about this as a game and think about how we change countries incentives and i think the best way to change their incentives is to build up the stockpiles and standpie capacity and then the incentives to impose the export restrictions and to hoard vaccines will be much weaker if you don't do that then countries are going to expect are going to question whether they're going to be able to get access to to vaccine strain pandemics they're all going to try to go it alone we still won't have enough uh uh capacity with that and likely we'll get a bunch of export restrictions efforts to hoard vaccines with the real ages which would be a extremely in both inefficient and inequitable outcome um you know we need both national efforts to try to have these stockpiles in standby capacity but i also think there's an important role for global efforts not just for the low-income countries but also so that we can avoid the collapse of the international trading system thanks very much
