so let me just set the stage a bit to say what is the question we're interested in um it is how many additional deaths occurred uh during coven 19 uh at least during the first year which i'm going to date from march of 2020 which is when we saw the first significant deaths in the u.s from kobet through february of 2021. now you might just ask why can't we just count up the number of deaths that have been attributed to covet and and that's our answer there's a couple of reasons for that um first uh there's particularly early in the epidemic some deaths might not have been attributed to covet where it really was the cause later on it's even possible that some deaths were attributed to covet but actually other things were more important but the more important piece of that is that there are indirect effects which could either raise or lower deaths so for example we have evidence that early in the pandemic people weren't going to the emergency room for other conditions for fear of getting infected and so for example if you had a heart attack and delayed going to the emergency room you might die of a heart attack where you wouldn't have otherwise and there's a whole host of other things that could be going on some of which we'll talk about on the other hand some kinds of deaths might have actually fallen so for example influenza deaths flu deaths probably fell at least initially because people were social distancing they were being so much more careful about infections so we need to to sort of take all these things into account so the basic idea here is we want to count up excess deaths and that's very simple this this is as much math as i'm going to give you today but excess deaths e are equal to actual actual deaths minus the number you would have expected if cobia 19 hadn't occurred the problem here is and there's a little bit of difficulty sometimes measuring actual deaths very quickly but that's a minor issue the big one is how do we know what the counterfactual is that that is how do we figure out how many deaths there would have been if if we hadn't had the pandemic and that turns out to be quite a complicated issue it's one that i i spent quite a lot of time on uh in this project in fact initially this is this is the first step for some additional work i wanted to do looking at um how we separate sort of pandemic versus recession effects but to get that or to get other kinds of things like that we need to know how many excess deaths there were so i started out taking a very simple idea we just essentially inflate the prior year's deaths by say population growth that turned out not to work out well at all for a variety of reasons so i've adopted a different approach and one of the things that this has allowed me is to come up with i think some ways we can tell if our estimates are plausible and so at the end of this talk i'll say a few words about some of the prior estimates and why i think maybe we need to be careful about trusting them but so the goals here are first to to measure to quantify the number of these excess deaths and and we'll do that also as a percentage increase or share increase over the baseline look at differences by uh demographic characteristics like sex and race and age and also look at different causes of deaths and then i'll also present information on the share of these deaths that are being attributed to coven 19. so so if 100 of the of the excess deaths were covered in 19 that would say all the additional deaths are due to the due to the virus itself and none for any other reasons but we're going to find that that's not true there is some additional uh there are there are some additional sources that are going to be quite relevant for us as i mentioned there's some methodological improvements i believe um and in particular i'm going to argue it's valuable to compare this baseline number the counter factual expected number of deaths to the actual number of deaths in the prior year that'll give us some information whether we're getting plausible estimates or not and so i'll say a bit about that as we go on so i'm going to be using a variety of data sources i'm not going to say much about them but primarily the the key ones here are centers for disease control and prevention data on mortality rates earlier on and more recently they've put out provisional death counts uh a whole series of those that we'll use to get the the the more recent information there's some limitations of those that that well you can look at the working paper if you're interested in seeing about that okay so just let me start with a an issue that turned out turned up uh that i have not seen discussed in the prior estimates of excess deaths and that is um we have a big year-over-year difference in year-over-year changes and monthly deaths so in any given say in any given june there's going to be some number of deaths that we can compare to the prior year typically for most months we get these are increases here we'll get an increase of three to four thousand uh deaths relative to the prior year and if you think about it that makes perfect sense populations going up there's some population aging and so forth what i want you to note here is to look at month one that's january the mean is a little bit higher than other months not not hugely though it's about four thousand but the standard deviation is enormous so in most months we're talking about uh standard deviations on the order of you know a couple thousand maybe three thousand versus january it's twenty one thousand it's huge there's this huge variation there's actually some of that excess volatility in um in december and february as well but much less so one of the things i i do in this is to try to make some adjustments for that excess volatility in january um now the other thing to point out here is if you look at the actual changes in deaths so these are changes in deaths relative to the prior year and in everything i talk about here a year is actually going to refer to a march through february period and that's done since march 2020 through february 2021 is the first year of the covet pandemic and i'm not sure how easy it is to see these numbers but but these are telling you uh the percentage changes relative to the prior year and what i want you to notice here is that a couple of things first if you look at the left hand column here these are the actual changes they're positive in uh in most years so so if we're looking at over this ten year period in eight of the ten years they're positive but they actually vary quite a lot the the right hand column here shows you when i do this adjustment for the excess january volatility which helps a lot uh but we still have a lot of volatility uh or a lot of variance in the in the actual changes we observe over time why is this important the reason this matters is it tells you that this counter factual that we're going to come up with we're not going to estimate it that precisely we're going to have fairly large confidence intervals and and actually when we look at specific causes or groups they're even larger uh it there's also an implication that if we're looking at some of the earlier estimates where they have very tight confidence intervals they're actually not very credible because there just is this large variance that we can't perfectly explain so that'll be relevant as we go forward okay so just very quickly i'm not going to spend a lot of time on this but if we look at the methods here the strategy is to regress these adjusted mortality counts so these are adjusted for that excess january volatility on time trends and these can be linear or quadratic time trends and what i do here is i allow the the period to vary the starting year can vary anywhere between 2009 and 2016 and i'll estimate linear and also quadratic time trends and then choose the model that has the best fit so once i have that best fitting model i'm going to use it to project the pandemic year baseline deaths these expected deaths the counter factual and then the excess deaths are simply the actual number versus that minus that expected number um and then i can also look to make sure that these these uh baseline death estimates are in the range of what we would expect to see from prior historical changes and that's actually what this what this graph here does what this figure does um and all the only point i want to make here i'll make two points one is they're generally they they look pretty good so if you look at the historical changes over this ten year previous period those are the the ones in in blue or purple whatever that is and compare them to the actual changes we see the baseline in 2020 versus the previous year that the orange they're in the same general ballpark as each other so that suggests that they the estimates are going to pass this plausibility test i do want to point out that there's a some of these have very wide confidence intervals like look at the the flu and pneumonia you can see here the actual that that's that's this one here i don't know if you can see what i'm marking here there's a huge confidence interval going from quite strongly positive to extremely strongly negative and that comes about simply because when we look at things like flu seasonal flu variation there's enormous variation across years and again that's going to make it hard to accurately uh predict or i should say to precisely predict the baseline estimate for uh for 2020. okay so now let me get to some of the actual numbers there's a lot of numbers here you know basically these are things you can look at at your leisure or or go to the working paper and i'm going to show you some pictures in just a minute but just to to set the stage um in in the march 2020 through february 2021 period there were about three and a half million deaths um that's about 650 thousand a little bit less um more than we would then uh we would have expected at baseline and about uh 500 and uh just under 540 000 of those were directly attributed to covet the one other set of numbers i'll point out here is if you look at the age greater than 65 group those account for the vast majority of both actual and excess deaths uh which is not surprising we know you know it's it's the seniors who who die the most and and are hit the most by cobin that's going to be relevant as we go forward and look at uh kind of the the percentage differences in actual deaths versus expected deaths we might see big differences in some of the other numbers but but just to point out it's not a small base okay so this is showing you um the share of excess deaths uh relative to expected deaths by group and let me be clear because i think the title here might be slightly unclear what i'm looking at so a number what we see for like all deaths is a number like 1.22 what that says is there's 22 percent more to actual deaths than we would have expected so there so there's 22 percent excess deaths uh essentially in that year that's that's for all individuals um and you can see these rates so a ratio greater than one is indicating that you have some excess deaths which is what we generally are going to expect for every group we see that um that the ratios are are greater than one and considerably greater than one uh what what is quite interesting here though is when you look for example across race ethnicity groups you see very large numbers of excess tests very proportionately large numbers of excess deaths for blacks and and particularly hispanics and other races on the other hand there's actually um a relatively small number of ex percentage of excess deaths for the under 25 year olds compared to the older individuals now that's not a complete surprise when you think about it because individuals under 25 have not been at major risk of dying directly from coven we are going to see they are at risk from some other things as we come up so we'll get to that in just a moment so so that's this is showing you the uh the ratio of actual deaths to what we would have expected uh based on prior uh based on our counter or based on prior history now if we look at what percentage of these excess deaths are due to covid you see something quite interesting so the overall number here is about 83 percent this is a plus or minus a confidence interval but the estimate is about 83 of all excess deaths are attributed to covid uh i should say that number is considerably higher than many of the other estimates that are out there and the reason for that and i'll say more about this later probably is that those other s those other excess death estimates i think have often um understated the baseline number of deaths and so overstated the total number of excess deaths but then when we look at groups here what you see is um that that again for blacks and hispanics and other races a fairly large share of their excess deaths are not directly attributed to covet they're to other kinds of things and we see that really sharply here for the less than 25 year olds remember i mentioned they didn't have a huge percentage of excess deaths but among those deaths that do occur very few of them are due to covet and we'll see when we look at causes some of the things they might be related to okay so this is showing you um selected causes of death and again i'm not going to dwell on this table because i'm going to show you a picture but i will mention a few things here so the number one cause of deaths is is heart disease we know that there are about 700 000 in um in in this one year period about 33 000 excess deaths as we go down i want because i'm going to say a lot as we uh continue about some of the external causes of deaths but i want to note that the the absolute numbers of deaths are much smaller so we're looking at a much smaller base there all right so let me show you what this looks like in terms of a picture so these are showing you the excess deaths by cause as a ratio again of the of the baseline so essentially this is total deaths divided by baseline divided by our counter factual so for heart disease we have 1.05 that means there were five percent more deaths than we would have expected without the pandemic and so you see for a lot of these these are not generally huge numbers uh they vary for for example diabetes is actually is actually quite large i mean that's on the order of uh 15 they're really some of the really interesting ones though are some of these external causes of death so let me point out a few of them if you look at drug deaths drug deaths are on the order of 30 percent above what we would have expected and um this is where my research is continuing a big chunk of this is likely to be do a recession effect we know when the economy doesn't do as well uh drug deaths increase fairly dramatically so that could be part of the story there homicide deaths also have increased uh quite dramatically so we're talking on the order of you know 25 percent or so um above the uh above the counter factual number quite interestingly though suicides are actually below what we would have expected um and this is relevant you know there's a lot of discussion of deaths of despair and people will group things like drugs and suicides and alcohol or certain kinds of alcohol deaths if you look here suicides are following a very different pattern than drug deaths they're declining that's a bit of a mystery it may partly be that actually suicide started declining even earlier in 2019 and maybe we're not fully capturing that but what it does tell us that if you if you read the media reports there's a lot of uh a belief that uh that suicides in mental health generally have have gotten much worse during the pandemic and we're not seeing evidence of it here the last one i'll point out which is also quite interesting is that vehicle fatalities have increased fairly significantly now that's a surprise because usually during economic downturns vehicle fatalities fall and fall sharply and we know that miles driven fell particularly uh particularly at the beginning of the pandemic because you would have expected vehicle fatalities to have fallen the fact that they haven't uh suggests that that risky driving increased so so there's certainly at least anecdotal and maybe maybe harder evidence than that that people were on empty roads and they and they were speeding you know they were driving really fast or driving recklessly and so that might be the the cause of that okay so just to briefly summarize what have we learned there were there were something over six hundred thousand excess deaths during the first year of covid uh and again i hate the the paper discusses it's in a lot of a lot more detail than i have here but it's likely that prior many of the prior estimates actually overstated this number and also the coverage share of these deaths and then that occurred because they were probably underestimating baseline deaths um i think in in work generally on this issue and more generally if we're going to look at excess death calculations this notion of comparing your counter factual to what actually occurred in the previous year that gives you a good plausibility check that i think is important going forward as i mentioned there were particularly large increases for non-whites uh that that was known but i think less well understood has been the fact that we had these increases in drug and homicide deaths while suicide deaths have declined so why don't i stop there and thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk with you and i hope you but we'll go look at the working paper for more details
