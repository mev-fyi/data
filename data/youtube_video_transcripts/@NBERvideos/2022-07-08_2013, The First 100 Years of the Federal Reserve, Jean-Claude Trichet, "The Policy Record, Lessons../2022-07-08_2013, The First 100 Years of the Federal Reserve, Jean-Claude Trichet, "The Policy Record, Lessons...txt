thank you very very much indeed i think it's a marvelous privilege to be in front of so many friends and brains if i may and i thank the organizers for this uh opportunity i have also to say that the ricardo paper was a tool the force because it seems to me that he covered absolutely everything and commenting and discussing on such a paper is really very very difficult i have been during eight years the chair of an institution which is if i count well uh 14 and a half years old or even perhaps 15 if i count the creation six months before it became operational and of course it humbles in front of a hundred years old institution and it reminds me the say that good decisions come from experience and that experience comes from that decision which we had not much time to make so many bad decisions but let me say that i am very impressed by the candied way that you are examining your past with an approach which is so again so candid it's very very impressive i have four points commenting on ricardo paper that i would like to make one on the fed role in active cooperation between central banks the second on on the nature of unconventional quantitative measures the third on what i would call the conceptual convergence at a global level in which the fed plays a decisive role and the last point uh short reflection on independence very rapidly on the first point i have participated in all g7 g10 global economy meetings that we had in basel between central banks or with executive branches and i have to say that not only the very and decisive way of the fed to be an active participant but the simplicity and the kindness if i may bend in front of you of the representative of the fed alan bill roger yourself and when you take the helm don tim janet bill and i should cut many many others i think it was decisive in creating an atmosphere of intense cooperation intense and simple easy communication which appeared decisive in the crisis that crisis to me was probably worse than what started in 29 because the unfolding of the crisis was so rapid we could really see the house of cards collapsing under our eyes the counterfactual is very difficult to to make of course as always which creates an enormous difficulty to defend what you've been doing but i i was the testimony of what has been done since the very beginning of the crisis and it's very impressive i will ever remember ben when you pointed your finger on me at the beginning of 10 and you were telling me jean-claude now it's your turn meaning the epicenter of the crisis cross the atlantic you have the epicenter of the crisis now and you were pretty white and still still are probably the epicenter is still there one minute on the reflection on on the nature of the unconventional quantitative measure i uh first of all we did not practice the same tools and again i have to say very very clearly financing of the united states of america economy 80 market 20 banks financing of the european economy 80 banks 20 market so everybody should have that in mind when we compare both i would say the the banks themselves and when we compare the action on market not surprisingly the fed concentrated on the unconventional measures very much on market not surprisingly we concentrated very much on banks and our way of uh do it being unconventional was for from the very beginning in first the very beginning was the 9th of august 2007 provided a limited liquidity at fixed rate the fixed rate at the time was four percent and we went through the the the bank so i i say that because i think it's very important we have a tendency to forget that and compare what we were doing without understanding that for us banks were decisive now let me only say one word i would be more perhaps in the camp of ricardo than in the camp of ireland for once because generally i'm very close to you alan but i would say that clearly i prefer personally to consider that the quantitative measures whether ours or yours are very much designed to counter abnormal functioning of markets disruption of markets abnormal functioning of counterparts all over the financial sphere and are not pursuing necessary pursuing policy when you are the zero lower bound by other means and i see a lot of good reasons for that to introduce some kind of separation principle it seems to me that you have yourself this separation principle when you say the interest rates are one thing and we have quantitative indicators for the or target for the for the uh conventional measures the unconventional measures are of a different nature i don't insist on that but uh if i have a message it would be that perhaps even the two are mixed i would say the paradigm i have a preference for might be uh useful third point conceptual convergence i will not insist we have seen a formidable evolution of the concept of inflation targeting which has moved towards medium term medium long term which by the way ricardo helps considerably to reconcile the level of price and inflation we have differential price stability in the medium term ourselves which was less than two close to two uh as a matter of fact after 14 years we were at 2.03 percent which means that the level of prices was fully in line with that definition i see of course an enormous convergence with the us when ben said for me price stability is two or slightly less than two i see the japanese joining enormous convergence in terms of differential price stability enormous convergence in terms of banking supervision enormous convergence also in terms of communication even if there are still some differences but i would say that we we converged a lot and i take that positively of course in the worst crisis ever since world war ii which could have been the worst crisis ever since of the advanced economy since world war one in my own understanding now last point there i know that i am in a very very i would say complex conceptual universe i am encouraged by paul saying i am not in favor of the dual mandate full stop so let me let me say that the the dual mandate that i of course i agree with nancy that it's very complex the main problem i see frankly speaking is that if there is such thing as as a short-term medium-term and long-term no perhaps not a long-term trade-off perhaps we all agree on on the long-term trade-off but if there is such a such thing like a pertinent trade-off then is it thinkable that the political branches legislative and executive give that responsibility to make the arbitrage to a group of of course very wise persons but nevertheless not mandated politically so i have i have a problem there of course the reality is the reality and it it remains complex to understand fully the phillips curve but the i would say theory which is the theory that most central bank frankly speaking still have namely that medium-term price stability is a condition which is necessary but of course not sufficient to deliver growth and job creation in the medium run i prefer that because then you have the two goals but one is more or less a necessary and not sufficient precondition for the other and of course i would have a real problem ricardo with the three mandates because then we are really asking the open market committee or any monetary policy council to decide in the place of you know all political institutions and it seems to me that it's difficult to imagine and of course it might create a problem explicit problem of of independence now let me only mention in conclusion oh i have still one minute and either i don't count the first exclamation point the second one and the third one that i know now what exquisite courtesy is uh practice here so let me only say that our own experience of central bankers is that you you have of course the political institution but you have more than that you have you have your own country you have the public opinion at large the men and women in the street the fellow citizens and it seems to me that in any case even fully independent you have this accountability which is not the accountability to the private sector or accountability to the market participants but a very profound democratic accountability and it seems to me that this is something i experienced myself because as chair of the ecb i had people that were that had not the same way of looking at things not necessarily so being the single central bank of various public opinion that had not yet fully converged was really a formidable experience if i may but i felt very profoundly that we had we were accountable to all of them oh already the two exclamation points so i conclude i conclude with things that i wanted i i would say came to my mind when reading the paper of ricardo first of all we had no exchange rate crisis during this abominable crisis which goes on in a way and i think it's a it's a it's very important and i think we have to understand even better why we maintain order in the exchange rate since the very beginning of the unfolding of the crisis second remark which is perhaps a little bit bold when we were frightened by the overall conflict between republican and democrats on the game which would could conduct to a default there was an impact on the signature of the united states treasury there was no impact at all on the signature of the fed and so i will not contrary to friedman rule confuse the two personally it seems to me that the the fed is in the present situation the ultimate anchor of credibility that exists in this country that's my own understanding i had a joke but i keep it for myself thank you [Applause]
