the premise behind this is just the universal response of the authorities in essentially all the advanced countries was oh boy we blew it we didn't have anybody that was looking across the financial system if we'd only had macro potential policy we wouldn't have found ourselves in in this position the don't start here part but there's not been a lot of work trying to figure out exactly you know well whether macro potential uh policy will work and i think the spirit of this exercise is to say well let's just do a replay of the last crisis in one way uh that's an easy test because it was designed i mean the responses were designed having seen everything we're going to talk about of course they were designed in the heat of battle and you know dodd-frank passed in 2010 uh so we don't didn't have the full evaluation of that but on the other hand i'm sure dan will say at some point that one of the biggest reforms is to raise the level of capital and so the exercise we're going to do is to replay the last crisis where we're not going to assume the capital started at 10 percent or anything like that so think of the way we think of this is imagine you found yourself uh where you know circumstances evolve to where you wake up one day and discover you're massively short in terms of capital what you know what would you do and what would you be able to do and and so that's that's where we're gonna go the paper is divided into these four parts most of uh what i'm gonna skip today is in section one because it's a replay of a linear combination of what andre and daryl talked about so i'll give our theory of the case just very briefly and then i'll spend most of my time on the second two things you know what would it have taken to do something about this and you know are the authorities up to it for our purposes we're not going to get bogged down into exactly why these imbalances emerge whether it's beliefs or bad supervision or whatever we're just going to announce here's the things that you'd have to deal with and then are you going to be able to do it and we're going to have a two-part theory of what went wrong the first was emphasized a lot in daryl's paper here's a few of the numbers that we have in in ours about how the system was fragile the key takeaway from this was because of of this explosion of leverage with small losses the financial system became impaired and was possibly holding the economy back due to a credit crunch so that's one concern that we think is is there and you know that's broadly accepted as part of what we do with financial regulations we want to make this system resilient enough to be able to escape that here's our version of a mian and sufi like scatter plot that reinforces some of the things that just shows that household debt is somewhat predictive of big problems and it's not an idiosyncrasy to the united states across countries across time you see consistently with you know pretty similar slopes in these scatter plots so that's pretty compelling that you know if you get your debt out of hand you know you're you're at risk for trouble so the idea that we should have done something to make the system more resilient on the lender side is is pretty passe everybody accepts that the harder question is what do you want to do about household indebtedness and general borrower resilience so the stark version of this is are you worried enough about this potential aggregate demand externality that when the households start cutting back on their spending and in the uk case they don't default because the loans are with recourse so all it is is just peer cutbacks in consumption mark referenced the hockey stick what he was talking about is you can look at what people's debt to income ratios were or what their debt service to income were and look at the change in consumptions and you see when people get into that far right tail where they're pretty heavily indebted they cut back uh spending quite aggressively and that's a finding across a bunch of places are you going to put that in the macro pro remit or not the bank of england does and we're going to say that to understand and to prevent a replay of the last crisis you would have had to do something about this okay so our working uh estimate is that the one simple way to just um estimate the size of the cost of the crisis is to just look at the deviation from trend the details of how you draw the trend aren't particularly important this is a 20-year average if you just say you know by 2010 we're something like eight and a half percent short of the level of gdp and there's lots and lots of other estimates that suggest this is big um all that coming despite the fact that you know there weren't that many banks that failed and yet we had this big macro fallout so the part of the paper that i'm going to skip over the most is assembling a literature review and then a standardization exercise to try to translate what a bunch of different uh papers have found about what contributed to the drop in gdp and so um these these studies vary and the the quality of the identifying assumptions or the plausibility of the identifying assumptions narrower studies tend to be um probably pretty tightly identified but perhaps conservative in terms of what you could extrapolate for the macro costs so we have a whole bunch of studies i think there's 12 or 13 of them in the end that we use to estimate these things our punch line is that um a fair bit of the collapse in gdp could be traced to either the credit crunch or the deleveraging and so we're not it doesn't really matter for our purposes but um the exact numbers but the idea is that if you only attended one of these you you wouldn't be able to have headed things off and so if if you are looking for teaching and data to show your students there's a whole bunch more that goes behind this picture okay so now we have this kind of two-part test now i'm going to switch to the the meat of the macro pro part of all of this so question number one is it realistic to think that you could have seen that the risk of a credit crunch and the risk of deleveraging was developing in real time and then question two what would you have had to do or what would you have wanted to do to head that off and we're gonna take steps two three and four as the ingredients that would be necessary to prevent the credit crunch in the deleveraging but i want to start with question one which is imagine we operate as we do now what would you have been likely to be able to catch now somebody mentioned earlier this very prescient briefing that the fomc received in 2005 about the state of the housing market in the united states so the staff estimate if you look from the date of that fomc meeting to the trough of what action actually happened with respect to housing prices housing prices i think dropped 19 percent the staff forecast was that they were 20 overvalued so it seems inconceivable that a macro pro authority wouldn't have noticed that there was a problem with the housing market that's we're going to say no no problem there it's likely also that you would have noticed that debt was building up as i noted mortgaged it doubled in the six years before 2007. there was a lot of talk about um you know riskier borrowers getting credit and and so on whether we would have understood exactly uh the fragility that was uh embedded in those loans not so sure but you probably would have known something about it um the hallmark of most macro pro um innovations the biggest probably the biggest one and and the cornerstone of many countries macro pro committees is their stress testing so that i associate myself with whoever said that was the turnaround in the u.s um but to do it successfully for the last crisis you would have had to include the shadow banks and if you had done a stress test and you'd ignored what happened to all the broker dealers that daryl was talking about it's not clear you would have understood very much about what was going on so it was probably going to be important to find some way to pull those guys in and then finally the inner linkages and the the connections and i think this is probably the hardest bit um i if you're not down in the weeds working on this you may not understand that we still don't have a lot of the basic data that you would need to know to do a full-on stress test so one example you don't generally know the counterparty the counterparty so except that the domino thing has an element of truth or at least that the runs work through that kind of stuff we don't collect that data that the measurement system in the united states in most places is still premised on something like the national accounts or maybe the flow of funds and a lot of what you'd want to know just still isn't even very well measured so that seems like a constraint that we ought to take seriously when we try to do our war game okay so let's suppose you'd figured out that the the banks were under capitalized um what what would have been a plausible response so one way to dimension this is to just recognize that there was about 200 billion of tarp that was spent on the 15 systemic institutions that we focus on in the united states and that was that was pretty important um the obvious way to do this is this um tool that was created through the basel process it's called the counter cyclical capital buffer that's a time varying capital requirement that's layered on in the uk on the fpc every quarter we we have to affirm the the setting of that the united states has decided the ccyb should be zero uh they've not used it but many countries do and so one question is in the run-up to the uh crisis what would you have had to do with the ccyb to try to get the money that ultimately came from tarp into the system through private means so the formula there shows you how you would compute that number you take the 200 billion you want you compare it to the asset based risk weighted you'd recognize that some of the assets are outside of the united states so you you can't impose capital requirements on businesses outside and if you do that you get a number of about three percent now in the united states uh it's it's uh been agreed that the ctyb will never go above two and a half but that's not necessarily has has to be true um if you instead took the trend of credit growth and you said you wanted to keep credit growth on its trend now maybe and that might be an upper bound because maybe credit had been too fast but if you wanted to keep it on trend you could back out what that would mean and it gets you a number more like 4.7 if you wanted to match what happened uh both with tarp and in the aftermath of the 2009 stress test that gets you a number like 4.2 so let's take somewhere between three and four and a half as the ask you would have been making of the banks we think that's a plausible number um so bev wrote a paper back in 2016 pointing out how much the banks were disgorging so between their share buybacks and their their dividends there was a lot going out the door our number is let's assume in the middle of 2007 you'd woken up to all of this i think andre said it was incan in um unescapable that there was problems by mid-2007 just between then and lehman there was 67 billion that was paid out so if you just turned off the faucet that would have gotten you somewhat close whether you could have got the broker dealers inside the regulatory perimeter i think is is much harder but it seems important to recognize just because we have a basel committee on banking and we have a bunch of banking tools every problem isn't a banking problem and if you're not going to attend to the shadow banking sector you would you would find that challenging again the fpc in the uk once a year has to affirm or has to state where we think the systemic risks lie and if they're not inside uh the part of the system for which we've got some sort of authority then we make a recommendation to parliament that they would you know give us such authority and and so on but there's an active discussion once a year about where is the boundary um and you would have had to do that in in in the us case all right second thing you could have done was worry about the the funding instability um hard to know how much the funding mismatch was but one number uh just to put out there as a benchmark is how much did the fed ultimately supply so if you add up the alphabet soup of all the different programs and count the injections it comes to about one and a half trillion of liquidity now if you force the banks to term out their funding so swap all the short-term funding they were got getting for long-term funding that gets you a modest hit on credit costs um kind of any way you you squeeze it so you know the banks would have noticed it would have it would have cost them more but with our kind of back of the envelope estimates we don't think that that would have been super costly we don't make an attempt to distinguish between the credit crunch and the run on the short-term funding because it's just it's very very hard to estimate those things so we're going to lump those two together when we come to trying to figure out um the next step on the borrower stuff this is probably the most controversial thing for a us audience is to imagine that you're going to stand between a willing borrower and a willing lender and say you guys don't get to set the entire terms of your your loan deal we're going to interfere slow it down call it what you want but we're potentially going to put a little bit of sand in the gears there are three types of tools that have been used in the uk and elsewhere the first is to do something about debt to income limits you might say that you know no borrower or only a fraction x let's say of the loans that anybody is making can be made to borrowers with debt to income above four that's the nature of the intervention in the uk where you say that you know fifteen percent of up to fifteen percent of your mortgages can be made to these these uh individuals so you're not stopping any individual transaction but on a portfolio basis you could be interfering we don't think that would have had a huge effect on the amount of credit that was granted there's a second thing that you you could have done that would have been much bigger in the u.s which was to require documentation of income you get to write down your income you can write down whatever income you want to get under four so if you had you know cut back on the low doc or no doc loans or at least verified all the income we think that would have had a bigger impact on credit availability and then the last thing you could do which mark also mentioned is you could insist when the banks make a loan to a new new customer that they check whether or not the customer would be able to sustain the payments if interest rates were to rise so we do a three percent stress and we check whether or not you'd still qualify for the loan in that case so um there's a lot more data in the paper of this sort that gives you a snapshot of what things look like now that suggests then that in the us case you'd be talking about tools that we still don't have and still aren't very much discussed here but they do exist elsewhere they are used elsewhere here's a bunch of numbers that we have about how much some of these different interventions would have mattered it's very hard to know what would have happened with the documentation since presumably some people just wouldn't have qualified at all okay so do we think the regulators are up to the task and our answer is not very favorable for the f sock that comes for a variety of reasons the first one is the f sock has no um hard legal powers beyond the ability to designate an institution as being systemic so just to remind you we the the main systemic risk control in the united states was to tell the 10 existing micro prudential regulators that you ought to get together the secretary of treasury will chair these meetings and you ought to talk about things but when it comes to actually having the authority to do something there's there's not a lot there um they can make recommendations to other regulators there have been times when they've made recommendations that the so the group can vote by two-thirds majority to say you sec go do this the sec can say well you know we're not really convinced so we're not going to do it and that has happened so um there have there there are members of this 10 club of regulators that don't even have financial stability in their mandate which is pretty important because if you go and tell the sec you should do this on the grounds of mitigating systemic risk and they say well that's not our job but you know you may think it is but it's not our job and then you have a back and forth so the fed can do certain things uh it does control the ccyb and it it's in charge of the stress test but nobody in the united states has the authority to do anything about household leverage it wouldn't matter you know jay powell once a month could stand up and say i think there's a consumer credit boom that's going to end badly in the united states that's about all he can do so there is there's nobody that's in charge of that side of things so if you take that perspective the fsoc doesn't stand much of a chance the fpc probably is better positioned um the main reason is just there's a lot more tools so we think of the fsoc and the fpc as the polar opposites the f sox you know a club without a lot of tools the fpc is probably the most muscular financial regulator in the world it's got a bunch of tools there's a role in designing the stress tests there's the power to set the ccyb there's um sectoral capital limits so if we wanted to we could say banks have to hold more capital for every loan that's made to the housing market or or you know leveraged loans for buyouts or whatever we want we do not have tools for non-banks but we do have the ability to try to ask for authority to move into the perimeter and when we've made recommendations as as they've been to parliament or to the micro prudential regulator every recommendation we've made has been accepted or every power that's been requested has been granted um and as i said we have tools to um deal with with uh leverage so in principle it looks like an fpc-like um authority has has a chance in practice i think the answer is much less clear so our waffling answers the question in our title of our papers maybe um we could have said it on the one hand on the other that would have probably been more in keeping with the nbr standard but um what would what would it take um so first thing is you'd have to have a mandate so the united states there's been no debate over whether a macro purdue authority should have any scope for doing anything on the borrower side of the system you would have had to be able to do something about leverage and and the liquidity mismatches and you would have had to try to do something about the household household debt i i think the public if we were if we do have another crisis is going to be outraged in the united states because i i would guess most of the experts in the room would are going to agree the f sock is kind of toothless so you think how could we go through this huge crisis and then set up a response that was designed to fail but that's kind of my view of where we are it's just not set up to do this the uk maybe you have a chance you would have had to try to get the shadow banks inside the regulatory system that would have been lobbied against ferociously and then you would have had to push the boundaries of your power i mean in terms of forcing forcing them to recapitalize and then standing in between the the borrowers so i'm not i'm not sure whether it would have worked um but at least logically it could have so then the last part of the paper is some questions about okay so how did we wind up in this situation and we think that there's these five areas that that matter um first should should you take comfort that somebody out there is watching and uh we're gonna be able to identify problems in real time we think it helps to have somebody forced to be doing that but you might not want to assume they're going to be perfect and so maybe you want to build some slack extra resilience into the system how wide should the remit be so the main thing is do you want to uh attack borrower weakness and and do anything about borrower resilience um third most most notably absent the united states is these hard powers so does it help to have a regulator that can just make recommendations but has no authority to actually follow through pretty hard fourth how activists should you be and what's the role of cost benefit analysis that's that's a real challenge since these things are you know if you do your job you're not going to see a crisis and probably the hardest problem is the political account of the political economy around accountability so do the i'll leave you with a following thought experiment imagine you go to the the president and you say i think you know the probability of crisis in the next 25 years is is pretty good so let's say it's a one in 25 chance we're gonna have a crisis but if we do the following we can get it to one in 50. okay now and here's roughly what we're going to see in the cost in the very short run now do you think you you'd have a mandate to go out and do that and imagine now you're 17 years into this there's been no crisis you've pushed it back to one in 50 instead of one in 25 you think about all the inertia that's built into the system that you know tries to undo regulations over time i think it'd be it'd be difficult to sustain the support as the you know crisis fades especially if the costs were quite visible and yet if you don't have something like that it's hard to know why um you know why this is going to make such a difference so you've got to find a way even if the committee's working well and you don't have very many crises that you can somehow prevent the kind of steady erosion of will on the part of the regulators
