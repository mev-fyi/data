i'm emily breeza and i'm here to discuss effects of a large-scale social media advertising campaign on holiday travel and covid19 infections a cluster randomized control trial this work is a product of a very large group of collaborators economists and also physicians and nurses before the pandemic and throughout the pandemic doctors and nurses are among the most trusted experts in the united states this is according to numerous surveys and many have taken to social media during covet 19 to encourage public health behaviors such as masking social distancing and vaccination our team of physicians nurses and economists has shown in prior work that their promising impacts of video messaging in online experiments video videos recorded by physicians have been shown to improve knowledge and self-reported behaviors and these positive impacts have looked very similar across racial and political lines in this paper we ask can video messages recorded by trusted healthcare professionals and broadcasts through social media influence population level behavior and health we're going to work with the facebook platform because the reach of social media is unrivaled in the u.s 70 of american adults are on facebook our intervention focuses on one specific public health goal which was to reduce travel over the thanksgiving and christmas holidays in 2020. this is consistent with the cdc guidance against a backdrop of worries that people traveling to see relatives during the thanksgiving and christmas holidays would create mixing across regions large indoor gatherings which would both spur a tick up in cobit 19 infections we conducted an intervention where physicians and nurses recorded messages urging viewers to stay safe and stay home and we disseminated these messages as sponsored content using a facebook ad campaign our goal from the facebook ad campaign was just to get these messages in front of as many users as possible during the the period of our campaign in the target geographies if you were a user in the target geography you would receive you would see something like what we have on the right side of the screen coming from the doctors for coronavirus prevention project which is our group's facebook page the text reads this thanksgiving the best way to show your love is to stay home if you do visit wear a mask at all times and that's followed by a video which starts to play automatically uh this one with the cl our collaborator marcel alshon urging people to stay home for the thanksgiving holiday we also have an example from christmas recorded by one of our nurses we are nurses and doctors and this year as hard as it is we are staying home for the holidays i am doing this because i love you mom and dad i am tracy glushko from bozeman health and i am urging you don't spread covet 19. stay safe stay home the video is one example of one of the messages for the christmas holiday presented by nurse glushko from bozeman montana our physicians and nurses were from all over the country from massachusetts to maryland to colorado to texas and then up to montana and each was able to give the reason that they were choosing to stay home themselves for the christmas holiday so in order to test the efficacy of these videos at the population level we designed an experiment around the publicly available primary outcomes of interest so our first outcome of interest of course is mobility did people actually reduce travel in response to these messages and second if we did in fact see a reduction in mobility was there an impact on covet 19 cases did a decrease in travel cause population level changes to infections to answer the the first question we use the facebook movement range data which is publicly available at the county level um it's not available in a smaller granularity due to privacy protections the kovid 19 cases are also publicly available from state public health websites and they were available at the zip code level in 13 states which comprise our sample frame given the two different primary outcomes and the two levels of observations for these primary outcomes we developed a two-stage research design to increase our power on the covet outcome but also to allow ourselves to detect mobility impacts at the county level so in the first stage counties were randomized into high or low intensity a comparison of high versus low intensity counties permits measurement of mobility impacts of our intervention and in the second stage within each county zip codes were randomized to treated versus control in the high intensity counties 75 percent of zip codes were treated and in the low intensity counties 25 percent of zip codes were treated a comparison of treated versus control zip codes permits measurement of the impacts of the messaging campaign on covid cases as i said before our sample frame are the 820 counties in the 13 usda's reporting zip code level coded data and a few details on the reach of our campaign in the thanksgiving intervention we launched it on november 14th about 12 million users saw any study message at least once and for those that saw a message they typically saw 2.6 over the course of the campaign the christmas intervention was a bit shorter we didn't launch it until december 17th but it was more intensive but 23 million users saw any study message and those seeing a message saw about 3.5 video messages and these are from a bank of many different messages for both thanksgiving and christmas uh this is a map showing the 13 states that were part of our intervention and the randomization to high versus low intensity counties in this particular picture for the thanksgiving intervention turning to our results the first main outcome that we want to look at is mobility the goal of the message was was to get people to stay home so can we detect any impacts on actual distance traveled or staying home to do this we're going to use the facebook movement range data and primarily the change in movement metric this metric aggregates data from individual facebook users and counts the number of 600 square meter spatial tiles each user travels through during a day and what the graph is plotting are the differences in this metric between high versus low intensity counties day by day the dash vertical line is the thanksgiving holiday now one important thing to note about this data is that it only allows us to look at sending travel the travel prior to the holiday it's not well suited for us to measure effects on people coming home so what we do see is that there's a decrease in travel in the three days prior to the thanksgiving holiday when pooled together this is statistically significant and is about a 0.9 percentage point reduction in travel we see similar results for the christmas holiday this time the dash vertical line represents christmas eve and again we see a decrease in travel in the three days prior to the christmas holiday as well and it's a very similar magnitude the intervention caused about a 1.04 percentage point reduction in travel in the three days prior to the christmas holiday in high versus low intensity counties the facebook movement range data also provides an additional metric the stay home metric which measures the fraction of people who only stay in a in the same 600 square meter box for the entire day we find no impacts on that outcome so it does seem that people were leaving their homes potentially to spend time safely in social distance capacity outside or they could have been substituting their long distance travel with local holiday celebrations so therefore it's really important to be able to look at the covered case rate data to understand the clinical significance of these results turning to that clinical data again we were able to pull down zip code level data for all of the zip codes in our study now these data were updated approximately once a week for the majority of uh of zip codes in our sample and what i'm showing here is data aggregated to the two week frequency each dot is a comparison of the treated versus control zip codes measuring the inverse hyperbolic sign of biweekly covid cases now the inverse hyperbolic sine function can can roughly be interpreted as a percent change the red dots are the specific bi-weekly time period of particular interest for our study this is the two-week period starting five days following each holiday so what we infer is that the infections that occurred during that two-week horizon would be the infections that were contracted during those holiday celebrations and we see in both the thanksgiving holiday on the left and the christmas holiday on the right that those periods start between 5 and 19 days following the holiday we do see a statistically significant reduction in covet cases and pooling across both the thanksgiving and the christmas holidays we find about a 3.5 reduction in covid cases in treatment versus control zip codes the other thing we can do is ask which types of places responded more perhaps surprisingly we find no differences in democratic versus republican voting counties as measured by which presidential candidate in the 2020 election that county ultimately voted for and this is despite a backdrop of intense political polarization of covid19 public health measures in late 2020 similarly we find no differences in the impacts on urban versus rural counties we do find that the impacts on the kovid 19 infections outcome are smaller in magnitude and counties with high infections at baseline so the the treatments seem less effective in places where there's already high local community spread so just to summarize there was a widespread concern before both holidays that the heavy travel and mixing households from different regions would increase copay 19 infections and we show that a high coverage facebook ad campaign in which clinicians encourage people to stay home cause facebook users to reduce travel in the three days prior to each holiday but we find no impacts on leaving the house we also find a significant effect on new covid19 infections reported by the health authorities in those states five to 19 days after both holidays and so these results indicate that clinicians can be an effective channel to communicate life-saving information at scale through social media and and today our finding we believe that our findings have relevance for the ongoing vaccination efforts underway
