I do want to try to step back and look at some of the long run factors affecting U.S trade policy over time look at some of the historical continuities to see if they I might possibly inform where we are today and I Define the long term a little bit differently than perhaps you do I'm not looking back at just a decade or so I subscribe to Julie Andrews view in The Sound of Music that let's start at the very beginning it's a very good place to start so I tend to start around 1790 or so with the formation of the Constitution and to do so I'm going to be drawing on my book clashing over commerce the history of US trade policy which was published late last year it's an nber book and it's a door stopping 700 Pages or so of text but despite its length I I do appreciate many of the kind of reactions I've received from people in this room uh Greg Epp of the Wall Street Journal called it magisterial Ryan Avent of The Economist called it magisterial Richard Cooper of the financial Foreign Affairs called it magisterial Tyler Cowan of George Mason called it magisterial and Sumaya Keynes The Economist called it a bit of a slog um but actually that that proves one thing that Sumaya is the only person who actually read the book because because she is absolutely right um and so I'm grateful to her so how can you synthesize 250 years of trade policy history uh the United States how can we reduce this down to something that is manageable and then we can get our and organize our thoughts around it so as I went through the book I started thinking or writing the book I started thinking what what are the what are the purposes of trade policy what are governments trying to achieve by leaving taxes on Imports which is the principal trade policy instrument um and I stepping back there are three main goals of trade policy one is to raise revenue for the federal government the second is to restrict Imports to protect import competing producers from foreign competition and the third is reciprocity or uh trying to achieve uh open markets abroad by cutting your own tariffs and agreements with other countries uh so I call these the three R's to sort of make it uh sink in one's mind uh what's interesting about this division it also cords with three periods of U.S trade policy history very nicely so the period from the founding of the country after the Civil War is one in which the main goal of government policy with respect to trade was Revenue raising from the Civil War right up to the Great Depression the main purpose of leaving tariffs was to protect domestic producers from foreign competition and since the Great Depression certainly after World War II uh the main purpose of policy has been to reach reciprocity agreements and level the playing field if you will now usually there's a trade-off between these things and so that's why one takes precedent in a particular period of time you know if you want to use tariffs for Revenue you can't really use them to restrict Imports because then that uh will compromise the revenue objective if you use if you use tariffs to restrict Imports to a limit foreign competition well that sort of ties your hand in terms of reaching reciprocity agreements because then you don't want to cut those tariffs the Trump Administration however has been very happy in that you can have Revenue restriction and reciprocity all the same time because it really doesn't matter what the outcome is if you impose High tariffs that's good because you protect domestic producers from foreign competition if that helps you reach foreign trade agreements that's good because then it opens up foreign markets and if none of those happens at least we'll get the money into the piggy bank from all the tariffs so he's been very optimistic about uh it doesn't really matter the outcome we'll get one of the three and all three are good and we'll go with that so only good can come from tariffs but I do want to touch uh just quickly on revenue for a moment it's really not the most important of the three that I'll talk about today this is just going back once again to 1790 the share of U.S treasury receipts coming from the Tariff um and as you can see there are three periods in some sense the first one prior to the Civil War about 90 percent of federal government revenue came from the Tariff that's why the Tariff was very important for Revenue purposes with the introduction of the Civil War we introduced excise taxes the share Falls to about 50 percent and then with the introduction of the income tax 1913 it goes down as now at trivial levels now the president has tweeted about uh the using tariffs to raise revenue to pay off the federal debt and close the budget uh imbalance and things of that sort but I think any uh back of the envelope calculation that I or other people have done uh says you're not going to really change this from the one percent that it is and so that's a little bit of an illusion but I will say that revenues never uh completely absent from considerations of trade policy you might recall that the Uruguay round and NAFTA were both held up in the Senate finance committee over trying to make up the Lost tariff Revenue because there was a balanced budget rules in effect at that time so we can't ignore Revenue uh completely but the main debate over trade policy throughout most of History has been should we use it to restrict Imports or should we achieve reciprocity with other countries that's a debate that goes right back to the very beginning goes right back to Jefferson and Hamilton and the founding of the country and their debates over trade policy now when I talked to my undergraduates about Jefferson and Hamilton they think I'm talking about David Diggs and lin-manuel Miranda and they're rapping not necessarily about uh well they're wrapping up the funding in the national debt so it is tariffs a little bit but really wasn't about the Restriction reciprocity I try to remind them well there actually are these two other guys that were talking about and they didn't actually engage in a duel they didn't have uh debating wraps but they did have debating reports uh so on the left hand side this is uh Hamilton's famous report on the subject of Manufacturers which is probably one of the key documents in American history regarding tariff policy and in that report in 1791 Hamilton lays out a limited case for using the Tariff to protect domestic producers to jump start manufacturing the United States it's the more famous report but I think the one on the right which is Jefferson's report his dueling report in 1793 is actually much more important and if we look at that report we'll see Echoes of it today his report is on Commercial reciprocity and his report is on Commercial restrictions and privileges in other markets the great the American Revolution was America's brexit and what happened is um I'm sure the British have learned a lot about this from our experience uh it didn't work out so well we were excluded from the markets of the British Empire we were discriminated against around the world and so the goal of Jefferson as Secretary of State and even prior to that was to try to reduce foreign barriers to U.S exports and this is what he says in his report first of all he says his preferred course of action was friendly Arrangements meaning trade agreements with countries to remove their trade barriers but he also argued that quote should Any Nation contrary to our wishes suppose it may better find its advantage by continuing its system of prohibitions duties and regulations it behooves us to protect our citizens their Commerce and navigation by counter prohibitions duties and regulations also free Commerce and navigation are not to be given in exchange for restrictions and vexations nor are they likely to produce a relaxation of them where a nation imposes High duties on our products or prohibits them all together it may properly it may be proper for us to do the same by theirs now Jefferson conceded that this policy of reciprocity that of other countries had high barriers we ought to have high barriers against them too you can see that that would be um costly policy but he said it's better than doing nothing and that if we didn't do anything uh it would simply encourage more illiberal policies elsewhere so he says it is true we must expect some inconvenience in practice from the establishment of discriminating duties in other words the U.S ought to discriminate against those countries that discriminated against us but in this as in so many other cases we are left to choose between two evils those these inconveniences are nothing when weighted against the loss of wealth and loss of force which will follow our perseverance and a plan of non-discrimination when once it shall be perceived that we are either in the system or in the habit of giving equal advantage to those who extinguish our Commerce and navigation by duties or prohibitions as to those who treat both with liberality and Justice liberality and Justice will be converted by all into duties and prohibitions in other words there's going to be free writers out there it is not to the moderation and Justice of others that we are to trust for fair and equal access to the markets of our products but to our own means of Independence and the firm will to use them so he's calling for a very eye for an eye policy in terms of reciprocity which might surprise you coming from Thomas Jefferson at this time and he proposed first of all not mfn clearly he also proposed having a two-column tariff system where one column would be a preferred tariff and the other would be a non-mfn tariff this I hope resonates a bit with you today this concern in the United States about reciprocity and what other countries are doing to us and we see this every year when ustr releases its National estimate of foreign trade barriers which is another 500 page document issued annually by ustr outlining a Litany of complaints about all the uh discrimination uh impediments to our Commerce that other countries inflict on us so this concern of reciprocity goes way back now when I read this uh report as I try to do every year just to see what what is new I'm reminded of this thing on the right which is of course the Festivus poll from Seinfeld Festivus is the uh annual holiday the annual airing of grievances where you let all your friends and family know how they've let you down over the previous year and uh this ustr report is basically telling all our friends and enemies how they've let us down not treating our Goods very fairly in their markets now before I leave uh Jefferson move a little bit closer to the present I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Jefferson was also the architect of the most important trade policy experiment in U.S history that is the Embargo of 1808 1809 when for 15 months we shut down all U.S ports to foreign Commerce and basically closed the US off to uh trade and as you might imagine that was very controversial their distribution of consequences um I've calculated the welfare loss of that as about five percent of GDP which was incurred within the first six months because we can see it in terms of the uh prices of traded Goods but the controversy you can see in the archives too uh and so in the uh in the um Library of Congress you can find this letter to President addressed to President Jefferson it's from Boston in uh I believe it's uh February of 1808 so the Embargo has only been in effect for a little over a month and if we think that the political environment today is very poisonous and uh difficult the first line of this letter to the president reads uh Dear Sir Mr Jefferson sir you are a friend to the disturber of the peace and the greatest enemy of the whole world and as I say the the letter goes downhill from there so that's that's just the opening number uh the point is of course trade policy has always been very controversial uh in the United States because they're distributional consequences so uh the book is sort of traces through uh all the ups and downs of the Tariff over time um there's a lot of ups and downs uh and uh but I really want to focus on that restriction period and the red line is the average tariff on dutyable Imports the blue line is the average tariff on total Imports because after the Civil War a lot of goods were put on the duty-free list things that we did not produce here at home so they wouldn't be adversely affecting any producers but the red line tends to be relatively high and stable about 40 50 percent from the Civil War until the Great Depression Peak there and then it falls and we enter this uh era of reciprocity so um how do we think about this well this is an outcome not of these dueling government reports or high-minded government officials deciding what to do this is uh deep political economy factors driving both the Restriction period and the reciprocity period so here's a political cartoon uh from the 1930s which I think sort of summarizes the way in which uh you could think about Congressional tariff politics that is members of Congress are going to vote based on the interests of their constituents and the trade related interests of their constituents depends very much on whether the state is a platform for exports from the United States or whether there are a lot of import competing producers and this has incredible persistence because the geographic location U.S production for much of U.S history has been very very persistent so if you look at the 1820 census where is steel produced in the United States Pennsylvania if you look at more recent senses still a lot produced in Pennsylvania where was cotton produced in 1810 1820 in the South where is it produced up until the Great Depression once again in the South and Cotton's been a leading export for a long period of Time same with grain in the Midwest and so what we see is persistence in Congressional voting patterns on the Tariff so on the left here uh well first of all what this is is house voting on tariff bills one on the left is 1828 and on the right it's 1929. so this is a century apart a hundred years in which there's been industrialization movement West vast changes in the structure of the US economy and yet the correlation across house districts is something like 0.7 incredible persistence in terms of this very sharp north-south divide in terms of trade policy North voting it for higher tariffs in the 19th century into the 20th century because that's where most manufacturers were that were facing foreign competition and we're exporting tobacco and cotton there was coming from the south and they wanted much lower Terrace they were voting against those High tariffs we see this persistence also in the Tariff code so if we just look at the Tariff and there's just a scatter plot of the schedules of the Tariff 1867 to 1939 so this is a 70-year period and essentially the structure of the Tariff did not change over 70 years Republicans Democrats would fight over the Tariff and one would push it up and the other would push it down but they wouldn't change the structure of the goods very much so this is this these deep-rooted political economy factors I think uh provide the structural basis for uh U.S trade policy now there is a transition from restriction to reciprocity and I can't believe I'm giving a talk about trade policy and I'm not going to mention smooth Holly uh we're going to sort of skip that over in the interest of time and skip to the uh after the Great Depression or actually during the Great Depression we had a Secretary of State who is a relatively unknown unherald figure Cordell Hall but he was America's longest serving secretary of state from 1933 to 1944 he won the Nobel Peace Prize 1945 and that Nobel citation mentions not just his work in creating the United Nations but his work in bringing commercial peace to the world and ending the trade Wars of the 1930s through uh bringing about the Gat and other trade agreements uh he was very much of the mind that trade policy is foreign policy the trade policy uh more open trade policy would be good for the US economy it'd also be good for in terms of our foreign relations and the general World economy and would therefore a bet the cause of World Peace as the stamp uh in the 1950s indicated um just to sort of bring that notion home that Cordell Howe was really uh uh was on to something in the 1930s and 40s since we're here in Washington particularly in the national press club building you might remember the great Washington Post uh cartoonist herb block this is one of her Block's very first cartoons not whether you can see it but the very bottom there's someone uh with a name on their shirt trade freedom and trade freedom is holding up uh political cooperation and political cooperation is holding up world peace and you can see it's rather precarious and off on the side off the stage are the Tariff lobbies shooting peas at trade freedom with the understanding that if you jostle trade Freedom the whole system could come tumbling down and that was certainly a lesson that Cordell Hall learned from the 1920s and 30s and when he tried to impart for U.S trade policy and so he helped usher in this era of reciprocity uh that I think we're still in today I'll come to that in a moment the one thing that has changed during the reciprocity period Cordell Hall got this uh this uh the movement towards trade agreements going the one thing that has changed is partisan voting on trade policy so there's a chart going back to 1890 showing votes in Congress uh in the house on trade legislation the Blue Line the scale is uh the higher on the scale the more you're in favor of trade liberalization you're either against High tariffs or you're in favor of low tariffs and what you can see is trade policy was incredibly Paris in the late 19th century into the 20th century Democrats the blue line is up top because they would always vote for lower tariffs or uh uh are in favor or against High tariffs and Republicans are down there low never in favor of trade liberalization the red line becomes squiggly in the 1930s and 40s there's some movement among Republicans about whether we should move towards reciprocity and after World War II the Blue Line the red line Rises up to the Blue Line and they roughly follow each other in the 1950s 60s 70s even into the 1980s but by the mid late 1980s early 1990s particularly with NAFTA the Blue Line starts going down and the red line stays relatively high in other words the political parties have switched places in terms of trade policy this is not because of some ideological conversion of Republicans Or democrats this is purely a function or I shouldn't say purely but largely a function of a chart I showed you earlier that north-south divide the parties switched which ref which part portions of the country they started representing the Republicans were their strength in the late late 19th century up to smooth Holly was in the North and the Democrats were a southern party and now the Democrats are more of a northern party the Republicans are more of a southern western party and they've switched places the interesting thing about this thing and you have to listen to the most recent edition of trade talks with Chad and sumet to get insight into this is that there's a Divergence between the party leadership on trade issues and the party based on trade issues where the polling indicates the Republican base is much more protectionist than the leadership in congress uh and it's just the opposite with the Democrats how that resolves itself will be very interesting to what to watch uh in the months and years to come so that's a little sketch of history but I know the question that you're all asking is how different is the Trump Administration in terms of the history that we've observed is this a historical break are there historical patterns that we can see in the past um that uh mean that things are really aren't so different after all one thing that is different is is really much is very much the rhetoric um so you don't see previous presidents saying other countries are ripping us off other countries are taking advantage of us even Herbert Hoover who's commonly dubbed the most protectionist president of the 20th century uh he never belittled other countries he just said it's in our interest to protect our producers and uh that's something we have to do but he didn't blame other countries this blamey of other countries is very much reminiscent of the Nixon Administration and it recalls to mind uh treasury secretary John Connolly and his admonition that other countries are out to screw us our job is to screw them first and that seems to be very much uh in line with what the Trump Administration does and here's yet another herblock cartoon from the Nix Administration this from 1970 and it shows Nixon they're opening up the cabinet of import restrictions and all sudden they start tumbling out in terms of oil textiles and other products and the next Administration did impose many import barriers in this in this period in addition to the 10 percent import surcharge Acro across the board lived in all countries including Canada for some period in 1971. so that's one thing that's a similarity but also a difference the big difference of course is that Nixon used protection for political purposes he didn't really necessarily like to or believe in it but this President according to Bob Woodward's recent book thinks trade is bad and that's a very different view that you're not doing this to achieve some political purpose but this is a conviction um and and that you don't think uh trade is good well uh so we've seen the renegotiation of NAFTA and I'm gonna have to learn to say uh usmca um we've seen the renegotiation of chorus um and I think the the Judgment of most people is these are not transformative revolutionary changes in these trade agreements China had put in a little bit different category we'll have to see how that plays out but if we're talking about renegotiation renegotiating previous agreements uh uh maybe not to all of our liking but just uh changing some of the provisions it's hard to see a big historic transformation undertaking uh going play taking place in terms of U.S trade policy so what could the Trump Administration do to make its mark on History to really change the course of U.S trade policy I think what they could do is withdraw from the WTO in fact there have been hints uh coming from the White House that that's exactly what the president's interested in in fact it says here Sierra States uh there's that word again that John Connolly used um and perhaps Nixon himself but now the president in an interview with Bloomberg uh just uh in August actually said explicitly um we're going to pull out if they don't shape up now I think that would really change things because if we pull out the of the WTO and let me just say there is a big legal question about whether the president has unilateral power to do so uh that's not at all uh taken as given that relieves the United States of its obligation to treat other members with mfn tariffs and that brings us back to Jefferson in some sense and the fact that we do have a two-column tariff code column one for mfn then that modified column of free Imports with ftas and then that column two tariff which is much higher so for example this one here is just a 10 in ways and waste 45 percent uh in terms of the column two tariffs if we pull out of the WTO and we can possibly impose these column two tariffs uh without um a restriction that would really change U.S trade policy and in joint work with Chad bound we're taking a look at this column two which has really been overlooked in discussions of trade policy it's only applies to two countries uh Cuba and North Korea but it could potentially apply to many more what would happen if we shifted to applying column two tariffs to some countries or to all tariffs all countries turns out the simple average under column one is four percent the simple average under column two is 34 percent the import weighted average for column one is two percent the import weighted average for column two is twenty six percent well if for some reason we were to apply the column two tariffs to everyone it would Mark the highest the greatest increase in U.S tariffs in history going from those low levels top something up very high now once again I'm not saying this is going to happen or anything like that but it's certainly a possibility and given that uh even President Jefferson maybe president Trump have raised issues about whether mfn or unconditional mfn is a good policy I wouldn't rule this out completely but at any rate our forthcoming paper will explore this a little bit more but let me end on an optimistic note I mentioned these three eras of U.S trade policy history Revenue restriction and reciprocity is the reciprocity era coming to an end do we have a fourth R coming such as Retreat or what have you I think it's much too early to declare the end of the reciprocity era and uh and there's a historical analogy here which I will invoke what is happening of course is that other countries are moving ahead without the United States in their own trade Arrangements uh of course with the cptpp and of course the EU is reached uh is in the process of reaching agreements with many countries that the U.S does not have ftas with Japan mercosur and other countries around the world well this is a very interesting development because it does not include the United States which means the U.S is going to be discriminated against in major foreign markets and that in the past discrimination against the U.S has been a trigger and a motivation for U.S policymakers to do something to address that situation so here's once again my final cartoon from 1932. which shows the U.S behind its high tariff wall this after Smoot Holly and the rest of the world the countries of the British Empire and a few others forming Imperial preferences that formation was largely triggered by smooth Holly to some extent they said if the U.S is going to exclude us from their markets we have to form our own block to increase trade amongst ourselves and candidate in particular wanted that it was that discrimination in Imperial preferences that eventually pushed the U.S away from isolationism and uh and towards more active use of trade policy in reaching these agreements the ultimate response was the gat the immediate response was the reciprocal trade agreements Act of 1934 but the ultimate response was the Gap where we the United States wanted non-discrimination codified in international trade agreements in 1958 the European economic Community was formed preferential tariff reduction within Europe that stimulated directly triggered the uh President Kennedy to uh get the trade expansion Act of 1962 through Congress which led to the Kennedy round of the 1960s the expansion of the EC and the growth of Europe uh agricultural subsidy in the 1980s directly affected U.S commercial interests and triggered the U.S to push for the Uruguay round in the late 1980s concluded in the 1990s so I guess the glimmer of hope is to the extent that other countries move ahead with other trade Arrangements that exclude the U.S not immediately but with a lag there will be an effort upon by the part of the United States to level that playing field and end that discrimination so we have not reached the end of history with respect to trade policy and the story of U.S trade policy is far from over
