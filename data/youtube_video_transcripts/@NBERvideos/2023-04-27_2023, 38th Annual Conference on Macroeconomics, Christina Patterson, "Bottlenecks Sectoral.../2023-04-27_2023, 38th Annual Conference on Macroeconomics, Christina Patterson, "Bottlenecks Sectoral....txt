we're delighted that all of you could come to the conference and we'll kick off with the first paper which is uh by doronachimolu David otter and Christina Patterson bottleneck sectoral imbalances and the U.S productivity slowdown and we should say that authors have 20 minutes and each discussion has 20 minutes and then the remaining 20 minutes will be for General discussion great uh well thank you so much um to the organizers for including us as part of this uh conference I'm excited to kick off the day um as Valerie said with work bottleneck sectoral imbalances and the U.S productivity Slowdown oh okay uh great uh so a key um feature of innovation over the last several decades has been a large surge in innovation in ICT and computer and electronics in particular so this figure here shows you a glimpse of that rise you can see in the green line there was this huge surge in total patenting uh after around the 1980s and that coincided with a large rise in the fraction of total patents that come from just these two sectors this is suggested to some that maybe were on the edge of kind of a new era of abundance on the verge of kind of the singularity coming from these uh kind of High super intelligent computers but this explosion in Innovation on this Dimension has also coincided with relatively lackluster productivity growth overall so I'm plotting here tfp overall in blue and in manufacturing in Orange this is for the U.S and you can see the kind of much documented decline in productivity especially over the last several decades this suggests to others that maybe our best idea are behind us and we're in sort of a new age of slower growth so in this paper we're going to put forward a new hypothesis that tries to reconcile these two facts and our hypothesis is going to be that Tech uneven technological advances across sectors can create endogenous bottlenecks that can kind of hold back aggregate productivity we're gonna have a simple theoretical framework wherein if uh if inputs are should I let me just there and again it keeps popping up but if inputs are complementary to each other then new technologies are going to require simultaneous improvements in several of their inputs at the same time so for example think of the automotive industry we're not going to get huge advantages in technology in cars with just advances and things like sensors or software but we also need simultaneous advances in things like tires or batteries and if one of these say batteries is lagging behind then we can get explosive productivity growth in some part without having aggregate productivity growth overall and the batteries in that case of the car industry are endogenous and that they became a bottleneck as things like software and sensors sort of took off and so the bulk of the paper then is going to be to try to provide some empirical evidence for this hypothesis and a crossover array of specifications we're going to find evidence that greater dispersion in an industry's suppliers productivity growth has a large negative effect on its own uh industry's productivity growth So the plan for today is that I'm going to first go over the motivating theoretical framework to sort of formalize our hypothesis a bit more I'll talk about the data we're going to use and I'm going to spend the bulk of the time talking about some empirical evidence for these patterns so the motivating theoretical framework uh I don't know why this keeps popping up uh the motive so our goal here is to derive estimating equations that link an industry's productivity growth um to the distribution of productivity growth among the industries that Supply to them so we're going to consider here an economy with end sectors that are producing some output using a constant returns to scale production function where they're producing with labor with intermediate inputs X from a set of supplying Industries s and they're going to have some productivity a the key part here is going to be how productivity evolves we're going to build on and extend some of Jerome's previous work with Pablo Azar and we're going to introduce a quality ladder structure here where Innovations are going to increase n are going to increase productivity by a factor Lambda and the critical assumption we're going to be thinking about here is that the arrival rate of innovation denoted here by fee is going to depend on the distribution of productivity among your supplying Industries so the functions here H Big H and little H are going to be monotone functions that are going to capture the nature of that relationship so if little H is convex that's going to mean that their uh the inputs are substitutes in production and so Innovation is going to be determined by the most advanced inputs If instead there's like a little H function here is concave the inputs are going to be complements to each other and greater dispersion in productivity among your suppliers is going to hinder your own Innovation you can see that clearly if you take a sale expansion of that expression where you can denote Innovation here as a function of the average cost weighted average productivity growth among your input productivity of your inputs and the cost weighted variance of the productivity among your inputs since little H and Big H we had our monotone functions the average is always going to enter positively more Innovation among your inputs leads to more Innovation for you um but the term on the variance is going to depend on the shape of that H function and in the bottleneck hypothesis would be the concave case it's going to say conditional on the average productivity of your of your inputs um of Greater dispersion is going to hold you back so that's the theoretical equation we're going to estimate something in the data that looks very similar where we're going to relate the growth of tfp in an industry to the average growth of tfp among their suppliers again weighted by their input shares and the variance of that uh growth among their suppliers when we construct these we're going to leave out the own input share to get rid of that mechanical correlation and in addition to adding some controls and an error term the two differences of this equation relative to the theoretical equation or that well first we're using tfp as our measure of innovation and second since tfp is not interpretable on levels we're going to be looking at consecutive five-year changes in the growth rate of tfp and just to summarize here our hypothesis is that the beta term is going to be positive but that the variance term uh will will enter negatively so that's what we're going to take with us to the data a brief overview of the data we're going to be using well we need to know who your suppliers are for that we're going to use the input output linkages this is going to be the detailed input output tables from 1977 to 2002. we're going to get measures of tfp in manufacturing from the nbrcs manufacturing database this is going to be very granular it's going to give us 462 1997 makes Industries and we're going to use data from 1977 to 2007. we're going to supplement this with tfp from non-manufacturing Industries this will be 42 1997 nakes Industries between 1987 and 2007. I'm going to mostly focus on the US but I'll show you some results using international patterns and for that we'll get tfp from Clems for nine countries and 30 Industries also from 1987 to 2007. and then we're going to supplement these tfp measures with more direct measures of innovation that come from patenting and so in particular we're going to focus mostly on the USPTO patents this is going to give us patenting at the firm and CPC level that's industry patent class I'm using data from 1976 to 2014. we're going to get linkages across those patent classes coming from the network of patent citations and as I said most of what I'm going to show you is going to be using U.S patents but I'll show you some International specifications and for those we'll be getting the international patenting from the Google patents Global patent database from the same time period okay so on to some of the the uh the empirical evidence I'm going to first show you our first evidence for these bottleneck patterns visually so I'm going to show you this here which is showing the relationship between industry tfp growth and the average tfp growth of your suppliers so on the y-axis I'm going to zoom in on just that coefficient on the y-axis I have an Industries tfp growth where I've residualized out your fixed effects and the variance of tfp growth among your suppliers on the x-axis I have average tfp growth where I've done the same residualization and this is a bin scatter so each plot here is two percent of the data not an individual industry by year and you can see here that there's a pretty strong positive relationship on average when your suppliers are more productive so are you this contrasts with the variance here we're now on the y-axis I again have your industry tfp growth but now I've residualized it for those time fixed effects and the average tfp growth of your supplier and similarly on the x-axis I have the variance of Supply or tfp growth residualized in the same way so this shows us that conditional on the average TF pre-growth of your suppliers having a greater dispersion of tfp growth is a negative predictor of your tfp growth this table here just formalizes exactly what we just saw in those bin Scatter Plots you can see here that on average when you're uh you're supplying Industries have higher productivity growth so do you but conditional on that average a higher variance exerts a negative uh draw so that's for manufacturing that's what I just showed you in the bin scatters we can add in the non-manufacturing industries and we find very similar patterns for this while kind of wider swath of the economy now in addition to these being kind of statistically significant we also find that this bottleneck pattern could kind of meaningfully contribute uh to the decline in aggregate productivity that we see over the last recent decades now for this to be the case it has to both be that the magnitude of these coefficients is meaningfully large and that there was a rise in the variance of tfp growth among the suppliers this figure shows that that was indeed the case so it's plotting the variance of supplier tfp growth and what we see here is that this um this measure kind of more than doubled between 1977 and 2007. and if you do a simple back of the envelope uh using that you can see that our regression estimates I imply that a kind of substantial fraction of the decline in the Slowdown of productivity can be explained by this Rising variance so in particular in the green bars here what I'm showing you is a simple back of the envelope of what our estimates imply the growth rate of tfp would have been if the variance of supplier tfp growth had stayed the same as it was in 1977 to 1987. and what you see here is that between 1997 and 2007 our estimates imply that tfp growth would have been almost as high as it was in the initial period and around four percentage points higher than it was in reality this is just to show you that these bottleneck patterns are kind of relatively robust to a battery of alternate specifications so I'm showing you here just the coefficient of Interest which is the the coefficient on the variance of your supplier tfp although all of these are from specifications where we're also controlling for the average the top estimate here is the Baseline estimate and you can see here we find kind of a large and negative coefficient in alternate specifications where we control for uh different things we use 10-year changes we drop computers and in particular in the bottom estimate here where we control for the average and the variance of supplier prices or quantities now since tfp is not a direct measure of innovation you might think maybe we're capturing some neoclassical effects where you do better if your suppliers are more productive because you face lower prices and what we show here is if you control for this you find a similar estimate suggesting that's that's not what's going on here I want to highlight another robustness check uh which is that uh addressing the fact that we are regressing tfp on kind of the contemporaneous tfp among your suppliers and so you might be concerned that kind of common productivity shocks across those two sectors could cause some mechanical correlation and so we thought that isolating productivity changes that are common across several advanced economies might partially weigh against this concern So to that end we're going to show a specification here where we instrument the mean and variance of the supplier tfp growth with the mean and variance of those supplying Industries tfp growth but in France Germany and the UK and when you do that I plotted what you get here again this is just uh the the term on the variance the top two are Baseline estimates the OLS and the IV the bottom are the estimates if we include industry fixed effects and in both cases you see that the IV and the OLS estimates are relatively similar um kind of leaning against the possibility that these are really driven by correlated shocks across Industries so those were the evidence and the patterns we saw for tfp and as you saw in our motivating framework the the mechanism we have in mind that drives these uh these patterns are that this is coming from innovation so what we're going to do next is we're going to repeat many of the specifications we did with tfp but using a more direct measure of innovation that comes from patenting so what I'm showing you here are bin Scatter Plots that are analogous to what I showed you for tfp but I'm replacing the growth rate of tfp with the growth rate of patenting I'm replacing an industry with a patent class or a CPC code and I'm replacing the input output network with a patent citation Network so instead of being a supplier you're being an idea supplier and uh and so the suppliers are going to be to you in terms of the idea space are going to be those patent classes that you cite in your patents so on the left we have the plot that shows the relationship with the average and on the right the one with the variance each of them kind of residualizing out each other so what we see on the left is that there's a strong relationship on average so if the patent classes that you cite are growing a lot you have a large patent growth as well however on the right we see that conditional on that average if there's a greater dispersion of patent and growth among the CPC classes that you cite that's going to be a negative predictor of your patenting growth as well again zooming in on some robustness I'm going to focus on on the coefficient of Interest which is on the right hand side there here uh the top one is the Baseline that we were just looking at in that bin scatter and these are kind of what it looks like in an array of alternate specifications I want to highlight make two things here the first is the one that looks a little less robust that's the one where we drop computers so unlike in the case of tfp computers seem to be playing a particularly important role here and then lastly I want secondly I want to highlight the specification at the bottom which is a specification where we've instrumented the Upstream the kind of idea supplier average and variance in the US with similar moments um using patenting in different countries and we find that while the standard errors are a bit larger than the coefficient remains relatively similar now with the patent data we can also disaggregate further to the level of the firm and so these are again our now familiar bin Scatter Plots but instead of the dependent variable being the patent level patent class level uh growth in patenting this is the firm level growth in patenting so the left panel is telling you that firms that uh when the CPC codes that the firm cites in their patents are growing a lot that predicts more patenting at the firm level and the right panel saying conditional on that though when there's a greater dispersion in the patent and growth among the CPC classes that the firm cites that's going to be kind of a negative predictor of the firm's patenting growth again we can zoom in and kind of probe the robustness of those results we see that they're largely robust to different specifications and I want to just highlight the second one here which is the one where we add CPC by year fixed effects and thus what we're isolating the bottleneck patterns from are two firms within that kind of tend to patent within the same CPC class but have a different distribution of patent citations and we see that uh the the patterns are remarkably similar all right in the last minute then I want to zoom out and show some International patterns that suggest uh that these bottlenecks can also uh have contributed to the international uh slow down in productivity so to do that we'll start with tfp we're going to use the world input output table as well as tfp measures from Clems across nine European countries and 30 Industries and we're going to be looking calculating the average and variance now across not just Industries but Industries and countries that Supply to a given sector within a country and we find here patterns that look remarkably similar so when the industries and countries that Supply to you have a faster tfp growth that predicts fire higher tfp growth for you but conditional on that average the variance a kind of wider dispersion uh it exerts a negative influence this is true in panel one when we're looking across all Industries and countries and it's also true in column two where we add a set of year by industry fixed effects and we're just isolating the variation that comes across countries we can also do an analogous specification here where we use patents here we're going to use patenting growth across 633 CPC codes as before and here we're going to be using the 20 countries that have the most patenting in the uh Google and uh Global patenting database and we see patterns that are also broadly consistent uh with the bottleneck hypothesis here both in column three when looking across all cpcs and countries and when looking kind of just within a CPC across countries as well so I think I'm almost out of time so I'll leave it there these are kind of new and striking who think striking facts about the dispersion of productivity and Innovation among a sector is kind of as suppliers either input suppliers or idea suppliers and that own uh Industries uh growth in productivity our interpretation is that these represent potentially causal relationships that are reflective of the cost of an imbalance of innovation across sectors it leads to the Natural question of kind of why this happened was this inevitable is this sort of the way the Innovation possibility Frontier shifted out or does it reflect um potentially a Divergence between kind of the social value of innovation and the private costs of innovation and if it's the latter then it could suggest that the productivity slowdown could be the result of of some sort of market failure so I'll leave it there and we're really looking forward to the discussions
