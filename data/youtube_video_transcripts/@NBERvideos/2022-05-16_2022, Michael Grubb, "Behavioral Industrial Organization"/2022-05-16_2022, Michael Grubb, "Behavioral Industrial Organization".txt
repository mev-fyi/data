all right thank you um and thanks to the organizers for inviting me to participate it's been a great event so far um so in uh industrial organization uh the standard approach typically assumes firms are maximizing profits consumers are expecting utility maximizers with direct beliefs um often this is a great simplification that it works well but not always uh behavioral i o uh the approach is to enrich sort of standard i o models with more realistic participants um and we can think of at least two broad categories models where we make we add more realistic consumers to the models and models where we think about more realistic firm behavior i'm not going to have time to talk about behavioral terms today i'm going to focus on models of behavioral consumers and i like to divide the literature up into sort of three broad categories the first work that considers consumers with non-standard preferences and then uh two other buckets that both relate to consumers making mistakes in some kind but i'm going to separate it into two i'll turn at the end to to mistakes where consumers are overconfident or biased in some way that leads to systematic miss waiting when some consumers all tend to make a mistake in the same direction and systematically misweight uh product attributes or dimensions of price um before that i'll talk about what i call failing to choose the best price where consumers are seem to be searching too little having trouble identifying the lower two prices when they're comparing them and then maybe uh seem to be stuck on their existing options too much uh and the difference here is these mistakes tend to lead to noisy noisy decisions um rather than uh so systematic errors all in the same direction um so let me start uh with the the first category so consumers with non-standard preferences so you know there's a lot of uh some applied theory models in this area and the typical exercises to think through how should firms set prices when they face consumers who are philosophers or sophisticated um present focused consumers or they have a desire for conspicuous consumption or some other non-standard aspect of taste and you know fines are that market responses of firms can sometimes be beneficial to consumers so there's a classic example as a firm offering a commitment device to a sophisticated present biased consumer um but not always sometimes it could be exploiting and i thought the the branch of the literature i talked through a few papers on just as an example of this type of work is uh looking at cases where firms are selling to lost diverse consumers and that particular model that's been picked up most in the i o literature is the cassagay raven 2006 or 2007 uh models where reference points are based on rational expectations of future outcomes and are often not reference points but reference uh distributions um there's a couple of implications of loss aversion so one is first order risk aversion so natural response of firms if consumers are first-order risk-averse is to provide insurance against small risks so that's particularly one potential explanation for why we might see extended warranties being sold with regulates for all these things there's alternative explanations for this type of pricing patterns that these models might explain um another one herrick and mirin north uh predict that if a fur might otherwise be offering a two-part tariff or some service say charging uh 15 a month and 11 cents a minute if consumers are loss overs there's a motive to depress that marginal price which is offering an unlimited tariff essentially to provide insurance to consumers against fluctuation bills um those are some things we can see as being beneficial to consumers really catering to their tastes um another implication of loss of version is the comparison effect um some of the detail you know the detailed results that come out of these models depend a lot on uh us you know assumptions about timing and so on uh high using cassini and spiegler they have uh papers where the models there's a fixed reference point think of the the the price that all the firms are going to end up charging equilibrium that's the reference price that consumers have in their mind well think about a firm uh considering a deviation and charging a bit higher price that's going to be coded by consumers as a loss and they're spending more money in the money to mention that that loss is going to large we're going to see a big curtailment in demand whereas suppose a consumer a firm considers deviating and giving a discount that's going to be coded as a gain uh by consumers the gains don't move as large that's going to lead us to get an outward kink and a demand curve and so one of the predictions there is that if you've got asymmetric firms with slightly different costs from each other um they can still all coordinate uh finding it you know individually optimal they'll charge the same focal price because of that kink and demand curve and similarly you might have sluggish you know pass through with cost shocks uh you know a small change in topsoil we have to to shift the optimal price away from that kingpin um but you know this model by jew uh sort of flips things around because he assumes that a prominent firm in the market that the price that they set forms the reference point um and so now when the firm thinks about deviating and choosing a different price they're actually changing the reference point for consumers um and so the comparison effect now leads to an inward kink in the prominent firm's residual demand curve and that can leave the firm rather than being sticky in a a focal point on a randomness between higher levels yeah michael so my understanding of the spiritual literature expectations reference defense is that the most generous description of that literature is for expectations as reference points um so um how do we think about kind of the successive explanations of market phenomena using that model in light of the direct evidence that's the best mix um do you think are expectations actually crucial for explaining like this way of closing the model is like crucial for explaining one and two you know the zoo paper of course doesn't use as he just described doesn't use expectations as reference points that seems you know there's a different sort of assumption um so this is an excellent question um and i yes why did you say this inward kink paper is not using the um the expectation-based reference point um you know this this one is but i don't think it's crucial in this case um so if i could just jump in yeah certainly for number one it's crucial if you want the result to be robust with respect to background because if there's any background in this then you're thinking of dates and losses as [Music] to do something like this okay um and [Music] i'm going to let's see on this so this one that i forgot to get this one it's gonna matter um [Music] i think so both of the you know both of the points on this side it's gonna be crucial um so yeah so i think so maybe you want to tune out for 30 seconds on this live i i mean no no i was actually just raising the question how do we like when we see results like this it is almost like evidence for expectation space reference events because of its successes i i would definitely wouldn't i mean yes so let me go ahead let's go through this one um these these take the high views of the um their paper regular prices and sales here the idea is that the timing is the firm commits to a price distribution x andy and that influences consumers reference point and the idea is if they you know just charged a constant price you know maybe even maybe even they just charged marginal cost as the constant price perhaps people wouldn't be willing to pay at that price but if instead they randomize between a a low price and a higher price that low price can be so tempting consumers realize that if they ever if that if that discounts realize that there were a lucky one to get the cheap tv and the black friday sale they won't be able to resist buying it and that because of the because the reference point is expectation based they are going to start to feel attachment to the product and now if they can now if they meet the high price they're going to say uh they're going to be they're going to be in the reference point if they think about not buying the product they're going to be feeling that as a little bit of a loss in the product dimension because they've already started to imagine taking that nice tv home with them and so it's going to lower the utility of not buying um and they raise their willingness to pay when they confront the high price and so the firm can actually end up selling the product at a higher price average um and so they say that this can explain why you see things like this orange juice pricing pattern where there's high regular prices with stochastic discounts um so it does do a great job of you know fitting that observation of the data but we have other explanations so there's lots of price discrimination explanations and discriminating between different groups of consideration people who wait for the same people so there's we have other explanations for those patterns i wouldn't say it's strong evidence and support uh it's been evidence and supportive of those expectations-based thoughts emotionally how strong let's see you know if you do believe in his expectations matter it also suggests managing the expectations matters so it suggests that you know a public policy you know if you think people are being exploited into you know overpaying for tvs on black friday because of that thought of getting them at a great discount just attached the product you know sort of eliminating that uncertainty and having people find out far in advance whether they're the one who's going to get the discount or not could eliminate that attachment so not just finding out whether or not you get the discount before you buy but finding out early enough to affect reference could lead to different all right so that was my few minutes on consumers with non-standard preferences i wanted to turn now to um consumers what i call failing to choose the best price yes if we think that the magnitude of the non-standard preferences would shrink with states do you see less of the um anomalous pricing in response to them at higher stakes more expensive products um that's a good um i mean that's a good question i mean my i mean my impression is that these black friday sales include some of the big ticket items like the the large screen tv uh that best buy on black friday so within the price range of stuff that best buy charges um [Music] i think we would see this kind of uh pricing more maybe in part a question for roberto rigaban and his billiard crisis project yes that's a good question so choosing the best prices there's a focus of a behavioral i o if you're looking for a consumer mistake to look at settings with arguably homogeneous products because then if somebody picks the high priced option uh you can argue it's a mistake rather than uh just a preference for the the particular characteristics of that product um in settings with arguably homogeneous products uh what has somebody got to do to find the lowest price item well they've got a search to find out what the prices are and then when they see the prices they've got to compare them and be able to identify the lowest price and then potentially if they've already got a component provider they've got to make the effort to switch and industrial you know standard io without anything behavioral already has successful you know models of rational search and rational switching with search cost frictions and switching cost frictions that can explain um you know why we're not always in the for trans equilibrium or marginal cost pricing um but empirically there's a lot of examples where people you know try to estimate what's the search cost or the switching costs that could rationalize behavior and they seem implausibly hungry so it looks like in some cases that people are searching too little and switching to little so for example woodward and hall look at the u.s mortgage market the assignments are by brokers and they estimate that the financial returns are just doing one more price for visiting one more broker would be on average a thousand dollars so for somebody searching for a hundred thousand dollar mortgage um and their conclusion is that that's implausibly high and so they reject them off of rational search it's just something else must be going on that's causing people not to search that much um you know ben handles paper on choosing employer based uh health insurance plan uh find something similar he estimates that he needs a switching cost of an average of about two thousand dollars to explain why households aren't switching uh to a better health insurance plan with their employer and again the conclusion is you know that's you know two impulse will actually reflect the opportunity cost of time and forms there must be something else explained in this inertia you know possible ideas or inattention so yes in 2014 gives us evidence that inattention is an important factor in inertia in a car insurance choice it could be just you know forgetting to to do the task during the open enrollment period it could be procrastinating madeira has a paper suggesting that procrastination is a source of inertia medicare part d plan choice and then you know in traditional i o apart from the search and switching frictions once consumers are actually comparing objects in their consideration that we typically assume that they can identify the one that's best for them um you know it can be challenging to find convincing evidence that people aren't doing that and it's at some choice that looks wrong isn't just due to lack of search or switching costs but for example in the uk electricity tariff choice context wilson wilson and bottoms price 2010 they look at consumers who in a survey responses claim that the reason they just switched electricity providers is because they wanted to find the cheaper rate and six to 12 percent of those when you look at the change they've made they've moved to a tariff that's dominated by their original option so it really looks like they've been confused uh so you know whatever their beliefs are about how much electricity they're going to use they're now going to pay more or they say that okay since this is um do you think that at least in theory these are the kinds of consumer mistakes that the market should actually be solving you know like using point from the broker like why aren't real estate agents um solving this problem by basically directing consumers towards the better brokers that can offer them better um um deals or like with the inertia i mean at least like council suffrage they have been working on a company that just allows people to compare health insurance plans and much more to experiment um in simpler ways you know similarly with prices like why aren't there intermediaries for just kind of like making a bunch of money um helping people make more efficient choices um yes i mean and you could have asked a different question just why does it make sense for you know um [Music] you know one electricity tariff company to say we're going to be the transparent one that has really simple pricing come to us because you can understand it why isn't there a mortgage broker that says you know we're going to develop a reputation for an oil price 18 years um so that which is another second question you know regarding this um third-party advice right so uh sunstein and thaler right they have this recap proposal and the ideas a lot of times to get the advice on what you know if i want to solve the electricity choice problem with a third party the expert advice and which one to pick that's very personalized because these tariffs depend on usage and usage varies across households so how can you give advice without data um and i might not just want last month's bill but i wanted my whole history of bills and so their proposal is public the role of public policy should be to require that utility companies make it as easy as clicking a button on the website that lets you send all your historical data uh to the third-party advisor that we can have a whole wealth of um you know apps on the app store where you download connect your data and they tell you what what plan to pick um and uh you know i think one potential concern for that going wrong is we we already have some sense that this maybe doesn't work well as a model for helping people pick financial investments that financial advisors when there's not uh a fiduciary responsibility uh will often you know what wins in the market is not necessarily one giving good advice but one who's giving advice that gets good commissions so i mean i i think there's uh i mean i think this is an exciting you know possible way for public possibly to have choices but i'm not sort of convinced it would work yeah actually there is a third party but there's advice they've just arisen when i moved they called me and said like here are the different electricity providers and the different possibilities you have and i actually didn't really trust them neither with my data or this more importantly like are they getting commission from when they're gonna advise these students so i think that's exactly the kind of real problems that arise when you have you know entry level by terms that are kind of and um let's see i think so but going back to the the question you didn't the one that you didn't ask my rates what you know why aren't firms solving this themselves by just advertising themselves as a simple low-cost place i mean sometimes we do see strategies like that if amazon's whole thing is there in one free shipping you have to worry about shipping charge so sometimes we see the strategy but oftentimes we see the opposite um and you know so what's you know lack of search and you know confusion and comparing prices these lead to noisy decisions right that people who's going to lead consumers to apparently choose random if they just stop at the first shot they find instead of searching for a second or third quote then whatever they walk into first is what they're going to choose with these sort of decision errors that you know vary across consumers from the firm's perspective this is going to look like a serious form of product differentiation all right this is something that gives market power and it's going to lead to higher prices of equilibrium and so this is good this is good for farmers and um you know there's another issue that relates to what dimitri was talking about on thursday is that if there's different differentiation between um products you know this is also feedback it's going to look at allocative uh inefficiencies you know in the retail sector in the uk doesn't really matter from an efficiency standpoint which provider to sign up with you get the same electrons either way um so i think that the main impact is on uh on distributional issues markups um but you know potentially it's it's created inefficiencies as well um and you know it sort of makes sense that that firms should appreciate these mistakes uh if they're leading to market power and high markups um let's see how am i doing on time a little bit behind so um with for instance uh discouraging search you might think that what i want to do is uh make it really costly for consumers to check prices at my competitors that make it quite easy for them to come to me um what uh ellison and lility show and also wilson with a slightly different mechanism is it can be optimal for a firm who can only you know change the cost of a consumer coming to them to get a price quote it can be optimal for them to raise the search cost um one of the reasons could be if search costs are convex you know for instance i've only got a certain you know time budget for searching and then i've got to go make dinner if the first firm uses it all out i'm stuck i have to buy something um and so drip pricing is you know you know hiding some of the charges until late in the purchase process like you know not revealing shipping and handling to get the card has been shown in the lab in the field to be something used by firms to raise search costs and raise markups um maybe i will skip over that one so here's a quiz for you guys imagine you've got a new nice high definition ipad you're going to want to watch do a bunch of streaming of netflix videos on high def maybe use a lot of bandwidth and you want to do it on cellular you're going to be away from your wi-fi hotspot back when i did this screen grab a few years ago att was offering medium i mean small medium and large data plans for 15 30 and dollars a month and if you go over your data allowance uh you're gonna have to pay overage charges so uh what plan would you guys pick small plant medium plant high plant all right there's a pretty sharp group in the room so it's i don't know i've given you all the data you need but it's a math problem i have taken away the math it's the same information this is the total price you pay as a function of the gigabytes right and now uh what you can see more easily now is that the the big plan the five gigabyte plane is weakly dominated um if you use more than four gigabytes it's the same price as a three gigabyte plan but if you use less it's more expensive so nobody should ever pick the five gigabyte plans for some chance they use less than four gigabytes um i don't have any data showing whether anybody actually picked that from them although my guess is that some people did right then uh at least for us with people who are like us are used to working with brass it's a much easier way to present that information um this isn't even then handles paper but i learned this from him on email correspondence that some of the consumer and some of the new employees who have to make an active choice between two plans these are the two plans that some of them are presented with um and there's this low deductible plan in the high deductible plan but if you notice this is total expenditure as a function of your medical expenses the low deductible plan is more expensive for any medical expenditure by at least a thousand dollars and yet he finds that seven percent of employees pick the dominated option and when he asked hr why are you offering a dominated option they said what we didn't realize it was dominated don't tell anybody nobody annoyed that right so it's not necessary it's easy to tell that 699 is more than 249 but as soon as prices get multi-dimensional um it can be know it's a math problem it's hard for people to identify those treatments how should you think about the magnitudes of like seven percent like that actually seems small to me if people you know if you're writing experiments and you've found that people chose to dominate seven percent of the time people would be um yeah um i well i think uh i think i'll take that offline while with people's priors so much i mean um the all right i mean i i think um yeah i guess i guess a more interesting question is um what i'm sure yeah so what i'm showing you here is that yes so sometimes people screw up and are doing doing something that looks random um for the um you know papers i want to talk about here the idea is that these the the level of errors is not that this is something that firms can influence by the way they present prices and so that i guess it's not something i'm showing itself so i guess that you know that would be the more interesting thing uh is is it always just seven percent for choosing randomly uh or is it um is this something that firms and certainly the you know like the feeling of the applied theorists writing these models about uh obfuscation is that this is something in firm's control so for example a firm can choose to present the price as a simple 9.99 or they partition it into a 199 and an eight dollar shipping and handling and uh what these authors is you know they these authors call this you know these diff these different programming choices and in their model of price competition in terms of not just simultaneous issues and prices but also price frames and a primitive of the model is this comparability function pi which says for if if a price appears at two prices which here is a transaction y pi gives a probability that consumers can compare them and they're going to assume that with you know probably one minus five consumers who can't compare prices just pick a product and yeah so i guess the key the key thing is um [Music] yeah so the key thing i'm not showing you evidence for is what evidence do we have with the terms when we influence this uh like this um that's what you know this is trying to give you some intuition of why i think you know presenting things more simply can lower those mistakes um and insights from these models are that uh in equilibrium firms will choose frames with an eye to confusing people and adding to the noise um they'll choose different frames to make it you know all it's all going to depend on exactly what's assumed about this this primitive pie but you know for cases the authors look at um firms are going to pick uh more complex frames uh and so different frames from their competitors to make comparisons hard and lead to some more of this uh noisy choice that lead to higher markups and then you know if there's changes in the environment like if more competitors enter um or say there's an intervention to try to make prices more comparable that that raises pi um firms are going to try to offset those things that are lowering their profits by by uh increasing the complexity with which they increase their profits that would present their prices do you think that firms will also be attracted to like not that complex options just as a premium device to like people like a dominated planner a community product then that makes much more attractive than combination one with consumers uh yeah there's a paper i haven't cited uh i mean so um i think a lot of this work is applied theory um and depending on you know there's a lot so a lot of this is driven by assumptions so there's uh um [Music] there's a there's another paper i'm forgetting the author off the top of my head that assumes that you know consumers almost act like a lexicographic preference that what they do is they first identify the simplest looking price offers and then only choose with that set so if there's a price offer that's more complicated than the others they just ignore it right and if that's the decision rule you assume in your model for consumer behavior um then in equilibrium it's not surprising that we're gonna you know the predictions are gonna point towards firms doing well by offering simpler options and we're going to get more optimistic predictions about market outcomes um and i think uh the state of the literature is a lot more you know theory where this is based on assumptions rather than empirical evidence about how this works and but when you and when you look you know just anecdotally what firms are doing you see firms following both strategies um you know walmart's saying we're everyday low instead of simple and other places like stop and shop you know having just sales other prices are going up and down it's just a bit more confusing um so i don't i don't have a great answer for you know why we should you know see this sort of transparency approach like firms being more more or less prevalent from different markets realizing that there is a dominated option make the other options much more attractive to it um so there is um there is this so ronnie spiegler has uh has a paper where he assumes that he sort of categorizes price comparison he looks at price comparisons at a binary level to prices at a time and he assumes that and these are multi-dimensional prices and if one price is better than another on all the dimensions he assumes that's an easy choice if people get it right but when prices are are better on one dimension and worse than the other he categorizes that as a hard choice and then says well there's a you know that's where we get this in the noise but again that's um uh yeah these are all the sort of ideas that the people working in this area are thinking about and making different assumptions on um i don't know that we have you know empirical guides to what the right assumptions i'm not sure well just just for now so i want to turn now um to thinking about cases where uh we're not just adding noise to consumers decisions but we're adding systematic bias um the one i focus a lot of my work is over confidence but um really you know any just any any bias that leads to a systematic weighting of different product attributes price dimensions so fit under this umbrella so an example right this friends have not typically linked over confidence it's just hidden fees particularly think that consumers may underweight hidden fees when they're comparing two options either because they're hidden and they don't know what they are or they're unaware of them or they're not safe they're not a salient transparent upcoming component of the price um there's some themes in this literature right now the theme from the last one was noisy decisions light product differentiation uh high markups and market power here you know themes include so what was maybe called the behavioral first welfare theorem that competition in the marketplace doesn't end up maximizing uh joint surplus it ends up maximizing maximizing joint perceived surplus and firms are going to tend to exploit biases with complicated pricing features and we're going to see distortions on both intensive and extensive margins and when there's heterogeneity and sophisticated denials consider essentially cross subsidies between consumers where it doesn't look like this maybe firms aren't making any money in the market but they're facilitating sophisticated consumers exploding um yes firms complicat contracts to split buy some dog work work this out a long time ago did you if you include a charger you know no don't charge twenty nine dollars charge one million and twenty nine dollars and offer a million dollar rebate uh yeah what we need is just one person's forget the mail um so we maybe don't see examples quite this extreme um but you know to the extent that consumers underrate hidden fees it's going to be optimal for firms to hide the cost of their product in the hidden fees if people are over optimistic about taking some action like mailing a rebate they're going to overvalue the deal uh if you include a rebate with the deal so you should do that it's a firm um similar if you're just over optimistic about making sure you don't procrastinate sending it in um so lots of terms like free trials and teaser rates and you have to remember to cancel you might be over optimistic about your remembering to cancel uh you know these can be built in to uh have people overestimate the value of the deal similarly things like overdraft fees where you know your transaction fee on your debit card is typically zero but when you cross that threshold into negative balance suddenly it's 36 dollars per transaction um that's something that to to sort of avoid that fee you have to be paying attention to your bank balance if you're over optimistic about your level of attention you're going to underestimate how many units fees you pay uh it's going to make sense to the bank to charge the fees because you'll underestimate the total price of the account over estimate the value of the deal um similarly if if a consumer's biases needs them to misforecast their usage the optimal response for firms should be distort the other price of usage so that the marginal price is on an intensive margin if people are overestimating their usage they'll overvalue a decrease in the marginal price so you should lower the marginal price they'll overvalue the quality because if they think they're going to go to the gym all the time they're going to over value the how nice the treadmills are so you should put it on that's treadmills um reverse if people underestimate you do you want if you underestimate usage they're gonna not care that much when you raise the marginal price uh and so you should just sort it upwards um you know so sometimes this is really obvious like it's things like the dot work add in a mailing rebate other than times you get things um that are less obvious so from uh my work in 2009 i looked at what happens when people are over precise so if they're making a forecast about their uh future usage of data on their cell phone plan over precise means underestimating the uncertainty uh the noise around that forecast so if the true variation in usage so this is our median forecast to star the true variation is here somebody who's over precise might make a narrower estimated distribution that means any you know any megabyte of data usage below the median amount people are going to be overestimating the chance of using because this left tail is from you know compressed towards the middle um they overestimate the chance of using these units well you should lower the marginal price they're going to over value that discount they think they're gonna realize that discount more than they really do on the other hand all these units up here uh you know it's the firm you might know that there's a good chance they're gonna be out in this right scale using these units consumers don't under appreciate that they underestimate the chance of using those units uh you should distort the marginal device updates but since you can't charge for those units in advance people don't think they're going to use them you've got to wait until they're surprised by high demand utilizations and and charged from that what i show in my paper is that the optimal tariff could be closely approximated with a three-part tariff it's a fixed fee an included allowance of minutes and then a steam marginal price for going over the limit right early minutes we distort the marginal price downwards uh some late late uh high quantities with distorted margin pass upwards um dalvinia and malmo here is like one numerical example where this is the actual optimal one and you can see yes this is non-linear curve in the paper um basically i give sort of uh i characterize what what preferences would look like um for um do you think i could easily say all right nobody's going to do the fully nominated tariff um they're going to do some simplification fine but why is the simplification three parts why isn't it two parts why isn't it five parts what's special about three and what i show in the paper is if if the main uncertainty is how many phone calls you're going to want to make you sort of know how much you value a phone call i value phone calls at 15 cents a minute but i just don't know how many times the phone is going to ring if that's the uncertainty that's in demand that i'm over precise about i'm underestimating that variation of number of calls to come in then you know three parts gets you know two parts that's terrible three parts get you almost kind of but you know other types of preferences for you know if if you know i'm always going to make five phone calls i just don't know what the value is going to be you know the approximations all right um if you're naive about a self-control problem then you underestimate the chance of going to the gym uh i'm sorry you overestimate the chance of being good and going to the gym uh then we should charge time membership fees for inclusive memberships and that's you know shown in theory and in practice and see how things are are working out um another theme in this literature is that you know competition is definitely good for consumers but it doesn't make all this complicated pricing structures go away so it doesn't make the rebates go away it doesn't make the three-part tears go away competition is going to act as in this this three-part character it's just by lowering the first part lowering the 60 it's not going to change the shape of the turn um but so far in this this little bit on over confidence and systematic dissuading i said i've just been sort of telling you descriptively about how how contracts are going to look different you know what we care about is how uh welfare is going to change um so one um [Music] um one way things can change is if we have a mix of naive and sophisticated consumers we can get cross sensitives so an example here a bank has marginal cost c of providing an account they're going to charge an account fee p plus some hidden fee a that's you know limited by some cap a bar and there's two types so one minus alpha are making ninjas you know all about the fees if you throw an overdraft be it then they duck right they never pay um and then there's the naive uh folks and they don't think they pay the hidden fees maybe they just don't know about them or maybe they think they're really good at ninja banking skills um but in fact they end up paying the energy um bank profits are going to be if there's measure you know one consumers are going to get p from everybody a from the fractional of naive types and then they have to pay the cost c for providing all the accounts um you know nobody's going to be paying attention to the hidden fee when they pick which bank to go to so it's going to make sense for banks to max it out at the top level bar if competition puts profits to zero the base price is going to end up being marginal cost less the average hidden fee revenue they get and that means that the banking ninjas they get a great deal because they just pay this base fee so they're getting the banking services below the marginal cost you know how's that possible well they're being subsidized by the names we're going to pay more than more than a marginal cost so there's this distributional concern across consumers um going back to the you know putting the heterogeneity and sophistication aside and sticking with the case where everybody's biased and said everybody's overconfident um what are other impacts of welfare where there's distortions on the intensive margin so if i have this three-part tariff to exploit over precision that means some months i'm going to hit up 45 cents a minute overage rate that's going to distort my calling efficiently downwards and lead to deadweight losses um it's also potentially going to have participation distortions where maybe i just don't get a valentine at all um or i do get one when i shouldn't have and there's going to be distributional impacts i think these are easiest to see graphically and i'm going to do the same thing that speakers were doing on thursday which is draw two demand curves i want to label one rational expectation so this is the one i'm going to interpret as reflecting true underlying preferences and this is one that's inflated upwards you know overconfidence by the amount that somebody overvalues a contract for instance because um they don't realize that they're going to pay the 25 um airline check bag fees and thought about it so they're over valuing the contract by 25. um all right and i'm going to skip this for time what i'm going to do that you know is layer on top of this for the perfect competition case um supply curves i'm going to start here um with supply of the rational expectations and it's going to turn us it makes sense to actually have the supply curve shift up when people become overconfident um and that's because the products are changing right because when somebody if we go to move from a world where everybody has rational expectations i'm thinking about what's the equilibrium in that world well that's a world where we don't offer complicated mail and rebates and people tear us we offer sort of um like a simple two-part tariff fixed fee upfront and marginal cost pricing afterwards um when we go to a world with overconfidence all these bells and whistles get added to the contract so the product that i'm talking about demand for has changed and in particular it's going to introduce all these these deadweight losses on the intensive margin and what the normalization i make when i'm drawing this graph is i'm thinking of trying to make the two products comparable in terms of the expected utility they deliver in the true preferences and if there's a deadweight loss on the intensive margin in the in the world with overconfident consumers it's going to be more expensive to deliver the same level of utility because because some you know potential surplus is burned as a deadly loss and so that increase in cost you know shifts my supply curve up it's more expensive for firms to deliver the same level of true utility so under rational expectations we have price and quantity here both shift up under overconfidence so the true price uh the true price goes up but because people are over valuing the contract essentially the perceived price comes down and so quantity goes out you know consumers who are going to buy anyway end up paying more and then there's this participation distortion or extra consumers whose value for the product is actually below the cost of production uh end up buying inefficiently so creating a deadly loss and then there's going to be an area between these two supply curves which captures the deadly loss on the intensive margin what i like about putting it into this picture and uh showing the shifts in the curves is we know how to work out how much prices change when demand and supply curves change the pass-through rate tells us that so if if the demand curve shifts um the price shifts by one minus the path to weight times that to conversion if a supply curve shifts the price changes by the pass-through exception so this uh formula here tells us how much true prices are going to change um the perceived change in prices um is different that's the negative of the pass-through rate times this uh the difference in the shifts and demands supply curves and while the pictures are drawn when we work for a perfect competition these formulas about how prices and perceived prices change are general to cases where firms have market power and we can then think through um well when would over confidence lead to higher prices well so let's ignore the daily loss bit for a moment you know if people really if demand curves are inflated they overvalue the contract well if the pass-through rate is zero that's when we actually have higher prices when the pass-through rate is one you know that means any hidden fees get offset you know a hidden airline backseat gets offset with a lower uh ticket price so prices don't change uh sometimes people think oh their prices didn't change that's fine there's no welfare problem um but that's not true because precisely when the true price isn't changing is when the perceived price is changing a lot and when the perceived price is changing a lot and demand is elastic that's when we get big participation distortions so we can think through a lot of what the welfare consequences are um with thinking about both the elasticity of domain in the market and the market passed all right so um i've been racing to try to give you this broad overview of these three main areas of behavioral io i'd like to shift gears now and give you just a little bit of depth before i wrap up and tell you about an application that matt osborne and i uh did we looked at trying to evaluate uh the welfare of bill shock regulation which since 2013 has meant in the u.s cell phone companies have to send you a text message as you approach or exceed your allowance of text voice or data allowances i mean since that regulation went into effect firms partially responded by just making voice and text unlimited on those plans but many of you may get these text messages occasionally if you come up against your data or balance and sort of the night the night first thought is um uh i impressions this is great you give consumers more information they'll be able to make better choices avoid some high overdraft fees will be great for them but the pause as well firms are going to respond if you take away their overage fee revenue they're going to adjust prices in some way and it's less obvious uh whether this will help consumers or not and our approach was um you know taking approach that you could do is you know before the regulation went into effect the lowest this length of publication the paper didn't come out until after the regulation was in effect um so we can estimate a structural model of demand and simulate uh what happens uh when when consumers get their limits and i want to thank hunt for these slides i'm presenting for the first time i have a paper with um with hunt's slides thank you [Music] um so we've got data on about 1200 students from a major university a two-year panel on their cell phone bills um we see uh the choice that plans they choose from this includes three of these three partiers ones two and three that have increasing fixed fees for increasing allowances minutes by uh yeah so just on the uh motivation is it possible that utilitarian welfare could decrease or is it just a point that there may no longer be cross-oxidization like is it possible the firm price response should only uh is there any like sense in which it could be if they could oversteer or decrease welfare or would it just be that it would eliminate the cross subsidy um well the prediction i'll get to on the last slide is that actually welfare goes down a little bit on average uh for consumers um which and i'll talk about why when i get there um there's also plan zero here which is a two-part tariff which is just a sort of 11 cents a minute after that 150. um if bill shocks are going to matter it must you know it has to be that people are price sensitive because otherwise you get this thing that tells you oh you're in the 45 cents a minute region you say i don't care i'm inelastic but we do find that people are lasting so when price goes from 11 cents on peak to zero cents three nights and weekends we see a big jump in usage at 9pm we don't see that jump on weekends when it's freezing all the time people are responding to price um if people are already keeping track um you know suppose people already have perfect foresight of the demands of the month but we'd expect them all to be bunching exactly at the allowance of minutes we don't see any punching so if people don't have perfect foresight they could still be keeping track of their usage over time then we'd expect somebody who's carefully waiting till 9 pm for free calls at the beginning of the month by the end of the month they might start freely talking on peak if it's one of those months where they're going to be far away from the last it's by the last week of the month if you're keeping track you should have figured this out we don't see any evidence of that so it doesn't look like they're paying attention and realizing that they're not here when usage is free any time of day um and people seem to be making systematic plan choice mistakes they're picking plans that are overly convex so are expensive if you have high variance in your usage or overly small so again if you have a high right tail expense so we're going to explain this uh with with bias and beliefs about usage um how do we model uh consumers we can assume they get some initial information that gives them expectations about theta which is the calling opportunities in the rise in a month in a standard plan they then uh you choose a plan based on that then you realize your demand shot theta and based on that you think right that's like saying oh it's may i'm going to get 392 calls this month i'll make 314 of them in reality you make decisions one at a time every time the phone rings and the way that we're going to capture that is we assume you choose a calling threshold z star and just make all calls that are worth more than b start and then at the end of the month you'll find out how many calls that added up to so this is like instead of picking i'm going to use so many hundred kilowatts in my home this month i just set the thermostat and i'll find out on my bill and how many kilowatts that was later so this is the optimal approach for somebody who's uh inattentive we allow for overcoming so when people are making a forecast of what their theta realization is going to be this month they underestimate the variance of this distribution by a factor so that's the over confidence over precision how do we identify this model well we're going to get price sensitivity from those jumps in consumption at 9 00 pm and we're going to get the you know distribution of the underlying demand for calls the true distribution from actual usage patterns and then the beliefs i'm going to infer from initial plan choices now i can't separate beliefs about usage from risk aversion so i'm just going to assume people are risk neutral and i'll use what people in the insurance industry that plan they'd use plan choices they'd assume rational expectations maybe and uh assume and for something at risk um and i find that people choose risky plans uh suggesting over precision they're underestimating variance by about 60 and they're also underestimating averages now in our counter factual simulations um can anybody read this font size something will stand okay we're great um well the first column here we just simulate prices under our estimated model the status quo um and we do pretty well except for our model predicts unreasonably high overage rates um this is so we're missing something in the model that says why you don't sharpen why you aren't like don burton charge a million dollar uh average um so we cap it at 50 cents and that's binding uh for all three of our uh sort of predicted free purchase so that's a weakness um otherwise it's pretty good we're getting increasing fixed fees for increasing quantities of included minutes on the plan i should say why am i talking about minutes because this data is from 2002 that's all you've been doing back then right so it made our life simple maybe not applicable today but it's simple then you know column two we hold prices fixed but give consumers these bill shock alerts and there it's showing their overage revenue it's going from 223 in average overages per year per consumer down to two dollars so i'm saying that 50 cent overage rate nobody's going to talk on the phone so they get that alert they just stop talking and that's great for consumers welfare goes up for 100 bucks a year it's inefficient because um their value for their calls is above marginal cost it's just you know below 50 cents uh so profits of firms go down more and social welfare goes down that's great for consumers what happens when we allow firms to respond and change prices um well one of the things is now overage revenue doesn't collapse it stays at 152. why because firms lower overage prices to 17 cents or 12 cents a minute low enough that people would actually still talk over and they cut included a minute overnight so now plan one actually has zero including minutes it's a two-part tariff um and they are adjusting the fixies don't look like they're going up that much but if you look at planned choice shares consumers because of these you know cut and included minutes on the base plane it's encouraging people to pick larger plans so they're moving the plans to higher fixed fees so fixed so fixed payments are going up um so overall um you know the you know change in payments is largely offset um and i'm finding a loss in welfare what that's coming from is that i haven't de-biased consumers they're still over-confident so this plan a change in prices on plan won't actually make it a better deal according to you know true beliefs this is better by about a dollar a month um but they perceive it as eleven dollars worse because the bet you know the benefits are a lower overtrade they didn't they underestimate the right tail they don't value that the costs are now the first minutes are being charged at 17 cents a minute uh they think they use those first minutes so they see that it's costly so some people are leaving the market uh in an inefficient way so this is this participation distortion or two percentage once people um lead the market and the other thing is now that people have more information about marginal price they're responding more closely to marginal price marginal price is not equal to marginal cost um and so the intensive margin distortions get worse so they're making about the same number of calls but they end up making lower value calls that said you might still think that policy is a success because it's bringing down um it's giving large benefits to a small number of people who is that the people who previously would have had a really high overage the ones who were making the news stories about why we have to tackle bell shops who got like a 300 surprise bill that's being dramatically reduced so that the distribution of of overage fee pieces is coming much becoming much smaller so in some sense it's doing what policy makers want it's it's lowering the school shots up that's not coming up in my welfare because you know consumers are risk neutral there's no there's no value in the model for those reasons and helpfully highlights all the problems in the paper [Music] but then he ends on a positive message he says the basic economics is clear um so uh i like that i'll let you read this on your own so firms respond indulgely when consumers get this informative alert and you know those those uh uh you know price changes offset a lot of what the naive expectation for consumer benefits uh would have and been these unintended consequences including the substitution to you know to the outside option uh when when although plans are objectively getting better uh consumers because of their bias i don't see that um and i think i must be over time already so thank you for keeping yourself
